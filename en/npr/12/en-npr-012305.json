        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So we see wind - and basically we're looking at a situation where today the world gets 40 percent of its electricity from coal-fired power plants - we see wind supplying 40 percent of electricity by 2020.",
        "What about solar?",
        "We're seeing huge solar farms, out in the Mojave, other places around the world with the solar thermal energy.",
        "Solar thermal energy is going to play an important role, and it's growing by leaps and bounds.",
        "The most interesting solar-thermal project, if you will, is one that has come alive in Europe just in the last few months.",
        "For, I would guess, close to 20 years now, the Club of Rome has been promoting the idea of harnessing the solar energy in North Africa to generate electricity for transmission to Europe by undersea cable.",
        "What's happened there is that Munich Re - Munich Reinsurance, which is one of the world's largest reinsurance companies and therefore very much concerned about climate change, has put together a consortium of a dozen companies including Deutsche Bank, Siemens, ABB and several other large companies to develop a strategy and a financial plan to harness the solar energy of North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean.",
        "A German research firm has pointed out that it's entirely economic to consider Europe getting half of its electricity from solar thermal power plants in North Africa.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Now, the Algerians were already building - I think they've completed the first plant, working on the second.",
        "And they have an agreement with Germany that sort of precedes this much larger project.",
        "They point out that in the desert of Algeria, which is most of the country, they have enough harnessable solar energy to power the world economy.",
        "Now, that sounds like a mistake, but it's not because that basic point appears in the energy literature when it's pointed out that the sunlight striking the Earth in an hour has enough energy to run the world economy for a year.",
        "So it's a fascinating situation where we have not so much governments focusing on this, but corporations who look at it as an investment opportunity.",
        "And from Munich Re's point of view, as an insurance policy against climate change.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, how much - and here's a question from P.R.",
        "Mathis(ph) coming from \"\"Second Life,\"\" how much of the time lag in these technologies is a factor of politics, resources, and how much is technology?",
        "And I'm thinking about our country where it seems that the politics are so polarized now that even talking about alternative energies, it's, you know, it's one side versus the other instead of saying, we're all in this together.",
        "How are you going to move anything forward like that?",
        "Well, things are moving much faster than perhaps most Americans realize.",
        "The state of Texas, for example, which for the last century has been our leading source of oil, is now our leading source of wind-generated electricity.",
        "They have 8,000 megawatts in production, another couple of thousand megawatts in construction and a whole bunch beyond that...",
        "They just flipped the switch yesterday, didn't they?",
        "In a huge..."

        "Oh, on probably the - I think, it's the largest wind farm in the world…",
        "Yeah.",
        "And it wasn't T.",
        "Boone Pickens who did it, either.",
        "That's right.",
        "It was a German firm actually, E.ON, that is the principal player on that wind farm.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But when you add these up, and this has been done by an energy research firm, it comes out to over 50,000 megawatts of wind-generating capacity in operation, under construction and in development.",
        "That is more than enough to satisfy the electricity needs of the 24 million people who live in Texas.",
        "I mean, 50,000 megawatts is like 50 coal-fired power plants.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So it's huge.",
        "And the interesting thing is that the people making the investments there are not doing it because of, you know, Copenhagen is coming or because they're trying to meet Kyoto goals or what have you in the past.",
        "They're doing it because it makes sense economically to tap the enormous wealth of wind in Texas.",
        "So we're going to see that in other places as well.",
        "One of the things that is giving solar-thermal power plants such a dramatic boost - these are power plants where mirrors concentrate sunlight on a container with water or some other liquid to produce steam and generate electricity - is that they've come up with a technology for storing heat when the sun is brightest during the middle of the day using a molten-salt technology, most commonly.",
        "And that then permits the electric generators to keep going after the sun goes down for several hours, up until midnight or so, and to carry through the peak evening load.",
        "So that makes solar-thermal power plants much more appealing because their output begins to mesh very nicely with the daily cycle of peak needs.",
        "That's what we're talking about and looking at.",
        "That's what President Obama has said we need.",
        "That's what Steven Chu says we need to be working toward.",
        "And the interesting thing, if you look at wind power, for example, if you have a national grid with hundreds of wind farms, maybe even thousands, spread across the country, you actually have a rather stable source of electricity because no two wind farms have identical wind profiles.",
        "So the more wind farms you have, the more stable and the less fluctuation there is in the electricity supply.",
        "And it also would enable us to link the rich wind resources of the Great Plains with the Midwest and other areas that need electricity and to harness the enormous solar-thermal power resources in the Southwestern states.",
        "Wouldn't we have to rebuild the grid, though, the electric grid to make this happen..."

        "Yes.",
        "...at the same time as we're building the solar and wind power farms?",
        "Yes.",
        "The answer is yes.",
        "And it's very much like the situation in the 1950s when President Eisenhower launched the construction of the Interstate Highway System which we take for granted today.",
        "But back then, there were not that many highways, you know, that were where you could drive long distances very smoothly.",
        "There were a lot of states sort of patched together, but each state was responsible for its own.",
        "And then, we didn't - we really didn't have a good system and then today we do.",
        "And so, we're in a very similar situation now with the electricity grid.",
        "We need to get beyond the local situation and integrate into a national grid.",
        "But is that the plan?",
        "Is that what the - that we have as a plan or is it just an idea?",
        "Well, it's an idea but we're seeing pieces of it begin to take shape.",
        "And who needs to lead this thing then if you want it to get it to work?",
        "It needs to be coordinated from Washington, and simply because to get an efficient national grid, you have to do it at the national level.",
        "You can't put pieces together from different states.",
        "But your contention is that we can do this a lot faster than people think we can, we have the parts, you know, all you need is - you have the wind, all you need is the will to get this done.",
        "That's right.",
        "That's a good slogan: We've got the wind, now we need the will.",
        "The - it's a little bit like the situation in this country just before we entered World War II.",

        "industrial economy, not in decades, not in years but in a matter of months.",
        "And Roosevelt set these extraordinary arms production goals, for example, in a State of the Union Address in early January 1942.",
        "And what we have not yet quite fully realized is how serious the climate threat is and what it could translate into.",
        "And that's where I think we're going to - that's where the acceleration is going to come when we begin to realize that sea level is rising and that it is threatening coastal cities and communities, for example."
