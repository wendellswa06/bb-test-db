        "In this case, Kennedy said, Congress was well within its rights to ban a procedure that has a disturbing similarity to the killing of a newborn infant.",
        "Although Kennedy conceded that Congress had been wrong in many of its findings about the procedure, he nonetheless said that Congress had legitimate moral and ethical concerns that justified the ban, namely drawing a bright line that clearly distinguishes between abortion and infanticide.",
        "Justice Ginsberg responded by saying that the so-called partial birth ban saves not a single fetus from destruction.",
        "Instead, she said, the law outlaws a procedure that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other leading medical organizations say is the safest one for some women.",
        "The court majority admits, she noted, that its opinions hinged on moral concerns.",
        "But those moral concerns are untethered to any government interest in preserving life.",
        "And to make her point, she quoted Justice Kennedy's opinion in the 2003 gay rights case: \"\"Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to enforce our all moral code.",
        "Undeterred, Justice Kennedy had this to say: Respect for human life finds an ultimate expression in the bond of love the mother has for her child.",
        "The partial birth ban recognizes this as well.",
        "And, said Kennedy, while we find no reliable data to measure the phenomenon, it seems unexceptional to conclude some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant they created.",
        "Because patients often do not want to know the details of the procedures they will undergo, he said, it is unnecessary inference that this ban will encourage some women to carry their pregnancies to full term."
