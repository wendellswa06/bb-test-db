        "We're going to make sure that basic government functions are being carried out.",
        "We're going to make sure that America pays its bills on time, like we always have, throughout our history, but I'm still going to take principled stands on a whole range of issues where I differ with the president, I think the vast majority of American people and the majority of Republicans would say that's the kind of leadership we expect.",

        "That's the pattern that we've seen over the last several years.",
        "Let me mention, Mr. President, that one reason this is such an emotional moment is that people on both sides of the debate over the Affordable Care Act seem to believe that once the individual mandate takes effect and people begin receiving subsidies, the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, stays forever.",
