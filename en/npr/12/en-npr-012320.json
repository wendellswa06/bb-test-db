        "And he's a fan because of the mayor's record in Davao and the crackdown on crime he launched there as mayor, a crackdown that human rights activists say resulted in the deaths of hundreds in extrajudicial killings.",

        "And some of them said they were voting for one of the other two candidates running 10 points behind him.",
        "All right, so there are other candidates.",
        "Why are so many people drawn to this slightly outrageous guy?",
        "Because, Renee, at a macro level, the Philippine's economy is definitely growing, about 6 percent a year.",
        "But the majority here say it's not working for them.",
        "They're not feeling it.",
        "It's not trickling down.",
        "It's sticking in the palms of the 1 percent.",
        "And the people here want a president who isn't one of the usual suspects, one not beholden to the oligarchs that hold so much power here.",
        "On a daily basis here, especially in Manila, the traffic is just horrendous.",
        "The Internet is incredibly slow.",
        "People don't have much money.",
        "And then there's the crime and the corruption we just heard about.",
        "So Duterte, he's their guy.",
        "All right, so is he going to win?",
        "Well, he's got that double-digit lead, but his opponents have very sophisticated political machines and know how to get out the vote.",
        "And there's more than 20 percent of the population that were undecided just before election day.",
        "So there could be a late surge for someone else.",
        "But with that big lead and the rest of the vote splintered among the remaining four candidates, he's got a good shot."
