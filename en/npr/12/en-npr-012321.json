        "So what are we talking about here?",

        "He's been overseeing all the health-related provisions to the omnibus bill.",
        "And I asked him how progress has been going.",
        "My staff met until 1 a.m. And they were back at eight this morning.",

        "There were like five verys in a row.",
        "And in addition to health care, there're also environmental protection regulations - those are another prickly area.",
        "And that's just the tip of the iceberg.",
        "Senator Mikulski said this week that lawmakers have requested something like more than 130 policy provisions to attach to the underlying bill.",
        "And they relate to all kinds of things: carbon emissions, restricting abortion, limiting the power of the IRS, fiddling with the Dodd-Frank financial reforms.",
        "They totally run the gamut."
