        "His commission will be presented by his mother, Petty Officer First Class Louise Jackson, U.S.",

        "Louise Jackson was an animal lab technician at Bethesda Navy Hospital when she was tapped to help translate for ill Haitian refugees who'd been brought there.",
        "She'd emigrated from Haiti about 10 years before.",
        "One of the refugees was a woman very sick with cancer, separated from her young son, Orlando, who was at the military base at Guantanamo, Cuba.",
        "Jackson helped reunite mother and son.",
        "He came over about a week before his seventh birthday.",
        "And he came in April, and the mother die in July.",
        "Jackson says Morel's mother asked her to take care of him before she died.",
        "Jackson eventually got Morel's father, who had stayed behind in Haiti, to agree to let her adopt Orlando and help him become a citizen.",
        "Morel remembers little of that trip as a youngster before his life as an American.",
        "Mostly, he remembers that it was crowded, and he was constantly hungry and thirsty.",
        "A piece of bread fell into the water, and then I just hurried up and grabbed it, because, being overcrowded, just any opportunity you get to eat, you take it.",
        "And I just remember this bread being really, really soggy and really, really salty, but I was, like, really happy that I was able to eat something.",
        "Morel says for a while in his teens, he became rambunctious and lost, as he calls it, yelling at his mom, staying out late.",
        "He credits Jackson with reeling him back in.",
        "And he says in his sophomore year of high school, she reminded him that it was the Coast Guard who had saved his life years ago, and encouraged him to check it out.",
        "He did, and he fell in love with it.",
        "Morel says it's the Coast Guard's mission that hooked him.",
        "They specialize in saving people's lives.",
        "Even if they're doing a drug interdiction, if someone falls in the water, they stop everything that they're doing, and it turns into a search-and-rescue mission, you know.",
        "And I just love that.",
        "Once Morel got to the academy, his peers, professors and military supervisors all say they noticed his charisma and ability to engage almost anyone.",
        "Still, many of them never knew his dramatic story.",
        "And they saw the Hasidim with black hats and coats, dancing away to Hasidic music, and they're all speaking Yiddish to each other.",
        "So I approached one of the rabbis there and I introduced him to this young man who was speaking fluent Yiddish.",
        "And he just couldn't understand, what's going on, it just seemed so out of place for a Japanese person to be in a Hasidic wedding, speaking to him in fluent Yiddish.",
        "It's always amazing to them.",
        "By taking on Yiddish, Professor Ueda grappled with a language that defies easy translation, because of its many culturally-specific words."

        "Oh, I don't think they had any idea.",
        "I certainly didn't and I find it highly amusing.",
        "Why amusing?",
        "Well, because, you know, you lay all these plans and you try to be as political as you can on this issue.",
        "But in the end, justice always stares you right in the eyes in one way or another, doesn't it?"

        "It's a little awkward for the White House because during the 1996 Illinois State Senate campaign, candidate Barack Obama responded to a questionnaire with a letter, saying: I favor legalizing same-sex marriages.",
        "Last week, the White House backpedaled.",
        "Here's Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer.",

        "Then yesterday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Pfeiffer was wrong.",
        "Dan was referring to another questionnaire.",
        "In other words, Barack Obama did state in 1996 that he supports gay marriage, a very progressive position for the time.",
        "But today, at least publicly, the president no longer holds that view.",
        "He's been very clear about his position on gay marriage.",
