        "I approached this review with a little bit of dread.",
        "How do you write about Thomas Pynchon?",
        "By the way, it turns out he pronounces it Pynchon, so I will too.",
        "He's iconic, but his books are weird and difficult.",
        "And he has these diehard readers who go online to talk about him.",
        "They say things like Pynchonian and Pynchonalia.",
        "And they make a pretty persuasive case.",
        "But the truth is, the most persuasive case about any writer can't be made by the fans.",
        "So I tried to ignore the reputation and just read the book.",
        "Bleeding Edge\"\" starts in New York, in the period between the collapse of the dotcom boom and September 11th.",
        "It's about a spunky Upper West Side mom named Maxine who runs a fraud-investigating agency called Tail 'Em and Nail 'Em.",
        "She has to chase down Gabriel Ice, the CEO of a tech company called hashslingrz with a Z, while the book builds up toward the destruction of the towers.",
        "And that's the organizing principle, kind of.",
        "Pynchon may be taking on 9/11 and the paranoia surrounding it - and he's very good with paranoia - but he's also taking on the giant maw of the Internet.",
        "Actually, reading the book kind of feels like spending a day roaming around the Internet.",
        "You might be wasting your time, but you're also getting a crash course in life from an original artist and consummate joker.",
        "It's full of nonstop references, some real, some not.",
        "After a while, though, I was a little exhausted by all the mentions of things I never thought I'd have to think about again or made-up things that, if they existed, I would never want to think about again.",
        "But there's greatness here too, like the descriptions of Maxine's New York.",
        "Her sons attend The Otto Kugelblitz School, where each grade level would be regarded as a different kind of mental condition and managed accordingly.",
        "And I loved Maxine.",
        "It's somehow touching that in the middle of this often unfollowable story of corruption and conspiracies, there's this mom and her kids, walking to school.",
        "So how do you talk about a book that itself doesn't stop talking?",
        "I think you have to decide if you want a book to be easy to understand and shapely and perfect or if you think it can be peculiar and high IQ-ish; the Pynchonians seem to feel that way and I wanted to join them.",
        "Too bad, for me at least, that there were more than a couple of stretches where it was easy to get lost or wander off or feel irritated.",
        "The book is alternately shticky and profound.",
        "Some of the time I wanted to live in its world, other times I found it unreadable.",
        "But much of the time I was satisfied to let the prose build and build around me.",
        "The book is \"\"Bleeding Edge\"\" by Thomas Pynchon.",
        "Our reviewer is Meg Wolitzer.",
        "Her latest book is \"\"The Interestings."

        "Yay!",

        "Yeah.",
        "I do too.",

        "In my wallet, there's no card that says good ole boys' club.",
        "I take on the opposition party, but I take on my own party as well, because I believe it is principle over party.",
        "That's what comes first.",
        "In Washington, Bachmann has a reputation as a rhetorical bomb thrower.",
        "But to conservatives like Wendy Dowdy, she's a conviction politician.",

        "Yes.",

        "Yeah, the word is they're going to keep the troops pretty much where they are this year, maybe get down to 120,000 by the end of this year, because they want to get through these crucial elections in January of next year.",
        "Then after a couple of months to see how the elections shake out, the plan now is to start bringing out about 10,000 troops a month starting in March of next year and to bring them down very quickly.",
        "That means next summer is going to be a point of maximum vulnerability, because you take the troops out in the beginning from the easy places.",
        "But the deeper you get, the more you have to take them out of the riskier places, or the places where Iraqi troops are less reliable.",
