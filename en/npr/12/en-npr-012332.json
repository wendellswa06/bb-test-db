        "One of the things that the federal government would do if it was run by, like a business, is it would advertise.",
        "It wouldnt let its brand get run down in the way that -I mean, the federal government is uniquely unpopular.",
        "Well, Mark Fitzloff, tell us about some of the ideas that you and your fellow ad men tossed around and tossed out.",
        "Well, I think our inclination was that you had to treat the government with a little bit more respect.",

        "Mark Fitzloff, you remark that being confronted with a Super Bowl ad campaign is not always the best thing that happens to you in your work as a creative director in advertising.",
        "No, it just raises the stakes and the pressure on what one is hoping to accomplish with the advertising.",
