        "And what do you see the intersection being between development aid to foreign countries and national security here at home?",
        "Well, I think it's important to recognize we do development for two reasons.",
        "We both do it because it's the right thing to do.",
        "When we are able to help everyone on this planet or as many people as we can live up to their God- given potential, that's an extension of American values and that helps improve our world.",
        "And it's important for us to do.",
        "But we also do it because it's in our self interest, that it is important to our national security and a vital aspect of our foreign policy.",
        "I can imagine though that there would be lots of times when those three pillars of national security, the 3-Ds - defense, diplomacy and development - might be in opposition to each other, not necessarily working in tandem, that a defense goal might be in direct contrast to what you might want to do for development in a country.",
        "Well, actually our development aspect of foreign policy is about creating the very conditions, the stable societies, economic growth opportunities, ensuring that women and girls have access to health and education and the ability to lead productive lives.",
        "Those are the types of conditions that should allow us to not need more foreign assistance, and hopefully not need military intervention.",
        "But let's think of an example.",
        "For instance, in Afghanistan: I mean, you and Secretary Clinton have both talked about integrating development with defense and diplomatic efforts in the field.",
        "But, if you're an Afghan farmer and you're interested in learning how to grow a new crop, turning away from opium poppies, but if you also know that USAID is working in conjunction with U.S.",
        "military, isn't that a conflict?",
        "Isn't there a tension there?",
        "I think the opposite is the case, you know.",
        "That's a great example, because there are some parts of Afghanistan where there are many Afghani farmers trying to do exactly what you describe and move away from opium to other forms of high value production.",
        "And USAID is working together with the U.S.",
        "Department of Agriculture and other civilian assistance agencies on the ground to make sure that we can create effective trade and market opportunities for those farmers.",
        "And it's in fact the security provided by our defense pillar and it's the security provided by the Afghan government themselves that allows for that development effort to be effective and successful.",
        "You don't think that it might also dissuade some farmers from cooperating if they were afraid of being seen as working in tandem with U.S.",
        "military?",
        "Well - and that's why there is something else the secretary has highlighted that becomes very important.",
        "And that is doing our work in deep partnership with the people we serve and their country government, their country leadership.",
        "No country has ever developed itself and no community has developed itself from the outside.",
        "Those are decisions that have to be made locally and pursued locally.",
        "And then we can work in partnership with those local leaders and local efforts to help them be more successful.",
        "When you think about the countries that become the focus of our development aid, I wonder how you try to sort through places that might be politically important, strategically important to the United States and focus on those, but at the same time, not neglecting countries that really may have no geopolitical importance to the United States, but are in dire need of help?",
        "Well, you may need it sometime.",
        "So good, thank you.",
        "This, you know, is the recipe that sounds terrible, but tastes terrific.",

        "And so, we're excited to be executing all of these things.",

        "They bring a lot of talent and a lot of capacity to solve problems.",
        "We are also going to do things a little bit differently: bring in outside expertise and become more of a coordinating platform so that we can work with private sector innovators, like the Gates Foundation, or work with other foreign entities that are involved in development and bring their ideas in house and partner better and coordinate better with them, all for the purpose of delivering better results for the people we serve.",
