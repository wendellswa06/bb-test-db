        "A battery to power a car right now runs about $8,000.",
        "That cost needs to get down to a several hundred dollars for it to be an affordable car.",
        "Ralph Broad is a consultant and an adviser to the new alliance.",

        "He says there's no doubt electricity-powered cars are the future, but the technology needs to make vast improvements from where it is today.",
        "There is nothing simple about the advances that everybody is looking for in battery technology, which is why the scope of the dollar amounts are so large that everybody is after.",
        "The batteries will have other uses in the military transportation and energy industries.",
        "You're literally talking about one of the most important developments of the century if this gets pulled off.",
        "Question is, which country is going to get there, and which country is going to gain this strategic advantage in the world by having that technology and leveraging it."

        "There are a lot folks who see the energy issue as a great political issue to campaign on, but I think most of the - I'd say all of the 10 people who are here today believe that this is an issue that Americans want a solution on.",
        "In essence, the group's proposal boils down to this: some offshore drilling, some alternative energy paid for by the oil companies.",
        "It lets four states - Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia - approve drilling that's more than 50 miles offshore, and it expands drilling in the Gulf of Mexico to within 50 miles of Florida.",
        "That might satisfy Republicans.",
        "Democrats may like the plan's call for converting 85 percent of cars and trucks to run on alternatives to oil within two decades.",
