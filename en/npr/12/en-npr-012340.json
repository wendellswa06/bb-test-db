        "He grouped these organisms: birds by their beaks, insects by their wings.",
        "And then he ranked the groups: class, order, genus, species.",

        "The ranking system has more or less survived 300 years.",
        "Its structure is still sound, but just like a 300-year-old house, it's required some renovation.",

        "But now, we get to the end here, and now we've got a, sort of, mixture of weird snakes and lizard-like things that we don't really know where they fit in.",
        "De Queiroz calls this the mystery aisle; the lizards and snakes on these shelves are just too weird to be sorted by their scales and skulls.",
        "Here are the Amphisbaenia.",
        "De Queiroz pulls a jar out off the top shelf, opens it up, and tugs at this long thing.",
        "And you can see sometimes the way they were folded doesn't exactly fit well into the - yeah, so you might see why they call that worm a lizard.",
        "It's like a giant, bloated earthworm with scales.",
        "Today is a big day for the Amphisbaenians.",
        "Until recently, no one knew where they fit on the reptilian tree of life.",

        "and Europe.",
        "Well, so now, now that we have a better idea about who they're related to, we should probably rearrange the collection so that they're close to the things that they're closely related to.",
        "In cases like this, DNA analysis is shaking up the tree of life, moving creatures from one branch to another.",
        "Other times, DNA studies help create new branches altogether.",
        "Linnaeus grouped all of life into four different ranks.",
        "Now, De Queiroz says, scientists use dozens.",
        "As we've discovered more and more about how things are related to each other, seven ranks just weren't enough to deal with it.",
        "So now, you know, we have super-orders, sub-families, super-families, tribes.",
        "It turns out life is even more complicated than Linnaeus thought.",
        "But, De Queiroz says, Linnaeus got one thing perfectly right.",
        "He looked around him and saw that there is order in nature.",
        "And Darwin agreed with him a hundred years later.",
        "If he hadn't, we might not be celebrating Linnaeus today."

        "Right?",
        "This late in the race it means they are familiar with the candidates and dont like them.",
        "But usually, you know, it's kind of if you have, you know, 15 percent undecideds this late in the race it kind of means that both parties have kind of failed to nominate the right candidates, and could have won that race if they'd picked a better one."
