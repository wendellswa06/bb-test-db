        "And what kind of effect does datura have on humans?",
        "It produces similar experiences to LSD.",

        "So, basically, Venus and Mars are on an acid trip?",
        "I'm not certain about the female figure but in as much as this little mischievous satyr holding the fruit is actually beneath the so-called Mars figure who is actually fast asleep, I would suggest that that is what has happened to him.",
        "So at the National Gallery in London, the official description says: This painting depicts the conquering and civilizing power of love.",
        "Do you think that that's what it's trying to tell us?",
        "That is one of the theories, which I think is true.",
        "But my main theory is that people at the time of Botticelli would have read these paintings on a number of different levels and they were trained to do that.",
        "So, indeed, people like the satyrs are devilish.",
        "But for example, Venus in the Renaissance could be a lusty, earthly sexy woman.",
        "But she also represented another side of Venus was that she was totally spiritual and could take us into the celestial world if you like.",
        "There are other aspects of the painting that made me believe it's also meant to be Adam and Eve as well as these other lovers such as Venus and Mars.",
        "In the Bible, it is never labeled as an apple, which we all think is the fruit that Eve gave to Adam.",
        "For example, Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel, when he shows Adam and Eve, he shows them holding a fig.",
        "So what I am saying is that this painting could be read on all of those layers of meaning.",
        "Do you think that there ought to be some kind of like re-launch party for this painting?",
        "I mean, it completely changes the meaning of it.",
        "Well, it doesn't, you see.",
        "I'm not critiquing any earlier art historian's reading of the painting.",
        "I'm just saying that whereas early art historians have only read Venus and Mars, which is a modern title of the painting, into the painting, other - some other art historians think that we see portraits of contemporary lovers at the time of Botticelli."
