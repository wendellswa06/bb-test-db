        "Well, metaphor is something that is used a lot in psychotherapy.",
        "And tarot cards are kind of rich with symbolism and, you know, lots of metaphors that can, I think, help people understand the relationship between thoughts and feelings and behavior, which is, really, what we're trying to do in therapy as well - helping people make those connections.",

        "Right.",
        "And in the boat, they have six swords that are sort of surrounding them.",

        "Oh.",
        "And so those swords are sort of representing, you know, some of those more challenging mental events, like anxiety and fear and guilt."
