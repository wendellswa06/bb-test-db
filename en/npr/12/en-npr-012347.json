        "So it's pretty clear from that title, from the headline of your piece, where you stand on all of this.",
        "But I just want to point out that you are not the only one to publish such a strongly-worded piece this weekend.",
        "I mean, your colleague, Megan McArdle, who's a self-described right-of-center columnist, a libertarian, wrote a piece titled, \"\"When Will Trump Supporters Finally Say, OK, This Is Not Normal?",
        "(ph)\"\" Michael Gerson is a former Republican speechwriter.",
        "He wrote a piece saying the Trump presidency is not just unfolding - it's unraveling.",
        "There was a similar piece by Max Boot, another former conservative writer.",
        "So what is it that all of you are responding to in this moment?",
        "I think in this particular episode, as opposed to some of the other ones, it was the frenetic zigzag back and forth on policy.",
        "One day, he was going to have a tax cut - the next day, he wasn't.",
        "One day, he was talking about Jews being disloyal - the next day he was calling himself the chosen one.",
        "It was this frenetic pace of kind of lashing out that seemed to be discombobulated.",
        "If you had a relative that was behaving this way, you'd maybe take them in or tell them to have a nice cup of tea and sit down.",
        "This is the president of the United States.",
        "And what we saw was what the market saw.",
        "And although I think presidents sometimes get too much blame and too much credit for the economy, here, I think there's a very real connection, which is businesspeople don't know what's coming next.",
        "The European Council President Donald Tusk said something that was widely believed to have been directed at Donald Trump yesterday when he said that, quote-unquote, \"\"senseless disputes with other countries are careening the global economy towards a recession,\"\" you pointed out in your piece that no congressional leader or presidential candidate in the United States has come out and said the same.",
        "One would think that they have at least as much stake in the American economy as Donald Tusk does.",
        "Why do you think that is?",
        "I attribute the Republican silence to their general strategy of not saying or doing anything to make him even madder at them.",
        "You can call it cowardice.",
        "You can call it avoidance.",
        "You can call it self-delusion.",
        "But they have really not stood up to this president, and I think they're hoping to just stay out of his way at this point.",
        "As far as the Democratic presidential candidates, it's a really good question, and I actually think they should.",
        "And I think there is that opportunity for Democrats to be the grown-ups here - to give a serious speech explaining the dangers of increasing tariffs, to explain the importance of an independent central bank and to lay out in their mind what would be a better strategy in terms of taking on the Chinese.",
        "I think it would make a really impressive contrast right now as the president is unspooling.",
        "And these people are running for the job, and it would be nice to hear, like, an audition.",
        "Well, if we had so-and-so, what would they sound like?",
        "May 12th, 5:12, it's now China's 9/11.",
        "Starting at 2:28 this afternoon, the time the earthquake struck, crowds stood silently as sirens wailed and horns blared in tribute to the estimated 50,000 dead.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "When I called my house from Toronto that night after the game, my sister-and-law and brother-and-law were staying at our house, and 10 carloads of people showed up at the house throwing rocks and eggs and everything else at it.",
        "Ten carloads of people.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And they - I guess they didn't understand I was renting the house.",
        "It didn't bother me much, but it really angered the guy that owned the house."

        "And right now they're in a great position in this World Series, granted it's - weather related it's been terrible, and they've had to deal with some adversity.",
        "But one thing about this team, they're the most even-keeled team I've ever seen in my life.",
        "They don't get too emotional one way or another, and they just come out and do the job at hand.",
        "Well, Mitch Williams, thanks a lot for talking with us.",
        "Of course we all know of you as \"\"The Wild Thing\"\" from 1993, but I gather in Philadelphia now you're almost professorial there in your role as a sports analyst and talk radio host.",
