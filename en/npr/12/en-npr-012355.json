        "They are guaranteed 68 seats in the parliament for each province, but I think the real key has been the number of young people running.",
        "As you said, Lulu, there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years.",
        "The current parliament has been a frustration to many, almost a symbol of the corruption and patronage that has held Afghanistan back.",
        "And it was really interesting to see election observers at the polls.",
        "There were 400,000 of them - many of them there to support their own candidates to make sure that their candidates got a fair shake in these elections.",
        "The fact that so many young people and nonpoliticians were willing to put themselves out there, I think, shows that there's a new generation of Afghans trying to change things."
