        "Hey, Audie.",
        "How did we get to this point?",
        "So the backstory here is that - you might remember that Kim Kardashian went to the White House earlier this month to speak to President Trump to ask for a pardon for Alice Johnson.",
        "Alice Johnson was convicted of a first-time, nonviolent drug offense in 1996, and she was sentenced to life in prison.",
        "And that meeting seemed to work because President Trump commuted Alice Johnson's sentence.",
        "After that meeting, President Trump turned to NFL players and asked for the names of other people like Alice Johnson who might be pardoned.",
        "Which brings us to this op-ed in The New York Times.",
        "Did they actually offer up any names?",
        "They did not suggest names.",
        "The players who signed the op-ed - that was Doug Baldwin, Anquan Boldin, Malcolm Jenkins and Benjamin Watson - they pointed out that there are lots of people in federal prisons just like Alice Johnson.",
        "And they said, quote, \"\"imagine how many more Alice Johnsons the president could pardon if he treated the issue like the systemic problem that it is rather than asking professional football players for a few cases.",
        "So when they talk about systemic problems, what areas of the justice system are they talking about?",
        "They were talking mostly about drug offenses, people like Alice Johnson.",
        "And they called for the president to issue a blanket pardon for people in similar situations.",
        "They pointed out that nearly half of the people in federal prison are there for drug offenses.",
        "A significant number of those are serving sentences of 20 years or more for those drug offenses.",
        "They also said that more than a quarter of the people in federal prisons are elderly.",
        "And the players recommended that the president order the release of any drug offender over the age of 60 who was not recently convicted.",
        "Thank you, Farai.",
        "It is, you know, at the Discovery Channel I was put in charge of building networks there that was built around passionate fans, and as I created the Gospel Music Channel it was so obvious to me the passion, the size of the fan base across America with over 60 million people now buying gospel on a regular basis, and so many listeners across the country that the Gospel Music Channel has become the fastest growing network because of that the last two years.",
        "But it was, you know, understanding the fan base, the passion of the fan base that helped us, you know, really understand how to create a channel for them on cable.",
        "And it was so important, I think, that we recognize this art form of America that has infected our culture so much as well as, you know, it's deeply relevant to so many of your listeners, and many of people across America - deeply relevant to their lifestyle.",
        "Well, Congresswoman, there's some people who would say, look, you know, there's so many of these months, and besides, isn't there separation of church and state?",
        "And this is just, you know, gospel, isn't that religious music?",
        "And doesn't that cross a line?",
        "There are any number of issues that people might bring up in conjunction with looking at something like this.",
        "Why did you feel like it was something that you really wanted to make happen?"

        "Well, one of the things that I think is very important is how meteoric, how speedy this legislation passed, of course with the support of the majority leader of the United States Congress, which is a secular body.",
        "People were so excited from both sides of the aisles, Republicans and Democrats about the American aspect of gospel music.",
        "So, they didn't hesitate for a moment to think that this was something that we all should celebrate.",
        "In fact, our schools, we hope to expand this to the Smithsonian and create curriculums so that people know about this treasure.",
        "Bob Dylan, Sam Cook, Elvis Presley all had their music intertwined into the gospel genre.",
        "And so the idea of this commemorative month, and we will of course celebrate the first one, we hope the nation will join us.",
        "We'll have a big celebration in Houston and in Washington, D.C.",
        "But this, as a nation's holiday, is to be able to appreciate something that America can claim as part of her wonderful and rich heritage, and to say thank you to those who were yesterday, today and tomorrow.",
        "So, my message is take this month and dissect gospel music, both in terms of the early spirituals when we sang a cappella, to now the musical tones of a Kirk Franklin and a Marvin Sapp, people who were so diverse.",
        "Dissect it as a musical art.",
        "View it as art.",
        "Teach our children about art and music in our schools, and make them better persons.",
        "That's what we think this holiday is all about.",
        "You mentioned some of the many groups that referenced gospel.",
        "One of them Bob Dylan.",

        "When people say gospel, I mean, in terms of Kirk Franklin, for example - Kirk Franklin and Mahalia Jackson have certain things in common and certain things that are very different.",
        "When it comes to contemporary gospel in particular, what do you think people attract - attract people to that as opposed to, perhaps, classic gospel?",
        "You know, Farai, I think that inherent in all of gospel, whether you go back to where you began with Mahalia Jackson, or Bob Dylan, or some of the newer groups that people are listening to of all ages now, Switchfoot, many of these groups have crossed, you know, many lines into the secular world from traditional gospel roots.",
        "I think the one thing they find in the music is there's a certain sound to gospel just as a pure musical art form.",
        "But I think the message of hope that is inherent in all of gospel music, you know, in the world today, you know, we could all use a little hope in our lives.",
        "And I think people really attach to that and they are drawn to that.",
        "I think many people are seeking answers and seeking, you know, what tomorrow may hold, and I think gospel brings that comfort to many people."
