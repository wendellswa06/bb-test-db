        "Well - but let me ask this - there are some health care economists who have looked the idea of having government negotiate for lower drug prices who say - talk about \"\"The Art Of The Deal\"\" - negotiation only works if one party is willing to get up and walk away from the table.",
        "But you can't do that with Medicare, can you?",
        "You can't say, well, we're willing to walk away from this deal because millions of people on Medicare need those drugs to survive.",

        "Do you think some of this report will be declassified?",

        "And this was certainly what was briefed to the Senate Intelligence Committee two weeks ago, but you're absolutely right.",
        "I mean, the administration can't fully lay out its case because it knows if it were to do so, it would be compromising what's known as sources and methods, which would then make it harder for the CIA and the NSA and other spy agencies to get more information in the future.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, it may be too far to say that they elected the person.",
        "They may have contributed to a groundswell of opposition to, you know, Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, by having those emails released.",

        "And how do you quantify that?",
        "But you - you know, you do see that there is, you know, a view now within the intelligence community that this was the intention of the Russians.",
