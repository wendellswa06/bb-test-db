        "I mean, you know, if we can really figure out, for example, what this platform is - I mean, it probably was supporting a temple - and if we can get some more written information, we're going to get a better understanding of what is happening not just in the city.",
        "So the cities have these big major temples and then they have little temples and then they have shrines.",
        "And we have a pretty good understanding of how that worked and how people accessed them.",
        "But, again, one of the things I've been seeing on satellite imagery, which will record whether weather conditions are correct, architectural patterns beneath the ground, is a lot of the small fights and not scruffy little villages that you might expect.",
        "But they actually are kind of - just places that have temples, for example, or just places that have public buildings.",
        "And so I think that there is a kind of a new direction of research where we really need to think about what's happening in the countryside as well as what's happening in the cities as well, which we already understand pretty well.",
