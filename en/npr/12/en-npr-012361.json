        "Nice to have you back on the program.",
        "Good to be here with you, Neal.",
        "And what's changed over these past few months?",
        "Is the situation, particularly in the east and the south of Afghanistan, significantly better than it was?",
        "Well, it's a mixed bag.",
        "In the east, I think things are worse than they were last year.",
        "The east was long viewed as a part of the country that was sort of holding steady.",
        "It was where U.S.",
        "troops had been for the longest.",
        "And there was an assumption, I think, on the part of senior U.S.",
        "commanders that it would just sort of hold as it was.",
        "It wouldn't get much worse.",
        "But what we've seen over the past several months is actually, I think, a worsening of the conflict, in part because of increased infiltration from Pakistan, strengthened activities from one of the principal insurgent groups there, the Hakani Network.",
        "But it's a very different picture, Neal, in the south, where the bulk of Obama's surge forces were deployed, both in Helmand province and in Kandahar province, the two biggest parts of southern Afghanistan.",
        "And now, just having come back from two weeks both in Helmand and Kandahar, I was just surprised by the degree to which, in some of the - some of what had once been some of the worst, most violent places, the ability to move around, that the life sort of resuming back to normal, the commercial activity.",
        "I spent four days up in Sangin, which is in northern Helmand province, which -you know, it's been the killing fields of Afghanistan.",
        "More than 100 British troops were killed there from 2005 to 2010.",
        "And since last summer, more than three dozen U.S.",
        "Marines have lost their lives up there.",
        "Now up in Sangin, Marines can actually travel down roads that they once never could before.",
        "Some schools are starting to reopen.",
        "The main bazaar there is, you know, more crowded than it's been in years.",
        "Now admittedly, these are still early-level indicators.",
        "And I want to underscore that I didn't come away feeling like all of this was irreversible.",
        "In fact, you know, it feels very fragile, it feels very tenuous, and there are real questions to be raised that we can talk about today about the sustainability of this."

        "Will Afghan security forces be able to take advantage of some of these gains?",
        "Will the Afghan government step in to provide the necessary services to the population that will help to cement some of these gains?",
        "Or to what degree will we sort of be in a position of doing this all over again this summer?",
        "One of the things - we'll get to those, but one of the things we've kept hearing from commanders was the Taliban has been significantly degraded.",
        "We have been effective at attacking mid-level commanders, finding caches of weapons that we never found before, in much larger numbers than before.",
        "Yes, they're going to get new recruits in Pakistan.",
        "Yes, they're going to be coming across the border.",
        "But they're not going to be as well-led nor as well-equipped.",
        "Indeed.",
        "And certainly that's what, you know, I heard and to some degree saw across my travels over these past couple of weeks.",
        "An awful lot of - a lot of fighters have been killed over the past several months.",
        "So the ranks of those trying to resume the fight will be thinned out.",
        "A lot of their, yes, weapons caches have been unearthed and destroyed.",
        "A lot of bunkers - and these are bunkers that date back to the Soviet occupation, in places outside of Kandahar City, in some cases concrete bunkers reinforced with steel beams that literally were impervious to U.S.",
        "bombs that soldiers then had to go and blow up from inside with explosives.",
        "A lot of those things have been removed.",
        "A lot of IED belts, these are improvised explosive devices, the homemade bombs that they make out of fertilizer, in many cases the Taliban had laid belts and belts of these things to prevent forces from essentially encroaching upon their safe havens.",
        "The modern version of minefields.",
        "Indeed.",
        "And a lot of these have been removed.",
        "So what commanders say is even if large numbers of Taliban take up weapons again, commanders come across the border from Pakistan, which they will, and recruit disaffected young Afghan men to pick up weapons and to plant bombs, that the battlefield has effectively changed because a lot of their safe havens, a lot of their fighting positions have now been removed.",
        "And in many cases, what troops have done has been to further change that by doing things like trying to build big sand berms and putting up concrete walls to prevent movement of people.",
        "Look, there's going to be a fundamental difference this year because they have so reshaped the field of battle out there."

        "Let's bring another voice into the conversation, Andrew Exum, also with us here in Studio 3A, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, formerly an Army Ranger, also formerly a civilian advisor to General Stanley McChrystal in Afghanistan.",
        "It's nice to have you back, as well.",
        "Thanks a lot.",
        "And in February, we spoke with your colleague, John Nagl, who was pretty optimistic about how things were going, while Bing West, a former assistant secretary in the Reagan administration, said at that time he'd have to give the upper hand to the Taliban.",
        "As you listen to Rajiv Chandrasekaran's description, how are things going to go?",
        "Are those tactical successes going to translate to political success?",
        "Well, you know, first off, I think my own analysis largely matches up with Rajiv's observations.",
        "I think that where you can establish some degree of correlation between where we've had a high troop-to-population ratio, such as in the south and R.C.",
        "Southwest.",
        "And you can see gains in security, where we have had a lower troop-to-population ratio, such as in R.C.",
        "East - that's Regional Command East - we have seen the conflict worsen.",
        "You know, in comparison to both John's assessment, as well as Bing West, and I respect both men tremendously, I think I'm going to be a little more cautious on passing judgment on the success or failure of the current strategy until the summer, and I'll tell you why.",
        "We often make the mistake in America of thinking of the fighting season in Afghanistan like the baseball season, you know, it starts in early spring, and it winds up sometime around October or November, earlier if you're a Nationals fan.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But the reality is is that the fighting in Afghanistan never really ceases at any point, especially not in southern Afghanistan.",
        "And although the conflict is more kinetic, that is to say there's a lot more shooting going on in the summer, a campaign of fear and intimidation still rules the roost in the winter."

        "That having been said, the conflict is cyclical to a degree.",
        "It heats up in the summer.",
        "And so for a civilian analyst like myself, looking at the conflict, I have to look at the data of, say, one district in one month of a year.",
        "So I look at the Arghandab River Valley, where we've seen, where we think we've seen, tremendous security gains over the past 12 months, but I'm going to wait and reserve judgment until around June, July, August so I can look and see: Okay, how does security incidents in June, July, August of 2010 match up against security incidents of June, July, August 2011.",
        "That's different from, say, for example, the conflict in Iraq, where we surged in, and you saw a pretty precipitous drop of ethno-sectarian violence almost immediately after the surge.",

        "Populations in civil wars in general are just trying to survive, and they'll survive by hedging, by swinging back and forth, by trying to stay on the sidelines.",

        "allies, is to try to get them to choose sides.",

        "In the south, meanwhile, that is actually where we're still waiting on a degree of - I want to say collaboration or cooperation from the population.",
        "One of the big problems we have with the Afghan National Army, which so far has been a success story over the past 18 months or so, is that we've still not seen the participation from Pashtun southerners and its officer corps.",
        "And there's a real danger that it's going to become, you know, a military thats dominated by presence from the north.",
