        "troops in place, NATO commanders claimed progress against the Taliban, especially in the southern part of the county, areas around Kandahar.",

        "But while, as I noted earlier, people can transit on the roads, there's more activity in the bazaars, schools are starting to reopen, Afghan civilians in that district and in many other parts of southern Afghanistan still remain very apprehensive."
