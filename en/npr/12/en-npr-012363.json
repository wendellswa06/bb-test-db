        "Oh, excuse me.",
        "And one of the things that I noticed drastically since my last trip five years ago is that security is definitely a lot worse.",
        "And there's a lot of work being done by the NATO forces in Ghazni, but no one seems to know about it.",
        "The Afghans don't know about the work that they are doing both as far as development, and of course they don't know anything about the military effort, and neither do Americans.",
        "And I feel that it's very important that the kind of work that's being put into education, agriculture and such are communicated out to the community, so then there is some sense of security from the Afghan people.",
        "Just follow up on that, Hamira, there - we were talking about military gains.",
        "Hand in hand with that go the kind of civilian projects that she's talking about in Ghazni, which is to the east of Kabul.",
        "But is that - do you see evidence of that, Rajiv?",
        "Yes...",
        "If you don't have security, all of those development efforts will come to naught for the long term.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "The bottom line is that the Afghan people want security more than anything else.",
        "And so we can build all the schools we want and all the clinics we want, and that's a good thing, and in many cases these things are much needed by the Afghans.",
        "But ultimately, it won't change the center of gravity there because security remains the paramount concern for Afghan people.",
        "And I think one of the reasons there's been this backsliding in places like Ghazni and across Regional Command East and in other parts of the country, including up north in places like Faryab, is that there simply haven't been enough troops there to address this."

        "And so why did I see the changes I saw in parts of the south?",

        "forces in relatively small districts.",
        "Now, you can do that in some places, but you can't do that across the country.",
        "And so the big challenge for General David Petraeus and his other commanders is going to be, well, how do you then take some of these forces and apply them elsewhere and try to sort of keep the Taliban at bay in those other places and - but how do you avoid playing this sort of game of sort whack-a-mole?",
        "Like push them there, they pop up over here.",

        "...or the coast provinces in the east.",

        "That's right.",
        "And what the ISAF command wants to do, what General Petraeus wants to do is by the summer, he's going to want to start moving a lot of those troops that we have in the south and repositioning them in the east, in kind of the greater Paktia region where Shah's( family lives - is from.",
        "You know, Rajiv is a hundred percent correct that you have to establish security.",
        "You have to establish a degree of control over the environment.",
        "And with all due respect to the caller, the idea that we can do good works, that we can build roads, that we can build schools, and that - this is going to somehow address drivers of conflict, that's unfortunately proven to be incorrect.",
        "As a matter of fact, a lot of the money that we're putting into Afghanistan is distorting the conflict in Afghanistan and creating perverse incentives to where none of the actors - the insurgents, the government - has an interest in the United States leaving.",
        "What we have to do is establish some degree of security which then allows us to build up local Afghan forces, and that then sets the conditions for some sort of political settlement.",
        "But Rajiv is correct where we have not been able to surge troops, where we are still fighting an economy of force mission, that is where the Taliban is winning.",
        "And the same way that when we had the vast majority of our resources devoted to Iraq, Afghanistan worsened, and that's to be expected.",
        "I know what General Petraeus and what the other commanders at ISAF want to do.",
        "They want to gradually shift our resources from the south into the east whether they're allowed or able to do that in light of the expectations in Washington that we're going to begin a drawdown in July very much remains to be seen."

        "Obviously, some people remain in Afghanistan.",
        "There has been a lot of fighting there over the winter.",

        "Well, there's considerable unease among American military commanders in Afghanistan because of the Pakistan situation.",

        "security establishment that they have been particularly effective of late, that those will have to be curtailed, that other CIA activities there will also be, in some ways, attenuated because of Pakistani demands that certain, you know, contractors that help to enable CIA operatives working in that country be sent home or their visas not renewed.",
        "And more broadly, just the general tension between the two intelligence services which, again, is fundamentally counterproductive to trying to clamp down both on the issue of Taliban infiltration into Afghanistan but also the very bad actors who are seeking to destabilize the government in Islamabad.",
        "And, Andrew Exum, there's some suspicion that the Pakistanis are most upset, at the moment, because the CIA has been particularly effective against an organization which they did a great deal to establish and fund and organize, the Taliban, and in which they still have an interest.",
        "Look, the Pakistanis have been pursuing a pretty logical hygiene strategy since about 2005.",
        "As soon as we started to divert resources away from Afghanistan, the Pakistanis began to quite logically plan for a post-American, post-Western Afghanistan, and that meant reconstituting a lot of the proxy groups that would represent Pakistan's interests in a post-Western Afghanistan.",
        "The - now, at the time or right at this moment, Pakistan is very frustrated with the United States.",
        "There's - you see Pakistani officials...",
        "That cuts both ways.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "You see Pakistani officials quoted in the press saying that you have to either trust the ISI or not trust them because the Pakistani security service has been very helpful, quite honestly, in helping the United States and its allies target al-Qaida and those insurgent groups which threaten Pakistan.",
        "But the reason the United States can't be fully trustful of the Pakistanis is because we know that they have been arming, training, supporting those insurgent groups which threaten the state in Afghanistan."
