        "And I think that's exactly what Las Vegas is not doing.",
        "It and other cities around the country are trying simply to sweep homeless people away, to sweep poor people away, to sweep away any evidence of poverty in America.",
        "And I think that's exactly the wrong way to go.",
        "It's understandable that cities and neighbors do not like to see poor people, do not like horribly impoverished people living in their backyards or in their neighborhoods or in their city streets.",

        "We should note, as you suggested, as poverty grows across this country, we're starting to see these fights grow hand-in-hand.",
        "This is not just happening in Orlando and Las Vegas.",
        "We're seeing these fights, quite frankly, across the country.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And I think we've got to - we really have to focus on this as a national issue, and we've got to look at it as a human rights issue.",
        "It's embarrassing.",
        "It's a violation of basic human rights, of standards that the world community have agreed to about basic rights of human beings.",
        "And in a country as rich as ours, I think we can do much, much better.",
        "And that's why I think it's very significant that the UN has now drawn attention to this issue.",
        "So our country is now up on a world stage being criticized for its treatment of poor and homeless people, and especially for the disproportionate impact on racial minorities.",
        "We should note that we're going to see some conferences, including a conference on September 24th - or 21st I should say - a forum for the homeless and housing rights activists.",
        "But we should also note that this is beyond just a poverty question.",
        "This really is a civil and human rights issue, is it not?",
        "It is a civil rights issue, and it's a human rights issue.",
        "Certainly as we see in Las Vegas, the civil rights - and I think the ACLU representative was very right to point this out - we're seeing people being discriminated against based on their economic status.",
        "We're seeing also, people being - at least de facto - being discriminated against based on race.",
        "It may not be intentional, but it's a reality that the large proportion - 40 percent - of homeless people are African-Americans.",
        "And it may not be explicitly stated as an intentional discrimination, but that is the reality.",
        "And there's a reason for that, and it's all of the reasons of economic injustice in our country that disproportionately affect racial minorities.",
        "And so it is an issue of civil rights.",
        "It's an issue of human rights because the world community has said that there is a human right to housing, and that's not honored in our country.",
        "Even though the United States itself has also said, you know, over 50 years ago made a commitment to provide a decent home for every American.",
        "In federal legislation - the 1949 Housing Act - and that is a commitment that has been broken over and over again.",
