        "And it's nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Thank you for having me.",
        "And you begin your piece by conceding that in this swine flu season, you are over prescribing an expensive drug.",
        "Yeah.",
        "My example is the most dramatic example of defensive medicine, and I think all of us agree that doctors do practice defensively.",
        "Certainly, doctors in higher risk (unintelligible) professions like obstetrics or emergency room physicians probably have more dramatic stories.",
        "But the question, really, is does defensive medicine really drive up the cost of health care.",
        "And according to several studies, including those done by the congressional budget office, which is a nonpartisan group - as we know, no. The answer is no. It does not.",
        "Nevertheless, your patients are getting expensive prescriptions they probably don't need.",
        "Their health care costs went up.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They did go up a little bit.",
        "As a pediatrician, like I said, I'm not a huge utilizer of expensive medicines.",
        "And, thankfully, now that swine flue vaccine is a little more available, we're vaccinating more kids and hopefully keeping them from getting sick in the first place.",
        "But a lot of the procedures that, as you point out, rightly, people - doctors in other areas of specialty - well, we're talking about things like MRIs.",
        "Those are very expensive exams.",
        "Even surgical procedures that people don't need, all ordered by doctors for fear that if they don't order them, they're going to eventually - might eventually be sued for not doing all they could.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I think one example you can use is a CT scan.",
        "We do a lot more CT scans than probably are necessary in this country.",
        "And some of that is done defensively, to look for things that maybe we want to confirm do or don't exist in a patient, an illness.",
        "But the question then becomes is it safe to practice defensive medicine?",
        "And, you know, with CT scans, in particular, you're exposing a patient to very high doses of radiation.",
        "And repeated scans, you know, over the long haul could increase risk of cancer and other side effects of that radiation."

        "So, you know, it's not clear cut and I think that defensive medicine down the line may have negative consequences for patients as well.",
        "That's not what the issue here.",
        "If there were fewer CT scans ordered, it will be less expensive.",
        "Yes, that's correct, and to some degree, it will.",
        "But how much would that lower the overall cost of health care?",
        "And that question really shuts - and the answer that suggest it won't make a big dent in the overall cost of health care.",
        "How many - another impression that a lot of people have, you write in your piece, is that there are a lot of lawsuits and that doctors face huge liabilities.",
        "Again, the number of lawsuits over the last 10 to 12 years has been stable, essentially - at about 15 suits per hundred doctors in this country; according to, again, the Congressional budget office.",
        "And so we're not seeing really an epidemic of lawsuits that you might be hearing about from some of the rhetoric in physician's groups and lobbyists.",
        "Probably the most significant, the most serious lawsuits are now being handled in the courts, the most significant injuries and damages, while the other ones are going away.",
        "Other ones are going away, presumably being settled.",
        "Either settled or dismissed, yeah.",
        "And-",
        "But we don't have - I think, the point is, we don't have an epidemic of lawsuits in this country, that you might think with suddenly - if we suddenly capped rewards or somehow found other reforms to curtail - would suddenly drop health care costs.",
        "Overall, estimates are that malpractice costs, overall, account for probably less than two percent of overall health care costs.",
        "Let me ask this though, if the risk is negligible or just that minor, how come malpractice insurance rates keep going through the roof?",
        "There's no arguing that."

        "And one was more recently, in 2002.",
        "And the argument that physicians make is that there's - or physicians groups make - is that there's a large spike in lawsuits and there's an epidemic of lawsuits that drive up the risk of covering physician.",
        "When in fact they may be part of the issue, but really the main thing also is that insurance companies make money by investing insurance premiums.",
        "And when investment markets are soft, as they were in those three eras, profits drop and then rates have to go up.",
        "And so there are many more factors other than just a risk of covering a physician - in terms of what determines the price of malpractice.",
        "So in other words, when the insurance company get the premiums paid by every 100 percent of doctors that's not put an escrow somewhere, they invest it and it helps to makes money?",
        "Correct.",
        "Correct.",
        "And that's the nature of the insurance business.",
        "So the insurance business, the structure of the insurance business, you're saying, is responsible for this spike in malpractice insurance rates?",
        "Well, if you look at some of the data, that's correct.",
