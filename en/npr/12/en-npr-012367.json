        "But the question is, are these cases going to be tried by a jury of inner city people who sympathize more with patients than with the doctors, or are these cases going to be tried in front of professionals who understand the cases?",

        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I guess the question would be that is, would tort reform somehow change the price of defensive medicine?",

        "The same process occurred.",
        "The woman actually didn't win the case.",
        "And the reason - even though the physician admitted to error, because the jury decided that they had heard rhetoric that physicians were leaving the state due to high malpractice premiums, so they ruled against the defendant.",
        "I guess the question is - or ruled against the plaintiff.",
        "I guess the question is that, do tort reforms really change the pattern of behavior of patients and doctors, and I'm not sure it does.",
        "I think one thing that would change the pattern of everything would be if we'd focus on patient's safety instead of defensive medicine and tort reform.",
        "And that's being ignored in this debate.",
        "What do you mean by patient's safety?",
        "And I'm afraid I have to ask you to be brief.",

        "There are ways to improve patient's safety that will really help to perhaps curtail medical malpractice lawsuits because we're keeping patients safe in the first place - preventing the problem in the first place from occurring."
