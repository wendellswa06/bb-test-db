        "Let's pick something that we know always gets together in big groups.",
        "Right.",
        "That nobody knows of an indigenous repellent that they have, like we did with the cockroaches.",

        "Wow.",
        "…the same thing that's in all other animals.",

        "…the stench of death, too?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",

        "Well, we've test - the other thing we did was well, let's see how risky can we get?",
        "So if we just pick a couple of bugs that we think it might work on - and so, all my students were astonished one day when I walked in the lab with these tree branches full of caterpillars.",
        "And they're going, what are you doing, Dave?",
        "And I'm like, okay.",
        "We're going to see if we can repel all these 10 caterpillars with their own body extracts.",

        "They're not known to avoid their own dead.",

        "So we tested them first and we got 100 percent response, branches with the caterpillar extracts on them were intact and the ones that were not treated were defoliated.",
        "And then we did the same thing with another family of social caterpillars, we call the fall web worm.",
        "And there are right now, you'll often see them in the trees.",
        "And again, we got 100 percent repulsion with the body extract.",
        "And then we tested the two different acids and we got full effect in this with both acids, as well.",
        "Now those ones we haven't proven that the chemicals coming from them yet, but it's pretty good bet.",
        "Do you have to use the insects' own extract?",
        "I mean a cockroach - will it work on the caterpillar?",
        "Well, there's two parts to that.",
        "We've used the standard acids.",
        "You can just buy them from Sigma and we've used the pure acids.",
        "We get repulsion of the cockroaches, the wood lice and the caterpillars and some other stuff with those materials without anything added to them.",
        "So it does have a general repellant value.",
        "On the other hand, we knew that that aggregation chemical, the recognition cue was in there.",
        "And with the wood lice, we're getting repulsion with different dosages.",
        "So there will be a dose, we can get rid of all of them.",
        "But if the aggregation chemical or the smell of their own dead, in other words, if they smell it is them, then we get much more effective…",
        "Wow.",
        "…repulsion.",
        "So, the raw stuff works but if you add their own odor to it…",
