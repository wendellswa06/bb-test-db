        "That's right.",
        "So, you know, I think - but for me, all I got to do is say to myself, nappy-headed hos, while I'm looking in the mirror and say, do you want to be on a show that's associated with that phrase?",

        "How, as the society, do we promote this person and have him as a spokesman?",
        "It's - evidently, I think, we need to, kind of, look into ourselves, as a society, and wonder and ask ourselves why we have allowed this person to have national exposure.",
        "And that is my comment.",
        "Dan, thanks for your call.",
        "Clarence Page, is the public and the popularity of Imus to some degree to blame for this?",

        "Yeah.",
        "Like Pogo said we've met the enemy and he's, you know, it's just to say, mm-hmm, this is the double-edged sword of the First Amendment and our freedom say - and that wide marketplace of ideas, which I'm all in favor of.",
        "And indeed if Don were to decide to do like Howard Stern and go off the public airwaves to a private satellite radio and say whatever he wants to that'd be a whole different discussion.",
        "But we are talking about the public's airwaves here that we all share.",
        "...at that moment and throughout the day.",
        "The fact that we do have so many choices means that audiences have been segmenting(ph) people for whom Imus' humor is not their cup of tea.",
        "They just don't tune in, and that's their right too.",
        "That's why he's been able to succeed.",
        "I won't say allowed to succeed, just able to succeed over more than 35 years of broadcasting."

        "Well, I think he should be treated like any other shock jock, which he has not been treated like in the past until this weekend.",
        "As far as I know, he hasn't even gotten the stern warnings after past complaints.",
        "Now, he did go over the edge in a way that has resulted in two weeks off the air, which is light compared to a lot of other shock jocks, if you will, for similar infractions.",
        "But it does put up - put some seriousness to the message to his apologies and to CBS and NBC statements of outrage.",
        "Rochelle Riley?",
