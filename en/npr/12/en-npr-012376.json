        "A unilateral declaration of a cease-fire would be necessary at this time.",
        "Instantly, Israeli leaders dismissed Ban's suggestion, but it must have provoked some second thoughts within the government because soon after that, Israeli spokesmen began to hint that a unilateral cease-fire might just suit Israel's needs.",
        "A unilateral cease-fire would mean that there would be no formal agreement between Israel and Hamas.",
        "Thus, Hamas would not be legitimized as a negotiating partner in any way.",
        "Nor would Israel have to agree formally to Hamas's demands to open the border crossings and end the economic blockade of Gaza.",
        "Internal divisions in Hamas have also made agreement on a cease-fire difficult.",
        "The group's top people inside Gaza have been more flexible, but its external leader, Khaled Meshal, has been immovable, insisting there would be no cease-fire before Israel withdraws its troops from Gaza and opens up the borders.",
        "Meshal spoke to a meeting of Arab heads of state in Qatar yesterday.",
        "(Through Translator) This heinous aggression against the Gaza Strip is not against Hamas, as the enemy portrays it, but against all of Gaza, all the Palestinian people, the Palestinian cause and the nation.",
        "Israel has by now realized that it will not pay the agreed price to Palestinian negotiators or Arab negotiators.",
        "So it wanted to create a new game with new rules, and to impose conditions for a settlement.",
        "It appears that whatever kind of a cease-fire is finally achieved, the United States will have some role in maintaining it.",
        "Yesterday, Israel's foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, signed an agreement in Washington that spells out ways in which the U.S.",
        "will assist Israel in the technical and intelligence fields.",
        "According to Secretary of State Rice, the goal is to assure that more weapons are not smuggled into Gaza once a cease-fire is in place.",
        "We've said repeatedly that the continued supply of armaments to Hamas and other terrorist groups in Gaza, including by some in the region, is a direct cause of the current hostilities.",
        "It is therefore incumbent upon us in the international community to prevent the rearmament of Hamas so that a cease-fire will be durable and fully respected.",

        "Ahmed Abu Hamda, who works with NPR in Gaza, said there is much anticipation about a possible cease-fire - and much uneasiness.",
        "People here in Gaza - actually, they feel so confused also because the situation is partially calm here.",

        "Yeah, it could be.",

        "Also buyers of more fuel-efficient cars aren't eligible.",
        "Chrysler clearly wants to sell its main line SUV's and pickups.",

        "And with gas prices climbing, sales of those gas-guzzlers are plummeting.",
        "When you look at the sales numbers every month, Chrysler is just by far the worst off and they needed to do something to stop the bleeding so the gas program is their latest idea.",
        "And Nancy, how likely is this incentive to stop the bleeding?",

        "It's not fun anymore if you don't have any money.",
        "So a deal like this may bring people that are already car shopping into the Chrysler, Dodge or Jeep showroom.",
        "Is it going to bring new people into the showroom?",
        "Probably not.",
        "And Madeleine, consumers who read the fine print are going to see that this gas card offer is only good for the first three years you own the vehicle or the first 12,000 miles you drive, and a lot of people drive 20,000 miles a year or more."
