        "Slobodan Milosevic was buried yesterday on the grounds of his estate yesterday.",
        "In the days since the former Serbian leader's death in prison, he has been compared to Hitler and Stalin.",
        "Commentator Kevin Cullen says that gives Milosevic more credit than is due.",
        "Slobodan Milosevic was not a head of state who behaved like a genocidal maniac, so much as he was a gangster who happened to be a head of state, a hectored mob boss who had more in common with Tony Soprano than Adolph Hitler.",
        "He sought not world domination, but to keep his little slice of turf: Serbia, the North Jersey of the Balkans, and to somehow maintain order in a home that was as dysfunctional as anything Eugene O'Neal could dream up.",
        "Milosevic was a chameleon.",
        "He rose to power as a Communist.",
        "But when it suited him, he reinvented himself as an ultra-nationalist.",
        "Had he believed he could retain power by becoming a Scientologist, Milosevic would have invited Tom Cruise to become the nation's chief psychologist.",
        "But Milosevic was always and forever a gangster.",
        "He ruled through fear, intimidation and, quite often, murder.",
        "He subcontracted criminals to do his dirty work.",
        "He effectively leased the private sector to cronies who paid him tribute.",
        "His family and his pals got rich while the standard of living for ordinary Serbs plummeted.",
        "Yet, for all he did for the family, he was constantly harangued by his wife Mira.",
        "Nothing he did was ever good enough for her.",
        "Poor Slobo: a hard day at the office committing crimes against humanity, and he had to come home to this?",
        "Mira was more than a shrew.",
        "In 1999, after she complained about a crusading newspaper editor who was writing embarrassing things about the family, the editor was shot to death on his Belgrade doorstep.",
        "For someone properly described as the Serbian strongman, Milosevic was pathetically weak.",
        "After launching the wars that killed a quarter-million people and made refugees of several million others, he promised Serbs in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo he would never abandon them.",
        "But he did.",
        "He warned NATO he would never bow to their bombs, but he did.",
        "He vowed he would not recognize the legitimacy of the election that ousted him; but after Serbs took to the streets, he did.",
        "And when police surrounded his Belgrade villa in the spring of 2001, he promised to kill himself rather than surrender.",
        "But he gave up.",
        "During a surreal, 26-hour standoff, Milosevic (unintelligible) around, a cigar on one hand, a big handgun with a 25-shot clip in the other, launching into a soliloquy about dying with honor.",
        "Outside the heavily fortified walls, a few hundred loyalists, many of them drunk, urged their hero to hold out to the bitter end, chanting, Slobo, Slobo, Slobo!",
        "When the cigar wasn't in Slobo's mouth, the gun was, and he threatened to use it on his wife, his daughter and himself.",
        "His daughter, Maria, was packing not one, but three guns that night.",
        "And when her father dropped his bravado and his piece, she ran from the house, hysterical, firing wildly.",
        "Luckily, she's as bad a shot as her father was at keeping promises."

        "Mira, big hair and big mouth, was furious that her husband gave up without a fight.",
        "Alas, their son Marco could not be present for the festivities as he had already fled to Moscow to avoid being killed by rival mobsters.",
        "Last week, the former first family of Yugoslavia fought with each other again, this time over where to bury their patriarch.",
        "They are scattered now, like so many wise guys on the lam.",
        "Mira is wanted on corruption charges.",
        "Maria still has that little matter of shooting at the cops to settle up.",
        "And Marco?",
        "Well, let's just say that if Marco ever returns to any of his old haunts, he is likely to be greeted as his dad's favorite war criminal (unintelligible) was one day six years ago in the lobby of Belgrade Intercontinental Hotel when someone cheerfully called out his name, then shot him in the face.",
        "Kevin Cullen is a reporter for the Boston Globe.",
        "He covered the war in Kosovo, as well as, the downfall, arrest and initial court appearances of Slobodan Milosevic.",
        "Bye.",
        "And perhaps you are wondering, why are we playing in San Francisco and not Oakland?",
        "Well, because no one believed in that team right there.",
        "Yeah, not a problem.",
        "It happens all the time.",
        "Yes, I was a military family physician in Fort Lewis, Washington.",
        "During the air war we were told that they needed a push package of 110 physicians to replace those docs they thought they were going to die in the first week of the ground war, and they needed two family doctors to be part of it.",
        "I was picked out of a hat as one of those two doctors, rushed over there through training and actually arrived on the night before the invasion.",
        "It's - of course in that sort of situation your family doesn't know where you are and - but all she knew is that I was going through the war.",
        "And fortunately, of course, we didn't have the casualties we expected, and I stayed on for the refugee operations over the next three months.",
        "Obviously the communications with your family, this - people forget it was the dawn of the age of the cell phone.",
        "They were just coming out, and there were satellite telephones that were also just coming out which could reliably be counted on to fail after about 15 minutes.",
        "Yeah, we did not - I did not have any way to talk to my wife until 10 days after the 100-hour war, and she saw CNN reports of doctors stepping on landmines and spent a couple of nights waiting for the black sedan to show up.",
        "But fortunately after they set up a satellite phone session and four hours of standing in line, I was able to talk to her."

        "And Ken, in retrospect, how did it change your life?",
        "Well, you know, I could actually say I had seen what it was, although my experience is far less than many of my colleagues who are over there today who I keep up with by email.",
        "Yeah, it's something you don't take lightly, but if you have to do it, I am very confident that we're capable of doing it.",
        "I still don't think that our media has learned that our military power is more than just bullets.",
        "I think we do a great deal more with the services we provide and showing people the love of the American soldier.",
        "Ken, thanks very much for the call, appreciate it.",
        "All right, God bless.",
        "Also with us today, retired Marine Lieutenant Colonel Jay Stout, who flew 37 combat missions during Operation Desert Storm.",

        "Of course once folks are starting to shoot at you, you start to reconsider that attitude.",
        "Indeed.",
        "What was it like the first time you had to fly into enemy air defenses?",
        "Lt.",
        "Col.",
        "STOUT: I'll tell you, I was absolutely terrified.",
        "You'll remember the TV shots on CNN and the other networks of these great streams of anti-aircraft fire and surface-to-air missile salvos, and it was impressive to see on the TV.",
        "Now, when you're up there, again, I was so scared my stomach was upset.",
        "But I'll tell you that being a first-rate air power, the training of the United States aviators was such that my hands took over.",
        "The training was so good, I put the airplane where it needed to be, the bombs went where they were supposed to go, and I got safely back on deck.",
        "So again, I think it's important to understand that then and now, the United States taxpayer is getting quite a bit of value for their defense dollar.",
        "You spoke about getting back on deck - obviously based on one of the aircraft carriers.",
        "I think there were six in the Gulf at the time?",

        "I was actually based in Bahrain.",
        "In Bahrain.",
        "So you were flying out of one of the islands in the Gulf there, and obviously a state that was the target of Scud missiles.",
        "I wanted to ask you both: Have you ever been on the receiving end of a Scud?",
        "Oh no."

        "That was Colonel Macgregor.",
        "No, no, the Scud missiles were really designed for large, fixed targets.",
        "And in fact, the largest single loss of American life in uniform occurred when a Scud warhead fell on over 100 people near an airbase.",
        "So those kinds of weapons are not designed to attack combat troops in the field, who are generally too dispersed to make it worthwhile.",
        "Some of them were fired, though, at Bahrain.",
        "Lt.",
        "Col.",
        "STOUT: Yes, they were, and I can tell you at Shaikh Isa Air Base we were the target of a few Scuds, and the sounds of not only the Scuds but the Patriot missile batteries that engage them woke me up one night to the point where I was up in the ceiling, dug in with my nails.",

        "Hi.",
        "I was just going to comment based on the earlier discussion, about the equipment that the Iraqis, the Republican Guards were using in particular.",
        "I was in the 3rd Infantry Division, in the Seventh Corps, and I was an infantry lieutenant and a platoon leader, and I studied, you know, four years in college and a year at Fort Benning all about the equipment that the Soviets use, which was mostly what the Republican Guard had.",
        "You know, and you're scared of it.",
        "You know, you hear about the ranges and the capabilities, and the first time I saw it in person, I was really surprised at how antiquated it was.",
        "Their ballistic charts for the main guns were all kind of like riveted to the turrets, whereas we were using computerized laser range-finders, and everything in the Bradley and the Abrams tank was much more sophisticated."
