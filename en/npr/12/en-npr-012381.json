        "So I just wanted to, you know, share that thought.",
        "Well, I think that the caller makes a good point, but I would hasten to point out that we were facing equipment manned by Arabs, not Russians, not Ukrainians, East Europeans who are obviously infinitely more capable, better educated, more comfortable with technology.",
        "The Israelis tried repeatedly to tell us that we had almost nothing to fear because they knew from experience that the Arab tankers couldn't shoot anything that was more than 500 meters in front of them and they could absolutely not hit anything that moved.",
        "But again, we decided to dismiss - that is, at high levels - what the Israelis were saying, and that was a serious mistake.",
        "So again, we went into this on the assumption we were dealing with the Soviet Union.",
        "We weren't.",
        "We were dealing with an Arab army.",
        "If you were to take Jay Stout's comparison of, well, preparing 10 years to play the big game, you went in but you played the B team.",
        "Yes.",
        "Oh, I would say it was more like a high school team that was a championship team in the region playing basically second-graders.",
        "Yet the Israelis have had their setbacks from time to time with Arab armies.",
        "Ah, but they've faced a very different enemy now in Hezbollah.",
        "These were Shiites, not Sunnis, and it was very tribal, and they were extremely well-organized, well-equipped, and again, they defended very effectively after many years of preparation and training.",
        "Very different entity from what we faced, because remember, these places, our notions of a national identity, a national consciousness, don't compare with anything in that part of the world.",
        "So these armies that we faced under Saddam were by no means robust and capable."
