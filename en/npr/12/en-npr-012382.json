        "There were perhaps too many in the Gulf War.",
        "When you have an entire conflict whose whole killed total is in the hundreds, obviously the incidents of friendly fire really stuck out.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "And I think part of this was because most of the units that went in really were not trained for the kind of maneuver warfare in open areas that perhaps people 50 or 60 years ago would have understood better.",
        "You know, we were cramming thousands of troops into a front of perhaps a mile in many cases.",
        "We did not, by the way, and we didn't have any friendly fire in my particular unit.",
        "We had one man killed by the enemy and six wounded.",
        "But I think one of the reasons was we understood that just for a small unit, because of the ranges of our weapons and their lethality, you needed a lot of space.",
        "People that went into this war in most cases didn't understand that.",
        "There were too many people in too-dense formations.",
        "Jay Stout, friendly fire, if you're in an aircraft, shooting at people on the ground and dropping bombs, that's something you have to be very careful about, too.",
        "Lt.",
        "Col.",
        "STOUT: It's a huge issue, and it brings to mind an incident during the ground war, towards the end of the war.",
        "Folks on the ground were moving so quickly, our units were advancing so quickly that it was difficult to keep track of them.",
        "And we got up, my wingman and I, and absolutely savaged a column of armored vehicles along an area of Northern Kuwait, came back, were very excited, high fives all around, went to debrief intelligence.",
        "And the room got real quiet because there was a Syrian unit that was moving up there, and the Syrians, of course, used Soviet equipment just like the Iraqis did.",
        "And there for a short afternoon, we were concerned that we had obliterated a friendly unit.",
        "As it turned out, that wasn't the case.",
        "It wasn't the Syrians.",
        "It was Iraqis.",
        "But it was a very difficult afternoon for us."

        "commander, the allied commander, at the mother of all briefings, talking about a tank battle that was underway at that moment.",
        "(Unintelligible) fight that's going on with the Republican Guard right now is just a classic tank battle.",
        "You've got fire and maneuver.",
        "You've got they are continuing to fight and shoot at us as our forces move forward, and our forces are in the business of outflanking them, taking them from the rear, using our attack helicopters, using our advanced technology.",
        "I would tell you that one of the things that has prevailed, particularly in this battle out here, is our technology.",
        "Well, that battle was at a place called 73 Easting on the maps.",
        "That's why it has that title.",
        "Well, 73 Easting is a north-south gridline.",
        "And remember, you're operating in a flat, open desert.",
        "There are no villages to point to, no hills that you can speak of.",
        "So the only thing that you could call something that people might remember was by the north-south gridline where the battle occurred.",
        "And what General Schwarzkopf didn't tell everyone is that by the time we finally caught up with the rear guard of the Republican Guard Corps, the body of the Republican Guard had already escaped.",
        "We'd been held back for so many days, for so long that the enemy was largely gone.",
        "Now, the brigade that we attacked, and we attacked it with two cavalry troops in the lead, which is where I was, coming out of a sandstorm, so the visibility was very poor, and we ended up fighting at extremely close range."

        "And we devastated this unit.",
        "The battle was effectively over in a few hours.",
        "But within about 45, 50 minutes, we had destroyed, you know, dozens and dozens of tanks and armored fighting vehicles and killed at least a thousand people and we had broken the back of this defense.",
        "But once again, we were halted.",
        "There was no willingness to let us pursue the enemy, and so the opportunity to do what Colin Powell said at the beginning - to cut it off and destroy it - was missed.",
        "There was also an assessment at that time, in that same briefing that the Republican Guard was no longer capable of serious offensive military operations.",
        "Shortly after he spoke, rebellions broke out in the southern areas of Iraq by the Shias, and then later in the northern areas of Iraq by the Kurds.",
        "And the Republican Guard was reconstituted well enough to crush both of them.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "The Republican Guard escaped with most of its formations intact, contrary to popular belief, and they were re-equipped in some cases, but we know they got out with almost 700 armored fighting vehicles - tanks and other equipment.",
        "They got out with over a hundred helicopters, and so they went into action.",
        "By the way, General Schwarzkopf came back in March when he was interviewed later - this is after the tickertape parade and the suggestion of great strategic victory - and admitted that most of the enemy had actually left before we finally attacked.",
        "And it was very shortly thereafter that we began having more and more trouble with Saddam Hussein, leading all the way up to an actual offensive that he launched towards Kuwait in 1995, in the fall.",
        "And indeed, the aircraft carriers, Jay Stout, did not leave the Persian Gulf - well, I'm not sure, for another 10 years at least.",
        "No.",
        "Certainly, we maintained a presence, not only in the Gulf with aircraft carriers, but also in the region aboard - or - on several different land bases as well.",
        "The aircraft were there to enforce the so-called no-fly zones, one over northern Kuwait and southern Iraq.",
        "So as the - Saddam's helicopters could not pursue the fight against the Shia rebels, no longer kill their own people or pose a threat to Kuwait, and then in the north, to protect the Kurds.",
        "And this was an operation, well, probably the Navy - the Marine Corps and the Navy's principal operation for the next 20 years.",
        "Well, by the way, Neal, you're saying something that's very important for the American people to understand: The war never ended.",
        "In other words, we didn't win in 1991.",
        "It was a strategic failure.",
        "There were tactical successes, but no strategic victory because the Republican Guard, which was the basis for Saddam Hussein's survival, survived, and he survived.",
        "And so we ended up, essentially - at a huge expense to the American people - spending hundreds of billions of dollars for the next 12 years.",

        "And you got a much better or worse - depending on your point view - view of that, Venus, I'm sure, but it's seared in my mind, too.",
        "Yes, because communications in that area, even Central Command was out of touch for several hours on making personal calls, and my family thought I was pushing paper in Central Command when I was actually moving and giving first aid in Dhahran.",
        "But today, I've been working because there's been 135,000 of our Gulf War vets that still have an undiagnosed MS and other unusual health problems that they need to continue to follow-up with the VA all these years later.",
