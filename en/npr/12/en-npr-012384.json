        "That's the story, but I think it's important to remember how much of our history is documented in this kind of material, and if we don't save it, we're going to lose it.",
        "It's very interesting, for example, to look at the comic strips from the depression or from World War II or from the Vietnam era because we can gain sort of a sense of the time - the language, what was acceptable, what wasn't acceptable.",
        "It's amazing to me to look at World War II comics, for example, and then what we see in magazine advertising or on television today, the square inches of skin exposed now as compared to what was acceptable then is kind of amazing to think about.",
        "Cartoon art also played a large part - we say all those pictures, cartoon pictures, on the noses of aircraft that were flying over Germany and Japan.",
        "But fate intervened.",
        "The rain that had begun to fall signaled the arrival of a low pressure system.",
        "The wind shifted 180 degrees, and they began to push the Americans toward China.",
        "To their everlasting joy, they spotted the coast and bailed out with parachutes while their B-25 was still flying.",

        "Not all of Doolittle's men were so lucky.",
        "Six died, three executed after they were captured by the Japanese.",
        "But incredibly, with the help of the Chinese resistance, Doolittle and the remainder of his bombing squadron, including Lieutenant Cole, made it through the Japanese lines to Chungking in 10 days.",
        "We walked and we rode on ponies.",
        "We rode on (unintelligible) chairs.",
        "We rode on buses.",
        "We rode in cars, just about every means of transportation.",
        "For the next year, Lieutenant Dick Cole and many of the other Doolittle raiders helped keep the Chinese army alive by flying transport planes from India to China.",
        "Back in America, Doolittle's bombing raid on Tokyo made headlines across the country and boosted the morale of a very frightened nation.",
        "But Cole had no idea of all the hoopla back home, and it would be years before he knew he'd become a hero.",
        "In China, the Japanese had cut the Burmese road, and Cole and the other aviators were flying in supplies around the clock, helping Chiang Kai-shek hang on by his fingernails.",

        "This was a brave thing to do in a country where even today, people face death for questioning Islam.",
