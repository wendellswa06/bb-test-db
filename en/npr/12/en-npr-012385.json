        "Exactly.",
        "I mean, we use libraries for that.",
        "We also have a very large Manga collection - Japanese comics.",
        "So we have students who come in and read our Manga, both in Japanese and in English.",
        "And it's been kind of fun for us to learn about Manga and to build this collection.",
        "Do you have people who speak Japanese?",
        "Oh yes.",
        "I wonder.",
        "It's a research library.",
        "Obviously, you're researching the past of cartoons.",
        "Do people use your library to research various periods?",
        "Do they use it to illustrate books, for example?",
        "Oh yes, frequently.",
        "And for example, you can study the role of women in the teens or the ‘20s by looking at cartoon art, seeing how they were depicted.",
        "You could study fashion from a given period.",
        "There are all different kinds of things we can use cartoons to study as opposed to just studying the cartoons themselves.",
        "And we were talking earlier about preservation of these materials.",
        "Will they last for another hundred years?",
        "Absolutely, and I think some of you may have read Nicholson Baker's book…",
        "About the lost of newspaper archives.",
        "Right, about the loss of newspaper.",
        "And I agree with him that, unfortunately, librarians bought into this a little bit too much and dumped all of their bound newspapers in the ‘50s and ‘60s.",
        "And in fact, we now own quite a number of those, which were acquired by the San Francisco Academy of Comic Art, and its founder, Bill Blackbeard, and his friends clipped comics from those newspapers and filed them by title.",
        "So we have about 2.5-million comic-strip clippings as a result of that plus almost 800 bound volumes from the 20th century.",
        "And they're in wonderful shape.",
        "And if you want to study newspaper graphics, you really have to see those beautiful pages.",
        "Lucy Shelton Caswell, thanks very much for being with us.",

        "There's a sense among Koreans that there wasn't a proper reckoning of the colonization of Korea by Japan.",
        "And then Japan, on the flipside, had said, you know, we've done a lot of apologizing.",
        "That sort of animosity really played out in all sorts of interesting ways.",
        "For example, I got a Samsung phone in Tokyo.",
        "Samsung, obviously, is a big Korean company.",
        "And if you get a Samsung phone in Tokyo you do not see the Samsung logo on that phone at all, and part of the reason is because of the mistrust between these two countries and the people of both countries.",

        "He's been bragging for days now about how he's been leading nationally.",
        "And he talked much about a recent Monmouth University poll that puts him at 41 percent across Republicans nationwide.",
        "But this is a real test for those mainstream conservatives because this is the last debate for about a month.",
        "And if they want to get traction, especially in a state like New Hampshire, which is more favorable toward Republicans who are more in the party's traditional mainstream, this is their moment.",

        "Well, what do you think?",
        "Because it is expected that a key focus will be on national security.",
        "What do you expect will come out of that in terms of how these candidates play their cards?",
        "Most reporters and political insiders expect quite a lot of depth in this discussion on foreign policy, mostly because the moderator is Wolf Blitzer of CNN, who has some real knowledge on the issue.",
