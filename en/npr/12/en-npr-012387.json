        "Thank you, Neal.",

        "I just really - you've struck a chord.",
        "The captain, what he says is so true about the three rules of every unit.",
        "I was a military policeman in the Army, and we definitely had the guy from Poland or Polish descent, and we also had a guy from Guam.",
        "His name was Chargolof(ph).",

        "The Texan was always very proud of being Texan, and everything-big-comes-from-Texas kind of a thing.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I had to remind him all the time that, well, I'm from Alaska, and if you cut Alaska in half, Texas would still be the third-largest state to keep him in line.",
        "So, thanks so much.",
        "Oh, and then the nickname.",
        "I was Eeyore, by the way.",

        "Thank you.",
        "You, of course, Ben Tupper, served as an ETT - and again, that's one a small group of Americans serving with Afghan forces.",
        "So, yes, there was a small group of Americans in your unit.",
        "For the most part, you served in two different eastern provinces of Afghanistan.",
        "But a lot of the people you served with were Afghan troops, and they, of course, presented difficulties of their own and presented rewards of their own, too.",
        "Well, we heard earlier a cut of tape about a man you describe as Fayez, who was one of the terps, an interpreter.",
        "Yup.",
        "ETTs, on paper, were about 16 men embedded in an Afghan battalion, which could be up to 400, 500 soldiers.",
        "So we were a small element within the Afghan National Army's forces.",
        "Yes.",
        "The Afghan soldiers, you know, it was the best of times, it was the worst of times.",
        "You had people who were unpredictable, who were brave, whose bravery bordered on insanity, who would let you down at critical moments and who would do incredible acts of sacrifice and valor the next moment.",
        "Add to that the language barrier, the cultural barriers, be they religion, be they pork consumption, be they don't make the mistake that I made of showing a Afghan soldier a picture of my wife and asking him to show me a picture of his, a big no-no amongst young Afghan men.",
        "Things that really as well, or as much as the United States military tried to prepare us for this embedding role, they couldn't, and we made a lot of mistakes along the way."

        "They're shooting at the bad guys, too.",
        "But it was a very challenging situation, just with all those, language, religion, tactics, cultural things that made it a fascinating job.",
        "And, you know, I always jokingly when people said what was it like?",
        "I'd say it was like the Peace Corps with guns, because that's what it was like.",
        "It was cultural immersion.",
        "I learned so much about the Afghan people, their religion, the food -everything.",
        "I left there feeling like I was a little bit Afghan, and it was a wonderful experience.",
        "You know, aside from the people getting hurt and the loss of friends, both Afghan and American, it was a wonderful experience.",
        "We mentioned earlier \"\"Pop-Tarts and POO,\"\" which is a chapter, one of your essays.",
        "POO stands for point of origin, and a lot of your missions were to go out and find out the point of origin where Taliban had fired usually, what, 107-millimeter rockets at somebody?",
        "Correct.",
        "Yup.",
        "They had a tendency in Ghazni Ghazni's pretty much where we did a lot of these POO missions.",
        "They would launch these rockets just willy-nilly into the city, you know, which is a pretty dastardly thing to do.",
        "But we'd be then tasked - we being a couple ETTs, a couple Americans, usually me and Corporal Polanski - would get in a Humvee and go out with, you know, a company of Afghan soldiers, 60 to 100 soldiers, looking for where these rockets were launched from.",
        "And it's pretty neat.",
        "I won't get into all the details, but based on the crater analysis, you can kind of get an idea of where they came from and go try to find it.",
        "And when you find it, you find all the other forensic clues that are left behind, or you may actually find other caches of rockets.",
        "Or best-case scenario, you may find the Taliban sitting around there having chai and catch them flat-footed.",
        "The hardest part sorry, go ahead.",
        "I was just going to say, on this particular mission you describe, though, roads don't run straight in Ghazni.",
        "Indeed, they aren't really roads as much as we would recognize them.",
        "And you go from village to village and talk to the elders, and they say no, nobody sees anything, nobody sees anything, nobody sees anything.",
        "And you're at the last village that you're going to go to before sundown, and you have an inspiration as you're sitting there eating a blueberry Pop-Tart.",
        "I do.",
        "It was more of a copout because I was tired of walking into all these villages, and I knew what the answer I would get.",
        "Standard experience in Afghanistan is with the ANA, which is very well-liked among the general population, respected force.",
        "The Afghan soldiers show up in a village with me and, you know, Corporal Polanski in tow, and we got a warm even in areas that were very heavily populated by Taliban, we would still get a warm welcome."

        "And the village elders will be a little more reserved, and they'll sit back and wait for you to go address them.",

        "They're not as tuned into the fact that the Taliban have all sorts of nasty reprisals for people who cooperate or who may be considered, you know, to give information to the Afghan army or to us.",
        "Kids are more innocent, and, you know, they wanted a Pop-Tart.",

        "It was the neck stem of a human spine, blasted 150 meters in the air from the site of a suicide bombing minutes earlier.",
        "The events were fairly easy to reconstruct.",

        "No.",
        "And, you know, I'm no role model as to how the right way to do it was at that time.",
        "The regulations were kind of vague.",
        "And at varying levels of my chain of command, I had a lot of support for what I was writing and I had people who were more concerned that I was going to, you know, reveal some operational security aspect and, you know, put somebody at risk, which is a thing I always worried about.",
        "And I think it's common sense everybody who writes should be worried about OPSEC.",
        "But I had - I lived in a really gray area, and I had been doing the commentaries for NPR.",
        "I'd just been writing them and sending them in.",
        "I didn't ask permission.",
        "I didn't run them through any chain of command of any sort.",

        "So we really felt kind of out there.",
        "And I didn't have a problem just shooting stuff right up to NPR because I knew what I was telling, the stories I was telling were not propaganda.",
        "They were not - they weren't anything except really sad and exciting and important, I thought, moments that were occurring in the war that I thought that people needed to know about.",
        "And no offense to my brothers and sisters who've served in Iraq, but we in Afghanistan always felt like we were the bastard stepchild and that it was a forgotten war and that we were heavily under-funded and unsupported to the degree that we felt necessary to accomplish the mission there.",
        "And I think that's played out as evidenced by the fact that the Taliban is so resurgent now.",
        "But that one - the one story that you just played an excerpt from, the problem with that from the two-star level that was running Afghanistan at that time was it ran contrary to the image that was being presented to the message that was out there called a command message - of the progress in Afghanistan and of the building and of the focus on reconstruction, which are all important parts to what was happening in Afghanistan.",
        "But they didn't want to hear nor did they want to be broadcast or highlighted the violence and the tragedies that were also occurring hand in hand with that.",
        "So I got fussed at for including that vignette about the suicide bomber and specifically the Afghan soldier who kicked the suicide bomber's heart."
