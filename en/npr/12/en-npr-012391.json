        "I think he was on the last commercially scheduled flight out of Saigon.",
        "But I - he's done very well for himself over here.",
        "He's - in fact, he went back to Vietnam in 2003 to live and work teaching English and to experience his motherland country, and is still there and married with two children.",
        "I think part of the controversy about the baby lift can come from the fact that even though she says that the Amerasian kids were not harmed by the communists, we - when we went back on our first trip in 2003, we had two biracial girls - black American fathers and Vietnamese mothers -with us on the tour.",
        "And they encountered hostility at the airport when we checked into Saigon.",
        "In fact, one of the customs people there said you're not Vietnamese.",
        "And so I think part of the consternation about taking children out, some of it - I think Mary Nelle was right, and here's a big shout out to you, Mary Nelle.",
        "We've met her a couple of times.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "That some of these children I think would have died, if not probably at the hands of the government, certainly due to neglect, disease and whatever.",
        "And I'm really sorry that there were children who were let out without paperwork so that they could've been reunited with their mothers.",
        "But as she says, I think at that time in Saigon, everything was just totally pandemonium.",
        "Dana Sachs?",
        "That's right.",
        "It was total pandemonium.",
        "As far as the Amerasian children, I agree with you.",
        "They had - generally speaking, they had really, really difficult lives.",
        "I'm just - I'm trying to make a distinction between the rumors that were circulating among the birth mothers before the communists arrived, and that - those kind of rumors were just horrible, what - the kind of brutality that would be put upon these children, you know, their livers ripped out and eaten.",
        "And this -it was the kind of thing that put these women into total panic.",
        "And I think it...",
        "He is right.",
        "We've seen reports in the years since that Amerasian children in Vietnam were discriminated against.",
        "They weren't murdered.",
        "They were.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Right, right.",
        "I think, though, that a number of these women now who gave up their children, if they had known that there would be discrimination versus having their children murdered, they might have settled for discrimination and keeping their children with them.",
        "Roger, is your son doing - your adopted son doing well?",
        "Yes, he is.",
        "He's teaching at an Australian university in Saigon right now and is planning on coming back to the U.S.",
        "next year with his family.",

        "What happened in this case was that in the 1990s, maybe 10 or 15 years after, after the war ended, Vietnam began to open up to the West a little bit, and a group of these birth mothers took their documents that they had from their children and began wandering the streets of Da Nang, and when they saw a Westerner, they'd go up to them and say: These are my documents.",

        "And he said: I'll see what I can do.",

        "Mostly I think yes, but sometimes, when my child was younger and would look at Indian women with such sadness, I wonder, and when I see her struggle with the high expectations of a middle-class American family, where she is learning impaired, I sometimes think being a wife and mother there would be, if not better, at least easier in some profound way.",
