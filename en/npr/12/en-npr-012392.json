        "And I was incredibly moved by that and humbled by it as well, and I would have to echo your earlier caller's remarks about Vietnam being an incredible country with (unintelligible) the people are incredible and people shouldn't miss out if they ever have the opportunity.",
        "Thanks very much for that, John, appreciate the phone call.",
        "It's been interesting.",
        "Just the past few weeks, there's a lot of Babylift adoptees who are returning to Vietnam, and I've been sort of keeping up with it on Facebook.",
        "They're posting all the time, and a lot of them, as the caller said, have been doing charitable work, and some are trying to find their birth families, and they're traveling around the country.",
        "And it's so it's really heartwarming to read their posts and hear what kind of experiences they're having, which generally seem to be completely positive.",
        "Yet as welcoming as the Vietnamese will be, those people are no longer truly Vietnamese.",
        "Well, that's something that they have been dealing with their whole lives.",
        "I mean, what is their identity?",
        "They sometimes, you know, they say that inside they feel like they're Americans or whatever nationality they've been raised in, but on the outside they look Vietnamese, but they're certainly not considered Vietnamese by the Vietnamese, or not exactly in the same way.",
        "Yeah, so it's there is no home to return to in some profound way.",
        "I think they they're trying to figure out what their relationship with Vietnam is now and maybe forging something new out of that.",
        "Let's get another caller in on the conversation.",

        "Hi, Maggie, go ahead, please.",
        "Hi.",
        "Hey, I had the chance to go on a medical mission to Haiti in 1996, and I happened to be visiting an orphanage, and I asked the man who runs all those operations down there: How do you feel about us Americans thinking about adopting your Haitian children?",
        "And he said better any life than no life at all.",
        "And if you've ever visited an orphanage in any of those countries, you realize that they will have no life if they stay.",
        "If they leave, he said, you know, my ideal is that someone would take one of these children, educate them in America, but give them pride in their homeland, and maybe they could come back and actually help us lead the country, that we're so desperate for people to be raised and have the opportunity to get the skills to be able to lead.",
        "And so I'm all for international adoption.",
        "And Dana Sachs, you wrote a piece that was also published in the paper that raised some of the same questions raised by Operation Babylift, raised again after the earthquake in Haiti.",
        "Yeah, I mean, I think again the big danger is when there's some kind of disaster or war, losing children out in a panic and just saying, okay, we've got to get them out right now because - whatever, they're going to die or whatever, you know, they're going to be in some kind of danger.",
        "I think I was impressed by the way that the Haitian government and the U.S.",
        "government handled the scandals as they erupted with the children in Haiti recently, because they said we have to take our time with this, and instead of immediately putting the children that were taken out of Haiti into adoptive homes, as soon as questions came up, they put them into a foster situation with Haitian caregivers and just said let's slow it down and figure out what's going on here.",
        "These were questions about whether they were truly orphans.",
        "Right, right, right.",
        "And Maggie's point, though, that maybe these children, if they're truly orphans and stranded in a place like well, not stranded - if they're growing up in poverty in a place like Haiti, or you can name any number of other countries around the world, that they would have an opportunity to come here, get educated, or go to Canada or wherever, and have an opportunity to return to their country to provide that educated elite that is so sorely needed."

        "Well, we are I mean, I think that's exactly what we're seeing in Vietnam right now with the Babylift adoptees going back and trying to sort of figure out what their relationship is there, and they're I wouldn't say they're taking a leadership role in Vietnam, but they're taking a kind of visionary role of trying to do something for the people there.",
        "They're going to orphanages, and they're really thinking about these issues from a very personal point of view.",
        "So yeah, I mean that's possible.",
        "It's hard to see them going back and being, you know, normal members of Vietnamese society, but maybe it's a new group of people that can contribute to their country.",

        "Seven years ago, I returned with my adopted brother to the small village in which he was born.",
        "Seeing young men of an age similar to my brother's, I was amazed at how different and how much more difficult his life would have been.",
        "There may be controversy today, but here's one American who thanks God his brother arrived here 35 years ago.",
        "I've certainly heard that a lot, and I think, I think particularly the children who were clearly homeless, I think that their situation is it seems much better.",
        "It seems like they've had a very, very good and positive experience by growing up overseas and being able to go back to their homeland.",
        "The complicated situations are in these maybe 20 percent where they had family in Vietnam that gave them up out of a panic, and so there were families torn apart, and those situations are really pretty heartbreaking.",
        "You also point out that these were even the tip of the iceberg is giving it too much credit.",
        "There were maybe 900,000 quote-unquote orphans in Vietnam in 1975, the vast majority of whom were in the care of extended families in their villages."

        "But the situation was really helped by the fact that Vietnamese were taking in children.",
        "They were the ones who were really to the extent that anyone was dealing with the problem of homeless children or children in need, it was the Vietnamese themselves taking them in, child by child and family by family.",
