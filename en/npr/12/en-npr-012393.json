        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But he mentioned that on the tour, there were two Amerasian -well, they're adults now - there with him, and he said they were basically discriminated against.",
        "They were told that, you know, they weren't Vietnamese.",
        "So my question to your guest is, is there a difference in the discrimination between children who are half Asian and half American depending on the color of the father?",
        "If the father is a black American or if he is a Caucasian American.",
        "Is there a difference?",

        "They've seen less of that.",
        "And they do discriminate more against children who are of African-American descent than the Caucasian ones.",
        "And there was a lot more concern during the Babylift for those kids, that those African-American, Amerasian kids would be taken out of the country because of that.",
        "And I think when they go back, they feel it too.",
        "It's just - it's very strange to Vietnamese.",

        "And then we also have a nephew who is adopted from Russia.",
        "And the comment of is a child better off in an economically developed country of wealth or the poverty in which they were born, that is not the issue.",
        "The issue is the birth mother making the best decision that she can make in that moment of whether she can parent that child or not.",
        "And we really just have to support those birth mothers when they make those decisions because they're doing the best they can with what they have in front of them.",
        "I totally agree with you.",
        "I think that this is something that adoption agencies and the governments that are involved in adoption need to really, really focus on because there's a lot of problems with the ways that the birth mothers are given information.",
        "There was just a case out of Vietnam a few weeks ago where birth parents in some village up in the mountains were told that their children were being taken to the coast - down to the coast for school and that they'd be back in a few years well-educated and those children were sent overseas for adoption.",
        "So those women were making - they were making the best decisions that they could make.",
        "And who wouldn't make a decision like that?",
        "But the information that they got was wrong.",
        "Right.",
        "And that's the responsibility of our government when we (unintelligible).",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "Now they can't do that unless you agreed to it.",
