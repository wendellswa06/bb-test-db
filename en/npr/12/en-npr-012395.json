        "People don't realize how often we consume and use our credit without thinking about it.",

        "And I use Biblical principles as how to encourage people to just think about how they're using their money.",
        "And do you feel like the - we talked about this last time, but just to reinforce - do you feel like the lessons are salient or useful without the Biblical parts of it?",
        "Sure you can.",
        "I mean, if you don't believe in that, you can still follow the fast.",
        "This is what I believe in and I, you know, was inspired to write the book because of the ministry that I developed at my church and so, that's why I took that path.",
        "But people who are not religious had been buying the book and following the fast.",
        "I mean, you know, I'm not going to force you to pray",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",

        "I withdrew $150 cash to use for 21 days.",
        "I was amazed at how long lasted by not going to fast food joints, buying extra items at the grocery store and just staying in.",
        "It was great seeing my bank balance stay the same all month instead of dwindling.",
        "It's my new way of living.",
        "Oh, wonderful, wonderful.",
        "That's so good.",
        "And I like that she said she took the cash out.",
        "And the thing about it - what happens is when you use the cash, you're less likely to spend that money because it's a visual clue, like, you know, you've got 150, now it's down for 125 and now it's down to 25, and you stop.",
        "When you're using plastic, even a debit card, you're just swiping and swiping and you're not thinking about it.",
        "And many people find themselves upside down every month.",
        "They're spending more than they're bringing in.",
        "My guest is Michelle Singletary.",

        "Yeah.",
        "You know, it's so interesting you talk about that.",
