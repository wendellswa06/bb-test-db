        "You know, I've always said the biggest code of silence, to me, has not been law enforcement or the street.",
        "It's been the church.",
        "And where has our voice been as a conscience to society?",
        "Where's our voice been confronting the neglected and the throwaways that some people have meant to feel in our communities?",
        "Where have we been demanding that corporate America and government step up and stop ignoring and abandoning whole communities and whole groups of people who are poor?",
        "So the church in my mind is at a, you know - it's really at a crossroads.",
        "Either the church is going to begin to become vocal and become a moral voice again or the church is going to become irrelevant.",
        "Well, one faith leader who certainly hasn't been quiet about this issue is the Reverend Jesse Jackson.",
        "He's been leading various civil rights organizations in Chicago and across the country since the 1960s.",
        "I asked him why murder rates in many other U.S.",
        "cities have been trending down, but going up in Chicago.",
        "I'm not sure what makes one community relatively less dangerous or less volatile than another community.",
        "But the fact of the matter is people there deserve livable wages.",
        "They're the working poor.",
        "West Garfield Park, for example - $10,000 per capita income, 4 percent of the residents live in poverty, unemployment rate is above 25 percent.",
        "There are eight such communities where you have guns and drugs and jobs out, and violent conditions breed violent and desperate behavior.",
        "You know - and I hope you don't take offense at this - but we also called Dr. Carl Bell, whom I'm sure you know.",
        "A brilliant physician.",
        "Your brother and your brother's administration gave us Barack Obama.",
        "You know what?",

        "He kept us safe.",
        "Well, I don't think African-Americans are taking full advantage of political opportunities, but I understand why we're not.",
        "Because a lot of us--and this isn't just true of African-Americans; it's true of all kinds of citizens in America--are checking out, not just to the political process but of civic life itself.",
        "We don't think it matters.",
        "We've had more than one political outcome, which was not in our best interest.",
        "And, frankly, I think the political class or the political establishment has mostly perfected a conversation about how to win and not why.",
        "I think, in particular, I'm feeling frustrated--and I'm a Democrat, but I'm feeling frustrated with the Democratic Party because it seems to me we've perfected that conversation with each other about how to win.",
        "Everybody else wants to know why.",
        "And while we have that conversation, there is a much more negative, much more hurtful vision of government which has been spreading, not the vision that government can do anything--everything for everyone.",
        "Nobody believes that, but the vision that government is bad rather than government is us, and that's a vision, frankly, I think was on display in the Gulf Coast after Katrina, and good people were ashamed of what they saw, and I think rightly so."

        "But I've been saying, Ed, to people, `You need to remember that those folks abandoned on those rooftops after Katrina were abandoned before that storm.",
        "And the middle class who--were one month away from being just like them and deeply anxious about that, who have been waiting for the Democratic Party to make up its mind about what it is we stand for.",
        "So I do sense very broad frustration, very broad skepticism among African-Americans and other Americans about the political process.",
        "And one of the reasons I'm in this race here in Massachusets is because I want to recapture a sense of community, of shared responsibility, politically and otherwise, because I think if we don't turn that around, we are in very, very deep trouble.",
        "Let me ask you this about the political landscape for you personally.",
        "Gubernatorial races have over the last 20 years become where they used to be very local for the state.",
        "They become very national.",

        "You still have to go against the attorney general there for the nomination.",

        "Well, I think the party has been courteous here in Massachusetts.",
        "It's been encouraging, but it has also been, I think, appropriately neutral because it's a contested primary and they don't want to pick sides until we have a nominee.",
        "And we won't have a nominee until the September primary.",
        "So there's a long period between here and there.",
        "I think that the more exclusive group, if you will, is not the party per se; it's the political establishment which, in many respects, are non-partisan.",
        "These are the folks who are heads of this and that, many of whom are my friends I've known for a long time, as I have the incumbent attorney general.",
        "We have lots of friends in common.",
        "But these are the folks who believe that they get to say whose turn it is to run.",
        "They have to, I think, bear some responsibility for running the same old unsuccessful play over and over and over again.",
        "Do you get the sense from those people--and we all know every state has their powerbrokers.",
        "Do you get the sense that they're saying while staying as neutral as possible, that it may be--I'll underline that--time for an African-American to have an opportunity and chance at this?",
        "I think, frankly, what I get from a lot of them is that my politics are their politics.",
        "I'd be the better candidate and I'd be the better governor.",
        "But it's really someone else's turn.",
        "And I think the problem with that is that the people who need a change, the ones who can't wait, aren't a part of that conversation.",
        "The establishment have all the options and all the influence and connections to protect their interests, frankly, no matter who is in power from whatever party.",
        "But everybody else, in my view, is the responsibility of the chief executive, and that's the responsibility I'm looking to assume.",
        "And what of those who are not the powerbrokers?",
        "One has to start to lay the seeds, if you will, particularly in one's own community.",
        "Are you seeing excitement from the African-American community as a collective in Massachusetts?",
        "And, again, as we grow this countrywide, are you hearing and seeing from African-Americans in other states who are excited about this possibility?",
        "Well, Ed, you're exactly right about how important it is to do the state work.",
        "We're building a very grassroots campaign.",
        "We have about 2,500 volunteers and we continue to add to that every week.",
        "And, frankly, I don't think--while I may never catch the attorney general in his fund-raising, he's been at it for three-and-a-half years, he will never catch us on the ground.",
        "And that's where this campaign will be won.",
        "I have much, much more work to do to introduce myself and to build a volunteer base and a base of activists in black and brown communities here in Massachusetts, and we're working on that.",
        "In fact, I'm going to be in an event shortly, the beginning of a series of neighborhood town halls, if you will.",
        "I've been visiting churches and so forth.",
        "There's also been a tremendous amount of support and excitement that has come from black people around the country, including many of my colleagues in the Clinton administration who, led by Secretary Alexis Herman, from the Labor Department, have organized to help raise money and raise awareness about the campaign.",
        "Well, it will be interesting to watch as many African-Americans like yourself and Kwesi Mfume and others, Mr. Steele, look for statewide office and see how it all plays out, and we'll continue to watch this.",
