        "Well, there's a few things that the National Hurricane Center has been looking at.",
        "Understand when we're in the plane, we see, like, one little piece of the puzzle, and we get that information back to the Hurricane Center.",
        "We're actually transmitting the data we're collecting in real time via satellite to the Hurricane Center and to the National Weather Service for their models.",
        "But the Hurricane Center is looking at our piece of data and a lot of other data, and according to what they're stating right now, first of all, the storm appears to be starting what we call an eye wall cycle, meaning you have this little doughnut in the middle which is where the strongest winds are, the eye wall, and at some point with strong storms, you start to form an outer ring around it.",
        "Once you form that, it starts to choke out the inner ring and the strength of the storm can go down one or even two categories for a period of time.",
        "Then the outer ring starts to contract and it can strengthen again.",
        "That's one thing that appears to be starting.",
        "Also, when we were flying in the plane, we saw a substantial amount of dry air, to be expected, coming off the continent to the northwest of the storm.",
        "And if you were following it on the infrared satellite, you could see the cloud tops on the west, if you had the colored ones, go from red to more like orange and less intense colors.",
        "So I believe it's sucking in that dry air and that's also starting to weaken the storm.",
        "We just don't exactly how much.",
        "Brings up a final question here.",
        "When we see the storm--you mentioned the colors--it is red, it is yellow, it is orange.",
        "Right, of course.",
        "That's just the color-enhanced infrared.",
