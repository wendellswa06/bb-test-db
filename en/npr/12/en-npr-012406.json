        "That represents an effect that the average person would see the ad about five times.",

        "So, the reality is there has been this arms race escalation.",
        "But, again, that's not the only thing that money gets spent on.",
        "It gets spent on a whole variety of activities that campaigns undertake.",
        "And, again, each one has a role.",
        "There's somebody in the campaign advocating for teach one of those activities, saying: You know what?",
        "This could make a 10-vote difference, a 20-vote difference, a 50-vote difference.",
        "And it's very hard to say absolutely not, won't make any difference at all.",
        "Yes.",
        "And, Steve, you're right.",
        "I mean, you don't want to be the guy on the campaign who said, you know, let's hold off on that last million dollars in Ohio and then lose by 200 votes.",
        "You know, sometimes, we don't even get the gross-rating points that Mark's talking about because what we're really trying to do is affect the media narrative, create an overall impression, an overall narrative that stitches together the story that you're trying to tell.",
        "You're saying that you put out an ad, and whether one million people see it, 10 million people see it or hardly anybody even remembers it, at least the reporters will be aware that you're putting out this particular message, and it will seep into their story somewhere.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "I mean, sometimes, we just put out an ad, and it'll only be up for a day.",
        "And we knew that it wouldn't get seen by voters, but it would get coverage by reporters.",
        "But look what's happened with the Obama campaign and the attacks on Romney with respect to his stewardship of Bain Capital and the decisions, the business decisions he made that ended up hurting a lot of average folks: a lot of crossfire in the press about that - some from a few Democrats, some from reporters, editorialists, others.",
        "But you see where those ads have actually been on the air in swing states, it's made a difference.",
        "It's really damaged Mitt Romney's image, and it's helped Obama take the lead in some of those important swing states.",
        "So, again, an example where the media didn't necessarily pick up on the narrative the way the campaign would have liked, but the ads themselves did make some measurable difference.",
        "And I would just add to that, that that Bain story is the narrative that Obama campaign is trying to establish, and they've done a pretty effective job of it.",
        "And they've done it by spending very heavily, very early.",
        "And that's when you can have the most impact, which is exactly what we did against John Kerry in 2004.",
        "So, is there a real possibility that President Obama, an incumbent president - and incumbents usually have plenty of resources - is there a real possibility he could be outspent this fall?",
        "Well, I think there's a real possibility.",
        "We don't know for sure yet, obviously.",
        "There's several months yet to go of fundraising.",
        "But it is possible that that in the aggregate, when you take all this billionaire money and add it to what's actually being raised by the campaigns, it is possible the president gets outspent.",
        "It's absolutely possible.",
        "And just to give you an example of how distorted things are, Steve: The Koch brothers, by themselves, will spend more money in this election cycle than the entire presidential campaign of John McCain in 2008.",
        "That's a lot of money."

        "But, again, I would argue very hard to know today, in a race that's very close, could those extra 5, 10, 20, $50 million make a difference of a few hundred votes in a few states that make all the difference at the end of the day?",
        "The answer is, yes, they could.",
        "We won't really know until after Election Day just how much influence they had.",
        "I mean, it could come down to, you know, three electoral votes in a, you know, a state like New Mexico.",

        "The population is part of it, but the other parts in my mind really have to do with how we use water and how we manage water, and so I think dealing with all three of those components, you know, the population side, the consumption side, and how well we manage it is really going to be really important as we move forward on this issue."
