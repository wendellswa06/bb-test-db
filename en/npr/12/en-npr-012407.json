        "Do you think that we could have enough water if we manage it better?",
        "I think we absolutely could have enough water if we manage it better.",
        "If you look at the statistics globally, for example, you know, we've got five to ten times more water than we would need to satisfy the basic needs of the human population.",
        "Now having said that, a lot of that water's not accessible to us.",
        "It's in places where people don't live, where we don't grow crops.",
        "So it's not all available to us.",
        "But the point is, if we get more serious about valuing water for all of its uses and begin to use it more wisely and a lot more productively, I think we could meet the basic needs of all people on the planet and, very importantly, begin to restore some of the aquatic ecosystems that have taken a bad hit from our past approaches to water management.",
        "Let me just back up for a second because there are so many issues here to talk about.",
        "Name for me one or two of the major wastages of water, the practices that waste water, that you think should be managed better.",
        "Well, we have to start really with agriculture, which is by far and away the biggest consumer of water on the planet in terms of human activities.",
        "About 70 percent of all the water that we're extracting from rivers, from lakes, from underground aquifers, goes to grow crops, and food production is a very, very water-intensive activity.",
        "It takes about a thousand tons of water to grow one ton of grain, and that's not accounting for any inefficiencies in irrigation, just the amount of water that the crop needs to grow - about a thousand tons per ton of grain.",
        "So it's a lot of water.",
        "Now having said that, there's a lot of inefficiency built into our food system.",
        "We have very inefficient irrigation practices.",
        "You know, a lot of farmers are still irrigating the way farmers did centuries and centuries ago.",
        "And so there's a lot of updating we can do to make irrigation more efficient.",
        "One of the most efficient practices we have in irrigation is called drip irrigation.",
        "It's a very efficient way of getting water to crops.",
        "You go right to the roots where there's minimal evaporation and minimal losses of water.",
        "And we find that you can double or triple crop per drop of water of you move from more conventional irrigation to this more efficient drip irrigation.",
        "That's just one example of the potential for efficiency to help us do better in agriculture.",
        "The other thing is looking at where we grow crops and how appropriate the crops we're growing are to the climate in which they're grown.",
        "We're growing some very thirsty crops in some very dry places.",
        "So there's a lot we could do to increase water productivity by shifting the crop base to more appropriate climates.",
        "See, now I would have thought that all these lawns and golf courses and things would be soaking up a lot more water than agriculture, but you seem to say that it's even more in the planting.",
        "Well, if you look at the three major sectors of water use globally - agriculture, industry and cities and municipalities - the breakdown is roughly like this: 70 percent goes to ag, about 20 percent to industry, and 10 percent to cities and municipalities.",
        "So watering lawns and watering golf courses fits under that 10 percent that's going to cities and municipalities.",
        "But that's also a very important 10 percent because it's a very concentrated demand.",
        "If you think about cities around the world, you've got a lot of people living in a very small geographic area in some cases, which puts a lot of strain on the rivers, lakes, groundwater aquifers, that are supplying those cities.",
        "UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Speaking Spanish).",
        "Lawn watering has become one of the biggest increased uses of water, particularly in parts of the United States as we suburbanize.",
        "More and more water is going to irrigate lawns.",
        "If you look at domestic water uses in much of the West, and even increasingly in the East, a large share - often 50 percent or more in the western states - domestically, is going to irrigate green lawns.",
        "So we need to ask, is that a productive use of water when we have rivers running dry, lakes beginning to shrink, fish going extinct, and so on.",
        "And I think the answer is probably not.",
        "And so a big new frontier in water conservation really needs to take place outdoors."

        "Brent Haddad, she seems to be describing all the kinds of things that go on, you know, go on in California with water shortages, and this is something that's been going on for quite a while out there.",
        "Has it not?",
        "Well, millions of years.",
        "One of the things that you mentioned earlier - Sandra and also Linda Jacobsen - was how the population continues to grow.",
        "And out here, out west we're seeing that very intensively, and yet at the same time as a nation, our overall water use hasn't changed that much over the past 20, 25 years, it's just inching up.",
        "And so one of the ways that we've been able to adapt is that we're using water more intensively.",
        "As we conserve water, the water we are using just carries more of the load.",
        "And what that means is we have bigger issues with the quality of the water once it's been used.",
        "And I think that drives us to this question of how are we going to treat that water that we've already used - that's passed through a farmer's field or passed through a city - and get even more use out of it.",
        "And it sort of moves us to a technological perspective on what kind of opportunities are available to meet future water needs.",
        "Well, tell us about some of them.",
        "What kinds of technologies will help you recycle, re-use this dirty water?",
        "Well, there's - the two basic categories are desalination and water reclamation and reuse, and they use overlapping actual technologies to achieve their goals.",
        "What they amount to is, after various earlier treatments, pushing water through it a membrane that lets the clean water through and blocks the pollutants from following.",
        "And so those technologies take a lot of energy because you're forcing water through that membrane.",
        "But at the same time they produce water that is reusable for anything really, from agriculture use or public irrigation, all the way up to drinking or high tech uses.",
        "Mmm-hmm.",
        "Does turning what was an agriculture area into housing change the water needs.",
        "Or, is it just the same kind of you know - it's the same water supply that you need.",
        "Well it turns out that if you're transitioning from farmland to suburbia at least out west here it's just the same water use for both uses.",
        "And you can imagine that by thinking well, there's a whole lot of grassland that's surrounding the houses and so they're going to be irrigated the same way a crop would be, and then inside the house itself, there's the family uses.",
        "So it's just about the same.",
        "You don't get a big gain if you transition from ag to housing in terms of land use.",
        "I was surprised to hear you say at that beginning that over the last decades that - did I hear you say the volume of water has not changed?",
        "No."

        "The amount of water being used?",
        "Yes, we use about 400 billion gallons of water per day in the United States, and that's a figure that really hasn't shifted that much since the mid 80s.",
        "There have been transitions within that figure, and the major transition has been the increase in urban water use.",
        "But our population has grown so why does that demand not go up?",
        "Because we're becoming much more efficient in the water we use.",
        "The cities - especially out west, but Florida as well and in the Southeast - urban uses have become so much more efficient that the per capita use has gone down over that same period of time.",

        "I've heard Californians tell me that there are now going to be importing water from Canada?",

        "Well, I think that if we try to do that the Canadians will be building the same fence on their border that we're trying to build on ours down south.",

        "Mmm-hmm.",
        "So where will you get the extra water you need for growth?",
        "Are you saying if we that technology - the technology fix will allow you to stretch the water you have now?",
        "There's a few things that we can do, and in fact, cities throughout the West - and in fact state and federal government as well - are starting to pay close attention to these options.",
        "We're only using about 8 percent of the wastewater that we generate in the U.S.",
        "- this is urban wastewater.",
        "We're only reusing about 8 percent of that.",
        "If you think about it, this is water that was treated to the point of being drinkable - the highest quality water.",
        "It passed through the city and now it's coming out, and it has the city waste in it.",
        "But it doesn't have the heavy salt content, it doesn't have a lot of other problems with it that you start out say with ocean water or brackish water from underground.",
        "And so we are only using about 8 percent of it now, so there is an opportunity there.",
        "And then we also have what I mentioned these brackish ground water sources, where in the past we thought - we used to call those saline sinks.",
        "In other words, forget about it, there is water there, it's lost, don't even think about it.",
        "But now we're realizing that, depending on how you use that water, it actually is cost effective to set up a desal plant and bring that water into use."

        "I was wondering if you start - if they start taking water from abundant places, how would they be able to transport it and get it to the places where needed, say, California and that area of America?",
        "Yes, how would you - how do you move a - you know we talk about people buying electricity and selling it on from state to state, can you do that with water?",
        "Well, I think that we really can't think of electricity and water as the same here because the water is needed in every state.",
        "You might argue not so much Alaska, but it's so expensive to move water that what I think is happening is that we're relying by and large on our existing infrastructure, and California has more of it than any other place on earth.",
        "So we can move water about 400 miles in California, but I think it's unrealistic to think that Alaska water will ever serve the needs of people in Los Angeles.",

        "Yes, Dr. Postel.",
        "One of the ways - one of the primary ways we actually move water around the world is in the form of grain.",
        "That's really how we trade water.",
        "Some of us in the water business call it virtual water, for that reason - call grain virtual water for that reason.",
        "Because it is so expensive and so unwieldy to move water, what we do move is the thing that's most intensive to produce with water which is food.",
        "And so if you look at a country like Egypt for example, it's importing half of its food, not because it's short of land but because it's short of water.",
        "And so increasingly, as countries become more stressed in their water supplies, they turn to the international grain market to help balance their internal water budget.",
        "And we're seeing more and more countries begin to do this.",
        "So one of the ways water scarcity will play out in the world is through the international grain market, which over time will impact grain prices and all kinds of things.",
        "So, that's really going to be the way, I think, we balance water budgets, is through the grain trade.",

        "And people that have looked at India carefully with regard to water suggest that as much as 25 percent of their food supply is now produced with water that is being over-pumped from underground aquifers.",
        "So that's kind of a bubble in their food economy that is going to have to burst at some point.",
        "And what happens then is they'll look - like China is already beginning to do and like other water stressed countries - to international grain markets to help meet their food needs.",
