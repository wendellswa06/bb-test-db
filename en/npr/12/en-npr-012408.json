        "Yeah.",
        "I think, you know, part of what's gone in the West - and not just the West, but elsewhere - is, you know, a tendency to underprice water and for governments to subsidize very, very large water projects that bring water to these populations where I think we're all suggesting maybe it's just unsustainable from a resource standpoint.",
        "So some of the very large water projects, like the Central Arizona Project, like the Central Utah Project, like moving water from Northern California down to Los Angeles, has encouraged this growth.",
        "So I think it's not entirely by accident that it's happened.",
        "There's been a policy to subsidize water for a very, very long time.",
        "And so I think one of the things we need to look at is to bring our water policies up to date and to recognize that water now is becoming increasingly scarce.",
        "There's competition for it - not just between cities and farms and industries - but between human uses and the environment that supports everything else.",
        "And so I think an update of our water policies, and pricing, and regulations is really critical to begin to move toward a more sustainable picture of water down the line.",
        "And that line can't be too far off.",
        "I mean, we're seeing so many signs of unsustainable use - rivers running dry, aquifers being depleted - that those transitions need to happen quite soon.",
        "You know, we should have those bottled water people start supplying the water.",
        "Then you'd conserve it.",
        "It's costing more than gasoline.",
        "Talking about technology, I want to bring in Jerry Maxwell.",
        "He's the general manager of Tampa Bay Water in Tampa Bay, Florida.",
        "Now, we talked about new technologies that may help alleviate water shortages, and among Tampa Bay's resources for water is the U.S.'s largest facility for desalination or desalinization - depending on which way you'd like to talk about it - and that is taking the salt out of the ocean water."

        "It's very much more expensive, and that gets to an earlier point that was made about are we undervaluing water?",
        "We've undertaken a program to reduce our reliance on groundwater in favor of the environment by 100 million gallons a day.",
        "And we've done that by diversifying our supply, using both fresh surface water as well as desalinated seawater.",
        "And we will achieve that objective this year, and that has increased the wholesale cost of water by more than two times.",
        "The judgment made by the public policy-makers at Tampa Bay Water is that that's part of our responsibility to achieve both a sustainable supply and to exercise a very high level of environmental stewardship.",
        "And the good folks at Tampa Bay are going along with it.",
        "That's correct.",
        "And now, I would also point out that the good folks at Tampa Bay have exercised a very high level of conservation, and conservation restriction, and xerescaping, and the use of reclaimed water for outdoor irrigation, and washing of cars, and those kinds of things is very prevalent across our entire region.",
        "And we've been able to reduce per capita residential consumption to levels of around 100 gallons per person, per day."

        "Certainly, in areas that get very little rainfall - parts of the Middle East, you know, countries like Kuwait where you just don't have rainfall and any renewable water to work with - absolutely, desalination is a source that's important to supply drinking water.",
        "At the moment, I have trouble seeing it as an elegant solution to our problems here in the U.S.",
        "and most places.",
        "If you think about what desalination is doing, it's using energy to turn saltwater into freshwater.",
        "Most of that energy is coming from fossil fuels, and so it's contributing to climate change, which is going to have a major impact on our ability to manage water and on our water supply.",
        "And so to me, it has some serious problems, and one thing we didn't mention was the difficulty in many areas of dealing with the brine that results, the waste product from the desalination process, which has environmental issues attached to it, too.",
        "So to me, this kind of tendency to look toward increasing supply, which desalination is part of, really begs the question of what's happening on the demand side, where there's tremendous potential to meet the needs that we have for water by increasing efficiency through conservation."
