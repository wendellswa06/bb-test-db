        "And there are some really good examples of this now.",
        "In my own backyard in Boston, a city of over 2 million people, we've seen the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, which got very, very serious about water conservation back in the late 1980s when it was looking at the need to divert additional water from the Connecticut River.",
        "And citizens encouraged the authority to look at conservation as a serious alternative to that supply-side solution, and they did and implemented a very aggressive water-conservation program.",
        "And what's happened?",
        "Thirty-three reduction in demand, and the reservoir that supplies Boston is brimming with water.",
        "The question in our state now is what to do with this so-called surplus.",
        "There's no need for the extra diversion anymore, and there's now water to be dealt with in the reservoir, and the question is do we restore the ecosystem -the river ecosystem that that reservoir supplies - or do we increase the number of residents getting supplied by the authority?",
        "And that's the debate we're having now, and the reason we can even have that debate is because there's been a successful conservation effort that has saved water in the state.",
        "And there are a number of examples of that sort, but nowhere near enough to suggest that we've come close to tapping out conservation's potential in this country or internationally.",
        "Well, I see things a little differently.",
        "Hang on a second.",
        "Let me just remind everybody that this is TALK OF THE NATION Science Friday from NPR News.",
        "Brent, do you want to jump in there?",
        "Yeah, if I could.",
        "We already have about 1,200 desal plants functioning the United States, and the majority of them are inland, where there's some brackish water - it's not as salty as seawater - and there may even be some industrial waste heat nearby that makes it cheaper to pass it through the filters.",
        "And it's these kinds of local solutions, where you're finding a water supply that's impaired, you're finding an energy source that's available - that would otherwise be wasted - that will create water in the future.",
        "And if we don't do that, then we're going to keep drawing down our rivers and our wetlands and our aquifers, which we just can't afford to do.",
        "And so we really have to think about if we don't pursue desal and if we don't pursue water reclamation and reuse, well then, where are we going to get the water?",
        "And out west here, because we have these drought cycles and rainy cycles, we really can't hunker down so tightly on our conservation because the very first source of water during an extreme drought out West is the water that last year was used to water the lawn.",
        "And we give that up just because of general conservation.",
        "Then we're at higher risk when a big drought hits, and we have to start scrambling for other sources that are outside of the city.",
        "So I would say that we're sort of just beginning these processes of developing these technologies and fitting them into the existing water supply.",
        "And it's a brave new world, and the Tampa Bay example is a very interesting one - it has technological growing pains - but eventually they'll have a plant that's really helping the environment of Florida.",
        "And I think that with some good public policy backing up the technology, we can re-water some rivers and protect the broader environment by using these plants.",
        "Sandra, 30-second rebuttal.",
        "Well, I think again it's a question of the value of water and what you're doing with it.",
        "I think in a lot of cases - I completely agree with Brent that there are some areas in which, you know, some desalination of brackish water makes sense, and we're seeing more and more of that.",
        "But I think as a supply solution - in most cases, we see large-scale desal going in - the demand-management side hasn't been tapped, and that's really where the most environmentally sound and most cost-effective ways of meeting new-water needs are to be found."

        "One thing they do have in common is that they both seem to show that a jury trial is very different than the court of public opinion.",
        "To hear more about that, we called Glenn Ivey.",
        "He's a former state's attorney for Prince George's County, Md.",
        "That's a suburb of Washington, D.C.",
        "In that role, he supervised prosecutions of police misconduct and sexual assault.",

        "And I began by asking Glenn Ivey if he was surprised by the different decisions.",
        "Well, you know, Castile - I was surprised with that one.",
        "I did think that there was a good chance for a conviction, maybe not for the most serious offenses.",
        "But I thought they'd get him on something.",
        "And the reason I thought that was the case was in part because of the video, even though it's not complete.",
        "But also I thought that, you know, the way the officer was behaving on the video that the girlfriend taped was pretty significant.",
        "And the other piece was there was a second officer at the scene at the time who did not react the same way that the shooting officer did.",
        "So what - so you said you that you were surprised.",
        "But so why do you think it ended up as it did?",
        "I mean, I know traditionally juries give officers a great deal of deference.",
        "You know, I think their sense is that these are people making split-second decisions under high-pressure situations."

        "And what about in the Cosby case?",
        "Well, I think a couple of things there.",
        "You know, first of all, Ms. Constand, I think, apparently did a good job on the stand, but she had a couple of problems with her testimony.",
        "One was the continued phone calls - I think it was over 50 with Mr. Cosby.",
        "And I think they said that was because of the - you know, her role at Temple University.",
        "But I would think that might have been a factor in the jury having some, you know, boy, if you're a rape survivor, do you call that person 50 times again?",
        "I think that the big issue was what happened at the front end of this case.",
        "The judge made a decision about how many other of these women could actually be heard by the jury.",
        "And, you know, as I understand it, there's up to, like, almost 60 women saying that this is what happened, and it followed the same M.O.",
        "But the judge decided only one could, you know, testify.",
        "And there are reasons for that.",
        "I'm not, you know, saying the judge was wrong per se.",
        "But I think, you know, the jury only hearing from one as opposed to two or five or more was probably a factor as well.",
        "Joseph Kennedy, what are your thoughts about this?",
        "Well, I actually wasn't that surprised by the Castile verdict.",
        "Jurors in the Castile case were instructed, you know, to judge the use of force from the perspective of the police officer.",
        "The jury instruction specifically cautions them against using 20/20 vision of hindsight.",
        "And then the jury instruction also sort of primes jurors to think even more specifically about the - from the police officer's point of view - tells them police officers have to make split-second decisions about the use of force under circumstances that are tense, uncertain, rapidly evolving.",
        "So the law sort of definitely favors the police.",
        "The jury instructions favor the police in use of force cases.",
        "These cases are hard for prosecutors to win.",
        "So Glenn, let me go back to something you talked about in the - in relation to the Cosby trial.",
        "I think that many people who just follow the news casually would know that some 60 women - nearly 60 women have accused Bill Cosby of the same or similar conduct - giving them drugs without their consent and then, you know, imposing himself sexually on them.",
        "Why weren't those accusations considered, you know, relevant here?",
        "As you mentioned, only one person was allowed to sort of testify.",
        "I think the casual observer would think that's relevant.",
        "It speaks to a pattern of behavior.",
        "So why wasn't it a part of the jury trial?",
        "Hey, what's going on there?",
        "Why does God hate America?",
        "Oh, nice.",
        "Heath Ledger in hell.",
        "Well, she probably should've lost last night, and she had a tremendous comeback.",
        "She's a great fighter.",
        "But, remember, in the Olympic gold medal match you referenced that Serena won, Serena Williams beat Maria Sharapova 6-0, 6-1.",
        "And one wonders, you know, the silver medal is nothing to sneeze at, but one wonders how such a comprehensive defeat, what that has done to Maria Sharapova's confidence.",
        "You know, she's won this event before.",
        "But, again, it really is Serena Williams's tournament to lose on the women's side."

        "Who else are you looking at who might be a contender?",
        "Well, the other big contender is Andy Murray, who had this breakthrough beating Federer to win the gold medal.",
        "Murray, from Great Britain, from Scotland, and he wins this medal at the London Games.",
        "So the fact that it was in England, his home country, is all the more significant.",
        "He has never won a major, and one of sort of these enduring questions in tennis is whether Andy Murray can finally break through and win that title.",
        "And certainly, a few weeks after beating the might Federer on the lawns of the All England Club to win that gold, certainly he has some momentum.",

        "Yeah, and 30 used to be geriatric in tennis but no longer.",
        "Both Serena and Roger Federer are in their early 30s.",
        "You know, Roddick has had some injuries.",
        "And he's also sort of been this tennis sissafist(ph) where he'd broken through in 2003, and since then it's been a lot of close calls, no cigars, against Federer and Nadal.",

        "Open, his home country slam, and made this decision and announced it.",

        "How would you sum up her career?",
        "Yeah, you know, it's funny because she's so well-liked and the affection that she generated.",
        "In an individual sport, you know, in a sport that's so confrontational, for her to have had this uniform affection really is remarkable.",
