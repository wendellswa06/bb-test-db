        "The segment that you're referring to is sometime later where Sissy--Sissy's character, Ruth, finds herself spending an evening in a motel with a man played by Aidan Quinn with, we presume, romantic intentions.",
        "Whether she will be able to pull this off without regret remains to be seen.",
        "These are definitely key moments in people's lives where decisions are made.",
        "Certainly, in Sissy Spacek's case, whether--if she's going to carry on with this affair or not.",
        "She goes out of her motel room because the police have come to another one of the motel rooms and it turns out it's the first character that we meet, who's being arrested.",
        "And we meet her in prison.",
        "So there tends to be this overlap of connection and times when decisions are being made.",
        "How much of a back story did you give your actors?",
        "Or did you let them develop something of what happened to them before the scene that you shoot and possibly what might happen after that?",
        "I think, you know, actors, like all artists, they draw from their imagination.",
        "And I think that the biggest piece of direction you can give an actor is the screenplay.",
        "You know, I think when they sign on to the screenplay--and usually you have a couple of conversations up front and you both agree that you see this screenplay largely in the same way.",
        "After that, I'm really always reluctant to get into it, get into the text, get into the past and the why of it, with the actors because I'm scared that they're going to be working with my voice in their head.",
        "When I've done that, it hasn't paid off that well for me.",
        "I know, of course, many directors work differently and certainly those that have experience in theater, you know, are very comfortable getting into text and asking all the questions and every nook and cranny of a person's past, and then rebuilding it together and then rebuilding it in front of an audience.",
        "But I don't come from theater and I don't have that confidence.",
        "I was a cameraman before, so I feel that if they understand or feel like they understand the screenplay and can clue into it a certain way, then I'm very reluctant to tell them anything about the past of the characters.",
        "Really, I almost did nothing in this case as far as that.",
        "As a former cameraman and cinematographer, was this a dream of being able to do a scene in like one continuous take--was this something that you have been holding on for and just looking for the opportunity to do?",
        "You know, actually, I wasn't at all because I've always been very much enamored of the cut.",
        "I think there are many things, you know, some--you know, literature, music, film, radio; I mean, they can all share things.",
        "But there's something that is particular only to film, and that is a direct cut from one image to another.",
        "But while working on the script the idea was always to show just a few minutes in the life of each one of these women, and in really a few continuous minutes, contain one place, one time, and it seemed like a logical progression to show it in real time.",
        "I thought, `Well, if I'm only going to spend 10 minutes of her life, let me see them in real time.'",
        "Because I'm a great believer in people who swim in gene pools, do you mind if I ask you about your father?",
        "Because I'm not sure a lot of people know who your father is."

        "And I just like that feeling that you're left with after reading a good short story, where you really feel you've been submerged in a world that you know well and yet so many things were not answered.",
