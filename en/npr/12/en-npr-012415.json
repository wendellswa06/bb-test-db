        "Even before this report came out, an anti-GMO group called Food and Water Watch attacked it, accusing some of the people responsible for it of getting research funding from biotech companies or having other ties to the industry.",
        "Here's Patty Lovera, assistant director of Food and Water Watch.",
        "The makeup of the panel really is pretty clear, you know, that people are coming with the perspective that it's a pro, you know, pro-genetically engineered crop.",
        "It's left the chairman of the committee, Fred Gould from North Carolina State University, sounding frustrated.",
        "Gould has actually been known in the past as a GMO critic.",
        "He's pushed for restrictions on the planting of some GMO crops.",
        "You know, I have not been a darling of the industry.",
        "As a matter of fact, you know, they denied me seeds or plants to do my experiments.",
        "And Gould says over the two years that he and the other members of this committee worked on the report, they had one important rule.",
        "If you brought up an opinion, you had to then back it up with data.",
        "And if you didn't have the data, it didn't go in the report.",
        "The report tries to answer a long list of questions about GMOs, about nutrition, environmental effects, effects on the farm economy, about monopoly control over seeds.",
        "It says first of all, there's no evidence that GMOs are risky to eat.",
        "And it found that GMOs, as promised, have allowed farmers of some crops to spray less insecticide to protect their crops.",
        "Also, GMOs have not reduced the amount of wild plant and insect life on farms.",
        "But the report found that some other claims about the benefits of GMOs have been exaggerated.",
        "For instance, the productivity of crops has been increasing for a century, and that did not change when GMOs came along.",
        "The expectation from some of the proponents was that we need genetic engineering to feed the world, and what we're going to do is use genetic engineering to make that increase in yield go up faster.",
        "And we saw no evidence of that either.",
        "Juan Escalante is a blogger and activist who was at that protest.",
        "He says Trump's comments on Latinos are serious, not funny."

        "Many of Costa Rica's banana plantations are in the remote northeastern region among streams, canals and rainforests.",
        "That's where Paul Grant, a wildlife biologist at Stellenbosch University - in South Africa - went, to investigate whether pesticides are hurting local wildlife.",
        "In the past, I have witnessed - and other locals have pointed out - that there have been massive fish kills as a result of pesticide exposure in high levels.",
        "Grant wanted to know if these pesticides are also ending up in animals that eat the fish.",
        "In particular, he was interested in a small crocodile - called a spectacled caiman because a bony ridge between its eyes makes it look like its wearing eyeglasses.",
        "These caimans live in the Tortugero Conservation Area, which is just downstream from the banana farms.",
        "Because they're long lived and they're at the top of the food chain, a lot of the pesticides will kind of wind up at the top.",
        "He collected blood samples from 14 adult caimans; some that lived closer to plantations and others further downstream, in cleaner waters.",
        "He and his colleagues analyzed the blood samples for 70 different pesticides.",
        "What they found concerned him.",
        "The samples contained nine pesticides, two of which are currently in use and...",
        "Seven of which were historic persistent organic pollutants.",
        "These are pesticides like DDT, dieldrin and endosulfan, chemicals that have been banned for nearly a decade but persist in the environment and build up in the bodies of animals.",
        "Peter Ross is an environmental scientist at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, and also an author on this study.",
        "He says even though the overall levels of the pesticides were modest, there was some indication that they were causing harm.",
        "What was revealing to me was the fact that the caiman that were near banana plantations had not only higher concentrations of most of the pesticides that were detected, they were in a poorer state of health relative to the caiman that were in the more pristine, remote areas."

        "But did you know that Ben Franklin was the first known person to revive an electric shock victim using mouth-to-mouth or, rather, in that case, mouth-to-beak?",
        "There was no way for scientists to measure electrical force.",
        "They didn't have volt meters that you could buy today.",
        "So what they did instead is they would zap these poor birds and see what affect it had on the birds.",
        "And if they could say, well, this amount of power was enough to kill a sparrow, but it wasn't enough to kill a hen or a turkey or some larger bird, so it was a very primitive way of measuring electrical force.",
        "And Ben Franklin was involved in research like this, and he was zapping away hens and turkeys.",
        "And one poor hen, he got the idea: Well, I just zapped it, and it's here unconscious on the floor.",
        "Let me try to give it mouth-to-beak resuscitation and see if it comes back to life.",
        "And sure enough, it did.",
