        "OK, so did he originate this term or this point of view?",
        "The point of view was not new to him.",
        "Robert Bork espoused that point of view to some extent, as have others, but he was its main proponent on the Supreme Court.",
        "And while that point of view might, at one point, have been considered something of a fringe viewpoint, he came onto the court in the middle of the 1980s, just as the conservative Federalist Society was taking hold in academic institutions.",
        "So there was this two- tiered motor - him on the Supreme Court, the Federalist Society, other judges who had been nominated and would be nominated by President Reagan and the two President Bush's on the lower courts - who espoused this view of constitutional interpretation that really had not been a part of our conversation in the 20th century.",
        "And what informed this point of view?",

        "The flip side of that is a static interpretation of the law that doesn't move with the times, doesn't move with the society.",

        "It did.",

        "How would you describe him in relation to this term?",
        "He was its most fierce proponent, I guess I would say, but that didn't mean that he prevailed.",
        "Not everybody on the court agreed with him, including many of the Conservatives, on some issues.",
        "And so while he was its principal proponent and theoretician, he didn't win a great deal of the time because he was not a consensus builder.",
        "Other people were more willing to compromise than he was.",
        "He would have called that faux-conservativism.",
        "So there was a struggle not just with the moderate liberal wing of the court, but with some Conservatives on the court from time to time as well.",
