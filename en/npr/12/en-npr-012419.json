        "Yeah.",
        "And that's what's so great about this piece, because what Jack does is he deconstructs this picture from every single angle: the photograph, when it appeared, the whole social climate of the U.K.",
        "at the time.",
        "And by the end of it, you really get to learn who these boys were and what the picture says, but also how pictures also lie.",
        "You know, on one side, it looks like a picture about class.",
        "But in reality, the story was pretty different.",
        "The two upper-class boys, in fact, ended very tragically.",
        "The tall, snooty one, in fact, died at 16 of diphtheria on his way to see his parents in India.",
        "The smaller one went mad at 40, had a nervous breakdown, and at the age of 60 he died deeply unhappy and quite impoverished.",
        "And the kids who were less privileged did OK.",
        "They did fine.",
        "They joined the Navy.",
        "They led happy, prosperous lives.",
        "And you know, Ian Jack, though, at the end, he ends by saying even though this kind of emblem of the class system seems so archaic in some ways, it's still very much true today.",
        "A recent figure showed in England the schools which we call public schools are in such kind of disarray, really, that you get far less an education than you do if you're in an upper class school, and, of course, the schools the boarding schools are - you have a far better future if you graduate from those schools.",
        "So the point is, he says, you know, it really hasn't changed, even though it has changed so much.",
        "So that's the article in Intelligent Life, looking behind the appearance of something.",
        "And now let's move on to another article you've sent us, Tina Brown.",
        "This one is from Rolling Stone.",
        "I suppose the appearance is of Ken Salazar, the Interior Secretary under President Obama who came into office last year and said he was going to clean up the agency that regulates oil drilling.",
        "Yes, indeed.",
        "This piece, \"\"The Spill, The Scandal and the President,\"\" terrific piece of reporting, I must say, by Tim Dickinson, and I think the most definitive piece yet, even though much has happened since it was published on June the 8th.",
        "But the piece goes right deeply into the Minerals Management Service and shows how under George Bush, it really was stuffed with political cronies, with former oil operatives, back-scratching good old boys who were completely in cahoots with the oil companies - something that we've since learned.",
        "But he also really doesn't let Obama off the hook, because frankly, if this was the Bush administration now, everybody would really be going wild about the fact that if after a year and a half, and despite the fact that Obama said in his campaign and said as soon as he took office that he was going to clean up the corrupt atmosphere, his new Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar, who came riding in saying the sheriff has arrived, but it turns out he left the Minerals Management Service really, largely, the same old good old boys running the show.",
        "Well, let's make sure that we're clear on that, because Salazar did, as the article recounts, go to the Minerals Management Service, give a fierce speech, tell them that they had to clean up their culture and even made, as the article acknowledges, criminal referrals.",
        "And yet somehow, Salazar comes off as having done very little here.",
        "Well, you know, the fact is that it does take more than bold speeches and whip-cracking rhetoric to actually get something done.",
        "And I have to say that, you know, we're seeing this a little bit now across the board, really, with Obama.",
        "I mean, it is more than making speeches.",
        "It really is about drilling down and making sure that your management edicts actually do have follow up.",
        "Or making sure that whoever is drilling down is doing so safety, so to speak."

        "I mean, maybe he did some of it.",
        "In fact, he did do some of it, but he didn't do enough to stop this tragedy being averted - which, in fact, it could have been if that agency had been cleaned out right at the beginning of this administration.",

        "Yes.",
        "This is a fascinating book.",
        "I mean, Beinart is really a very, very cogent, smart, clear thinker, and he's done a wonderful book, really, about how America just has to understand and acknowledge the limits of its own power, and that much of the ill that has befallen us in the last few years has really been because of hubris, about not understanding what we can't do.",
        "He starts the book, actually, with a wonderful scene where he and the great liberal historian Arthur Schlesinger are having dinner, and Schlesinger is talking about remember the lessons of Vietnam about Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "And Beinart is saying well, actually, we keep thinking about the lessons of Vietnam.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "And he shows it so brilliantly throughout the last sort of 40 or 50 years of foreign policy.",
        "He says in some degree, foreign policy is all about deciding in which direction you'd rather be wrong.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And we've made some decisions that have turned out OK and decisions that have not turned out OK, and...",
        "Absolutely.",

        "The barista saw him open up his coat and pull out the weapon, and she fled out the back door.",
        "And then he turned around and opened fire on the police officers as they were writing reports and doing their general work.",

        "Troyer says at least two of the police were, as he put it, executed.",

        "A suspect is in custody in that case.",
        "But Troyer says it's still a disturbing pattern.",
