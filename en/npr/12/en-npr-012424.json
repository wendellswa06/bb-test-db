        "It has been nearly 17 years since Brooklyn, New York's Crown Heights neighborhood was engulfed by riots and recriminations.",

        "In the last few weeks, a series of new incidents, admittedly much smaller ones, have put Crown Heights on a small boil.",
        "Can members of the black and Jewish communities ease the tensions, and are they willing to try?",
        "In a few minutes we'll hear from two of those community leaders.",
        "But, first, here to help us untangle the latest Crown Heights affair is New York Post editorial writer Robert George.",
        "Hi, Robert.",
        "Hi, Farai, how is it going?",
        "Good.",
        "And why don't we talk about this in context.",
        "You know, you have the 1991 tensions that broke out, now what exactly is going on today?",
        "Well, right now you had a series of sort of minor incidents of either involving black on Jewish, black perpetrators on Jewish victims, or Jewish perpetrators on black victims.",
        "And a lot of it, if you look at it from, you just kind of step back, particularly in the context of '91, you - it is almost laughable in certain ways that people are making a comparison, because a lot of these have to do with like sort of stealing of bicycles, and there seem to be kinds of crimes of opportunity, as opposed to, specifically, a racial or ethnic bias.",
        "One of the first incidents you had was more generic, where some African-Americans beat up a black - excuse me, African-Americans beat up a young Jewish boy.",
        "Then you had a case where the son, actually, of an NYPD detective, an African-American, was jumped by a group of young Jewish men who may or may not have been affiliated with a Jewish community patrol unit called the Shmira, and that they feel that one of the people who was involved in it is a member of that.",
        "Then, some African-American boys saw a Jewish kid on a bicycle and jumped him and stole the bike.",
        "So you've - this is certain kind of a back and forth, back and forth.",
        "But it is really important to keep in mind that the incidents of 1991, or in a context where there have been really long simmering tensions between the black community and the orthodox Jewish community, many of the African-Americans were feeling that there was not just bias within the Jewish community towards blacks, but that the broader city power structure was siding with the Jewish community and ignoring some of the complaints of blacks.",
        "So that was kind of the gasoline that had been - had a match sparked to it, that kind of exploded in the riots in '91.",
        "Now, former Mayor David Dinkins and the NYPD got criticized for their handling of the riots back in 1991.",
        "How has Mayor Blumberg and Police Commissioner Kelly?",
        "Well, arguably the reason why David Dinkins was - became a one term mayor, is because of what happened in '91, particularly the fact that these riots went on for three days, and the police were apparently ordered not to go in and stop it, and there was this feeling - it became one of the symbols of the city being out of control.",
        "So far, both Mayor Blumberg and Commissioner Kelly have not been really facing that much criticism.",
        "The irony is actually back in '91, there were, each group, the blacks on one side and the Jews on the other, were claiming that the city was favoring the other side.",
        "This time, if there is any kind of criticism it's that both sides are saying that the city isn't doing enough to find out who the perpetrators are.",
        "Because so far, no one has actually been arrested in any of these incidents, even though suspicion has fallen on, I said, as a member of one of the Jewish community patrol groups.",
        "So to that extent there is not really much of - there is frustration that there hasn't been, there haven't been some arrests, but there, so far, that doesn't seem to be disbelief on that, you know, the city is, A, isn't taking this seriously, or B, that they're completely and totally in the tank for the other community."
