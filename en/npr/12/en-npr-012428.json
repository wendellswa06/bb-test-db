        "It's in decent condition.",

        "It seems like you all have reached a turning point in this disaster.",

        "Right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The turning point happened yesterday when a big - we were warned that a big - they called it a big chunk of oil, meaning a slick of oil broke off from the main big slick, you know, that's out there where the well is leaking.",
        "And we knew it was coming to shore and within hours after that, we started getting calls.",
        "People started picking up these birds that were really diving into it trying to catch fish.",

        "Exactly.",
        "The pelicans and the gulls, they don't see oil as anything other than something floating on the surface like sea foam or plants or whatever.",
        "And the fish, unfortunately, will actually go under the oil to hide, thinking it's the same thing.",
        "And the pelicans don't know the difference and they dive into it.",
        "Therefore, become oiled and, you know the rest.",
        "How many birds did you wind up recovering by the end of the day and how many have you seen so far today?",
        "Okay.",
        "So, what we received here at the end of the day was 29 pelicans, brown pelicans and 15 laughing gulls.",
        "And today I know they're catching more, I just don't know at this point really how many.",
        "Can you save most of those birds?",
        "Well, you know, here's the thing, you know, it depends on the variables.",
        "If you can get them in time and we did catch these birds in time and we can get the oil off of them, and the birds survive the stress of this, yeah, absolutely.",
        "We do it all the time."
