        "It was put out in what's known as a PDF file in computer lingo, and there are significant portions of it--in some cases, it was names, in other cases it was whole paragraphs--that had been sort of slashed out, blacked out.",
        "And what happened is that people who had, you know, just basic computer training were able to take that file, transfer it to another program in which case all of the black slashes would disappear and the original appeared.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Now having read the entire report, do the blacked-out portions changed the basic conclusions that US investigators reached here?",
        "O'HARA: No, it doesn't--they don't seem to.",
        "It substantiates what the US military's really been saying all along, which is that US soldiers opened fire on Nicola Calipari's vehicle because it was speeding towards them at a checkpoint on the road to the Baghdad airport.",
        "And as you recall, that's probably the most dangerous road in Iraq in terms of attacks by insurgents.",
        "And the report says the car failed to heed warnings to slow down, and American soldiers then fired on the vehicle.",
        "Two Italians who survived the attack tell a different story, and the Italian government, which did participate in this investigation, has refused to sign off on the conclusions."

        "O'HARA: I would think it's fairly serious.",
        "At the lesser end of the scale, the names of the soldiers who were involved in the shooting attack on the Italian vehicle are revealed, which, you know, raises the possibility of some kind of retaliation.",
        "But probably more important from a national security perspective is that the report spells out exactly what the rules of engagement were for the soldiers at the checkpoint.",
        "That's something the military never want its enemies to know.",
        "It also assesses the training and vulnerabilities of US forces who were involved and procedures they normally follow.",

        "This is simply not the kind of information the military wants floating around the Internet.",
        "What have US military officials said about this?",
        "O'HARA: Larry DiRita, who is the Pentagon spokesman, says that it apparently resulted from a technical error, and he says the military isn't sure how it happened.",
        "But he acknowledged that it is an unfortunate security breach in that it revealed procedural information about the military in Iraq to quite a large audience.",
        "He also made the point that the military normally would have released such a report in hard copy, but decided to put it out electronically because it's so dangerous for reporters to move around Baghdad to go pick it up.",
        "Hmm.",
        "One other thing, Vicky.",
