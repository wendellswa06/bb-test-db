        "So this is just a hold the line until they can come up with something else?",
        "The basic idea is the Germans feel they have to do something.",
        "Their population is up in arms about these revelations, not only about last October, finding out the NSA was spying on Angela Merkel, but the recent revelations that members of German intelligence and perhaps German military have been spying for the United States.",
        "The Germans...",
        "And we should remind ourselves Germans in particular might be sensitive about this because coming out of the period of Stasi and East Germany.",
        "Well, and even further back than that the Gestapo.",
        "There's a natural reaction to these revelations by the German public.",
        "And so the German government feels as though that it needs to do something, whether that's kicking out the chief of station for the CIA, which they just did from Berlin, or if it's telling them that we're going to go back to a low-tech solution to potential eavesdropping like the typewriter.",
        "One way or another, this is not going to be long-lasting.",
        "It's too difficult to run a country the size of Germany or the size of anyone going purely typewriter communication.",
        "There's a reason we use computers.",
        "There's a reason we use this kind of electronic communications.",
        "So review for us some of the ways that you can eavesdrop on type writer technology.",
        "Well, there are several ways.",
        "There's an old-fashioned human intelligence way and we call this Humint (ph) using human intelligence sources to look at typewriter ribbons to - used to - when you wanted to make copies of something, you used carbon paper.",
        "Those can be pulled out of the trash by human intelligence assets.",
        "There's a more advanced way of doing it, using computers to analyze audio signatures.",
        "Each typewriter...",

        "She believes that if other airlines are leaving passengers on the tarmac for six or eight or 10 hours, that will be good for business, Southwest's that is.",
        "I feel that, you know, the marketplace should dictate who provides the best customer service and I think that passengers vote for that with their pocketbooks.",
        "I just don't want the government telling me what I need to do for every given specific situation.",

        "The Maryland state legislature overrode a veto yesterday and passed a law that effectively forces Wal-Mart to spend more on health insurance.",
        "It mandates Maryland employers with more than 10,000 employees to spend at least 8 percent of their payrolls on health care.",
        "The state's other big three employers already spend that much so the law is really aimed at the huge retailer, Wal-Mart.",
        "Various stories about the Maryland law say that similar efforts will be made in other states.",
        "And to check on what's happening, we've called on Laura Tobler, who is health policy analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures in Denver.",
        "Welcome to the program once again.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Glad to be here.",
        "How common are state bills that mandate health coverage or more spending on health coverage by employers, employers generally or by Wal-Mart specifically?",
        "Well, this particular initiative is really aimed at addressing the growing number of uninsured in the states.",
        "And, indeed, Maryland is the only state that has passed a bill addressing large employers, 10,000 employees or more.",
        "However, Hawaii has an employer mandate that covers a variety of employers in their state and that's been in place since the early '70s.",
        "The reason that no other states have followed in Hawaii's footsteps is because right after Hawaii implemented their law the federal government passed a law called ERISA, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act in 1974 and it precluded states from regulating employer benefits, including health insurance.",
        "And there were states that have made attempts in the past--Massachusetts, Oregon and Washington among them--that have made attempts to implement employer mandates, and for reasons different in each state, gave up those attempts.",
        "Well, are people then watching the Maryland law assuming it's going to be challenged, watching to see whether it's going to be thrown out as a violation of ERISA?",
        "I am certain that everyone is watching the Maryland law and waiting to see what's going to happen there.",
        "Will it be challenged?",
        "California passed a law in 2003 that would have mandated employers to provide a certain amount of insurance--health insurance for their employees and there was quite a bit of analysis of that law and the conclusions were not clear as to whether or not it would have passed an ERISA muster.",
        "We really haven't seen an ERISA challenge to these types of laws.",
        "However, you're correct in assuming that states across the nation are going to be watching Maryland and, in fact, there have been a few states that have filed bills that are very similar to the Maryland bill.",
        "Now I've read a list of those bills with brief descriptions of them and there seems often to be a linkage between employees of big companies and the state's Medicaid program.",
        "The message seems to be to companies, `If your employers need state funds to get medical care, then you are presumed to be not spending enough money on their insurance.'",
        "That's right.",
        "In recent years the policy-makers have been paying close attention to who are the beneficiaries in publicly-funded health insurance.",
        "And they're seeing that, of course, a percentage of these beneficiaries are employed and that those employers either offer insurance that's unaffordable for low-income individuals or they don't offer insurance to a percentage of their employees, part-time employees or they don't offer insurance for the first six to 12 months of employment.",
        "So states are looking at ways to share the burden of paying for health insurance for those individuals, which is why Maryland named their bill the Fair Share Health Care Fund, indicating that they wanted employers to pay their fair share.",
        "That's Laura Tobler, who is health policy analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures in Denver.",
        "Thank you very much for talking with us."

        "And contemptuousness has Neptune.",

        "And each of those when written in lowercase letters consists entirely of narrow letters - that is have no ascenders or descenders.",
        "And then I asked, can you think of a seven-letter word that fits both properties?",
        "And the answer was avenues has only narrow letters, and it conceals Venus.",
        "That's a hard one, I've got to say.",
        "And we had about 300 responses.",
        "And this week's winner is Jeff Zarkin (ph) of Burke, Va.",
