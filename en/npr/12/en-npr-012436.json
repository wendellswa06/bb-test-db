        "We have seen this.",
        "So it applies around the world.",
        "But Facebook did say that they are going to at times make exceptions where the harms could outweigh the news value of content that politicians are posting.",
        "So, like you mentioned, inciting violence - that would be an area that Facebook may still take a post down or limit the spread of a post from a politician.",

        "What did Clegg say about that?",
        "What was the company's response to that?",
        "So in general, the company's stance on the calls to break up the company have been, if you want us to address these issues around election security, if you want us to address disinformation, we can do a better job of that if we're a bigger company and have more resources at our disposal to do that.",
        "But at the same time, you know, the company also is in this position where the whole reason we're having this conversation is because of how much power they have concentrated in one unit.",
