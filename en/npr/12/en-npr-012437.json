        "Last year, the suicide rate among soldiers reached its highest rate in three decades.",
        "This January alone, 24 soldiers took their own lives, that's more than the total number of combat casualties for that same time period.",
        "Will these startling numbers keep the spotlight on the mental health needs of our servicemen and women?",
        "And what are the cultural challenges of psychological counseling in the armed forces and among returning veterans?",
        "Joining us now are Steve Yeschin, he is a former Marine who served in the first month of the Iraq war, and Professor Jose Coll, he is a former Marine as well, and he heads up the Military Social Work and Veterans Program at the University of Southern California.",

        "Why do you think these soldiers are taking their lives?",
        "And is there a common thread to their stories?",
        "You know, Steve, the common thread that we're finding among the soldiers who are committing suicide unfortunately is age.",
        "Many of them are between the ages of 18 and 24.",
        "Now, to be able to predict why they're committing suicide is much harder, and one of the things that we're looking at is, and specifically the VN(ph), the Department of Defense is looking at - is not only age but difficulties with their marriage, law concerns - coming back home, and of course the multiple deployments.",
        "So we're asking these young men and women to do more than one deployment which is really unheard of in many of our previous conflicts.",
        "Does it matter whether or not they are coming back from front-line duty?",
        "It doesn't.",
        "Actually, what's been really interesting is that we've had quite a few individuals committing suicide unfortunately who have not seen combat, who were actually either in support units, and the Army has seen an increase in suicide among soldiers who've never been deployed.",
        "Really.",
        "Are they talking at all about committing suicide before they actually do it?"

        "That's a very difficult one - and that's one of the things that we're trying to reach out to a lot of young men and women in the armed forces to try to minimize the stigma and to reach out to their NCOs, and their officers, and the mental health profession within the military and outside the military.",
        "A lot of them don't feel comfortable reaching out to the military mental health sector.",

        "But I think the more fundamental long-term problem is that there is simply something of a mismatch between the expectation of students and also the reality of the job markets.",
        "We have do have four million retail sales clerks in the United States.",
        "These are not very glamorous jobs but there are a lot of them, and those are still growing in number.",

        "So, there is all sorts of secondary implications, I think, of this.",

        "It did.",
        "For example, if you look at in the middle of the career of someone, say, 15 years out after graduation, the typical earnings of an engineer is pretty close to $100,000 a year.",
        "The same is true of my field of economics.",

        "I've tried to be honest with my students and I tell my students that there are risks in anything one does in life and any kind of investment one makes in life.",
        "And colleges are subject to the same kind of risks that investing in, say, stocks and bonds.",
        "Part of the risk, of course, is that 45 percent of those who enter college don't graduate within six years.",
        "And students who think they can major in social work then go get a fancy job and then live in an upper middle-class suburb are perhaps living a life that's devoid of much reality these days.",

        "I don't tell them don't go to college, but I tell them there are risks associated with it and be cautious about piling up a lot of debt.",
