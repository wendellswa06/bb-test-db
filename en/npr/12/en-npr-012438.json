        "But no, for me mostly it was just, you know, trying to keep to myself and - but before I could start talking to people and, you know, sharing my experiences, I wanted to get myself, my personal things back in order and, you know, just become adjusted.",
        "And everyone wants to know what's going on, and everyone has questions and opinions, and there was just really no way to hide from any of that.",
        "That was the biggest thing for me.",
        "What about in your personal relationships with your friends that you had before you went to Iraq and your more intimate relationships?",
        "Oh…",
        "How would they impacted?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "I mean, it's hard to justify a lot of the things you do when you come back having experienced what you had just experienced in combat.",
        "I remember in particular one - one Sunday, I was sitting on the beach in Malibu and my friends were complaining about their dry cleaning not being ready in time to go out that night, and I'm sitting there and I'm rubbing my feet around in the sand and I'm thinking about, you know, my brothers overseas who - their feet are in the sand too.",
        "And, you know, if they would hear this conversation, you know, complaining about dry cleaning not being ready, as like that's the topic of the day, that's what's really important, it would make them sick, and it made me sick.",
        "And it was really - and still is kind of hard to relate to a lot of the people who are in my life before I went over because there is just this gap now where, you know, certain things that were once meaningful to me are really meaningless now, and things that are really meaningful to me are meaningless to the people who surround me.",
        "Now, one more thing before I go back to Jose.",
        "When you are - how long have you been back now?",
        "I came back from the war in 2003.",
        "I got out of the Marines in early 2005.",
        "All right.",
        "Did you have, when you came back, a difficult time, I don't know, sleeping and difficult time communicating, a difficult time sort of adjusting to who you are, Steve the person, and what is important to you and what your values are based on what you experienced in Iraq?",
        "Oh, absolutely, yes.",
        "I mean, I pretty much had two emotions, happiness and anger, and there was really no gray area in between.",
        "You know, I was either content at the moment or was very angry.",
        "Sleeping, it's not as much of a problem anymore but it was pretty difficult, especially since I had come back from seven months of virtually no sleep, you know, maybe an hour a night.",
        "Most sleep was during the day for 15 minutes here, 20 minutes there."

        "One morning in particular, my father came in and flipped on the lights and I jumped out of bed and almost tackled him, just - you know, certain things startle you, you know, a car backfiring as well, you know, bright lights, loud noises.",
        "It wasn't just trying to sleep, but anything that would really stimulate a lot of the experiences…",
        "So why - let me ask you then, Jose, why would we have, if you know, a spike in suicides here in January?",
        "And what is occurring in the universe that would make this happen or is it just a coincidence?",
        "I think a lot of it has to do with coincidence.",
        "I really don't think that the spike has to do anything with the change in administration or the climate.",
        "Now, I do really believe that there could be a spike because of our economic difficulties that we're having in the nation, and a lot of young men and women like Steve are coming back and realizing that maybe the employment that they have previously before going into the military doesn't exist any longer, mostly for our Reserve and National Guard deployment units who are being deployed and coming back.",
        "And maybe that stability of employment doesn't exist any longer.",
        "We have talked a lot on this program about the increased recruitment efforts on the part of the military and yet, we don't get in that conversation some of the dangers that people like Steve and others encounter when they come home.",
        "Is the military doing all that it could and should in terms of the support for these soldiers?",
        "Well, what we have to remember is when the individual goes into the service, they're part of the Department of Defense.",
        "Once he receives his DD214, he becomes part of the Department of Veteran Affairs.",
        "So, really, when we're looking at service providers and services when they're coming back home, once they are discharged, honorable discharge from the military, it really falls into the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the VET centers, and community agencies.",
        "And kind of if you look at Steve, he was mentioning he was trying to do that transition back into education.",
        "One of the things that we're really focusing on with this military social work concentration at USC is to provide those kind of skills to health-care providers and educators to understand that Steve looks like a traditional age student who's never been overseas yet, he has a lot of experience behind him.",
        "And we need to help him make that transition.",
        "Steve, I'm going to ask you this.",
        "You don't have to answer if you don't want to.",
        "I love when something is prefaced with that.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Did you - did you ever consider suicide yourself?",
        "Before - I'm a business owner now and so I would say that nothing ah - well, that was going to be a sick joke.",

        "A few more are lost on drugs, which I think is virtually the same thing because the Marines that I know don't exist anymore.",
        "Did you know that it was coming for those friends who committed suicide?",
        "You know, the first one was a big shocker.",
        "One - one wasn't too surprise - I never would have guessed it with either one of the - with either one of the gentlemen.",
        "But one was very surprising and the other one was a little bit less surprising, but I never saw any of it coming.",
        "Did either of them have the kind of support that you had from your family?",
        "Absolutely not.",
        "But I think most Marines who come back from combat - or at least the Marines that I served with - don't come back to nearly anything comparable to the support system that I had.",
        "The time is really short, Jose, but I'm curious as to whether or not there is a racial or gender component to who is committing suicide now.",
        "Ah, there is and although we do see more females attempting suicide, but yet more males are actually committing and completing suicide.",
        "And what about racially?"

        "And so that is the best assessment of what a typical defendant committing that crime would get.",
