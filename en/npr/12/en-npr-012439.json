        "It is not all that unusual to see judges vary downward from the sentencing guidelines in white-collar cases.",
        "Which, you know, I would submit supports this notion that there is a different criminal justice system for those who are wealthy and powerful from the criminal justice system from those who are indigent.",
        "I think there is class disparity and racial disparity that goes into some of those things.",
        "But I will say I have not seen variances downward that are so drastic from, you know, 19 to 24 years all the way down to less than four.",
        "Manafort will be sentenced next week for a different set of crimes in another federal court, this one in Washington.",
        "Do you see a potential for a harsher sentence there?",
        "Yes.",
        "That sentence will be imposed by Judge Amy Berman Jackson.",
        "She is limited by a 10-year statutory maximum on her sentence.",
        "And she also has the power to make that sentence either concurrent - served at the same time as the sentence imposed by Judge T.S.",
        "Ellis - or she could make it consecutive, which means it gets added onto the end.",
        "So the maximum she could impose would be something just under 14 years.",
        "I think that she has had a chance to see Paul Manafort involved in obstruction of justice and witness tampering, for which she revoked his bond.",
        "She also was the fact-finder who found that he lied to the special counsel in his efforts to cooperate.",
        "And so I think those factors are things that she will also keep in mind as she imposes sentence.",
        "At the same time, the crimes that Paul Manafort was found guilty of here, they don't have anything to do with the probe into the Trump campaign and the investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S.",
        "election.",
        "But do you think there's, like, a message in his sentencing to others who might be implicated in that investigation?",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, I think that the charges did not relate to Russia, but the investigation certainly did.",
        "His contacts with people in Ukraine and overseas banks, all of that was intertwined with the investigation that Robert Mueller was conducting into Russia.",
        "I do worry a little bit that a 47-month sentence sends a message to would-be cooperators that you're not going to get hammered, even if you go to trial and are convicted.",
        "Seeing a possibility of a long sentence for those who do not cooperate, I think, is really important.",
        "And so there is still that possibility in Washington, D.C., next week, when Judge Jackson imposes sentence.",
        "She can show the world what happens when you lie to cooperators, pretend to cooperate and continue to lie.",
        "That's former federal prosecutor Barbara McQuade.",

        "Yet it's - there are hundreds.",
        "There used to be a lot more.",
        "That's true, and that is something that concerns us obviously as we look to the future of bookselling and publishing in this country.",

        "Well, the independent bookseller has also been able to provide the same number of books through a visit or in today's world with a click of a mouse as well.",
        "So the difference between the two is not quite so great in that way.",
        "What the independent provides is personal contact and the community connection, and that is a cultural legacy that is important to maintain and inspire as our - inspire our future.",
        "What prompted you after decades of being a new bookseller of going into the used book market, too?",
        "Well, we've talked about it for about 35 years."
