        "We have a customer base that ranges from St. Louis to Kansas City to Tulsa to Little Rock.",
        "And we've been there because we have the books the people can't find in the chain stores and they're not going to find anywhere else, and especially now they're not even finding them in the library.",
        "And I've been encouraging people for the last 10 years that now is the time to open independent bookstores, because we constantly hear from people how they can't find what they want in the chains.",
        "A lot of people do not want to order over the Internet, and they spend all their time looking for independent bookstores everywhere they go.",
        "The thing is, I think bookstores - independents need to find their niche, develop their market.",
        "And we don't need to be directly competing with each other because there are so many books out there.",
        "And there's so many books out there that people go in the chains never see at all.",
        "I mean, there's 825,000 new titles published every single year.",
        "What kind of books do you have in your store that you can't get at the regular bookstore?",
        "Well, we have loads of books on sustainable farming.",
        "We have books on alternative energy.",
        "We have books dealing with the alternative views of politics.",
        "We have books on Native American.",
        "We have a great children's section, because we really believe that children should be informed on what's going on in the world.",
        "It's not so much the type, it's that we pick everything ourselves, which is also the advantage of having an independent store as opposed to some buyer in New York just randomly picking this milquetoast selection that goes right down in the middle.",
        "I mean, we constantly have people come in and say that they haven't seen three-fourths of the books that are in our store anywhere that they go.",
        "So there's a lot of books out there that never - that people never see because there aren't as many independent (technical difficulties) chains just don't bother with them.",
        "They actually (unintelligible) our little drop in the bucket.",
        "And one thing I'll say about the chains is everyone has this idea that they can't compete against the chains.",
        "But you know, I've been in this business long enough, but I remember in the '80s, there were seven or eight different chains, two of them were even discount chains.",
        "They've been artificially and unfairly propped up by the publishers all this time, and yet now we're down to two and neither one of them is making it.",
        "They both are struggling.",
        "So I say obviously there's something wrong with that business model, because even being artificially propped up, it's just not making it."

        "From my own experience, just in the last couple of weeks, I was in a very small book shop that I was not familiar with in Grand Lake, Colorado, and the proprietor was waiting on another customer and talking about all of what she could provide for their particular needs.",
        "And the store was tiny but it had kids' books, it had the bestsellers, but it had a very fine selection of local interest books.",

        "That's right.",
