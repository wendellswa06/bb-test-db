        "And historically, music has been a powerful tool for activism and for social movements and it's inspiring when an opposition leader like Morgan Tsvangirai would reach out to a band like this.",
        "Are you afraid that it seems partisan to work with an opposition leader but not with the sitting candidate for office?",
        "You know, what we try to do with the spots - and you can see it at MTVU.com - is make the case that this is not about any one candidate.",
        "It is about free and fair elections.",
