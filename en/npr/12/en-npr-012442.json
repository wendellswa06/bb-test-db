        "So, describe how this affects the broader economy.",
        "What's the cycle here?",
        "Well as you said earlier Madeleine, it's the root of the problem.",
        "It's one of the economy's biggest problems.",

        "We're kind of in a downward spiral.",
        "Lower housing prices means fewer consumers, fewer consumers means layoffs, layoffs means lower incomes, lower incomes means lower home prices.",

        "Well, he is just so, so deft, Alex.",
        "First of all he says, look, we withdraw the bad memo.",
        "Doesn't that in itself prove that the system worked.",
        "We self-corrected without any oversight.",
        "That's his first argument.",
        "And then he really, really kind of down-plays how bad those first memos were.",
        "He talked today about how they were, quote, \"\"unnecessary discussions.\"\" They were, quote, \"\"overly broad.\"\" That there was just some bad language in there that needed to be corrected, repaired, and fixed.",
        "And so the new memos really sort of tweaked them a little bit, got out the worst of it, but they were - did not change the interrogation policies.",
        "They did not - that the underlying policies that were approved in the initial memos are supported by the additional memos, were still the interrogation policies that were still legal.",
        "In fact, he wouldn't say that water-boarding is illegal, so, really, he just said oh the system works.",
        "We've fixed what was wrong and so clearly the system works.",
        "Here is a clip of him explaining how these extreme memos, the initial memos were really just not ever adhered to.",
        "Here's why he withdrew the memos.",
        "One way to think about this is to imagine that a highway had a posted speed limit of 85 miles-per-hour.",
        "But the cars traveling upon it never moved faster than 65 miles-per-hour.",
        "Taking the down the 85 mile-per-hour signs and putting up 65 mile-per-hour signs would not require a change in driving conduct.",
        "It would merely redefine the outer boundaries of what drivers would be said legally could be done.",
        "This is precisely what happened with the interrogation advice rendered by the Department in 2002 and 2003.",
        "I cant tell from that whether the former Attorney General is backing away from what the administration has done or not.",
        "He's really not.",
        "What he's in effect saying is everybody was driving 65 miles-per-hour all along.",
        "No laws were broken, everything was OK.",
        "The memos were too extreme, but nobody ever broke any laws.",
        "It's important to remember that John Ashcroft is known to have said, quote, \"\"history will not remember this kindly.\"\" And he, throughout his tenure at the AG's office was taking strong positions internally and secretly against some of the excesses of the Bush administration.",
        "But the face he's presenting to the public today, Alex, is one in lock-step with what the administration did.",
        "He said lives were saved because of what the administration did."

        "Yeah.",
        "Right.",
        "So the basics here is that it takes a computer image, a 3-D computer image, and then it prints it out - in Jim's case, it prints it in plastic.",
