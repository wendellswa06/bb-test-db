        "Well, it depends on the region.",
        "In the East, in Benghazi and around that area, we're hearing a lot of sense of relief, a lot of happiness.",
        "People are very excited to finally have their freedom for the first time in more than 40 years.",
        "At the same time, it's a qualified happiness because, consistently, what we're hearing from people there is until the western region and until the capital is free, they can't truly celebrate, and trying to combat the attempt by the regime to kind of divide the country to east and west and make these rumblings of civil war, which isn't actually the case.",
        "In the west, in Tripoli, primarily, what we're hearing is a lot of fear.",
        "Even the people that we have been able to talk to on a regular basis and who, you know, last week, were a little bit more fearless about speaking with us, now are saying, you know, no phone calls, you know.",
        "They might still send us messages.",
        "They might still send us emails, but they're - we're hearing from a lot of people on the ground that in these days that have a little bit quieter since last Friday, there's been more of a crackdown.",
        "And now they're actually going after people who have been seen at protests, people who have been injured at protests or people who are talking to outside media or to people on the outside, criticizing the government.",
        "So what we're hearing now is that people are very, very frightened.",
        "I mean, at best, the information flow that we were getting out of the country was a dripping faucet.",
        "And now it seems like even that is starting to close up.",
        "So - yeah.",
        "I mean, people are just very, very afraid."

        "I'm sure you know his background.",

        "And one of the things you learned was that the campaign moved all the way west and then all the way back east, and then back and forth and back and forth.",

        "And the biggest fear they're facing right now is really the fear of having him come back.",

        "And so...",
