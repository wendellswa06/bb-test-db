        "Tell us about that.",
        "What - your study, what can you learn from the genomes of these centenarians or super-centenarians?",
        "Well, we've known for a long time, that exceptional longevity runs very strongly in families, and just needed to see what kind of genetic study we wanted to perform to try and take into account what was saw as a very complex picture.",
        "Certainly, it wasn't going to boil down to one or two genes.",
        "It was surely going to involve lots of genes.",
        "And so we did a study that eventually found these 150 markers that pointed to about 70 or so genes, that if you have all the variations associated with longevity, then you have a pretty good chance of getting to extreme old age.",
        "Pretty good meaning, what, seven, eight out of 10?",
        "Well, it would - it varies.",
        "If you have all the variants associated with longevity, then we have a 99 percent chance or I guess you'd call it a risk of getting to be a centenarian but with 77 percent accuracy.",
        "So what that also means is that 23 percent of the time, we had centenarians who did not have any genetic signature predisposing to exceptional longevity.",
        "That means there's something else that you haven't discovered yet.",
        "It means, right, there's genetic factors that we didn't look at and also environmental factors, as well.",
        "I guess the other thing I would say is that when we looked at our population control sample, there were about 3,000 subjects, that about 15 percent of them actually had these signature that showed a greater-than-50-percent predisposition or chance of exception longevity.",
        "That means, I think, 70 percent - I mean, 17 percent of the population has a genetic predisposition to living to 100.",
        "That's a lot more than our one per 6,000 currently in the population that is a centenarian, but that's because our current centenarians were born in 1900, and there was a lot of mortality back then, particularly in infancy, and a lot of people who might have had the predisposition didn't have the opportunity to get old.",
        "But now, a lot more people do.",
        "And one other interesting finding in your study, was that the centenarians had the same number of disease genes as normal people, but don't seem to be affected by the disease genes."
