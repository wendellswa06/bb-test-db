        "We were really surprised by that.",
        "For the longest time, we hypothesized that centenarians had to lack these disease-associated variants.",
        "Otherwise, how could they get to these ages.",
        "You're right.",
        "And to our surprise, they have about the same number of disease- associated variants as the controls, and what seems to make the difference is an enrichment for these longevity-associated variants that might in fact trump or negate the effect of a disease-associated variant.",
        "Well, that's interesting because, you know, we're now living in an age where we're trying to do our human genome, and everybody wants to know if they have these disease genes.",
        "You might find out, right, that you have these disease genes and not know that you have the longevity genes that might trump them.",
        "Right.",
        "I think we need - that's why I think some of these genetic tests that are being marketed to indicate what your risk is for a common disease is not ready for primetime.",
        "We need a much better comprehensive picture that takes into account other genetic factors that could compensate or negate the effect of a disease-associated gene.",
        "How easy would it be for any of us to find out if we have these centenarian genes in us?",
        "You know, not so easy.",
        "I think we're going to make a website available to researchers who have their institutional-review-board- approved studies who are looking at longevity to input data from their subjects into the site and will produce similar kind of result reports for them.",
        "With regard to individuals, well, they'd have to go to a researcher and get this done, and I think we're still pretty worried about the ethical implications and what people would actually end up doing with this information.",
        "It's certainly imperfect, and we'd like to understand a lot more about what people would do if they heard that they didn't have a signature, if they did have a signature, how they're going to interpret that.",
        "So I don't think the public is ready for this information yet.",
        "Yet since it was not mandatory for many centuries, could it be made non-mandatory now?",
        "He's able to withstand enormous accelerations and decelerations.",
        "But you're absolutely right.",
        "And that's, in fact, the challenge for the CGI, is to try to get that as correct as possible.",
        "One interesting experience I had at the end of the very first Spider-Man film in 2002, there's a scene where he's swinging through the canyons of New York and he lands on a flagpole.",
        "And I've used this scene in my class.",
        "And if you listen very carefully, you could hear a very subtle thunk as he lands on the flagpole."

        "And the entire scene is CGI, so they obviously had to put that thunk in by hand.",
        "And I had an opportunity years later to talk to the special effects people who did that, and they said that their studies of neuroscience show that you expect to hear certain things even subconsciously.",
        "And so if that thunk isn't there, it's not as if you would have walked out of the movie complaining that the movie stunk because when he landed on the flagpole there was no thunk.",
        "Right.",
        "But rather, you wouldn't - without being aware of it, you'd know that something was off, and it would remind you that it's CGI, whereas the thunk is a very subtle cue to try to convince you that what you're watching is real.",
        "And so they're - you're absolutely right.",
        "The CGI has gotten tremendously sophisticated, and they're using cutting-edge science, neuroscience in some cases, to try to paint a realistic world inside the computer.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, every science fiction, science movie on radio or TV, somewhere along the line, there's a giant blackboard filled with equations, right?",
        "Yes.",

        "That's an excellent point.",
        "One of my pet peeves is that sometimes you would see on blackboards in these films a random collection of complex equations that had no connection to each other, as if the art designer had just flipped through some physics textbooks and written down things that look very complicated.",
        "And often they look complicated to someone who is outside of science.",
        "Within science they're like undergraduate material, and there'd be no real reason to write them on the blackboard.",
        "And so they asked me to come up with an equation that would actually play a role in the plot, that a character would see this equation and something would happen, and the audience would have to recognize it when they saw it again later on.",
        "So it had to be visually recognizable and striking.",
        "And I asked, well, what is it about?",
        "And they said, well, it has to do with cell regeneration and human mortality issues.",
        "And I didn't want to use a real equation because, again, if it's a major plot point that some people know this and some people don't, if I just wrote down like say in physics, the Schrodinger equation, you know, all the people who study physics would say, what's the big deal?",
        "It's the Schrodinger equation.",
        "Right.",
        "So I started - I did some - it was actually a fun weekend looking through the literature on issues of, you know, human aging and longevity studies and an equation called the Gompertz equation that describes human mortality.",
        "And so I took that as the basis, as like the primer coat.",
        "And then I added terms in order to turn it from something real into something not real because the Gompertz - the equation in the movie, if you try to actually apply it, will not actually turn you into a giant lizard.",
        "Spoiler alert.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "Thank goodness.",
        "I couldn't write fast enough in the film there as I was watching.",
        "And so - but...",
        "But they - did they insist on having the whole board filled or, you know, or you sweetening it up with other stuff?",
        "That was them to the most part, but I did add various things.",
        "They also asked me like, you know, what would whiteboards, what would blackboards look like?",
        "And again, I stressed that it's not just, you know, a random collection of equations, that frequently when we write on board, we're trying to solve a particular problem.",
        "So you're seeing, you know, a lot of similarity because it's steps in a solution.",
        "Stanley Kubrick was very famous for making sure his equations were right in \"\"2001: A Space Odyssey."
