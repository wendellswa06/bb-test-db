        "One of the things that I try to find predictions of - for another book that I wrote about, quantum mechanics, that of technology from science fiction pulps or movies at the time and I couldn't find was magnetic resonance imaging.",

        "Yeah, so in comic books, this is, you know, well-known, a famous storyline.",
        "Gwen Stacy was Peter Parker's girlfriend for many years, many issues, and she died in \"\"Amazing Spider-Man #121,\"\" published in 1973.",
        "And it was a very significant milestone in comic book history because it was the first time that a recurring character, a long-standing character, innocent bystander, died when the hero and villain fought.",
        "She was caught - she died when Spider-Man was fighting the Green Goblin, and it's also very significant because it's been, you know, going on nearly 40 years now, and Gwen Stacy is still dead in the comic books.",
        "Nearly inevitably, these characters get better at some point, but poor Gwen doesn't.",
        "And so she was on top of a bridge, brought to the top of the George Washington Bridge by the Green Goblin in order to lure Spider-Man into battle.",
        "She gets knocked off the bridge during the fight.",
        "Spider - falls to her apparent doom, Spidey catches her in his webbing at the last moment but discovers, when he brings it back up to the top of the bridge, that she is, in fact, dead, even though he caught her in the webbing."

        "How much force would the webbing have to exert to stop her in, say, half a second?",

        "And so that part doesn't require a suspension of disbelief.",

        "Michigan would be typical at three percent.",

        "He got almost a 100,000 votes in Florida.",
        "And as we all know that race was decided by 537 votes.",
