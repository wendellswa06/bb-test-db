        "Were there any outward physical signs that people were not aging as quickly, their hair didn't turn, you know, that sort of thing, obesity, anything like that that you could look at these centenarians and say gee, you can see when they're in their 80s.",
        "They're aging slower, their mental capacity is better, there are outward signs?",
        "We have a lot of - we've collected a lot of findings that people can find at the New England centenarian website.",

        "Yes.",
        "And there's findings such as the fact that 90 percent of the centenarians are disability-free well through their early 90s, at the average of 93.",
        "So they're living 33 or more years beyond the age of 60, disability-free.",
        "So living to 100 is actually a wonderful thing.",
        "A few other things is that their kids are very much following in the footsteps of their parents, these people in their 70s and early 80s who have 50- to 60- percent reduced rates of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and hypertension.",
        "That's one of the clues for us, just how strong this was running in families and why we needed to move forward with a genetic study.",

        "Just one, and we don't know the patterns.",

        "That's one of the places we're headed.",
        "We're also very interested in looking at other centenarian - non-Caucasian.",
        "This was a study mostly of Caucasians, and we collaborate closely with another study in Japan that has a similar number of extremely old individuals, that is people over the age of 105, that we like to look at with them and see what signatures they have.",
        "I'm sure it's going to be different genetic variants.",
        "I'm sure they'll have signatures associated with exceptional longevity, but it'll be really interesting and important to see what the differences are.",
        "Why would you expect them to be different?",
        "Well, Asians if - geneticists will tell you that the variations of a whole - a very large number of genes, the frequency of those variations in - or in Caucasians can be very different than in Hispanics and African-Americans and Asians.",
        "So even for something - there's a gene called Apolipoprotein E, and the E4 variation is known to be associated with Alzheimer's disease, and it can be very rare in some populations and quite common in others.",
        "So it's really important to look at these different groups.",
        "So you're saying don't everybody jump to conclusions very quickly on this stuff.",
        "Right.",
        "These things need to be kind of taken slowly, chewed upon and looked at in other studies before anybody jumps to any quick conclusions.",
        "I completely agree with that.",
        "And you're continuing to collect data and try to narrow down what these differences are.",
        "Yeah, well, there are some other important steps.",
        "We've - all these data and the results are going to be available.",
        "Certainly all the results are available on the Web, including these genes, and we anticipate and hope that other investigators are going to start looking at these genes, what pathways they govern, how they might interact to really try and start understanding the underlying biology of why some people age so slowly and, in some cases, avoid or markedly delay age- related diseases.",
        "And of course, what everybody wants is that longevity pill, their fountain of youth."

        "But I those will be useful in maybe slowing down aging a little bit, but more importantly, like the centenarians, markedly delaying disability and perhaps decreasing risk for age-related diseases like Alzheimer's.",
        "But in the 30 seconds we have, your other take-home message is most of us could probably live to 85 or 88 if we just take care of ourselves.",
