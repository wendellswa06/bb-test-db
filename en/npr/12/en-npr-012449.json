        "And as I understand it, celibacy became, well, mandatory - or almost mandatory - for Catholic priests in the 12th century.",
        "It's actually more complicated than that, and that's - part of the issue is that we usually a very simplified history of celibacy, including thinking that it's only one history when in fact, it has been a very diverse history depending on geographical locations, particular Catholic rites, and so on and so forth.",
        "It also depends what we understand by celibacy, because if we want to also oversimplify things, we should say that more than half of the history of Roman Catholicism, celibacy was actually optional for priests.",
        "And then again, until the 16th century, in many dioceses and parishes, it was still optional.",
        "What the Council of Trent does in 1545 and on is to make much more clear and - how do you say - defined much more of a rule that if the person wants to be a priest, that person cannot be married, and that if a person is a priest, that person cannot be married.",
        "So, though you say for more than half of the history of the Roman Catholic Church, celibacy was optional; nevertheless, for 450 years or so, it has not been."

        "As you might know, several Episcopal married priests that have renounced the Anglican Church, the Episcopal Church and have embraced Roman Catholicism have been admitted as married priests in the Roman Catholic Church.",
        "And besides that, Catholicism and communion with Rome, with the pope, is also a fixture of many Oriental churches - Maronite, Coptic and other Oriental churches where still, married men can be priests, which is different from priests being able to get married.",
        "And that is also a nuance that many people don't know about.",
        "There are many rites, and there are many periods and regions in the history of Roman Catholicism, where married men are or were admitted to be priests.",
        "But once a person is a priest, if he is not married, then that person cannot get married in most Catholic rites that are in communion with Rome, not just Roman Catholicism.",
        "And we're talking about priests, who are, of course, men.",
        "What about nuns?",
        "Has there been similar flexibility in the centuries about the women of the church?",
        "Yes.",
        "There were what were called begins(ph) in the history of the church that were women that lived basically a cloistered religious life with other women, and actually sometimes in shared monasteries with men, that lived as celibates during certain periods of their lives - for example, when their husbands were out in war, which could take years, and sometimes decades, until they came back.",
        "So they lived as nuns.",
        "They were married.",
        "Most monasteries, though, which is a different thing from priesthood - and again, there is a confusion in many people about these two aspects of Roman Catholicism - monasteries, both men monasteries and women monasteries have an old tradition of singlehood and chastity, of not getting married or of not being married anymore - because widowers and widows can become monks in many religious orders.",
        "And actually, one of the things that can be said is that one of the important factors in pushing celibacy for the priesthood in Roman Catholicism were precisely monks that became powerful in the church and religious orders that had a tradition of a monastic life and that became powerful in certain religions or periods of the history of the church, and ended up either favoring or imposing or enforcing celibacy also for the priesthood, for the priests that did not belong to monastic orders.",
        "And Professor Maduro, you've talked us through a lot of history, and so bring us up to date.",
        "Is there a live debate at this moment within the Catholic Church, in the Vatican, despite whatever the stories may be about Father Cutie, is this a live issue today?",
        "It is, indeed.",
        "It is, indeed, worldwide, and that for many reasons, if only because the celibate Roman Catholic priesthood has undergone, in the last 30 years, such a drastic reduction that the only way to really keep up with the needs of the faithful all over the world is going to be, sooner or later, the ordination both of married men and of women, single and married.",

        "St. Paul said the exact same thing.",
        "He said that those who wish to serve God without a divided heart should embrace celibacy.",
        "So the origins of clerical celibacy go all the way back to Jesus Christ and the early church.",
        "Yes, and we've heard from Professor Maduro they were not applied that way for many hundreds of years.",
        "Well, that's not true, because there were a number of priests, even during that period, who embraced celibacy.",
        "It looks very unlikely.",
        "It's true that it is a discipline of the church, and the church can change disciplines, but I don't see the church doing that because that would represent regress, not progress.",
        "A clerical priesthood is actually a deeper and more perfect understanding of the nature of the priesthood.",
        "Jim, from your experience, would some flexibility - or do you stick to the rules?",
        "Well, I think right now, the church is not sticking to the rules because it's allowing in married Episcopal and Lutheran churches who have - excuse me, clergy who have decided that the Roman Catholic Church is the more full and complete vehicle for their completion of their liturgical call.",
        "And so, I mean, it's already going on.",
        "I mean, I have no problems with saying that - you know, agreeing with Father Neumayr, who was saying that this is something that some people are called to.",
        "But we also have the - in the Oriental Rites clergy, who are, as long as they are married before they are ordained, they are allowed to function.",
        "I think it will call for a tremendous rethinking of how parishes function, but that's happening already with the closing and combining and joining of parishes because there's only one priest.",
        "Jim, just a slight correction.",
        "George Neumayr is an editor, which some would regard as more powerful than a priest, but…"
