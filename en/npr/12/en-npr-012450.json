        "It would also bring in issues of Catholic sexual morality in terms of, will the wife of the priest obey the very somewhat controversial encyclical of Paul VI, Humanae Vitae, banning artificial birth control?",
        "So the money issue and the sexual issues are the things that need to be brought up in terms of - at this change.",
        "And Chris, when you diocesan priests, you mean the parish priests, the people who we normally come in contact with.",
        "Yes.",
        "Priests do a lot of work.",
        "Parish priest is your basic priest who has obedience to his bishop, and that's where the, as I understand it, the promise of clerical celibacy goes to that human authority of the bishop.",
        "But people like myself, who are Carmelites, Jesuits, Benedictines, belong to a religious order, could never get married because we made our vow to God to be celibate and embrace that as a gift we felt we could share to the church.",
        "Otto Maduro, is this a distinction that is significant as far as you can see?",
        "Oh, yes, indeed.",
        "And it's basically the same distinction that I originally pointed out between monks on the one hand and priests on the other hand.",
        "One of the things that I would add to that is that, as Mr. Neumayr said, it is true that there have always been celibate priests, priests that have not been married, that have had no sex - at least that is known - and have had no children, and that at the same time, have no requirement in that direction from the church authorities.",
        "What is interesting and important in the present time is precisely that we have a debate around - the discussion around the issue of whether celibacy should be mandatory for all priests and required for the priesthood or, on the contrary, should we go back to the oldest and longest tradition of separating celibacy and singlehood and not having children and not being married on the one hand from the priesthood on the other hand, in the sense that they can be or not together.",
        "It's not an either-or - or was not an either-or for over 1,000 years - issue.",
        "Why shouldn't we go back to not making of it an either-or issue, especially when we have other rites in the Roman Catholic church and the Catholic church that don't have this as an either-or, and especially when we're losing so many priests in the Roman Catholic rite and have this need for more priests?",
        "And George Neumayr, let me ask you.",
        "That practical issue, again, reported by our first caller, the soon-to-be former priest in Boston, and indeed from Professor Maduro - as a practical matter, the church is running out of priests in this country.",
        "That has nothing to do with this issue.",
        "That has to do with modern liberalism seeping into the church and weakening the church and making it less attractive to males, to young males.",
        "If you reduce the priesthood to social work - glorified social work, as it were - then you're obviously not going to be appealing to a large number of young males who want to give up their entire lives or sacrifice something which is very good, marriage, for the sake of building up Christ's kingdom.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Chris.",
        "Let's see if we can go now - this is Tim - excuse me, Trim(ph), with us from Long Island.",

        "I mean, it was in the Bible with Aaron.",
        "Aaron was married and had children, you know?",
        "And yes, it should be a thing where listen, you have monks like myself that are more disciplined and are adhering to the discipline that, hey, we are celibate, this is who we are, stuff like that.",
        "Good afternoon.",

        "It doesn't have to do with, oh, celibacy or not celibacy.",
        "It has to do with the walk, the godly walk.",

        "And does the godly walk demand celibacy?",
        "Does the godly walk demand celibacy?",
        "In my book, no. In my book, no. It does necessarily have to do deal with celibacy.",
        "Again, the first churches or the first set of men that were holy, were people of Aaron, Moses.",
        "They had family, they had children, and their children grew up in the priesthood.",
        "And they were the first priests, and they went out and ministered.",
        "So, no, this issue here doesn't have to deal with this marriage or being celibate.",
        "That is, to me, it's an irregularity right there.",
        "You know, it's merely more of a political ploy in here more than anything else, and that's pretty much my view.",
        "And as far as the person that was on the phone talking about liberalism and the church, again, when you put church politics inside of what is really holy, you know, just - what's for God, for God, and what's for man, for man.",
        "You know what I'm saying?",
        "Leave the politics out of it.",
        "I really believe that this thing here has two components.",
        "You have people from one end that says, listen, I'm struggling with do I want to walk - have the walk with God - it's an individual walk.",

        "Right.",
        "But go back to St. Paul.",

        "Paul, obviously, wasn't saying that to denigrate marriage.",
        "He obviously thought marriage was also a good state.",
        "But if you're serving the Lord and you're giving yourself to the Lord entirely and serving the people of God, it is better to be in a state of freedom, which celibacy gives a person.",
        "Better, maybe, but could there not be two kinds of priests, two kinds of them?",
        "Well, as you've already said on the show, that is the case right now.",
        "There are some married priests.",
        "So, this is not an either/or situation.",
        "The issue really is, do you want a majority married priesthood, do you want 70 percent of your priests to be married?",
        "The church says no. Pope Benedict says no. He's written about this.",
        "He's talked about this.",

        "I am very positive about maybe changing this situation with the priests.",
        "I feel that maybe we - the Vatican needs to start listening to us, that maybe we should give the right to priest to get married, only because there's a lot of issues like the one we have this recent priest that just, you know, was caught with another woman, you know, at the beach, kissing and hugging.",
        "And then not only that, we've had, you know, many priests who has raped many boys and girls.",
        "So, it's important that we start changing.",
        "It's a modern world.",
        "But also, we're facing that if we decide to make changes like that, then situations such as if the priest gets married, well, then why follow the rules of the church.",
        "All that, we need to look into.",
        "Yes.",
        "And so it's very important that…",

        "Otto Maduro, is it time for the Catholic Church - you said as a practical matter, they're running short of priests - nevertheless, is it time for the Catholic Church to listen to, well, parishioners like Cecilia, or is it time for parishioners like Cecilia to listen to the church?",
        "Well, I think that it is time for our leadership in the Roman Catholic Church to listen more closely to the signs of the times, to listen more closely to our lay people.",
        "Let me say a couple of things in comment to the last things that I've heard in our conversation in TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "One is, I would insist with the monk that just spoke a few minutes ago - and I really love that position.",
        "That's the position of a monk that thinks he has chosen a way that is not necessarily either their way, the only one, nor necessarily better for everybody and for the church than all the ways - but probably complimentary.",
        "And what I would insist very much is that neither holiness nor efficiency are intrinsically tied to being either single or married, to either having or not having sex, to either having or not having a family.",

        "Go ahead, please.",
        "I don't think that this sort of either/or situation - it's not that marriage is an obstacle to holiness.",
        "It's that the nature of the priesthood is such that it makes more sense for that person to be totally available to the people of God, and to devote themselves entirely to worshipping God.",
        "Again, I think, you know, if you go back and you look at what Christ said and what St. Paul said and what many of the early fathers said, you would see that celibacy befits a ministry which exists for the sake of serving the Lord entirely.",
        "George Neumayr, thank you very much for your time today.",
