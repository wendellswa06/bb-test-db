        "He's been there since 1968, longer than any other Republican in the history of the Senate, and he got these, you know, housing renovations to his own house, and it took - basically, it took him down.",

        "He has a tough fight.",
        "I mean, he has six candidates running against him in the August 26th primary, none of whom are likely to beat him, but he has a very strong Democratic opponent, Mark Begich, a very popular mayor of Anchorage, Alaska and a state - now the Democrats have not won a Senate seat there since 1974.",

        "I don't think you can get anything more out of a meeting.",

        "So it's that recognition I think that is extremely important for Putin - this respect for him as the leader of a great power.",
        "You are one of a very small circle of people who's had the experience of advising an American president who is about to go sit down with Vladimir Putin.",
        "And I wonder what your advice is to this American president, to president Trump, heading into Helsinki.",
        "My advice would be, you need to have a plan.",
        "You need to have focus.",
        "You need to know what you want and that you need to be firm in pushing back when you think that President Putin is saying things that are either in error or a misstatement of what American purpose is in the world."
