        "Well, it was a bad jobs report for the president on his bus tour in Ohio this week.",
        "He was trying to walk a very fine line, saying that the country is going in the right direction but not fast enough.",
        "And, of course, in Ohio the unemployment rate is lower than the national average.",
        "That's true in many but not all of the battleground states.",
        "He's also trying to expand the frame of reference for voters, saying this trend started long before I was elected.",
        "Romney, on the other hand, has the much easier job.",
        "He can go out there and say the economy is weak, the president had his chance, he's not up to the job, it's time for someone new.",
        "We talk so much about how the economy can really make or break a president running for re-election.",
        "I mean, if unemployment does stay around this spot - 8.2 percent - I mean, I suppose the president will be relying more and more on getting his voter groups to turn out; the groups that came out last time - young voters and African-Americans.",
        "You say that he's confident in getting African-Americans to the polls.",
        "But are these groups mobilizing?",
        "Are you sensing that?",
        "A new documentary hits select theaters this weekend.",
        "It's called, \"\"No End in Sight,\"\" and it lays out misstep by misstep, exactly what happened in the early months of the war in Iraq that led to where we are today.",
        "It's a compelling and disquieting story told largely by the people who helped design and implement the U.S.",

        "Thanks so much for being with us, Charles.",
        "Thank you for having me.",
        "Well, the one thing to explain is that the polls have been all over the map all year long.",
        "The most perfect example is the day of the New Hampshire primary when everybody had Barack Obama winning big, and Hillary Clinton won the New Hampshire primary.",
        "Even on the - you know, even as they were voting, we thought it was going to happen.",
        "So the polls have been off.",
        "Clearly, Barack Obama perhaps may be - you know, the adulation he got in Germany with 200,000 people seeing him in Berlin, that didn't translate back home.",
        "And I suspect that - because basically, John McCain has not had a good couple of months.",
        "He's had gaps in his campaign and his campaign has stumbled.",
        "He's had bad photo-ops and things like this, bad opportunities to make news.",
        "But at the same time, the voters clearly do not understand or know or feel comfortable with Barack Obama, and that's why the race is still relatively close.",
        "But again, this is still July approaching August.",
        "We still have a long time to go before the election.",
        "In 1988, for example, in the middle of August, Michael Dukakis had a 17-point lead over Vice President George Bush, and of course, there was never a President Dukakis.",
        "Right.",
        "And there's a poll that's showing that likely voters - and we should explain what we mean by that - that he's up in the poll with - McCain is up in the poll with likely vote.",
        "Right.",
        "And these are people who are more likely to turn out.",
        "The lead that Barack Obama has in the Gallup Poll is among registered voters, and that's gone up to six points today.",
        "But among likely voters, most likely to turn out, McCain has that lead.",
        "But again, Barack Obama still has several months.",
        "Want to have a great convention, which he hopes to have and which he had in 2004, to make this case to the electorate.",
        "Because we saw at the end, with the final primaries against Hillary Clinton, more and more Democratic voters had doubts about Barack Obama, and that's reflected in the polls today.",
        "All right.",
        "We have some emails here with answers to the trivia question.",
        "Let's see if any of these people are right.",

        "When Richard Nixon picked Spiro Agnew in 1968, they didn't know that Agnew was taking bribes as governor of Maryland, you know, under the table, which is remarkable.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "When McGovern picked Thomas Eagleton in 1972, he had no idea about the electric shock therapy.",
