        "Congressman Barr, you were considered one of the most conservative members of Congress during your time there in the late '90s and the early 2000s.",
        "You introduced the 1996 Defensive Marriage Act, for example.",
        "But what is it about the Republican Party now that made you decide to leave it and become a Libertarian?",
        "Former Rep.",
        "BARR: How many hours do we have today?",
        "As some of us older folks remember, years ago when a fellow named Ronald Reagan was asked a similar question about why he left the Democrat Party and at the time joined the Republican Party, he said he didn't leave the Democrat Party, the Democrat Party left him.",
        "And that's very much how I feel, and a lot of sort of Libertarian-leaning Republicans feel that the new Republican Party - the Republican Party of this early 21st century - has veered so sharply from its fiscal conservancy roots, from its respect for individual liberty and its fighting for smaller government.",
        "It's veered so sharply from all of those core issues that we've been left far behind, those of us that used to be with the party but believed in smaller government and individual liberty.",
        "So I've formally left the Republican Party after a number of years of watching it move toward bigger government, more costly government, more powerful government.",
        "Was there a tipping point?",
        "Was there...",
        "Former Rep.",
        "BARR: I think probably more than anything else, a couple of areas that in years passed would have remained so esoteric that nobody would- that nobody would really pay attention to them but have become very important issues, sort of defining issues.",
        "One is the administration's disrespect for the great writ, the writ of habeas corpus, believing it can hold individuals, including American citizens, indefinitely, without granting them access to the court, one of the fundamental underpinnings of liberty in our country.",
        "And secondly, the rampant spying on American citizens under the guise of gathering foreign intelligence without warrants.",
        "That has done great harm to the very notion of privacy in our country.",
        "But you did vote for the Patriot Act, did you not?",
        "Former Rep.",
        "BARR: Yes.",
        "Which...",
        "Which increased the power of the government to eavesdrop on citizens.",
        "And that doesn't seem to...",
        "Former Rep.",
        "BARR: No. It - the Patriot Act did not deal with increased surveillance of Americans.",
        "The administration has done that quite separate from the Patriot Act.",
        "I did vote for the Patriot Act, as a number of folks did.",
        "At the time, after working on it to get the administration to scale some of its provisions back, they also made a number of promises to us that I guess a number of us naively believed, that when the president or the attorney general tells you something, you know, you can sort of believe it.",
        "In every instance in which they had assured us, for example, that the act would not be expanded, that it would not be abused, that it would not be used for non-terrorism cases, those sorts of things, in every instance they went back on those assurances that they'd given us.",
        "So I basically spent the last five years since leaving the Congress working with diverse groups such as the ACLU, the American Conservative Union and others, working to try and scale back the Patriot Act."

        "Hi, Craig.",

        "Now, we've had a lot of documentaries about the Iraq war.",
        "What is different about yours?",
        "What did you really set out to - what story did you set out to tell in this documentary that's different from others perhaps?",
        "I had a question.",
        "I go back and forth with some of my Libertarian friends about - I have sort of a moral issue about Libertarianism in terms of letting the market decide things.",
        "My question is, without - if you let the market decide and take care of things, for example, when it comes to, maybe, like Enron, sure, Enron, those guys were caught and punished, but not before all of these people lost their life savings.",
        "So if you have - if these companies are regulated, then supposedly they're supposed to stop that from happening so these people don't lose their market - don't lose their savings before the bad guys are caught.",
        "So - and maybe I'm not understanding Libertarianism correctly.",
        "So maybe you could explain that.",
        "You want a little more explanation of what Libertarianism stands for and...",
        "In terms of, like, letting the market decide things.",
        "To me, that seems sort of - I have a moral problem with that in that businesses don't necessarily make the moral choice, and showing Enron as an example.",
        "All right, great.",
        "Congressman Barr.",
        "Do that make sense?",
        "Former Rep.",
        "BARR: I think one mistake that some folks make is to equate regulation with the moral issue or to believe that simply because an industry or sector of the economy is regulated, somehow that's good.",
        "One can look at a whole range of sectors of our economy or industries that are heavily regulated and I don't think anybody could walk away from seeing the history of how those sectors have behaved, saying, oh, gee, this has not caused problems."

        "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and federal institutions that let mortgages are already very highly regulated.",
        "Of course, they're about to be more regulated.",
        "But the fact of the matter is, even if you have a regulated industry, if the taxpayers are somehow on the line to guarantee losses or risks, then what do you have?",
        "You have losses and bad risks.",
        "We also have, and Libertarians certainly believe in the power of using the courts, and in cases where fraud is committed, for example, the criminal law is to protect those who have a fraud or other illegal acts committed against them and their savings or resources where money is taken away.",
        "In the case of Enron and a number of other recent examples of corporate misdeeds, the problem has been not that there isn't regulation, there's more than enough regulation.",
        "But the government has failed in its responsibility of timely and effectively using the power of the criminal laws to protect people's savings and investments.",
        "Ken, did you want to jump in here?",

        "You said - we said that you supported the Patriot Act, you opposed gay marriage, you supported tough drug laws, and you supported the war in Iraq.",
        "Now, are those still your views and is that - do you see that as the views of the Libertarian party?",
        "Former Rep.",

        "You'll find a number of Libertarians like myself that believe that some - many of the issues that you ticked off there should be and should remain issues that people at the state level and then their community should decide, not the federal government.",
        "For example, on the issue of marriage, even though I am personally opposed to same-sex marriage, I believe that if that is what people in a particular state - and this ought to be a status, you're not the federal government dictating anything - but the people in a particular state, Massachusetts, California.",
        "If my state of Georgia, which has not recognize same-sex marriages, if people of Georgia decide to, then I think that ought to be respected by the other states and by the federal government.",
        "But you're running for president of the United States, so is that a national position that you're taking on these issues, or it's just state-by-state issues?",
        "Former Rep.",
        "BARR: Well, the federal government ought not to be involved in dictating policy in these areas.",
        "It ought to be up to the people of the states.",
        "And if the people of the states, for example, decide that they wish to recognize and allow medicinal marijuana, I believe, and most Libertarians, I dare say, believe that the federal government ought not to be able to come in with the heavy hand or hammer of federal prosecution and override the decision that the people of the state have made.",

        "Now people in different communities may decide that they want to have certain types of social services agencies, and for so long, for example, as we have a taxation system as we currently have, which we'd like to change, but as long as we have the current system, it certainly make sense to provide incentives for individuals, local governments to provide tax - tax benefits, for example, to donations, to social services agencies.",
