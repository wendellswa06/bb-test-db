        "BARR: I have no idea what you're talking about because the fact that tens of billions of dollars, U.S.",
        "taxpayer dollars, were wasted as the government mandated a government-directed effort in Hurricane Katrina, certainly it would seem to me to indicate that probably the least efficient method of bringing relief to individuals on at least a large as happened in Katrina is the government.",
        "As a matter of fact, if you study what happened down in Katrina, in New Orleans, in the aftermath and continuing even to this day to address the problems arising from the hurricane tragedy nearly three years ago, you'll find, I suspect, that those instances in which people were actually demonstrably helped were not those that were mandated or controlled by the government but were those that were in the hands of private businesses and private charities.",
