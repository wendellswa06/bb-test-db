        "Yes.",
        "The looting doesn't quite convey what happened in Iraq and in Baghdad as soon as American forces took over the country and opposed Saddam.",
        "First, it was looting.",

        "And that extended to all of the cultural, literary, and historical sites in Baghdad and in Iraq including the national archives and the national museum, which were completely devastated.",
        "One of the things your film does very effectively is build the case that there were certain decisions made, and that each of those decisions up the ante in terms of Iraqi anger, which ultimately led to the insurgencies and the very difficult situation that we find ourselves in there now.",
        "Looting was one.",
        "The decision you - to let go of the military as you already you mentioned, deBaathification was another.",

        "But after the deBaathification order, after the disbanding of Iraqi army, when the insurgency began to arise and also because the United States didn't have enough troops to secure the borders of Iraq, and of course, wasn't using the Iraqi army to secure those borders because the Iraqi army had been disbanded, foreign fighters began to move in to Iraq.",
        "And as Iraq descended into chaos, it became easier and easier for those foreign fighters to operate.",
        "And, now, we find that al-Qaida and al-Qaida in Mesopotamia are significant forces in the country.",

        "Most of the insurgency is domestic, and most of the violence in Iraq is domestic and not linked to al-Qaida.",
