        "It is hard to say this with a straight face, but your team is actually working to try and make materials that are invisible.",
        "It's not that the material is invisible, the goal is to design and make these materials such that they will bend the light around an object.",
        "What's achieved by bending the light?",
        "Well, think about a rock in a stream, in a river, for example.",
        "So, the water bend around the rock.",
        "But after they pass the rock, they just keep flowing as it wasn't there.",
        "So if you try to sense(ph) the water, let's say, few yards after the rock, you don't really know if there was a rock there from the first place or not.",
        "So this is the principle that is being used for cloaking.",
        "We just designed some special kind of material.",
        "It's a meta material, I gather.",
        "OK, yes.",
        "So what we have shown in the lab is two different meta materials that ultimately show that we can bend light backwards.",
        "You will not be able to go to Target next month and get this off the shelf, but it is definitely a major step because it shows that you can control how the light is bent just by designing these special materials.",
        "Does this mean somebody could cover themselves with meta materials and sit in a bus station, and no one would see him or her.",
        "Well, when they think it will be commercial, then I would say yes.",
        "The problem is that also he will not able to see those who sits next to him."

        "So we find most of our victims are owners of SUVs or pickup trucks, vehicles that tend to have more of a ground clearance.",
        "So these people can simply just slide up underneath the vehicle, find the converter and just cut it away from the exhaust pipe, and they're gone in no time at all.",
        "And so it must be lucrative.",
        "I mean what does one sell for on the black market?",
        "Well, thats where it gets interesting because there are one of three precious metals that are used in each converter, and that depends on the converter.",
        "And every kind of vehicle has certain kind of catalytic converter and these things are rather standard size for a small sedan and much larger for bigger vehicles.",
        "So there's going to be different amounts of those three kinds of metals within each converter.",
        "So let's say there's - I mean just grams - Im not sure what the weight is, but it takes a bit of that material to make it lucrative to somebody.",
        "But when those prices on some of these metals were approaching nine, 10 thousand dollars, as they were a couple of years ago, that makes it very attractive for all the parties."
