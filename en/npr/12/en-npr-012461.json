        "We're about 40 miles away from where Stardust actually came down, but we could see the red-orange glow of the spacecraft as it came in, and there were cheers here, cheers also closer to where it landed where the recovery crews were gathered and some of the principal scientists were gathered.",
        "And they were all nervous because 16 months ago we had a similar kind of mission end here in a very different way with a crash landing, and that was because the parachutes on that Genesis spacecraft failed to open.",
        "The device that was supposed to trigger those parachutes had been installed backward.",
        "Well, the same kind of device and the same parachute system was on Stardust, so there was some concern that maybe they wouldn't work right.",
        "But they did.",
        "Both parachutes opened and Stardust did float to the ground safely, and they're out there now recovering the spacecraft.",
