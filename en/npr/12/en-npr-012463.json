        "The biggest requirement is that you have a loan that's backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - the giant government-sponsored mortgage firms.",
        "The loan had to be made prior to June of 2009, and you have to be paying your mortgage.",
        "Tens of millions of Americans, though, fall into that category.",
        "And the president says something he can do right now is to help more of them to refinance.",
        "Which could save you hundreds of dollars a month and thousands of dollars a year on mortgage payments.",
        "This refinance plan is not a new idea, though.",
        "A pair of economists at Columbia University, Chris Mayer and Glenn Hubbard, for years now have been proposing a refinancing plan that sounds very much like this to help the economy.",
        "They've been speaking on NPR and publishing op-ed pieces in the major newspapers, speaking at congressional hearings.",
        "And now with the president himself announcing the plan, it certainly sounds like the day has come when their proposal is becoming a reality.",

        "This has finally spurred some real action, I hope.",

        "They couldn't believe that the president's campaign committee or the White House could be connected to something like this.",
        "And meanwhile, the Nixon administration was castigating The Post and our reporting every day.",
        "It left us in a very isolated position where we were concerned about the future of the paper, the future of our careers, if this story didn't pan out in the way we thought it would.",

        "I knew that he was high-ranking, but I didn't know how high-ranking.",
        "And as a matter of fact, it wasn't very important what job he held, so long as he did one thing; and that was tell the truth.",

        "Bradlee's strengths were often also closely linked to his weaknesses.",
        "The star system that orbited around him led to tensions within the newsroom.",
        "A celebration for a Pulitzer for one of those young stars, an expose by Janet Cooke about an 8-year-old heroin addict, turned to ash in just hours.",

        "They're saying it's not.",
        "And you need somebody behind you saying, keep at it.",
        "And that was Bradlee's message in a thousand different ways.",
        "Remnick says it was almost touching.",
        "Several of the senior editors competing to replace Bradlee adopted some of his sartorial traits, his reading glasses on a string, the slicked-back hair, the striped shirts.",
        "After decades of Bradlee's leadership, no one could imagine an editor with a different look.",
        "Len Downie succeeded Bradlee in 1991, a less flamboyant, more careful newsroom leader with a dedication to investigative reporting.",
        "But the paper continued to carry Bradlee's trademark swagger.",
        "After his retirement, Bradlee served as a vice president at large for the paper's parent company, a charismatic emblem for the glory of the paper's journalism, even as it as it hit rocky economic times.",

        "We've got the traditional downtown, and an area we call Midtown that is becoming really very attractive, attractive to new businesses that are, in turn, attracting a new demographic: a younger, more educated population coming into these areas, filling in jobs in technology, some attracted by the businesses that were here before, but many actually starting up new businesses that are trying to change - change the nature, change the trajectory of the city of Detroit.",
        "Would you call this group of people the newcomers, a lot of them, urban pioneers, in a sense?",
        "In a sense they are pioneers.",
        "They are pioneering because they're coming into an area that had been unattractive for decades.",

        "In fact, it's been identified as 7.2 square miles of a city that is almost 140 square miles.",
