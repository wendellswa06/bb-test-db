        "As NPR's Scott Horsley reports, that deadline has sent homebuyers racing and has lawmakers thinking about extending the credit.",

        "Right.",
        "And so, East decided to do a study to figure out if having an older sister who got pregnant really did affect the likelihood that the younger sister would find herself in the same position.",
        "She compared a large number of sister pairs, all with the same socioeconomic and life circumstances, and found that the behavior of the older sibling did often change the trajectory of the younger.",
        "The younger sisters are five times more likely to get pregnant, as other young women who have an older sister who hasn't been pregnant.",
        "Five times.",

        "Both can have an effect.",

        "Now, Rende says you can see older siblings' influence in all kinds of families, whether they're rich or they're poor.",
        "But their power is especially magnified in the subset of families he studies: families that are psychologically unstable.",
        "There, the power of an older sibling is much greater because parents are often not around, and so siblings are spending a lot of time together."
