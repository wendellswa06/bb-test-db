        "It's not clear if the version of the public insurance option that emerges from Congress will allow the federal government to negotiate with insurance plans, so giving states the power is a way of hedging their bets.",
        "Cantwell says it's a key part of cost control.",
        "Already, more than a dozen states offer some sort of insurance subsidy for working adults.",
        "This would expand those programs.",
