        "And instead, what Benghazi means to the American public, as you just mentioned at the top of the hour, is this terrible incident with the death of Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I think he paid some price but much less than the price - if you think about the price of intervention in a war - this is the political price domestically that you pay.",

        "I mean, there's - over and over again, you see that, you know, their countries are very reluctant to do this.",
        "And what pressures a democratic government into this kind of intervention is a lot of pressure from the media, from human rights groups, and that finally sort of, over time, can come to take root with public opinion.",

        "Definitely.",
        "I mean, you'll have cases where you have a strategic motive or an imperialist motive.",
        "And I think that there, you know, there is always a lot of suspicion that when a super power says we're intervening, but the reason why we're doing it is because we have the highest interest of humanity in mind, that a lot of people around the world are very suspicious of this.",
        "And I think that also Americans tend to forget that after Iraq, after Abu Ghraib, after Guantanamo, the U.S.",

        "Yeah, although, actually, I think Saddam Hussein would've been perfectly happy to sell the United States lots and lots of oil; would've provided a certain amount of stability.",
        "But that's right.",
        "I mean, I think there's always this question, why are you intervening in one place rather than another?",
        "And I don't think you're ever going to get complete consistency, and I don't even think that that's right standard, that you, you know, you would say there are many places around the world where really terrible things are happening.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I think, you know, almost all of these things, once you start, there is significant pressure for it to escalate.",
        "So when, you know, another example, when Bill Clinton starts NATO air strikes in Serbia, in the Kosovo War in 1999 to protect Kosovar Albanians who were being massacred by Serbian nationalists, then the Clinton administration starts out doing air strikes and then comes under lots and lots of pressure to say air strikes aren't enough, air strikes are not really saving civilian populations on the ground.",

        "But if you're arming the rebels in Syria, does that create more pressure for you to support them or does it mean that the rebels can stand on their own two feet, which means less pressure on the Obama administration to get involved?",
