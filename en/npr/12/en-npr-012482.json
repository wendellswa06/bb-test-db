        "Of course, scientific debates didn't stop there.",
        "New contradictory research surfaces all the time.",
        "And then others come out saying no, the original theory was the correct one.",
        "And then some studies in the top journals are retracted, as happened just a few weeks ago with a study in Science that claimed to have found the genetic signature of longevity, only to be retracted due to technical errors with a flawed chip.",
        "With all that flip-flopping, how do you know when you can actually trust the science, not to mention cases of scientific misconduct, fraud, when researchers fudge the numbers or even invent patients.",
        "If they get caught, their papers are retracted from journals ideally, but then what?",
        "Many times that bad science is never really truly forgotten.",
        "Scientists continue to cite those studies, and busy physicians continue to rely on them, perhaps putting patients at risk even after those studies have been debunked.",

        "Well, if the field is no longer relevant, I guess doctors aren't relying on it anymore, but you do wish that the literature had a purity that it probably doesn't have.",
        "Ivan?",
        "I would agree.",
        "I think it's an interesting question whether or not say a body of work on a treatment, a medication for hepatitis C, just using Grant's example, should that be retracted once a vaccine that we have sort of demonstrated is effective comes out and is proven.",
        "On the other hand, you know, maybe that's a question about just again the progress of science.",
        "I guess the one thing that we've been looking at, at Retraction Watch, Adam Marcus and I, he's my co-blogger there, should something that can't be reproduced be retracted?",
        "In other words, if another group of scientists try and do something, according to what it says was the protocol in that old paper, and they can't do it, or they do it, and they get a different result a number of times, there's actually some debate over whether that should be retracted.",

        "If you look at it the moment it was quote-unquote \"\"retracted\"\" and it's not there, I don't know if that counts.",
        "But if you look a certain amount of time later - and granted I think you've actually, this is part of one of your studies, you found that about a third of papers just simply weren't noted.",
        "Yes.",
        "You could get to a PDF of the paper without knowing that that was retracted.",
        "And if I may go right back to what Grant was saying, I think that's an excellent point about Nature and Science, again the world's sort of leading journals, certainly in the basic sciences.",
        "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has also a very high number, in fact I think higher than either of them but as per capita, in other words, per paper, I don't know what the appropriate, you know, Greek or Latin is there, it's not necessarily higher."
