        "Grant, I was - I interrupted you.",
        "I interrupted my own question when I asked you have patients actually been put at risk.",
        "Yeah, I asked the question whether patients had been put at risk in any papers that had been retracted between about 2000 and 2010.",
        "And I specifically looked at those, each of the 180 clinical papers that had been retracted and tallied up the number of people enrolled and patients treated.",
        "And the numbers were rather large.",
        "But then if you look at how many patients were enrolled in studies that were influenced by those retracted papers, the numbers are astronomical.",
        "So to complete the circle, the number of patients enrolled in a retracted study was over 28,000.",
        "So this is 28,000 people spread among 180 different retracted studies.",
        "And of those 28,000, something over 9,000 actually received treatment of some sort.",
        "Now if you look at the secondary papers, the papers that were influenced by those retracted papers, over 400,000 patients were enrolled, and then roughly about 70,000 were treated.",
        "Those are gigantic numbers.",
        "And did the patients receive bad treatments as a result?",
        "Well, in some cases yes, and in some cases no, and in some cases the treatment may have been quite trivial.",
        "It's hard to, after the fact, go back and figure out how much risk a patient actually was in.",
        "In most cases, probably not very much because the institutional review board at the institution where the patients were treated should be looking out for the welfare of the patients.",
        "So you wouldn't want to ever have patients enrolled in the study where they were really at risk.",
        "On the other hand, you wouldn't want to have any patients at all enrolled in a study that's built on false premises.",
        "Ivan?",
        "You know, what Grant is saying is absolutely right, and I would just sort of focus on what he just said about institutional review boards, IRBs, which again are overworked.",

        "But certainly, this was an oncologist who - no one can reproduce his results.",

        "Yeah.",

        "Exactly.",
