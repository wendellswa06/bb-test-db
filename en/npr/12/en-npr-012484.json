        "Well, I think - I stand by that.",
        "I know that looking back on my own papers there are things that I wish I had done differently.",
        "But I would say that most of those errors are quite trivial, like a reference number that is supposed to lead to one citation actually leads to another, something like that, a typo that you didn't catch in the galleys.",
        "I think that there are very, very few papers that are completely free of overt error.",
        "And then, if you throw in the mix whether or not those papers stand the test of time, I think nearly no paper is perfect.",
        "I'll be daring and say no paper is perfect.",

        "Companies called them up to ask for their services to review research.",

        "And IRBs are under a lot of pressure.",
        "In fact, what I think Nancy is referring is the FDA did a sting of, quote, unquote, \"\"for-profit IRBs.\"\" Most of the time these IRBs are within institutions, so NYU, my alma mater, Columbia will have an IRB, again, overworked.",
        "You want to get your stuff through the pipeline, you're going to go to a for-profit IRB.",
        "It's a relatively new development.",
        "So they were looking at that, and they did find - they created this sort of fake protocol and fake company and they did find some serious gaping holes."
