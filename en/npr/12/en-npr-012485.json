        "So, for the Trump administration, obviously there's an effort to repeal Obamacare that we fell short on.",
        "But the tax reform agenda, the regulatory agenda, the confirmation of judges certainly were big things they were able to be accomplished on a partisan manner.",
        "As you say, the next couple years, it's a question of what can actually be accomplished in a bipartisan manner, which is a different equation entirely.",
        "What kind of conversations are they having right now in your old office?",
        "I'm probably more bullish, Michel, in believing there's actually more that can get accomplished.",
        "I think that the president always had more affinity for the Democrat plan on infrastructure spending, and I think that's - could be a big opportunity for the next couple years.",
        "And I also think there's opportunity on drug pricing - that the president probably has some opinions that are more in line with Democrat thinking on that issue as well.",
        "Of course, though, the White House leg affairs team is going to be handling a lot of subpoenas for information or inquiries for investigations.",
        "And against that backdrop will be, what do Democrats in the House decide to do regarding investigations or potential impeachment hearings?",
        "And how does that impact the legislative agenda, too?",
        "But let's talk about how the Trump commission deals with its own caucus, the Republicans, at the moment.",
        "Because, as you just pointed out, there are issues on which the president says that he has more affinity with the Democrats' perspective than with a number of the Republican conservatives, for example - the sort of people who see themselves primarily as conservatives.",
        "They don't like those big stimulus packages.",
        "They don't want to see changes in the trade agreement with Mexico and Canada.",
        "So how do you deal with them?",
        "So I think they're each a little bit different.",
        "Let's talk infrastructure for one second because I think, typically, Republicans have talked a good game about being concerned about spending, and we have a debt that's now over $21 trillion.",
        "But, in reality, when push comes to shove, Republicans haven't shown much more willingness to stop spending than Democrats have.",
        "And so when you have an infrastructure spending bill that actually would provide resources back to their home state, I think you could see an avenue where Republicans work with the president.",
        "Keep in mind as well that the president, I think, has more leverage now over the Senate because, in many cases, those members who won in this midterm cycle, I think, owe a lot of that victory to the president.",
        "And some of the president's biggest opponents among the Republicans in the Senate, whether or not it's the passing of John McCain and the retirement of Bob Corker, retirement of Jeff Flake, means he has a Republican conference that's more in line.",
        "So I think he has more leeway to say, hey, look - I've helped you.",
        "I need your help on this infrastructure package.",
        "And what about on big issues where the parties really do have very different philosophies about the way forward?",
        "I'm thinking about immigration.",
        "How do you navigate something like that?",

        "...Executive orders and the courts.",
        "In the 16 days since Super Tuesday, Hillary Clinton has not won a single primary or caucus.",
        "Barack Obama's victory in the Democrats abroad a global primary, which was announced today, makes it 11 in a row.",
        "And with contests in the crucial states of Texas and Ohio less than two weeks away, the Clinton camp is going to have to do something big if she's going to get back into the race."
