        "often, it ceased to be extraordinary and was folded into my daily routine long ago - like brushing my teeth or surfing the Internet.",
        "So routine, that I don't exactly know when the epiphany hit.",
        "But let's pick a likely moment from the last five years.",
        "I'm at a party.",
        "Nice party.",
        "I'm one of a sprinkling of self-conscious black people who are nonetheless feeling very good about being here.",
        "I'm thinking that there's some social equality after all, that being at this party among these people is something my parents' generation could never have dreamed of doing on a regular basis.",
        "I'm chatting with a white person I've just met who's on the young side of middle-age like me - decent, educated, pretty friendly.",
        "We start talking about where we're from, our families that sort of thing.",
        "He mentions that he had relatives who fought in World War II.",
        "So did I, I say.",
        "My great Uncle Lester, he was actually at D-day in Normandy.",
        "Though he didn't fight, of course, he drove a supply truck.",
        "The person I'd just met looks at me blankly, not understanding.",
        "Black people didn't fight in World War II, I go on.",
        "Oh, his face says, segregated - race.",
        "He nods sympathetically, a little too sympathetically.",
        "I'm sorry, his face is saying.",
        "How awful for you.",
        "He's treating this rather humdrum fact about my Uncle Lester like an illness, like it was bad moment for me.",
        "I suddenly realized that his sympathy is merely a cover-up for ignorance.",
        "He doesn't know the troops were segregated in World War II.",
        "He has no idea.",
        "And he doesn't know that the segregated troops aren't about me at all.",
        "They're about us.",
        "It's American history and he doesn't know it.",
        "I started to wonder, what else doesn't he know?",
        "What else do I have to spontaneously - sometimes reluctantly but always passionately - educate him",
        "know, especially in 2006.",
        "A political era in which facts in history are officially regarded as stupid things, as Ronald Reagan once famously said.",
        "But beyond the almost religious disregard of history, is a great indifference to history in general, especially the racial history.",
        "But as a non-person, a representation of somebody black but not a real black person with all that messy history attached - like black people were in the ‘60s.",
        "Isn't that over, white people seem to want to know - even as they nod in sympathy as I go on about my Uncle Lester?",
        "Can't we just talk now?",
        "Well, yes and no. Sure, I can talk about Tom Cruise's baby with the best of them.",
        "The price of oil, the latest Italian restaurant that just opened up in that part of town that was once dead, but now is becoming so hip.",
        "You see, knowledge is never random.",
        "We choose to talk about things, even small things, because they connect us to some part of ourselves.",
        "With the exception of black people themselves, race evidently connects no one to anything anymore, and that alarms me.",
        "It's taken me about 20 years to accept that history moves, not in straight lines but in ellipses and circles, and that the window of the ‘60s that we take for granted was one of the biggest aberrations in American history.",
        "So, the job of my generation, as it was for all the generations before it, is to agitate.",
        "That means, among other things, to remind people at parties, and boardrooms, and newsrooms, and in line at Starbucks - of who we are, of who we were."

        "In Ohio, you've got a lot of blue-collar voters, kind of white, downscale women that have been very good for Clinton in the past.",
        "In Texas, up to 40 percent of the Democratic electorate could be Latino.",
        "But the problem is that Obama has been making inroads into those demographic groups, and also at least in Texas, the rules for apportioning delegates might favor him.",
        "The kinds of districts where there are high numbers of African-American voters, because they have performed well in past elections, they are awarded more delegates than the big Hispanic districts because traditionally, their Democratic turnout has not been as high.",

        "That's right.",
        "I think that neither candidate is going to get the 2,025 delegates - 2,025 delegates they're going to need by the end of the primary season, so the superdelegates are going to be necessary to put one of them over the top.",

        "But, maybe, in the end, there's not going to be a contradiction between those two things.",
        "And a lot of superdelegates might, in the end, think that going against their constituents is not a good thing for the party in November because that would cause a big rift.",
        "I think once the primary season is over, once we've gotten past at least Pennsylvania on April 22nd, you're going to see the superdelegates start to sort themselves out."
