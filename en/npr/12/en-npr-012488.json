        "Well, I think there are a lot of elements.",
        "I mean, I think obviously the cover itself has to be inherently interesting and arresting both visually and in terms of the language or lack of language, but I think what you also see in the covers that came out on top of this contest is that really memorable covers capture a moment that is emotional and dramatic to begin with and they sort of crystalized that moment for readers.",
        "I think the Lennon cover came out on top both because it's a really distinctive cover that still holds up but also because that was such an emotional moment.",

        "Magazine covers from the 1960s dominated this top 40 list.",
        "Why do you think that is?",
        "Well, I wouldn't say they dominated, but they were certainly very well represented.",
        "I think there are two answers to that.",
        "One was that it was just a very dramatic time.",
        "The one decade that didn't do so well was the '80s.",
        "I think it's partly a reflection of the fact that even though some interesting things happened in the '80s, they were nowhere near as dramatic in terms of political and social change as the '60s, but I think the other reason that the covers from the '60s hold up and the people remember is that new vocabularies in terms of cover treatment, a new way of approaching magazine covers visually and in terms of language and humor were all being introduced at the time.",
        "So some of the things, for example, that George Lois, the great cover director for Esquire, did in the '60s, since then, you know, his style and that style has been widely copied.",
        "So it doesn't seem all that new anymore, but at the time it was deeply original, and I think everybody remembers that.",
        "The number three magazine cover on this list was his photograph of Muhammad Ali from Esquire magazine in 1968.",
