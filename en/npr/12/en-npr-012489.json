        "Every four years, we do this big yearlong reporting project of the behind-the-scenes story of the election, and we get it all ready and we close on election night and print it the next day.",

        "Exactly.",
        "Exactly.",
        "But, you know, we still went ahead and published our project and what we did for the cover was to take an image of George Bush and an image of Al Gore and morph them.",
        "And it turned out visually actually that they morphed very well.",
        "And the cover line was, `The Winner is...,' and it sort of captured the fact that the outcome wasn't determined but also the surreal nature of that election night and the weeks that followed.",

        "We're all familiar by now with what's happened with subprime mortgages.",
        "As more borrowers have defaulted on those loans, lenders have taken huge losses, some have gone out of business.",

        "Lending standards have tightened for consumers and businesses.",
        "The cost of borrowing has gone up and that slowed down what had been a booming corporate buyout market.",
        "The stock market has also taken a hit.",
        "So while nobody's really expecting a change in interest rates today, they want to know that the Fed is watching the situation and will act if necessary.",
        "Well, what would that action look like?",
        "Well, the Fed's in kind of a tough spot.",
        "On one hand, you know, if they acknowledge that there's a serious credit problem, investors could panic.",
        "But if they ignore it altogether, they appear to be asleep at the switch.",
        "Eventually some people believe the Fed may need to lower interest rates to free up capital, stimulate growth.",
        "But I spoke with Charles Lieberman.",
        "He's the chief investment officer for Advisors Capital Management.",
        "And he says the Fed may not even need to lower interest rates to get investors feeling confident again.",
        "What's happened, of course, is a panic.",
        "And a panic just reflects a quantum change in people's thinking.",
        "And it can change as quickly going back the other way if all of a sudden people realize the sky isn't falling.",
        "So it's a difficult road for the Fed because they're dealing with market psychology, not with simple financial dynamics.",
        "There's another reason the market may not need the Fed's intervention, which is that Fannie Mae, the country's largest buyer of home loans, has asked its regulator for permission to essentially buy more mortgages and Lieberman says if that happens, that may inject enough capital into the mortgage market to relieve some of this credit crunch.",
        "Now, there's other news today about how the economy is doing.",
        "That's right.",
        "In general the Fed has still been more concerned about the risk of inflation than the weakening economy, and some new numbers out today suggest that the Fed has been right to worry about that.",
        "Labor costs rose about 4.5 percent between June of last year and this June.",
        "And while that's great for workers, you know, who are earning more, it's also a sign of underlying inflation, so we may expect the Fed to express that concern again in its statement today."
