        "Let me close by asking a question of both of you: are there any incentives out there to change this market, to slow down the illegal killing of these rhino?",
        "Let's start with you, Frank.",
        "Well, in Vietnam, there's been a lot of critical media attention on rhino horn, and there are also public information campaigns basically describing it as an overpriced placebo that doesn't do very much.",
        "I did talk to some older users, and they actually had stopped using it because they didn't find that it was really helping them.",
        "Some people say Vietnam is a particularly faddish culture, and one of the hopes is that, you know, with a strong public information campaign, they can begin to change minds there.",

        "There are now some conservancies getting drones.",

        "To run through the three: legalization is a very controversial idea.",
        "It's coming from economists in South Africa.",
        "So, these economists imagine a world where you have rhino farmers and they're selling the horn to meet the demand.",
        "And then somehow, although this part not fully explained, somehow they calculate that that would also decrease the black market, decrease the illegal poaching.",
        "Now, dehorning is an idea coming from Kenya, where it's somewhat of an internal memo circulating around the halls of the Kenyan government, would be to cut off the horns of many of Kenya's rhino and burn them publicly as a kind of message that nobody's entitled to rhino horn if the rhino can't have it himself.",
        "That may not work because even after you cut the horn from a rhino there's still a little bit left.",
        "And even current prices, even that little bit is something valuable or dehorned rhino will be poached.",
        "The last idea, kind of the most radical, is poisoning.",
        "There are some rhino ranchers in Namibia and South Africa who are poisoning their horns.",
        "The poison allegedly does not hurt the animal but it could kill anyone who eats the rhino powder.",
