        "That's because they fired up the Large Hadron Collider again.",
        "The LHC is the world's most powerful particle collider.",
        "Last week, it achieved the first collisions between the two beams of protons, and this week, they set the record for the most energetic proton beams, passing Fermi Labs' previous record.",
        "And they've actually had some collisions.",
        "That's good.",

        "If you're on Twitter, you can tweet us with your questions by writing to the @ sign, followed by scifri, and if you want more information about what we'll be talking about this hour, go to our Web site at www.sciencefriday.com, where you'll find links to our topic.",
        "So Drew Baden, for those of us, or those of our listeners who have sort of forgotten about the LHC, give us a little primer on what it's all about."

        "That's the European acronym, Center for European Research Nuclear.",
        "And it's right in the corner of Switzerland, straddling the border between Switzerland and France, right outside Geneva.",
        "And it's - so it's at the base of the Jura Mountains, which are a little north and west of the city.",
        "And the lab there has been - was built in the '50s, and it's a fairly decent-sized lab with decent-sized accelerators that have gotten bigger and bigger over time.",
        "Right, and it's got this big ring that goes across the border, 17 miles in diameter, I understand.",
        "Actually, it's 17 miles in circumference.",
        "Circumference.",
        "Yeah, and that's right.",
        "It's too big to be on site at the lab.",
        "So it's deep underground and straddles the border, and it's between the mountains and the lake on the plains there.",
        "And it's - the whole thing sits in a plain.",
        "It's perfectly - the ring defines a plane as perfectly flat, and it's underground about 100 meters here, 100 meters there, maybe a little bit.",
        "Right."

        "But so it's deep underground.",
        "Right, and so the idea is to take these two beams going in opposite directions around this ring, and in about eight different spots around the ring, you can bring them together so they head-on collision into one another.",
        "And then there are these detectors that look at the collisions and decide what they're seeing.",
