        "Hey, hey, Scott.",
        "Good morning.",
        "You spent a lot of time with Michael Cohen this week.",
        "And you asked the question that got him to say he was aware of other illegal activity, in addition to hush money to mistresses and using charity to pay for his own portrait - other illegal activity that was being looked at by the Southern District of New York.",
        "Did you ask him about that in private hearing?",
        "Did he spill the beans on that?",
        "Well, thanks, Scott.",
        "We - I can't get into the details of that testimony in the private hearing.",
        "But what I can say is he will likely be examined on that in the private setting.",
        "He had so much to say on so many questions that, quite frankly, we asked him to voluntarily come in next week.",
        "And he agreed so that he could continue with his really fascinating testimony.",
        "And with regard to that misconduct, I would just point to one previous question that I asked in the hearing.",
        "I asked about his conversation with the president - his last conversation with the president or his advisers.",
        "And apparently, it happened two months after the raid.",
        "And he wouldn't get into it because he said that, too, is under investigation by the Southern District of New York.",
        "President Trump supporters say that Michael Cohen's a liar.",
        "And who could believe him?",
        "But they did urge people to believe two things - one, that he testified Donald Trump didn't tell him directly to lie to Congress.",
        "And two, he said he saw no evidence of collusion with Russia.",
        "Are those two points in the president's favor?",
        "Well, I think that when he said he did not see direct evidence of collusion, I think that there's definitely some kind of confusion on that.",
        "Because at the same time he said that, he also talked about overhearing a conversation on the speaker phone in President Trump's office at the Trump Organization where the president and Roger Stone talked about an upcoming dump of emails attacking Hillary Clinton by WikiLeaks.",
        "And, again, that was something that was new news.",
        "And it had been previously denied - these types of conversations - by both President Trump and Mr. Stone.",
        "And so that could be some evidence of, you know, a conspiracy or collusion.",
        "And therefore, we have to continue to investigate.",
        "You've been raising questions about Jared Kushner's security clearance for a couple of years.",
        "Should he have one?",
        "No.",
        "He should not - well, he should not have top-secret security clearance.",
        "You know, there are at least three problems - one is that he had numerous errors and omissions on his initial security clearance form where he did not report foreign contacts.",
        "Two, he has tremendous financial vulnerabilities, including this property called 666 Fifth Avenue in New York City where he's tremendously indebted.",
        "And he's seeking investment from all over the world to shore it up.",
        "And then three, it appears that the president concealed the fact that he had actually ordered John Kelly and Don McGahn to give Jared Kushner a top-secret clearance.",
        "And law enforcement officials didn't want him to have it.",
        "And so these factors all point to him not having it or not - he should not have it, I should say.",
        "Quick last question.",
        "Do people in Schaumburg, Ill.",
        "- in your district - care about whether Donald Trump lied about paying hush money to an actress or the job he's doing as president?",
        "Will have much to say about McCain.",
        "He just doesn't bring that excitement, that spark.",
        "The interest, I think, that sort of - you know, the creative types and the Hollywood types or whatever.",
        "What does the festival celebrate?"

        "But they were commissioning for - they were doing the very first stages of commissioning, where you put a beam through - it's like threading a thread through a million needles, you know, to get the beam to go all the way around.",
        "And they were threading it, and then they needed to stop.",
        "A power supply needed to be replaced or something like that, and they said, well, while we're waiting for the power supply, why don't we check out some of our magnets at high fields, which is what you need to do to accelerate at high energies, at very high energies.",
        "And oops, all of a sudden they found a problem.",
        "It blew up one of the magnet - the connections to the magnets blew up when they were testing it.",
        "By blew up, you mean it didn't actually explode, but it sort of stopped working.",
        "Right.",
        "It didn't explode, but what happened was that, you know, you put a lot of current through something, it heats up, they're superconducting.",
        "There's super-cooled helium.",
        "The helium gets hot, and it turns into a gas, and that sort of explodes.",
        "Yeah, all right.",
        "It caused a lot of collateral damage, a lot of dirt in the beam pipes, a lot of magnets had to be replaced and a lot of hang-wringing and soul-searching for, you know, is this a problem?",
        "Is this going to be a problem later on?",
        "And that's what took a year, is to go back and take a look at all of the, you know, phenomenally complex device - if you can call it a device - and you know, to - you don't want this to happen again.",
        "Right.",
        "And so they took a long, hard look.",
        "They found a few other problems.",
        "They took their time - better safe than sorry.",
        "Yeah, now you're a part of this experiment.",
        "I mean, so I said physicists are excited.",
        "Are you excited?",
        "Is this an exciting time?",

        "Yeah, in fact when I hang up, I'm going to catch a cab to Dulles Airport, and I'll be there tomorrow morning - well, for me tomorrow morning.",

        "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "And�",
        "And I go right to work.",
        "And okay, so here's one of the problems with describing the results of what you're going to get from CERN because you said that we're going to be able to get some idea of the conditions a few milliseconds after the Big Bang, but it's really, really hard for the public, I think, to understand what that means and why you need this 17-mile-circumference ring to smash protons together.",
        "Right.",
        "So you know, give it one more shot.",
        "Well, I can give it a try.",
        "Okay.",

        "�all the mass of the universe was in a small volume.",
        "The whole universe and everything in it was compacted, and that's quantum mechanically unstable, and it started expanding.",
        "And it expanded at a pretty furious rate, but all the matter and the energy in the universe occupies that whatever volume is in the universe, and as it expands, like any gas that expands, it cools down.",
        "It's got a bigger volume to hang out in, and it cools down.",
        "And as it cools down, like any collections of molecules, any gas, it goes through phase changes.",
        "And the name of the game is to figure out where are these phase changes and what's happening in between the phase changes.",
        "And if you really want to know - I mean, a lot of the phase changes happen in the first millisecond, but you know, we're sort of guessing because we can't look back further than we can probe.",
        "So the idea with the LHC is you take these beams, and you collide them, and at the point of collision, you have a very high energy density, which is equivalent to the universe at a particular small time after the start of it all, after the Big Bang started.",
        "And the LHC is about - the energies of the LHC, when it's at full energy, is equivalent to the universe at around maybe a trillionth of a second, to the minus-12th to the minus-13th, 14th, something around there.",
        "There's a lot of action that happens just around there, and we are pretty anxious about it because we think we're going to see a lot of new stuff that's going to be very important for us to figure out exactly what's going on with the universe.",
        "Well, I'd like to know what's going on with the universe.",
        "Well, and you do actually know what's going on because, you know, people do cosmology large-scale structure studies.",
        "They look up there, and they see galaxies, and the galaxies are distributed the way they are.",
        "And you kind of scratch your head and say how could the universe have started out as this big, as this very hot soup, very homogeneous soup, very smooth, end up in this very lumpy, cold universe we have now.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So it's all fitting together now.",
        "It's complimentary.",
        "And that's what makes it a really exciting time."

        "I was just curious.",
        "You know, I've been listening to you talk about the collider for a couple shows, and I was just wondering if there was anything that could go seriously wrong with this experiment.",
        "You mean like we blink out of existence, that kind of thing?",
        "Yeah, like poof, we're gone.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "We won't know if that happens, of course, but Drew Baden, what do you think about that?",
        "Yeah, there was a lawsuit about that.",
        "Some people said well, we're not doing our environmental impact statements correctly.",
        "You know, here's the way I look at it: The energy in the beams from the LHC is about 300 megajoules, and so you might ask what's a megajoule?",
        "But 300 megajoules is about the amount of energy your refrigerator would use in maybe four days.",
        "Now, does it sound like that kind of energy is going to make us all blink out of existence?",
        "I mean, I wouldn't - you know, I'm not so worried about that.",
        "If that was the case, if that small amount of energy - although concentrated into a very small volume - but if that small amount of energy could make you blink out of existence, we probably would have blinked a long time ago.",
        "So most people are not really worried at all about this.",
        "This is very far from something that is real and you need to worry about.",
        "Okay.",
        "One more quick call and Janelle(ph) from Eldersburg, Maryland.",

        "I was wondering why the circumference is 17 miles, if there's something special about that number.",
        "And also I've heard that when these particles can collide, they can create black holes, and that was a concern.",
        "I know the last caller mentioned something about poofing out of existence, but are these tiny black holes of any concern?",
        "Right, right.",
        "Well, it's 17 miles because you need to get the beams to high energy, and the way to do that is to put them in a circle and keep adding energy to them.",
        "It's like something going around in a circle, and every time it goes past you, you give it a kick.",
        "And so that's a good trick to get it up to high energy.",
        "And the reason why you want this thing to be a very - as large as possible in circumference, in diameter, is that whenever a charged particle makes a turn, whenever it accelerates, it radiates energy away.",
        "And the bigger the turn, or the tighter the turn, the more energy it radiates away.",
        "So it's an efficiency issue.",
        "So you want to make this thing as, you know, as straight as possible, but then again if you make it too big, it would be too costly."
