        "Yeah, the FBI, dating back to 1924, has kept large, you know, pieces of data on people.",
        "That was fingerprints back then.",
        "But in recent years, they've been evolving into palm prints, into iris scanning, facial scanning and all sorts of things.",
        "And they're slowly moving forward with this, with the, you know, the deployment, most recently, of the facial scanning, which allows for basically a computer to find matches of people, of potential criminals, with mug shots in a large database.",
        "Everybody has come pretty much to rely on fingerprints as being almost perfect, not entirely, but almost perfect.",
        "But how good are these new systems?",
        "Well, I guess that's the big question.",
        "The FBI says that this will allow them to do more and be more efficient and track more people.",
        "But we haven't really seen these things used that much.",
        "Most recently, they had a new program where they had a fingerprint scanner that they were giving to officers around the country, that they could use on the street to look at people's - you know, to check people's identities.",
        "And they say that this has turned up, you know, people who were wanted on warrants for murder and other crimes.",
        "But at the same time, you know, I guess we haven't had enough time to really assess how efficient and how good they are.",
        "And with the facial recognition system, where are they going to get the pictures?",
        "Are these just mug shots of people who have been arrested, or are these pictures from anywhere and everywhere?",
        "Well, they say that it would be just be mug shots, that they don't - you know, they say they won't be just taking pictures from your Facebook account or stuff like that.",
        "And what they would do is there would be - a computer would be matching the face of the person they're trying to identify with pictures in their repository, and then it would be giving - the computer would do this, and then it would give the person who's doing the review a list of people that could match that.",
        "So at that point it would spit out some possible matches."

        "The NYPD for many years has had a database of scars and tattoos, where you can actually go - you could go into it and type in, let's say, you know, scar on, you know, you know, the left side of someone's face, and a list of different people who've been arrested would come up or a list of, you know, different notations about that in police reports would come up.",
        "And this is the FBI's, basically, attempt to take this to a national level and to have a large, you know, way that if, you know, we're not just identifying people in New York City but identifying people across the country based on tattoos or scars or, you know, other body markers.",
        "And would local law enforcement provide information?",
        "I mean for example, you mentioned the New York City police.",
        "If you got arrested in Queens, would that information then get sent to the FBI with your mug shot and your fingerprint and your information on scars and tattoos and even your iris?",
        "Yeah - well, you know, I don't know as much about the iris stuff, but what I do know about the programs that they've had is that most of them are reliant on local law enforcement cooperating with them, providing them with information.",
        "Because, you know, these are the folks that are out there (technical difficulties) actually, you know, have developed the fingerprints and have developed different information, and they are - you know, that information is fed into the FBI.",
        "Not every local law enforcement, you know, office or, you know, police, you know, group is doing this, but as time goes along, these - hypothetically these databases will become bigger and bigger as more states and local, you know, authorities get onboard.",
        "And they're obviously computerized.",

        "In fact, much of the growth in the South has been attributed to the multiple parallels, streams of people coming from different places that are now adding to this new mix of people that are now converging into an area that's very - has a long, long history, which I think a lot of people may not be aware of until they get there."

        "In fact, Florida was the third state to secede from the Union in the months leading up to the Civil War.",

        "Well, what scholars are discovering is that they - the new arrivals are coming from parts of Latino America, meaning parts of Central and South America, that are different from the traditional ones that we often associate with Florida, meaning Cubans coming in.",

        "And that means they come in with the assumptions about who is on top and who is on the bottom in this country.",
        "And those assumptions, do they reinforce the old caste system?",
        "They actually do reinforce the caste system that had been in the South and much of the rest of the country for so long.",
        "It turns out that those attitudes are showing up in recent studies.",
        "There's a study out of Durham, North Carolina, in which it was found that 78 percent of Latino respondents said that they felt they had more in common with whites, and 53 percent of them said they had the least in common with blacks.",
        "And so they also had more negative views of African-Americans than did the native white population in those places."
