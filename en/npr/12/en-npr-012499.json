        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)",
        "This is TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "I'm Neal Conan.",
        "We're talking about the new system from the FBI to collect and exchange fingerprints and other biometric information.",
        "Eventually, that could include iris scans, photographs for facial recognition systems and palm prints.",
        "To many in law enforcement, it's a long-needed tool to help identify criminals and terrorists.",
        "Others worry about invasion of privacy.",
        "We'll hear both arguments in a moment.",
        "If you've gathered intelligence in law enforcement, the armed forces or in the business world, how might this information be useful, or how might it be abused?",

        "Our guest is New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt, who covers federal law enforcement.",
        "And joining us now are two people on different sides of the argument: Rick \"\"Ozzie\"\" Nelson(ph), a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, where he directs the Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Program.",
        "He's with us here in Studio 3A.",
        "Nice to have you with us.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And Michael German, a senior policy counsel for national security and privacy at the American Civil Liberties Union, a former FBI agent.",
        "He spent 16 years there and joins us now in Studio 3A, as well.",
        "Nice to have you with us.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "And you and the ACLU, what's the concern here?",
        "Well, the concern is that there appears to be a vast expansion of this program happening without sufficient transparency and oversight to make sure that it's being done in a way that protects privacy.",
        "And that expansion is both in what is being collected, what these databases are gathering, but also in the mission of the NGI program."

        "The mission?",
        "Sure.",
        "As Michael suggested in your earlier segment, what the FBI has repeatedly said about their criminal justice information system is that the purpose is identifying bad guys, you know, that a guy arrested in San Diego we can prove is the guy who's wanted in Minneapolis.",
        "And we all want that to happen.",
        "But the problem is now that the program is expanding.",
        "For instance, one of the programs that we're most concerned with is a Department of Homeland Security program called Secure Communities, where NGI is being used as the conduit to run everybody arrested throughout the United States through a DHS database to determine their immigration status.",
        "And that often isn't criminal but rather a civil program.",
        "So it is again this expansion, often without the approval of the state and local authorities who are submitting their prints in violation of their agreement with the FBI about how that information is handled.",
        "And let's turn now to Ozzie Nelson, and Ozzie, from your experience, how might this really help law enforcement?",
        "Well, it certainly can.",
        "I want to back up just a little bit and, you know, note that the largest facial recognition database in the world right now is Facebook, with 900 million users.",
        "And the amount of information that the public and private sector is collecting on a daily basis, whether it's Google or Facebook or Yahoo!",
        "is just immense.",
        "Big difference, you do it voluntarily, you provide it voluntarily to Facebook.",
        "It's not the state, and Facebook can do many things, but it can't put you in jail.",
        "It can't, but unlike with Facebook and unlike with Yahoo!, we do have the public, we do have legal recourse with the FBI.",
        "There is congressional oversight, the representatives of the people address the FBI.",
        "There's testimony here.",
        "We also have, you know, the Congress makes laws regarding this.",
        "This is one of the areas where we're woefully behind.",
        "You know, if you use Moore's Law, where the speed of technology, the power of technology, is increasing every 18 months, our laws and policies certainly aren't.",
        "And yes, with Facebook you are volunteering information, but there are a number of instances where these organizations have used this information without the users fully understanding what this is.",
        "And so going forward, I'm comfortable to some degree, comparatively speaking, with the FBI utilizing this information.",
        "Again, this information is not randomly collecting information.",
        "These are people that come into contact with law enforcement, like a mug shot, or they are people that apply for civil government jobs, such as with the FBI or the CIA, or military personnel who willingly give their information up.",
        "So this isn't the random gathering of information."

        "And if that information is used inappropriately, there is a legal recourse for our average citizen to deal with that, and that does not exist with Facebook.",
        "Anyone who's had their identity stolen can tell you the legal resources available are not as useful.",
        "And as you look ahead to the system, you're confident?",
        "Abuses are possible.",
        "Well absolutely abuses are possible, but that's why it's so important that we have a dialogue, and I think that what Mike is doing and the ACLU is doing is important because we have to have a conversation about what the right balance is between privacy and security.",
        "We're behind in that discussion.",
        "We have to determine what - how much security we want and how much of our privacy we want to give up, and we haven't figured that out yet.",
        "And the technology is advancing so rapidly, we're getting further and further behind.",
        "They don't talk about it at all.",
        "It's like, let's just put on expensive TV ads attacking one another's resumes.",
        "That turns off me and other Independents, like, in a hot second.",
        "So, what they need to be doing is really talk to Independents.",
        "Is there a definition of self-esteem that social scientists agree on?",
        "And I also want to reflect that it's not just about the U.S.",
        "citizens, that's obviously the number one priority, we need to respect their civil rights and privacy of our U.S.",
        "citizens, but the FBI has a larger situation here.",
        "There's only 14,000 agents in the FBI, and they're trying to stop things like international property rights theft from nations such as China.",
        "They're trying to stop cybercrime.",
        "They're trying to stop terrorism.",
        "And we need to ensure that they have the tools that they need to stop those crimes because that's really where they're focused.",
        "And Mike German, I know that one of your concerns is that, in fact, this is not going to be more efficient, that it's going to provide a flood of data that's going to overwhelm the FBI.",
        "Absolutely, and this is particularly true in regard to the photographs being submitted.",
        "If you look at the privacy impact assessments that the FBI has written on these programs, for something like fingerprints it mostly is criminals.",
        "But there are some innocent people whose fingerprints are being submitted.",
        "Obviously when I became an FBI agent, I submitted my fingerprints.",
        "But like Ozzie said, that was a voluntary thing.",
        "You know, but now, you know, we're expanding who we're fingerprinting: teachers, truck drivers.",
        "You know, a lot of different people are now having - who are innocent, not suspected of any criminal activity, have their information being submitted to these databases.",
        "That's also, with fingerprints, been true with what's called latent prints, where at a particular crime scene, the police collect a print that they don't know who it belongs to, and they submit it to the system, and that..."

        "Well, because it might turn out to have been the criminal.",
        "Right, but it also might not be.",
        "You know, if the crime scene was a hotel room, you might have been there a week, month, you know, but as you start to expand these programs into something like DNA, which is far more persistent, the likelihood of having that type of information collected and retained in these databases of completely innocent people is expanded, particularly with photographs.",
        "And under the PIA, when the FBI expanded this to include photographs, they still have to be submitted by a law enforcement entity, which is good, but the problem is it doesn't indicate where the law enforcement has to get it.",
        "So I could download your Facebook page, give it to a police agency, and they could submit that to the FBI, and there's nothing in the FBI's rules that say that they wouldn't accept that.",
        "So, you know, with ubiquitous surveillance going on now, with video cameras and other surveillance techniques, there's a lot of photographs of completely innocent people out there that may end up in these databases.",
        "Ozzie Nelson, is there such a thing as too much information, too much data?",
        "Again, the amount of information that's going to be collected on us by private sector, governments or whatever is not going to go down in the foreseeable future, if ever.",
        "So there are always going to be - you know, and the use of third-party data, if a bank, you go into a bank, and you are videotaped by their cameras, how is that information being used?",
        "Can the FBI buy it?",
        "Can other vendors buy it?",
        "And what can they use it for?",
        "These are the challenging questions that we really - again, we haven't grappled with as a society as you really need to do.",
        "One thing I have to commend the FBI on, again, there are concerns.",
        "The FBI is not a faultless organization, and they have made mistakes in the past.",
        "But they are trying, in my opinion, to be very transparent.",
        "This conversation itself is indicative of that.",
        "We did ask them to provide somebody to appear on the program with us, and they declined.",

        "Well, that's their prerogative, but we are here discussing it, and a lot of the information that we're discussing is stuff that's publicly available on their website or testimonies.",
        "You know, Mike has a PowerPoint brief that he pulled off the Internet.",
        "So again, they're trying to put there out there because I don't think that the FBI gains by having a secret discussion that doesn't take into account the privacy.",
        "And even someone like me, who leans to the security side of the equation, at the end of the day I'm a U.S.",
        "citizen, and I want my privacy protected, and I want my civil liberties protected, and we have to find the common ground.",
        "And if both sides run to the respective corners of rhetoric, where it's got to be security or privacy, we're going to fail as a nation.",
        "And we have to come together and figure out the best way.",
        "And we need Congress to take a larger role in determining what that is.",

        "Dave(ph) joins us on the line from Mechanicsburg in Pennsylvania.",
        "Hi, how are you doing?",
        "I'm going to make two quick points.",
        "You had mentioned something about banking videos and walking into establishments and how that data's going to be - how that data is going to be given in and possibly purchased, I think what we're going to wind up seeing is announcements on the front of public facilities that say if you enter these facilities, you are subject to videotaping and surveillance.",
        "And it's going to be a common catch-all.",
        "The bigger picture here is I'm not concerned about the FBI's database.",
        "They want to share this information with everyone.",
        "So they're going to be sharing it with other people's databases.",
        "Who is doing the oversight on these federal programs?",
        "Who's making sure that this personally identifiable information is - these systems themselves are being built in a complaint manner, in accordance with federal law?",
        "And is that - do you have direct experience?",
        "Yes, I do, federal and commercial.",
        "OK, I guess that would go to you, Mike German.",
        "I think he's exactly right that there is so little transparency into what actually happens on a day-to-day basis, not just with the NGI databases but with all law enforcement intelligence databases and such a premium being put on the concept of information sharing without sufficient regard to whether that information is appropriately collected or shared is a big problem.",
        "And the fact that, as Ozzie suggested, our privacy laws haven't kept up with technology, and that's both for the private sector and the public sector.",
        "And so, you know, being in compliance with the law is not necessarily very protective of people's privacy because the law is so inadequate."
