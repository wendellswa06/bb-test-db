        "OK.",

        "Here's an email from Xavier(ph) in Independence, Missouri: Law enforcement already employs software that can scan hundreds of license plates per second and run checks on tags for outstanding warrants and such.",
        "What would prevent law enforcement from using the same type of software scanning hundreds of faces per second to identify everyone at a ballgame or in the airport or at a rock concert?",
        "And, Ozzie Nelson, we've heard of attempts to do that when there might have been a threat at the Super Bowl or something, and they want to run facial-recognition systems.",
        "Again, this is where we have to make a decision in what we want to do.",
        "If there's a viable threat where a stadium is known to be a potential target for a terrorist organization and they have mug shots or some sort of facial recognition, facial photo of these individuals and they're going to scan the stadium to try to find that individuals, I think that's a valid thing we want the FBI to do.",
        "We want them to provide that level of security.",
        "I think that's reasonable.",
        "Again, they're not taking these cameras and peering them into our bedrooms.",
        "They're going to a public place, and they're trying to (unintelligible) for the public security.",
        "And again, what's good about law enforcement using this as opposed to the private sector is that there's legal recourse.",
        "If someone is misappropriately - appropriately identified, they have legal recourse to take action to do this.",
        "This happens all the time even with fingerprints.",
        "As Mike said, if you go to a crime scene, you pick up fingerprints of people that are not involved in the crime, they don't end up in jail.",
        "There's a question though, Mike, about how long that material stays in the system.",
        "Particularly people with DNA, they can get swabbed when they're arrested.",
        "Does that DNA information then stay in the system forever even if they're never brought to trial, charges are dropped?",
        "I'm unclear on what all the rules are with the different systems, but certainly, what we're concerned about in this case is the collection.",
        "And right now, there are many states that are collecting based on arrests rather than based on a conviction.",
        "And what we've seen is, you know, where we have protests and mass arrests at protests, all the protesters' DNA could be collected even though no charges are ever pursued.",
        "And that then can remain in these systems for as long as the government wants to keep them.",
        "Mike German, senior policy counsel for national security and privacy at the American Civil Liberties Union, a former FBI agent.",
        "Also with us, Rick 'Ozzie' Nelson, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who directs the homeland security and counterterrorism program.",

        "And I wanted to bring you back in, Michael Schmidt.",
        "We're talking about 2014 before this system is supposed to be fully implemented if everything rolls out and there's no tremendous bugs or delays in the system.",
        "How long before that are these various parts going to come out?",
        "Well, it's part of a larger system that the FBI is going through that is sort of started that.",
        "It's what they call a six-part system.",
        "You know, before this, there was the palms and latents where they now are looking at palm prints because they believe that palm prints are just another way of tracking whether someone was in a place.",
        "After the facial recognition will be an iris scan, and this is just part of a, you know, a larger technology push that the FBI believes it needs to do as technology has evolved but also to serve, you know, local law enforcement across the country which is - wants to use this stuff.",
        "And the FBI believes they can sort of serve as a main hub for that.",
        "So that's what that process looks like, and that will probably go beyond 2014 and, you know, probably into 2015."

        "I was in the database marketing business in the '80s and '90s, and what I think is interesting is that we ran through the same type of issue back then about privacy and where to draw the line.",
        "We had a bunch of information that we had access to for marketing purposes.",
        "And on the upside, it was great.",
        "We could deliver very targeted marketing messages to people with specific interests and use that information to take the clutter out of their lives and just deliver messages to them are of interest to them.",
        "But when we found out that we were gathering this information sort of behind their back and without them knowing it we got a big backlash.",

        "And now here we are faced with the same problem again.",
        "It's interesting, Ozzie Nelson, particularly facial recognition seems to have a little bit of a creep factor for most people.",
        "Well, it is.",
        "I mean - and there's no doubt that this has a big brother aspect to it, you know?",
        "But again, the idea that, you know, in 2014 that the FBI is going to flip a switch on and, you know, 40 million cameras are going to start watching people for dropping gum on the sidewalk is a little Orwellian, and I don't think the intent of the program.",
        "Again, this is an outgrowth from the (unintelligible) program, which is based on the fingerprint, it's determined - it's meant to find criminals and to bring those people to justice.",
        "And I think we have to stay grounded in this conversation.",
        "Again, it's so important that we don't run to our respective corners and then try to have the conversation from there.",
        "We have to have the conversation in the middle because we have to solve this.",
        "You know, we saw with Congress with the rhetoric floating around there, we can't get the solution.",
        "Every day that we don't put policies in place or laws in place to guide how we want to do this, whether it's in the private sector or the public sector, we're putting the nation at risk, not only from a security perspective but also from an economic perspective.",
        "And we'll end with this email from John(ph) in Milwaukee: I was stopped for going over the speed limit but I was not issued a speeding ticket.",
        "Just before the Milwaukee police officer returned to her car, she asked if I minded if she fingerprinted me.",
        "I'm 57 with no record and only one speeding ticket my life.",
