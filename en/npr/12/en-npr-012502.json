        "Well, as far as we know now, it's going to come out of their oil revenues, which of course they have many other needs in terms of rebuilding the country and so forth, so it's almost counterintuitive that this would be the way it was carried out, but that seems to be the current plan.",

        "Speculation is some may have gone to militias, some may have gone to insurgents, some may have gone to Kurdish organizations waging war against the Turkish government.",
        "So given that record, it's of some concern whether the Pentagon and the military have put in new monitoring mechanisms or whether it's just going to go into the same black hole that these earlier weapons went into.",
        "So if this deal goes through, how do you think a new infusion of weapons is going to affect the U.S.'s mission in Iraq?",
        "Well, there's a danger that they'll end up being used against our troops, just because of this loose system of controlling them on the part of the Iraqi government.",
        "And the Iraqi government itself has in the past been penetrated by insurgents.",
        "Some of the militias that have joined the armed forces, they are sectarian Shia militias.",
        "So there's still a strong possibility that they will be siphoned off and some of them might be used against our own troops."
