        "They do not want that to happen, but there are talks in the Senate ongoing.",
        "That's a huge question mark for what Congress is going to do.",
        "And they really do not want to vote on any health care legislation.",
        "There were promises made to Maine Senator Susan Collins last week during that tax debate to get her vote in which she was told that Congress would pass two companion pieces of legislation that would essentially prop up the individual health care market because remember; the underlying tax bill effectively ends that individual mandate.",
        "OK, so if the House doesn't vote on those health care bills, does that mean Susan Collins could then vote against the final tax bill?",
        "It could.",
        "And she has said that those votes are conditional to her support for the tax bill.",
        "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has promised her both publicly and privately that Congress will vote on those bills before the end of this year.",
        "And I saw her in the hallway today, and I asked her if the speaker had given her similar assurances that the House would vote.",
        "And this is what she told me.",
        "I have had three conversations with the president of the United States about this, and I think he has quite a bit of influence with the House members.",
        "And she has a point.",
        "If President Trump comes out and says, look, guys; you need to do this to get the tax bill done, they will likely follow suit.",
        "All right, there's a big meeting at the White House this week with the big four, the top Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress.",
        "I mean, how big of a role does President Trump play in these negotiations?",
        "This is really critical.",
        "This is when presidential leadership really kicks in at these end-of-the-year negotiations.",
        "They need the White House to sign off on these spending levels or any immigration or health care deals because Republicans aren't going to bring to the bill - to floor any bills that won't be signed into law.",
        "And that's what - important part to remember here in these negotiations, is that Democrats really do pay - play a role.",
        "In order to get any of this done, they need bipartisan compromise in the Senate.",
        "Otherwise, Democrats could threaten a filibuster and block all of this.",
        "And that generally falls on the president to try and figure out what that sweet spot is and then to bring his own party onboard.",
        "So that is the challenge for President Trump in all of this.",
        "NPR congressional reporter Sue Davis, thank you very much."

        "But if you can't identify them, and you can't tell which is which, you give everyone the treatment because you're afraid to miss somebody.",
        "So after diagnosis, most patients have surgery, often followed by radiation chemotherapy or hormone therapy.",
        "Side effects can be severe.",
        "Esserman, a cancer researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, teamed up with Swedish doctors to look at how a test which biologically measures a tumor's aggression might identify patients at low risk of having cancer return.",
        "The test worked, and Esserman was able to pinpoint patients at very low risk of having cancer return even up to 20 years after diagnosis.",
        "You can really say to someone, you're not going to die of this disease.",
        "And we don't have to be aggressive up front and treat you with everything just in case.",
        "Esserman looked at medical records from 652 Swedish patients who had a mastectomy or lumpectomy plus radiation.",
        "The tumor test found that 15 percent of them were classified as ultra-low-risk tumors.",
        "About half of the women got no further their treatment.",
        "About half got the hormone blocker tamoxifen.",
        "After 20 years, nearly all were still alive.",
        "The results build on findings from a 2016 study that showed nearly half of women with low-risk cancer could actually skip chemotherapy and not have their cancer return.",
        "This ultra-low-risk designation really identifies people with an extremely low risk for recurrence or death from breast cancer.",
        "And so that means that, up front, we can say, you don't need all that treatment.",
        "It's a great thing to be able to tell people.",
        "Esserman says it now appears about 20 to 25 percent of breast cancer tumors diagnosed today aren't ever going to cause problems and don't need treatment after surgery.",
        "Dr. Len Lichtenfeld with the American Cancer Society says the findings concur with growing evidence in many different cancers."

        "When you say the carbon atoms are not being transformed into energy that you use, instead it's more like the bonds in the food.",
        "Food has a lot of carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds, which are relatively high in energy.",
        "And when you oxidize it and end up with carbon-oxygen and hydrogen-oxygen bonds, those are lower in energy, and the energy that's released is the energy that you use for body functions.",
        "It's also the energy that keeps your body warm.",
        "So it's not the energy directly from the food that we're eating that we're using to make - it's not the product of the food itself, directly, that we're making energy from?",
        "It's from breaking the bonds, sort of.",

        "Does it - I think we all think that a tree grows, you plant a tree in the ground, you water it, you fertilize it, fertilizer goes up the roots and creates a big oak tree.",
        "Is that how it works?",
        "Well, not exactly.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "It's like - most of our college students know that trees sort of breathe the opposite of us, that we breathe in oxygen, breathe out carbon dioxide, and trees breathe in carbon dioxide and breathe out oxygen.",
        "But they don't connect that knowledge with their ideas about the way the tree grows.",
        "So they still often think of trees as getting most of their mass from the soil, but it's not the soil that's the source of most of the mass of the tree.",
        "It's actually the carbon dioxide.",
        "So 90 percent of the mass of the tree comes from the carbon dioxide in the air, and the remainder comes from water and soil and minerals."

        "Interesting, want to tell us about that?",
        "What were you trying to find out in that question?",
        "Yeah, again, when we're - when we think about decay, people tend to think of decay like a rotting fruit or a moldy piece of bread or a tree decaying, they tend to think of that as a process of going back into the soil.",
        "You know, it's even incorporated into common sayings like ashes to ashes and dust to dust.",
        "But that's not really - it would be better to say carbon dioxide to carbon dioxide, because when the bread or the tree decays, the primary products again are carbon dioxide and water, and there's just a little bit of mineral substances, nitrogen, phosphorous and so forth, that are going to remain and possibly go back into the soil.",
        "I think hardly anybody realizes that, you know?",
        "And is that something you have to unteach people when you teach students about the right way that it happens?",

        "And so students memorize a lot of stuff, and they learn how to recite chemical formulas and things like that, but it doesn't change the way they think about these basic, everyday processes."

        "Let me get a reaction because I'm running out of time.",
        "Good idea?",
        "At least certainly where carbon is concerned, right?",
        "Yes, we talk about that as life cycle analysis, and an important part of life cycle analysis is the carbon footprint, and the idea underlying the carbon footprint is that we have, you know, we've got carbon in various places, and if it's in organic matter, like in food or fuel or things like that, then it's pretty - it's harmless to the environment.",
        "But when you release it into the environment as carbon (technical difficulties) then it becomes a contributor to global warming.",
        "And it's the carbon that's getting recycled over and over again.",
        "It's being taken up and then put back in nature.",
        "It's getting recycled over and over again, except now we've thrown that cycling out of balance by burning a lot of fossil fuels, and therefore we're putting a lot more carbon into the atmosphere than we're taking back out.",
        "Speaking of CO2, I want to bring on another guest who says now they are being able to set up a system where they can actually track a cloud of CO2 across the world to see where it's coming from."
