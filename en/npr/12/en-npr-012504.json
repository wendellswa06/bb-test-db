        "You're actually setting up a monitoring system?",
        "Yeah, in the last week there was - and on Wednesday in particular there was an announcement of an expanded network to measure greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide and methane, at 50 stations in the U.S.",
        "and a comparable number internationally with the goal of quantifying greenhouse gas emissions.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And what part of the world can you monitor?",
        "Well, let me - let's - a little history here.",
        "The systematic tracking of greenhouse gases started already back in the 1950s with my father's contributions at Mauna Loa in the South Pole, and there's been expanded efforts since then.",
        "It's been incremental.",
        "Major players include various government agencies like NOAA.",
        "And through these observations, you can increasingly make inferences about where the carbon dioxide is coming from and going to, getting beyond just the question of whether it's building up in the atmosphere.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But our ability to date is really rather coarse.",
        "We can make statements about whole continents or large ocean basins.",
        "But to try to make statements about emissions on politically relevant footprints like counties or countries has not really been feasible yet.",
        "And this network is targeting the expansion to allow that to happen.",
        "So you'll be able to trace the origins of a large cloud of CO2.",
        "Exactly."

        "Yeah.",
        "Just like a smokestack has a plume that - and if you're sitting downwind, you can tell that there's CO2 coming and, with accurate measurements, even quantify more or less what it's coming from.",
        "And you can do the same thing with a city.",
        "You can do the same thing with a country if you have enough measurements in the right sorts of places and take account of the winds.",
        "And where would those places be that you'd like to set up the measurements?",
        "Well, there is a core background network of observations now at clean sites like Mauna Loa and throughout the world maintained by NOAA and other programs like ours here.",
        "And that gives us a pretty good handle already on the clean air parts of the atmosphere.",
        "There's also expansion that's gone on over the U.S.",
        "and over Europe in particular, to try to measure carbon dioxide concentrations and methane and other greenhouse gases.",
        "There's columns - that is, throughout the vertical atmospheric column, over continental regions.",
        "And what this network would do will rapidly expand the level of those efforts, so that we can really start to make some firm estimates of numbers.",
        "So we could see where the big greenhouse gas emitters are coming from.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean at this point, the way we tabulate greenhouse gas emissions, countries are obliged to - the countries under the Framework Convention are obliged to report their emissions of greenhouse gases.",
        "And the approaches for doing that involve keeping track of the processes that emit carbon dioxide like various industrial processes or raw material flows and so forth.",
        "This is a so-called bottom-up accounting.",
        "And one of the questions that one faces is the question of whether what you actually compute with that is accurate relative to what you emit.",
        "It's a little bit like going on a diet and assuming you know what you're doing simply by counting calories.",
        "You very much like to know that you're actually losing weight.",
        "And what you need to do is have some kind of measurement that actually tracks the actual mass flow, and that's what we can do with the atmosphere.",
        "Talking about carbon dioxide this hour on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR.",
        "And once you know that, then that goes into the political arena.",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "I think the main interested parties will be governments and other entities that are concerned about their emissions.",
        "The assumption here is that the value of this kind of information will increase with time as people get more and more serious about cutting their emissions."

        "Methane, I should say, as well.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "They often think of it as more like a quality of the air than a component of the air.",
        "So carbon dioxide is good air and oxygen is bad air.",
        "And I think having these kinds of quantitative data and talking about carbon dioxide's origins and so forth, there's a real opportunity for students to learn about carbon dioxide and its sources.",
        "Do they realize the interaction between CO2 and the oceans?"

        "And so the frontier that needs to be pursued to advance the capability is really more over land than over the oceans.",
        "We do, however, depend very much on our oceanographic colleagues to keep track of what's going on in the water.",
        "So, again, that's actually part of the backbone that we build upon as the oceanographic communities contributions to carbon measurements.",
