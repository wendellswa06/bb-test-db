        "So tell us what Trump is saying today about Manafort and Cohen.",
        "Well, he spoke out not long ago about Cohen specifically and insisted that Trump himself has done nothing wrong here.",
        "Cohen of course told prosecutors that the president illegally directed him to arrange payments to two women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump in an effort to avoid fallout in the 2016 election.",
        "Trump of course denies those affairs.",
        "And in an exclusive interview today with Ainsley Earhardt of Fox News, Trump contradicted Cohen.",
        "He insisted he only knew about the payments after the fact.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"\"FOX & FRIENDS\"\")",
        "Later on, I knew - later on.",
        "But you have to understand, Ainsley, what he did.",
        "And they weren't taken out of campaign finance.",
        "That's a big thing.",
        "That's a much bigger thing.",
        "Did they come out of the campaign?",
        "They didn't come out of the campaign.",
        "They came from me.",
        "In that interview airing on Fox News tomorrow, Trump insisted that because the money came from him and not the campaign, it couldn't be a campaign finance violation.",
        "But he's really missing the point here.",
        "The larger issue is whether the money was meant to influence the election because, if so, that has lots of implications for how the money is reported.",
        "And that's what got Cohen into trouble.",
        "And how is the White House answering questions about that larger issue, that missing point?",
        "Well, press secretary Sarah Sanders held a briefing today, and she was asked about this.",
        "She wouldn't answer questions about the payments and basically stuck to her talking points.",
        "And she took issue with a question about whether Trump had lied to the American people months ago when he originally said that he knew nothing about those payments.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "Look.",
        "Again, I think that's a ridiculous accusation.",
        "The president in this matter has done nothing wrong, and there are no charges against him."

        "OK.",
        "So it sounds like they are trying quite hard to downplay any potential damage to the president.",

        "Privately, though, I'm hearing from sources close to the White House that there is real concern, or at least a sense that there should be.",

        "You're right.",

        "Sarah Sanders was asked about it today.",
        "She said she hadn't been aware of any discussion so far about that.",
