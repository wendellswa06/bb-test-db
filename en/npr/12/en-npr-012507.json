        "I did.",
        "Stephen Covey merged his business with Franklin Industries so that's how it turned into this Franklin Covey as we know it, the store at the mall where you can get the planners.",
        "So I did go to a Franklin Covey symposium in Chicago for a few days and there were a lot of Franklin Covey products also there for sale.",
        "The funniest thing they had also at that seminar was a company called Executive Book Summaries, which was one of the conference sponsors.",
        "And what they do is they take these business books and they condense, you know, a 400-page business book down to its essentials, so it's like three paragraphs long.",
        "And I noticed that they had taken Stephen Covey's latest book, \"\"The Eighth Habit,\"\" which is actually a longer book than \"\"The Seven Habits\"\" so I haven't read that one yet but it's one habit is - takes up more room than seven...",
        "Than the previous seven.",
        "Well, it must be real good (unintelligible)...",
        "...the previous book.",
        "Yeah - and anyway, they had taken \"\"The Eighth Habit\"\" though and condensed it down to two paragraphs so they were trying to sell the book, on one hand, but then also you could just pick up a pamphlet with the two paragraphs and it was all boiled down for you.",
        "And let's see if we can get another caller on the line.",

        "I realized I was really far from where I wanted to be, and I decided to take that seriously even though it's such a pithy(ph) comment, you know, but my life has just turned around 180 degrees.",
        "And the thing that really works for me about him is he seems to encourage me to really listen to that deep inner voice, you know.",
        "He doesn't sort of tell me what to do so much as I feel like tells me how to listen to what it is that's really inside, you know.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "I mean, I'd feel like I was really far from where I wanted to be and, you know, one of the things I wanted to talk about was how scary it can be to sort of become the person that you want to be, if it's so unfamiliar to you, if you've been living your life and kind of going the wrong direction for a really long time, you can turn it around and it'll feel really good.",
        "But on the other hand, it's kind of really challenging, too, because it's so unfamiliar.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You also have to commit to it, and it's interesting.",
        "Thanks very much for the call and good - continued good luck with your pursuit.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "But you have to commit to it and one of the - I forget which chapter you were writing about, Beth Lisick, you said, you know, if this program is to succeed or if any of these programs are to succeed, I have to be dedicated, I have to be committed to this.",
        "It's true.",
        "I - because I found myself, you know, a whole year doing this was really exhausting.",
        "And - so there are times - it so chronicles my year and I kind of start to flag at points and just think, God, I don't know if this is for me.",
        "And, you know, it's like what the caller said, having this idea of following your bliss.",
        "It's interesting because it's almost like if you just think of that, I don't know that I needed a book to tell me that I can maybe read the title and just sit there and think about it, following your bliss, okay, following what's inside and I think that - in daily life, it's hard to keep doing those things when you're distracted by people cutting you off in traffic or, you know, all those, all the things like that.",
        "Small children, those sorts of things.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Which you have had and have, the question about these (unintelligible) you learn a lot about God.",
        "And it's this very slim book on disciplining your child and it was so basic and simple, and I actually found that it really, really worked.",
        "And that was probably, you know, one of the top ones that I did that year was just learning this advice on how to discipline my child.",
        "And again, it's not a very funny chapter because I go through, you know, the temper tantrums and the frustration and all that of being a parent."

        "So that - in that case it worked out really well.",
        "But I wonder - you see a lot of parallels between even, you know, Richard Simmons, who you wouldn't necessarily think of being the same category as, say, Deepak Chopra, but nevertheless, the same kinds of advice filtering through all these different channels.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know what I found very interesting was when I did my home organization month, I consulted Julie Morgenstern, who's Oprah's go-to lady.",
        "And it was - her book is called \"\"Organizing from the Inside Out.\"\" And a lot of it is takes these ideas of kind of going a little bit deeper and figuring out well, why is your closet a mess, and I just thought I've just got a messy closet, I don't know, I can't keep the stuff organized, I - and then when I read her book, I thought, you know, it really is because I've always been sort of ambivalent about fashion, I like, you know, old vintage clothes but I think it's kind of ridiculous to be really into fashion and spend a lot of time on your appearance.",
