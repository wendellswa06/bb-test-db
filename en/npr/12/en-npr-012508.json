        "And pretty soon, he became intolerant of my behavior to him because I wasn't responding to his use of power anymore and he left me.",
        "Well, you know, that's - in a lot of these books, too, is that you cannot choose, you know, you can't control how other people are going to act to you but you have the choice, the power to choose how you react to them.",

        "What conclusions did you come to?",
        "And why did you single out this particular race as an example of push polling?",
        "You know, I think that there was something about stepping out of the way that I normally live my life with which really is this kind of low impact, go with the flow, in a way following my bliss, but that wasn't exactly working out in some areas.",
        "So when I stepped outside and actually started to - I mean, I'm not kidding, you know, visualize myself writing a book about it, going on TALK OF THE NATION, trying to make something - make some sense out of it.",
        "In the end, I really did find that, that there was some good ideas and it was useful for me to kind of step outside of the way that I normally think.",

        "Yeah.",
        "That - I think that that was, that's the biggest downside, definitely.",

        "And so, yeah, I think that maybe if people read this book, they'd probably realize that they don't have to spend as much money as they are on all these seminars and a lot of the ideas are, you know, you can get a good used copy of an old self- help book.",

        "It's - it was written in the late 1800s and a lot of people turn to it as one of the first pot, you know, think positively (unintelligible), you know, come true.",
        "But also, why - what is your take on the fact that there's such a proliferation of these books and a lot of them wind up saying the same thing over and over again, and why are people turning to these, you know, turning to these as opposed to what most people turned to a long time ago which was, you know, organized religion?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I find that very interesting, the whole idea of the life coach and the therapist to kind of taking place of that.",
        "And I think that a lot of it is about packaging and marketing and that somebody - taking these old ideas and putting in, you know, a new face on it, and somebody feels like, well, I'm not going to relate to Deepak Chopra, but maybe, you know, Stephen Covey's going to be my guy.",
        "Or maybe I want somebody more religious, or maybe I want somebody a little warm and fuzzier.",
        "And so I think a lot of it is just it's been discovered that this is a huge, huge money-making thing.",
        "And so I think that's what it is, is that they just keep turning around and putting a new face on it and that those faces are going to resonate with certain people."
