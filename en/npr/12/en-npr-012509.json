        "And the bees are dying in such large numbers that farmers have had to import bees, literally shipping the hives cross-country so that farmers can share them.",

        "On the Fourth of July, Deep Impact crashed into Tempel 1 in a really dramatic fashion, and the explosion was surprising in itself because instead of the expected textbook dirty snowball of ice and rock, scientists found the comet to be made up of a softer organic material, which might offer insight into how the Earth was formed.",
