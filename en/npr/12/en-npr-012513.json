        "No, they can agree right now.",
        "Now I am not suggesting that they're going to do that, but it is a very interesting wrinkle in the whole pool-play format of the tournament.",
        "And this happens in different tournaments too, it's not just characteristic of the World Baseball Classic, it's just a funky little thing.",
        "And by no means is anyone, I think, suggesting that they would do that.",
        "But its just sort of quirky.",
        "In the meantime, of course, the United States will be playing against South Africa.",
        "I assume sobered by the prospect of another surprise.",
        "Well I think so.",
        "I mean, it will probably work out that this was a good thing for the United States to have, you know, the heck scared out of them.",
        "So, I, no, I would not want to be the South African lead-off hitter who steps in the box against Roger Clemens tomorrow with his patriotic fire-breathing out of his nose.",
        "I think that, you know, now the game tomorrow is probably going to be meaningful, though of course I guess, in a way, we're really going to know what happens based on what happens based on Canada and Mexico tonight.",
        "But still, it's going to be very interesting.",
        "And I tell you something, I'm about to go out to the workout where the American players are practicing for tomorrow's game, and I want to ask the African-American players how they feel about playing South Africa.",
        "Of course, you know, relations have changed with that country over the past ten years or so, but, you know, these are guys who grew up as kids hearing about Nelson Mandela and hearing about apartheid and what not, and I'm sure they'll have some feelings about playing a team with that name on their chests.",
        "The one game that everybody is raving about was played not in Arizona but in Florida, in another round of, that had to do with the Venezuelan's against the Dominican Republic.",
        "This is really, this tournament is already sparking some comparisons to some of the great games ever played.",
        "Well, I think that would be an exaggeration, frankly.",
        "I mean, we're in the middle of it now, and a lot of people are feeling as if it's more fun than they expected.",
        "It's what I expected, I don't think it's a perfect tournament, there are a lot of problems with it, but its fun.",
        "You know, and that's okay.",
        "It's early March.",
        "It's a lot more fun than the Padres-Rockies tilt down in Tucson, you know, their spring training affairs.",
        "So, you know, I think people really have enjoyed the spice that was thrown into spring training.",
        "I don't think there's a better time to do it; I don't think it would work in November, I don't think it would work in July in the middle of the season.",
        "I think it has to be done in March, and we're enjoying baseball with a little bit of a different flair.",
        "The Dominican Republic and Venezuela have a wonderful little rivalry that will only grow stronger as people get used to and decide they care about these match-ups.",
        "Well, since Roger Clemens went high and tight on his own son the other day in batting practice after the kid took him out over the fence with his first pitch, I suspect you're right about worrying about the South African lead-off hitter tomorrow."

        "It's a real brand hit.",
        "The question is how long that lasts.",

        "So is this a good or a bad sign for him?",
        "It's not good.",
        "You know, there was a woman named Wendy Walsh who complained, spoke to NPR, spoke to other news outlets, initially The New York Times about what she experienced when she was effectively auditioning for a paid regular weekly spot on his program which could give her a good salary and could give her extra payments for other speaking fees and other gigs that she might do outside the network.",
        "He basically made clear that she was going to get the job and then at the end of a dinner made clear she wouldn't get it when he refused to go back up to her hotel room, according to her accounts.",
        "This New York law firm Paul, Weiss is reviewing it much as it evaluated the accusations of other women against Roger Ailes before the Murdoch family which controls Fox News fired or ousted Ailes last summer.",

        "You know, David, in so many ways, Bill O'Reilly is the face of that network.",
        "I mean under what circumstances could you really imagine him being forced out altogether?",
        "Well, there are two things to think about.",
        "One is he brings in so much money for the network.",
        "Advertising is not the primary source of revenue, but it's a huge one for Fox News.",
        "He brings in in the nine figures a year from his show alone.",
        "And he sets up primetime for them as well in ensuring high ratings for the rest of them.",
        "On the other hand, he's in some ways considered an embarrassment by Rupert Murdoch's sons Lachlan and particularly James Murdoch.",
        "They see this as not the forward-looking face of Fox.",
        "They had hoped, in some ways, particularly James, to bank the future on Megyn Kelly - you know, a more forward-looking, younger figure and also somebody - more centrist views, perhaps."
