        "And you don't want that.",
        "You never want a table full of blank stares (laughter).",

        "If you tell me, David, that you're off to Maui tomorrow, I might end up feeling envious of you.",
        "And so that earlier research has actually shown that one reason that stories about experiences we haven't had are less satisfying to us is that they can leave us feeling left out.",
        "But what Gilbert and his colleagues Gus Cooney and Timothy Wilson are finding here is a different phenomenon.",
        "A common assumption that both storytellers and listeners are making turns out to be wrong.",
        "Speakers tend to think that listeners will most enjoy hearing novel stories - that is, stories about experiences the listeners haven't had.",
        "And that makes perfectly good sense.",
        "We think of communication as an attempt to tell people things they don't already know.",
        "But what our experiments revealed was that listeners actually far preferred to hear stories about experiences they had already had.",
        "Shankar, how did Gilbert do experiments here?",
        "Did he hang out at hundreds of dinner parties or what?",
        "(Laughter).",
        "Well, he did something much easier but less interesting, David.",
        "He and his colleagues exposed people to stories about novel and familiar experiences.",
        "And what they found is that stories about familiar experiences were enjoyed much more than stories about novel experiences.",
        "Now, it's not that people don't want to hear about new stories.",
        "You know, we go to movies.",
        "We read books.",
        "The reason we don't enjoy such stories told by our friends is that storytelling is really hard, and most people we meet aren't great storytellers."

        "Most of us, when we tell stories, leave all sorts of things out.",

        "One of the things that Gilbert recommends, David, is that at your next dinner party you should spend less time talking about experiences that only you've had and more time talking about experiences that your listeners have also had.",
        "So when you talk about a movie that your friend has also seen, your friend is going to compensate for your weaknesses as a storyteller by remembering context and atmosphere and all the things that made the movie memorable in the first place.",
        "To put it another way, Gilbert says we tend to think of stories as if they are fruit.",
