        "Circuit on this issue - if they find a constitutional right of access, the FDA has a much stricter standard of scrutiny to meet in order to keep people from getting it.",
        "And it's really a question of how much evidence the FDA has to come up with that a particular drug in the clinical stage is dangerous, and how much they can basically interfere with the right of an individual to have access to it.",
        "So take us briefly through how this lawsuit progressed.",
        "The original three-judge panel sided with the Abigail Alliance.",
        "The FDA asked the full panel to hear it, 10 judges.",

        "Well, there are a lot of interesting slippery points in that holding.",
        "But to call it treatment is perhaps, you know, is very illusionary because when you look at the statistics about what kind of drugs, which are in phase one trials - phase one trials are the basic safety trials to determine the maximum safe doze of a drug before they go forward into any efficacy studies.",
        "If you've just talking about a drug that isn't a phase-one trial, 80 percent of products which are tested in phase one trials never go forward to market because they don't pan out on efficacy grounds.",
        "I want to repeat that point because it's worth repeating.",
        "Phase one is more or less to test the dosage level of safety for phase two.",
        "It's not to measure whether or not the drug is effective.",
        "That's right.",
        "You know, they will not ignore incidental efficacy data if there is any that comes forward.",
        "But usually, we're talking about testing on healthy patients just as to find what a maximum safe doze is.",
        "When you're talking about cancer therapy, you're usually not - doing that on healthy patients.",
        "But 80 percent of products, which are tested in phase one trials, will never get an FDA.",
        "So that means 80 percent of products that the Abigail Alliance litigation says you should be able to have access to are going to - never going to pan out for you terms of efficacy or reasonable efficacy and safety.",
        "And they may indeed diminish both the quality and the quantity of remaining life."
