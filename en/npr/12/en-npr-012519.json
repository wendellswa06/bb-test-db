        "We sort of have a love-hate relationship with the FDA.",
        "There are people who call it very paternalistic with respect to its drug approvals.",
        "And, you know, in some cases, perhaps it is.",
        "But they also fault it for not being more strict with medications like, for example, Vioxx.",
        "And so, on the one hand, we're very much individuals when it comes to wanting something for ourselves, but on the other hand, when they don't pull something from the market - and certainly what went off with Vioxx is exhibit A with respect to this, and certainly what's happening today with respect to Avandia - there's certainly plenty of controversy over what the FDA advisory committee is going to do today in its decision.",
        "But isn't the difference in these cases that terminally ill patients have a lot less to lose?",
        "Certainly so.",
        "But do you know your terminal when you're taking Vioxx?",
        "I would not - I don't even mean to prejudge the causal effect with respect to Merck and Vioxx.",
        "But, you know, we're all terminal in one way or another and - but I do, I take your point.",
        "Certainly, if you're willing to assume risks as you are terminally ill, the real question is how much do you understand about those risks?",
        "How much you're really told about them?",
