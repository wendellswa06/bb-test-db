        "When you ask for compassion for the FDA - we had a session with the FDA at our hospital where they told us frankly.",
        "We never approved it.",
        "I mean, that mechanism is there, but it's never to the FDA official's advantage to approve a compassionate use.",
        "I'm quoting - I quoted an articled I wrote from Milton Friedman, that an FDA official has two very different kinds of mistakes.",
        "One, approve a drug that turns out they have unanticipated side effects, resulting in death or impairment; or refuse approval that is capable of saving many lives.",
        "With visions of Prolinamide(ph) in their head, the knowledge of the fame, the claim that came to the woman who upheld the approval of Prolinamide is there any doubt which mistake you'll be more anxious to avoid.",
        "With the best will in the works, you'll be led to reject or postpone, and that's exactly what happens when the hands - when the decisions in the hands of the FDA, compassionate or other use - everything leaves the FDA official to postpone or reject.",
        "And that's what happens.",
        "Dr.",

        "He's been talking to us from M.D. Anderson Cancer Center Studios in Houston.",
        "We have an e-mail from Stuart(ph) in Salt Lake City who says while I'm no expert on being a cancer survivor, I've been living with HIV for over 14 years.",
        "I remember well the fight we had to get experimental HIV medication on the fast-track for public release.",
        "We were successful in that fight and the results has been overwhelmingly positive.",
        "The argument against releasing those drugs was that we did not know the long-term side effects.",
        "I was one of a small group of people who did suffer from serious and unanticipated side effects.",
        "I was unable to work for three years as a result.",
        "In spite of that awful experience, I certainly think it was better than the alternative - death.",
        "My guest is Fran Miller, professor of law at Boston University School of Law.",
        "And I'm also joined now by Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, chair of the Department of Bioethics at the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health.",
        "Welcome to the program.",
        "Thank you for having me.",
        "And I should make it clear that you are not speaking on behalf of NIH in any way.",
        "You are here speaking from your own point of view.",
        "And what is that point of view?",
        "For these people that are terminally ill, why shouldn't they have a right to these medications?",
        "Well, first of all, I think we should separate out the issue of the constitutional right from what good public policy is.",
        "I think, as Fran Miller correctly pointed out, the Supreme Court has said in its end-of-life-care cases and its physician-assisted suicide cases that the liberty interest people have, the fundamental constitutional right, is not to be invaded, not to have their body invaded.",
        "That's a much different item than be able to demand medications or resources.",
        "As a matter of fact, more than 25 years ago, the president's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical Behavioral Research made that point, that the ability to refuse is one thing, but even autonomy and self-determination does not give a patient rights to demand the use of resources, including drugs.",
        "So that's been a long-standing view.",
        "And I think as Professor Miller said, the D.C.",
        "Appellate Court's decision, which was two to one, was kind of what observers of the court would call the twistification(ph) of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the physician-assisted suicide cases, to try to get it to fit their own ideological position, and it didn't fit."

        "The second issue is should - once we say that there's no constitutional right, the question is - in any individual case - should a patient get access to drugs?",
        "And everyone has said the FDA and others, including myself, that patients should, under some circumstances, be able to get access to unapproved drugs.",
        "That's the compassionate use item.",
        "And contrary to Dr. Freireich, who said that it's never used, that's simply untrue.",
        "As a matter of fact, probably the biggest case of compassionate use was with the drug Iressa, which was developed by AstraZeneca for lung cancer.",
        "And while there were some promising results, it actually made access available to 24,000 people worldwide.",
        "But then, it was shown not to have any survival benefit in lung cancer, even after many, many people got access to this drug.",
        "So it's simply not true that the FDA doesn't use this mechanism.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "I'd like to echo what Dr. Emanuel just said.",
        "I'm wrecking my brain for the numbers.",
        "But I was at a conference, Food and Drug Law Institute Conference on the Abigail Alliance a few months ago.",
        "And the FDA official there - and I cannot remember the numbers, but if I remember correctly, they said about 75 percent of their, or to 80 percent of their petitions for compassionate use are granted.",
        "And I think, perhaps, Dr. Freireich was sort of conflating the basic approval decision of a drug with the compassionate use a separate issue.",
        "Yes, the FDA does indeed often take its time with respect to being sure before granting an NDA, which basically lets a drug go to market.",
        "But if I remember correctly, it's more than 75 percent of their petitions for compassionate use are granted.",
        "And Dr. Emanuel, if a patient is terminal, understands the risk, is willing to assume them, and either the pharmaceutical company isn't offering the compassionate use or there's some other roadblock to that, why not allow them access?",
        "Look, there is a very important balance here.",
        "When you have a patient in front of you, terminally ill patient, your heart goes out to them, you're feeling very compassionate.",
        "You want to do everything you can for them.",
        "You'd be a brute, a robot if you didn't feel for them in their situation and their family's situation.",
        "On the other hand, we also have to recognize that there's important social policy here.",
        "We have had drugs - you mentioned Avandia.",
        "Vioxx has been mentioned.",
        "But before the FDA existed, we have lots of drugs that harm people and that hurt people, first of all.",
        "Second of all, the most important thing for cancer patients is not access to experimental drugs.",
        "It's access to proven drugs that actually fight cancer.",
        "And the only we're going to know if they're proven is if we do clinical trials.",
        "And we have a lot of experience that access - early access to drugs delays clinical trial and delays our knowledge of whether drugs work or don't.",
        "In the cancer field, we have this information from the bone marrow transplant experience where lots of people thought bone marrow transplant was the cure to breast cancer - to metastatic breast cancer.",
        "They advocated that insurance companies cover it.",
        "They advocated state legislatures, often mandated that it be paid for.",
        "And the data are that about 25 to 40,000 women got bone marrow transplantation off protocol, so no data was collected from them.",
        "And we barely - we're able to enroll a thousand women in the trial that showed that it had no benefit at all, that in fact all those women were getting this extra high doze, some of them dying in the bone marrow transplant room for no benefit.",
        "And we've had that experience with AIDS drugs also.",

        "And I petitioned to get in - or I tried to get in into a clinical trial.",
        "I wasn't qualified, but I petitioned to still get access to the drug and I got it, and now, it's state-of-the-art medicine.",
        "When I took that drug, we had a lot of risks.",
        "We didn't know exactly what was going to happen as it never been in humans before, but it was very important for me personally.",
        "I had only 26 T cells, I've been in the hospital with a bad brain infection for a week, my weight was just incredibly, incredibly low and it gave me hope.",
        "It also had a benefit for society.",
        "When we take these experimental drugs - even though we're not in a clinical trial, we get information about side effects.",
        "Those can be collected by the FDA.",
        "If the FDA was doing a better job in collecting side effect information, every one would be at a whole different level than we are right now.",
        "So there's an individual benefit, there's also a societal benefit.",
        "In terms of lung cancer, which I also have and I just learned that I have that in the last few months, I'm on an Internet site with thousands of people with lung cancer.",
        "And it's very, very sad to see people that have exhausted all treatments that are currently available and they're aware of other treatments and they would gladly participate in those clinical trials and they can't get in them because they're filled and they're in a waiting pattern and that waiting pattern can be many, many months and sometimes years.",
        "And to read those stories of about the people that would travel all the way across the country, they'd stay in trailers, they'd stay on the floor, in a sleeping bag and they're aware of drugs that are out there.",
        "And other people that are taking those drugs are sharing their information, and we know that those drugs are hopeful, they just haven't gone through the quote process, yet.",
        "Hank, thank you so much for your call.",
        "Actually, I think Hank's story about his AIDS treatment shows you that the system works, that when someone isn't eligible for a clinical trial and does petition, the FDA is responsive and you can get access.",
        "But I think we should also be clear that that Hank's drug turned out to be state-of-the-art and to be successful, is the minority of cases.",

        "Well, if you look at the 100 drugs that start in human trials that stays one trials, again, to find out dosage, only five will get to FDA approval.",
        "Only out of 70 out of those 100 will even go on to test for efficacy, 30 failed because they're too toxic or for some other reason.",
        "And even of those that go on pass phase one, only one in twelve will get approval.",
        "So most of the drugs, 11 of those drugs, are going to fail and only one's going to succeed, and we have to recognize that many of those patients who get those other drugs will not get any benefit and may get harm.",

        "The bottleneck here is really not the FDA.",
        "It's the manufacturers.",
        "They want patients in clinical trials so that they can get the safety and efficacy evidence that they need in order to go to market.",
        "They don't want patients who are - have co-morbidities or too sick or otherwise don't qualify for the trial, distorting their data on the safety and efficacy.",
        "They're the ones - and certainly, the Penelope case, which was widely read about after the Wall Street Journal front-page article on it - was about a manufacturer that didn't want to take the risk of having its clinical trials torpedoed by using out - and it's just tragic, tragic facts with respect to a little girl who was dying of, I believe, it was leukemia.",
        "But the problem…",
        "Well - but, even if the data from terminal patients who have access to these drugs for compassionate users or some other channel isn't as valuable as a, you know, random double-blind clinical trial, isn't all information helpful, to some degree, Hank's point about side effects?",

        "Mostly, it's not that clinical trials are full up and people are waiting to enroll in them.",
        "Mostly, we have clinical trials open and they're not enrolling patients.",
        "The notion that Hank said that we have hundreds of thousands or tens of thousands of people willing to enroll in clinical trials just - is not the reality out there.",
        "About 40,000 to 60,000 cancer patients a year enroll in clinical trials.",
        "We have many clinical trials, which have been opened where -which aren't enrolling patients, where it's difficult to enroll patients.",
        "And so the idea here that patients are just waiting for clinical trials is, I think, not an accurate picture out there.",
        "The second thing I would say and reemphasize a point I made before is that if you have these all alternative mechanisms, which are easily available and patients don't have to go into a clinical trial - we know from history from the bone marrow transplant cases and others that patients will not go into a clinical trial and go into this alternative mechanism, making it harder to enroll people in a clinical trial, harder to get the data to know whether a drug works or doesn't work, and harder to get proven stuff out to patients.",
        "If we slow up the system, slowing up the enrolment in clinical trials, we're actually going to make it worse for cancer patients not better, because we won't know whether these drugs work.",
        "It will take many more years to learn their efficacy and their side effects and be it - then present the data to the FDA about the balance.",
