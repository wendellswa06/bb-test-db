        "The problem was because they were so overwhelmed with lack of resources - it's a very small county, I think about 7,000 people live there - they were not identifying properly where these people were buried.",
        "Some of the remains were found, multiple sets of remains in a grave site.",
        "Eventually the bodies - along with whatever items people had with them on those journeys - were exhumed by forensic anthropologists at Baylor University.",

        "With Columbine, the ripple effect was huge.",
        "I don't know how comparable it will be but certainly, for the immediate community who knew these individuals.",
        "And I think because of the almost-instant access to images and stories from survivors - those become available in a matter of minutes; and we know from 9/11, repeated exposure to the same images, over and over again, can have a traumatic impact almost the same as actually having been there."

        "I think so.",

        "If you look at it, this whole field of grief counseling - whatever you want to call it - is a relatively new thing.",
        "And somehow, people got through disasters centuries ago, and seemed to do OK and get better.",
        "And so, people can do very well and get through these things, and come out of it on the other side with a better perspective on life and feeling stronger - maybe not happier, but feeling stronger as individuals; that we understand now what's really important, and how to take care of ourselves, and how to take care of each other.",
