        "But most analysts agree that the prosecutors so far have been unable to prove the charge of genocide against Milosevic.",
        "This certainly has to do also with the specific legal requirements to prove the responsibility for genocide.",

        "It's just entered its fifth year and had a long way to go still.",
        "Well, one was the prosecution was very ambitious and decided to lump together all three major wars, Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo in one trial.",
        "Many analysts say this was a mistake, that it would've been much better to have had three separate trials and three separate verdicts.",
        "The other reason is that in a sense when Milosevic surprised everyone, he said he didn't recognize the legitimacy of the tribunal, the U.N.",
        "tribunal, but he decided to act as his own lawyer.",
