        "Well, I've kept every date book that I have, and I know every place I went.",
        "So I created this beautiful table, and that was fantastic.",
        "It was really--I was immensely proud of that.",
        "But there was one question which went--I'm paraphrasing, but it was essentially this: `Did you ever live in the United States between your 18th and 26th birthdays in any capacity other than that of a lawful non-immigrant?'...",
        "What does that mean?",
        "...or something like that.",

        "And so I put the thing away for four months.",
        "I even wrote away to Selective Services, asking them this sort of vague question like, `Did I ever live here as a non-immigrant?",
        "They brought me back and said, `We have no idea who you are, and we have no idea what you're talking about.'",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "So we just--so that kind of thing.",

        "So--yeah.",

        "And another question that sort of stopped me short was whether I would--if the law required it, would I bear arms on behalf of the United States?",
        "And that sort of stopped me for about a week, and then I checked `Yes'--well, for a variety of reasons; one is because it struck me that the spirit of the question was: Would I ever?",
        "And, you know, if they said, `Guess what?",
        "We're finally going to go in and stop the Janjaweeds' genocide in Darfur, and we need every able-bodied man.",
        "Are you in?",
        "You know, I would probably say yes.",
