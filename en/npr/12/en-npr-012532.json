        "The federal indictment announced Tuesday alleges that four East Haven police officers routinely conspired to violate, and violated, the civil rights of members of the local community - particularly, Latinos.",
        "Janice Fedarcyk is assistant director in charge of the New York City office of the FBI, which worked on the case.",
        "In simple terms, they behaved like bullies with badges.",
        "David Fine, U.S.",
        "district attorney in Connecticut, says the indictment describes more than 30 instances of abuse.",
        "The four defendants have been charged with using excessive force in the arrest of five individuals, conducting unreasonable searches and seizures...",
        "The arrests follow a federal report that details a deeply rooted pattern of discriminatory policing - frequent race-based traffic stops, where officers allegedly used ethnic insults; raids on Latino businesses; and beatings of Latinos taken into custody.",
        "The officers have pleaded not guilty.",
        "Charges like these are easily made; they're not so easily proven.",
        "Lawyer Hugh Keith represents the town of East Haven.",
        "He says Connecticut police officers are often sued for false arrest and excessive force.",
        "In all the years that I've done the work for East Haven on these lawsuits, they have had a success rate in court, in front of juries, of well over 90 percent.",
        "What's riled up East Haven residents today is a comment made by East Haven Mayor Joseph Maturo, just hours after the officers' arrests.",
        "A local TV reporter asked the mayor what he was doing to support Latinos in the town, and he responded by describing what he planned for dinner."

        "He doesn't have - no clue of other communities growing up in his town.",
        "This guy runs the town, and he's not really paying attention to our community.",

        "Now, young lower-income black people are more likely to say this than upper income black people.",
        "But what you get is nearly 40 percent of lower income blacks saying that they have little or no values in common between the poor and middle class black communities in the United States.",
        "And the perception of a class divide here has grown since the question was last asked in a poll in 1986.",
        "So when large numbers of black Americans say they don't think there's just one race there anymore, they're not really talking about skin color; they're talking about values and economics?"

        "Yeah.",
        "In fact, in the poll, there is a rating of major black Americans and Cosby comes out near the top.",
        "And down at the bottom are people like 50 Cent, the rapper; you know, only 17 percent of black Americans approve of him and what he does.",
        "And it's striking because obviously young people who are more likely to listen to rap and participate in the hip-hop culture, they're the most critical of people like 50 Cent and highly laudatory of the Bill Cosbys, Oprah Winfreys of the world.",
        "Now, when you spoke to some of the people who actually participated in this survey, how did their own life experiences and what they're doing now influenced some of the things that they thought and said?",

        "Thank you.",
        "What I've come to understand is it really does take a multi-pronged approach and accountability is an important element of that.",
        "So we need to make sure the predators that are out there are identified as early as possible and held accountable.",
        "And that takes victims that are well supported in their communities and feel comfortable with bringing that forward, you know, that the bottom line here is that we have a society, unfortunately, where we've got a culture that makes it very difficult for victims of this crime to report, often, you know, to even their very close family or friends."
