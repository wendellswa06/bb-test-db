        "I think Richard Russo is on to something.",
        "We have a difficult time as Americans talking about class.",
        "And I think that among black people in this country now it's reached the point where people are acknowledging it, and they're slow to acknowledged it as a reality if they are well-educated, if they have liberal politics, because they don't want to have it said that they've become bourgeois and are forgetting those who are at the lower end.",
