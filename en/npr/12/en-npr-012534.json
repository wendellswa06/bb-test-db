        "And one of the reasons conservatives are wrong when they say that they're going to swallow Trump - even though he's sort of obnoxious because they care about the Supreme Court - is that the moral etiquette of the country, the moral capital of the country is foundational.",

        "I mean, the kinds of things that people feel sort of permission to say about her are extraordinary.",
        "And we're going to have to watch out for that.",
        "I mean, my biggest hope is that if this ends and if Clinton wins as the polls suggest she will right now - she spends a lot of time in Trump country.",
        "I'd love to see her travel to eastern Tennessee, eastern Kentucky, West Virginia and say, look, there are a lot of people among the Trump supporters who'll never vote for me, never vote for a Democrat.",

        "There are people whom the economy isn't serving well, and I'm going to be your president, too.",
        "I hope there are really not just gestures, but actually policy efforts to say, I'm going to care about your problems no matter what you do in this election.",
        "And maybe she might even close on that theme."
