        "I went into a state of grieving at this point, and I wrote a sort of obituary for the carvings and sent it off to a London weekly journal where it was published.",
        "And then I started receiving these wonderful phone calls from the palace authorities, saying: No. Actually, extraordinarily enough, the carvings had basically survived.",
        "There were two or three which were badly damaged in parts, and only one carving that was completely destroyed, which was a seven-foot-long drop which flanked a painting over a door in the king's drawing room, as it was called.",

        "You can achieve 90 percent of the effect with 50 percent of the effort.",
        "But the truth is, unless you do the final 10 percent, which takes another 50 percent of effort, you'll never achieve that fineness which is necessary if it's going to, you know, raise the hairs on the back of your neck.",

        "It was a real innovation.",
        "So I thought it was necessary to the appearance of the carving.",

        "You know, when I first saw Gibbons' work at close quarters, I visited the palace shortly after the fire and got up on the scaffolding.",
        "And the first time I saw Gibbons' work close up, I nearly came out in hives.",
        "I was so astonished by the flamboyance of his modeling and by the fineness of his cutting and undercutting.",
        "And then I went back to my workshop in upstate New York and stood at my desk - I remember with my hands on my hips - and I looked out at my own work, and I felt almost a sense of despair, because I thought I had carved my leaves, for example, with a holographic accuracy.",
        "You know, I would bring a leaf in from outside and put it on the workbench, and I'd copy it.",
        "But you know something?",
        "They looked like wooden leaves as opposed to Gibbons' inaccurate leaves which looked like real leaves.",
        "And it was the first lesson that he taught me.",
        "There always has to be a translation into this new medium, and that you could only make a wooden leaf look like a real leaf by certain selective exaggerations.",
        "So even this very realistic form of art actually is artificial in its way."
