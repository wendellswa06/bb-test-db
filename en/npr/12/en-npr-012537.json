        "At least Clinton, you know, got that.",

        "Senator John McCain said this week in a radio interview, quote, \"\"I promise you, we will be united against any Supreme Court nominee that Hillary Clinton, if she were president, would put up.\"\" He later walked that back a little and said he would judge any nominee on their record.",
        "But does that give us a hint of what to expect if Clinton does win, more gridlock in Congress and not just over the Supreme Court?",
        "David.",
        "Possibly, of course - but, you know, I've been in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas this week, and they're sort of surrender among Republican ranks.",
        "I ran into one guy who said he was not going vote for either of them until Trump made these election comments, and now he thinks it's important for Clinton to lose - or Clinton to win big.",
        "And so there's sort of a chastened mood, even acceptance, before the election results.",
        "I truly hope that's true.",
        "And I think if - you know, Clinton is threatening Trump in states like Arizona and North Carolina.",
        "Even though it's a real long shot, Texas, Utah may not go Republican.",
        "So there will be a basis to say this is at the very least, a round rejection of a certain kind of Republicanism.",
        "So you'd like to think that has an effect.",
        "But what I worry about most is the path of least resistance and the most politically attractive path for Republicans may be to win over the Trump constituency by putting up a wall of resistance to Clinton and then looking forward to 2016, where the Senate seats fall in a very good way - I'm sorry, to 2018...",
        "Right.",
        "...Where the Senate seats fall in a very good way for the Republicans - and say no way the Democrats can win four times in a row.",
        "And so there's going to be a lot of incentive to oppose her.",
