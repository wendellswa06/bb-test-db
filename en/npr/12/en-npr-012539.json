        "We're just trying to get a better understanding of how giant Sequoia trees respond to severe drought.",
        "We have very little understanding of, like, well, how severe of a drought does it take to, like, kill a giant Sequoia tree.",
        "This notion that the giant sequoias could die because of drought has brought together multiple agencies for the first health-related study on the giant sequoia.",
        "Some of these trees are over 3,000 years old and have faced many droughts in their lifespans.",
        "But perhaps this drought is too much for them.",
        "The good news is that there were lots of trees that still seem healthy, but there was this smaller amount that seemed to be stressed and stressed in ways that we haven't seen documented before in the parks.",
        "Koren Nydick is the lead scientist behind the study.",
        "More than 40 trees are in the process of being analyzed for stress from four years of drought and warming temperatures.",
        "That's the kind of stress that eventually could kill a tree.",
        "Researchers want to compare data from healthy sequoias with those showing signs of decay.",
        "Gathering all this information is labor-intensive.",
        "Tree biologists like Wendy Baxter are trying to understand how these sequoias respond to drought conditions.",
        "We're going to assess the water status of those samples that we collect.",
        "So that's sort of an instantaneous measurement of the water status of the tree at that point in time.",
        "This is how it works - after a researcher loops that rope over a branch hundreds of feet high, tree biologists like Baxter attach themselves to the line and literally hoist themselves into the branches.",
        "I think Americans are going to have to get used to the idea that fuel is going to be permanently a little higher or much higher than it has been in the past, and food is going to be higher than it has been in the past as a relative price compared to other things that Americans buy just because, again, of these huge countries that are coming online.",

        "Now, as you heard, Barbara Fight isn't feeling the crunch here.",
        "What does that say to you?",
        "Well, it's interesting that Barbara mentions clothes because there are some goods that economists like to call consumption goods - things that people really need to buy on a regular basis, and they tend to continue to buy these goods even through recessions.",
        "And clothes is one of those things, you know?",
        "Every year, you have to buy some new clothes for your kids or for yourself.",
        "And so clothes is not one of the first items to see the downturn.",
        "What starts to see the downturn are those purchases that we have the capacity to put off for the next year such as, we don't have to improve our - build another room on our house.",
        "We don't have to buy another car.",
        "These are called durable goods, which you really can decide whether to buy this year or next year.",
        "So what if Barbara Fight wants to expand her store or hire new people for her store - in other words, what if she needs credit?",
        "She's probably going to think twice about doing that because that's a durable good purchase that she can put off a little bit if credit is a little expensive this year.",

        "The lion's share of the public is not at risk of foreclosure.",
        "And so, there's a real issue about the extent to which the public would support too much help for those people who got stuck in bad situations.",
        "But there's a political thing going on here, too.",
        "Democrats are pointing out that while ordinary people are losing their homes, one of Wall Street's biggest firms got a big bailout.",
        "And so, I imagine some of the people we've talked with wouldn't mind getting a bailout, too.",

        "The government mobilized to make sure that when this investment firm ran into trouble, it would contain the trouble within Bear Stearns.",
        "So in other words, if the government had not mobilized to facilitate this purchase of Bear by another company, what would have happened is Bear, on Friday last week, would have declared bankruptcy because it would have defaulted.",
        "And that bankruptcy would have put in jeopardy all the customers that it does business with.",
        "And then it would put the customers of those customers in jeopardy.",
        "And should Bear have been allowed to fall on its own devices to go bankrupt, so to speak, you would have had concentric circles of problems emerging and radiating out from Bear throughout the whole economy.",
        "I have to say, it sounds a little trickle-downish to say that and not also advocate helping people from having their actual homes being foreclosed on.",
        "The government is helping people work with firms, with their lenders, to try to minimize the extent to which foreclosures cause hardship to people.",
        "There are lots of programs that are in place - that are trying to educate people and their lenders - how to get together and get through this with the minimum hurt to either side in the same way that the government facilitated the purchase of Bear by another investment bank.",

        "We first see Texas Congressman Charlie Wilson watching Dan Rather on TV while lounging in a hot tub with naked chorus girls.",
