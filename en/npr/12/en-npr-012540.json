        "Now, it turns out Noah's mom, Heather Cummings, also suffered severe anxiety when she was Noah's age.",

        "CUMMINGS: You know, I'd bump my head and think I was going to have a, you know, concussion or get hit close to my temple and clearly, you know, watch the clock 'cause I'm going to die.",
        "Researchers say it's pretty common for parents to pass anxiety like this on to their kids.",
        "Some of it's genetics like other mental or physical conditions.",
        "But some of it's the way anxious parents parent.",
        "Golda Ginsberg is a psychologist at Johns Hopkins University.",
        "She says studies show how much children of anxious parents are at risk.",
        "We know that children whose parents struggle with anxiety are somewhere between two and seven times more likely to develop an anxiety disorder themselves.",
        "It's partly how a parent views the world.",
        "If they see it as a scary place, often their children do, too.",
        "We know that children will model their parents.",
        "So if a parent is showing anxiety - jumping up on the table if they see a mouse - versus, you know, reacting calmly, we know that children are going to - certainly anxious children are more likely to develop fears that are similar to what their parents are showing.",
        "This is exactly what happened to Heather Cummings and her son Noah.",
        "When he was a toddler, if he disappeared behind a tree, she thought he'd been kidnapped.",
        "As he got older, her anxiety shifted and she worried more about his anxiety.",
        "H.",
        "CUMMINGS: You just think if you love them a little more or you reassure them enough, eventually one day they'll wake up and not be worried anymore because you're saying all the right things and you're doing all the right things.",
        "Sadly, all the right things were in fact making Noah's anxiety worse.",
        "His parents constantly reassured him that he was fine.",
        "They asked the school to allow Noah to call home when he got worried.",
        "He did about five or six times a day.",
        "His father, Dave Cummings, even spent an entire day in the classroom.",
        "I went in just to be sitting there in the classroom with him, and my entire focus is just on Noah - how is he handling each moment, how is he doing - and just giving him a reassuring smile or going over and rubbing his back or just, you know, for a second - just doing anything in my power to reassure him that things are going to be OK."

        "But finally, the family was so overwhelmed they knew they had to do something.",
        "By the time they arrived at the office of psychotherapist Lynn Lyons, Noah's anxiety was severe.",
        "Lyons specializes in anxiety.",
        "And the first step for Noah, she says, was to understand how his anxiety was affecting his body.",
        "Your worry grabs onto your imagination and then it sets off that part of your brain called the amygdala.",
        "That's your alarm system.",
        "Which signals the brain to produce more adrenaline.",
        "The heart pounds, blood rushes, breathing becomes heavy, muscles tense and the stomach churns.",
        "And all of these reactions are really automatic and really primitive.",
        "So now your body is ready for an attack by a saber tooth tiger, and actually you just have to take a spelling test.",
        "And the big surprise for Heather and Dave Cummings was that all their reassurances were actually fueling Noah's anxiety.",
        "The way that you learn how to manage life is by making mistakes or by stepping into things that feel uncertain, that feel uncomfortable, that feel overwhelming and then proving to yourself through experience that you can manage it.",
        "So what Noah had to do was stop his body's automatic response.",
        "When Noah's worry talked, Noah listened.",
        "Lyons uses cognitive behavior therapy - CBT - to help kids like Noah do a 180 and completely turn around the way they perceive anxiety.",
        "So he had to start to talk back to it.",
        "He had to start to do the things that his worry said he couldn't do."

        "But with Nichols at the helm, \"\"Charlie Wilson's War\"\" only 90 minutes, powered by sharp performances, a sophisticated script and a light touch even when it comes to the story's central irony - how that the enemy of my enemy is my friend thing played out a few years later.",
