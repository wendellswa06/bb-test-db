        "Or does Hamas being Hamas preclude that?",
        "Well, Hamas is today a terrorist organization committed to the destruction of the state of Israel.",
        "What it would take for us to be able to move forward is to open a (unintelligible) government that recognizes the right to Israel to exist, that renounces terrorism and violence, and that is committed to adhering to previous agreements, including the Road Map.",
        "These are so natural principles that are the foundation for peace.",
        "But you said today that that implies you're capable of hearing something else tomorrow and taking a different view of Hamas?",

        "But if there were a declaration from Hamas, that we recognize Israel, we acknowledge past agreements, we renounce violence - those declarations would count for something?",
