        "Well, I talked to one shareholder who said, you know, basically, look, $2, $10, there isn't that much of a difference.",
        "We're still going to lose a lot of money, and shareholders are going to lose a lot of money.",
        "Shares of Bear Stearns were worth, I think, more than $180 more than a year ago, and now we're talking about $10.",
        "So the chances are a lot of shareholders are still not going to like this deal very much.",
        "But one of the things that happened today was that Bear Stearns basically has created 95 million new shares in the company, and they're going to be sort of ceded over to JPMorgan Chase.",
        "JPMorgan will then have - sort of almost have voting control over the company.",
        "I think Bear Stearns figures at this point, you know, they can - it won't be that hard for them to get the additional shareholders on board because there are enough shareholders that understand that, you know, this isn't a great deal, but it's probably the best they can hope for.",

        "And when it agreed to this deal, JPMorgan Chase said we don't know what these are worth and until we do the math, we don't want to be on the hook.",
        "So the Fed basically said, well, we will take these potentially bad securities and give you money using them as collateral.",
        "So if you lose money, we'll cover the losses, which essentially means taxpayers will cover the losses.",
        "The Federal Reserve doesn't believe that will happen, but still there is the possibility.",
        "That aspect of the deal generated a lot of criticism from people whose - who thought that taxpayers are on the hook.",
        "So JPMorgan Chase came in today and said that they would absorb the first billion dollars in loans, if there were any.",
