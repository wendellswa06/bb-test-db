        "Well, launching a criminal investigation means that they think it's more likely than not that a crime was committed.",

        "Among other things, a grand jury gets involved.",
        "And it doesn't mean an indictment is inevitable, but now it means that people will be required to give evidence or face contempt of court charges or will have to evoke their Fifth Amendment rights.",
        "This basically says that crimes could have been committed.",
        "And those crimes that could have been committed might be contempt as there are court orders calling for preservation of the materials that might have been included in the tapes.",
        "There could be the possibility of an obstruction of justice charge if there were subpoenas calling for materials that could've been included in these tapes.",
        "So this really does move it to a different level.",

        "The problem for Jackson is a problem many African-Americans encounter when they begin to dig deep into their roots.",
        "Many of those records are difficult to find because African-Americans, both before and after slavery, weren't always accounted for.",
        "But Lawrence Jackson, who's also a professor of African-American Studies at Emory University, was determined.",
        "He knew his family went back several generations in Virginia, so he began a journey to those places, and he's written about it in a new memoir.",

        "And we struggled so much to even understand, really, what took place in the 19th century, especially the last generation of slavery.",

        "How did you find who your great-grandfather was?",

        "And I couldn't imagine, you know, sort of how he was able to come up with the price - I think it was about $200 - as a man who was in his early 60s, that he would be able to sort of grasp the dream of yeoman farmer.",
        "And as you can imagine, if you buy 40 acres at 62, you know, you're at the end of your active farming years.",
