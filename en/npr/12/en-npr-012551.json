        "I play jazz.",
        "Frankly, you know, classical music needs some of this right now.",
        "I'm really into that, you know, the idea that I could get onstage and kind of do this - rock out in Avery Fisher Hall.",
        "So yeah.",
        "So it wasn't that long ago that you were just another high school guy, you know, dreaming of playing in a rock band.",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "How did you end up being able to rock out classically instead?",
        "Well, when I was 16 years old I was going to be a rock star, but I ended up - you know, I got to high school and, you know, there was already a drummer in the band.",
        "So kind of by accident, I said, well, I'm going to try this whole treble bass clef thing, you know, melody harmony.",
        "To be honest, I didn't really know the difference between the two back then.",
        "So I kind of started playing marimba, holding four mallets, two mallets in each hand, watching some of the great marimba players.",
        "And I kind of said to myself, you know, I could be a drummer and, you know, do something that everyone's doing and it's been done so well so many times, or I could really take my drumming skills, combine them with what I'm learning now and not just be a percussionist but really a new kind of percussionist that really is - I don't want to say crossing over - that's not the right word - but really is not afraid to draw from other forms of music to bring it into classical music.",
        "And the marimba is prominent in the second movement of the piece that you'll be performing with violin.",
        "Right.",
        "I'm just going to play a little bit of the concerto.",
        "I think the real way to experience the piece is with the violin, because the piece has such a high degree of complexity.",

        "A marimba actually comes from thousands of years ago when tribes used to hang wood over holes in the ground and hit them to worship.",
        "And so I think in addition to the voice, the marimba is actually one of the oldest instruments in the world.",
        "Maybe deep down inside, that's what really appealed to me.",
        "There's just something very, very fundamental about this instrument in music making for me.",
        "That's - what we have here today is kind of a more advanced version of that.",
        "We have rosewood suspended.",
        "We have resonators underneath the wood, and it's in a massive frame that's been designed by Yamaha - I think spectacular, you know, it's just a spectacular instrument.",
        "It's eight feet long.",
        "We have five octaves.",
        "And each octave has its own unique character.",
        "The way I actually ended up getting - having the opportunity to play this concert and do this groundbreaking piece was because of the marimba part.",
        "When Harold called me, about a year ago now, he said Simon, my name is Harold Farberman and I have shown this marimba part to about three of the top freelancers in New York City and it has been deemed unplayable.",
        "And I said, okay, well, send me the music and I'll give it a read.",
        "And he came to my house in Brooklyn and, you know, he actually went back and rewrote it a couple of times and made it even harder once he saw me play it once.",
        "What made it unplayable?",
        "What is so difficult about it?",
        "I think the speed, you know, so...",
        "And you hit it with these mallets and it looks like you have a few dozen mallets to choose from here.",
        "I do.",
        "Describe them for me.",
        "All of the mallets, I think the differences between them, to kind of describe it really quickly, are that you have maybe a rubber core and then it's wrapped with yarn on the top of the mallet.",
        "Depending on how tight the yarn is wrapped, you get either a very booming and resonant sound or a more articulate and staccato sound.",
        "Can you demonstrate the differences?",
        "Sure.",
        "These mallets I'm using right now..."

        "So you have a third station in this movement as well, or a third station for the third movement.",
        "Yes.",
        "The third movement is actually different than the first two because it's a lyrical movement.",
        "With the first movement, just to recap, we have drums, bombastic sound, surprise, you know, all of these different things.",
        "With the second movement, we have marimba and we have this kind of back and forth between articulate sounding passages and then the chimes, which are very, you know, watery.",
        "Now the vibraphone, the way the second movement ends, is it ends with me hitting the chime and then out of that note the violinist is stanza G.",

        "Now, this is a vibraphone.",
        "And to me it looks a lot like a small version of the marimba, only you have metal keys as opposed to the wood.",
        "Well, from a technical standpoint, the reason it is different from a marimba is that it has a pedal on it.",
        "So I can play the vibraphone a couple of different ways.",
        "And this makes it a very lyrical and expressive instrument because you're using your feet like on a piano to control the sustain of the note.",
        "(Soundbite of vibraphone)",
        "There are two other sounds I get in this movement.",
        "I guess the first sounds that I want to show you is that I actually have to take a coin in my hand, place it on the bar of the vibraphone, and actually I take two coins and place them on two different notes, the D and the F sharp, so it sounds like this.",
        "I have quarters right now on the D and the F sharp and you'll hear at the bottom of the instrument I'm hitting regular notes and at the top I'm hearing shimmery notes with the coins.",
        "So it sounds like this.",
        "(Soundbite of vibraphone)",
        "Did the composer actually write in the score put coins on F sharp?",
        "Let me read you - I'll read you exactly what Harold wrote.",
        "Play notes with one mallet.",
        "Hold metal coin in other hand to create sizzle effect.",
        "But all the instruments I've showed you today can be played with different mallets, can be set up different ways, can be - I mean the amount of knowledge you can acquire as a percussionist is really infinite because of this aspect of playing percussion."

        "And I actually had to sit there and work with the composer on getting the best possible sound out of my chest, you know.",
