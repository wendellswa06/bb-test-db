        "None of the churches belong to his group.",
        "Behr says the Senate inquiry does not infringe on the separation of church and state because Grassley's questions have nothing to do with church doctrine.",

        "Were perks actually taxable benefits?",
        "Were gifts that were given to the ministry actually what's called a pass-through transaction, where the individual gives directly to the - to another individual rather than using the church in-between?",
        "The compensation that was derived for these individuals, these pastors or ministers - was there some oversight?",
        "While the majority of churches have responded to Senator Grassley, it's unclear how many will answer his questions.",
        "Joyce Meyer Ministries has posted financial reports on its Web site.",
        "In a news release, Meyer says even though she's not required by law to answer Grassley's questions, she'll do so by Thursday's deadline.",
        "Regarding the $23,000 commode, the statement calls it, quote, \"\"a tall, elegant chest of drawers,\"\" and says it's one of more than five dozen pieces of furniture that the ministry paid $261,000 for back in 2001 to furnish its headquarters.",
        "Grassley says he wants to make sure that billions of dollars in donations are being used properly and not for personal gain."

        "We're seeing many of the same phenomena that you've already seen in the States: rising unemployment, inflation going down toward a negative territory and clearly our financial system has suffered, and we've had to bail out a number of our banks in much the same way."

        "And so, although Gordon Brown is, I think, in spirit behind Obama, he simply can't afford to spend much more himself.",
        "And beyond that, is there sort of a different way of thinking in Great Britain where people have - don't have the same kind of safety net that people in other countries have, that there's less support for the unemployed, for instance?",
        "Well, I think that's the way it seems because we have a slightly higher level of support for the unemployed than there is in the U.S., but we have slightly less than in Germany and France.",
        "But if you look at the figures, actually, the amount that's going to be spent over the next couple of years on people who are unemployed is very significant, indeed.",
