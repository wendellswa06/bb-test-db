        "You can also join the conversation on our website.",
        "That address is npr.org.",
        "We'll also get questions from the audience here at the Grand Ballroom in the Hotel Jerome.",
        "Thanks, everybody, for coming in today.",

        "But we begin with David Savage, who covers the Supreme Court for the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune.",
        "He's on the phone from his office in Washington.",
        "And David, this is a pretty dramatic day there in Washington.",
        "Yes, quite an interesting scene and quite a surprise, too.",
        "I don't think many people were thinking that John Roberts would be the one who would save President Obama's healthcare law.",
        "Justice Kennedy dissented with - the four conservatives, dissented and said they would have struck down the law entirely.",
        "Chief Justice Roberts also came up with a way to save the law that I don't think many people had focused on.",
        "You know, this was debated about whether the so-called mandate was an unprecedented requirement that all Americans buy a product.",
        "You know, we've had endless discussions about the broccoli metaphor and whatnot.",
        "Roberts essentially agreed with the critics that you couldn't, Congress couldn't mandate the purchase of goods, but he said this law could also be justified as a tax.",
        "And I've said to people - my own, sort of, homemade example - if I said to you Congress is going to pass a law that said American families are required to have children or pay a tax penalty, the first part of that sounds totally unconstitutional.",
        "You couldn't require families to have children.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So I'm guessing that since the late 1990s, your children might have - not that we ever outgrow Legos, but I'm guessing...",
        "But if you said if you don't have children, you pay a tax penalty, that's sort of the way our system works.",
        "You know, that you don't have children, you end up paying at a higher rate and lower exemptions.",
        "We sort of accept the fact that there are a lot of tax consequences.",
        "And Roberts said - that's essentially how he upheld the law, said this is something that you would - in 2015, if you don't have health insurance, and if you have a decent income, some income, you would pay what they call like a personal responsibility payment with your tax return.",
        "And he said that sure looks like a tax, and Congress has the power to impose taxes, and therefore it's constitutional as a tax.",
        "Interesting that in Congress, when the law was debated, the Democrats did not want to call it a tax because, well, who wants to vote in favor of higher taxes.",
        "Nevertheless, as you're saying, the chief justice decided this is not on the basis of the \"\"commerce clause\"\" of the Constitution that Congress has the power to do this, but rather if it looks like a tax, and it acts like a tax, it is a tax no matter what they call it."

        "That's exactly the constitutional logic.",
        "You know, that the government said - the government did say in its briefs, by the way, they did make this argument, it just got very little attention at the oral arguments or anywhere else.",
        "They said if you look at this law, get away from the rhetoric about the mandate, look at the way this law works, nobody's going to be prosecuted or punished or fined if they don't have insurance.",
        "This is not some sort of true legal mandate.",
        "All it is if you don't have insurance, you pay this tax penalty.",
        "And the government said look at it that way, it's a tax, and that's the argument that the chief justice agreed with.",
        "One part of the law was struck down, and that involved the requirement for the states to provide more Medicaid coverage.",
        "That part was upheld, actually, it was just the teeth of that part where they were going to say if you don't do it, we're going to take away all of your Medicaid.",
        "Yes, that's right.",
        "This one's a little bit complicated to explain, and I think it'll be complicated to figure out what it's going to mean because the court basically said is that Congress can't require the states to go along with this expansion by threatening them with the loss of all their Medicaid money.",
        "You know, if Arkansas doesn't want to expand its Medicaid program and get another $40, that Washington can't threaten Arkansas by saying, hey, if you don't do that, you're going to lose $200 or $300 million of Medicaid money.",
        "And so the decision takes away the requirement.",
        "On the other hand, the federal government is going to pay something between 90 and 100 percent of the expansion.",
        "So I don't know for sure how this is going to work out, but I'd be very surprised if many states would say, well, no thank you.",
        "If the federal government's going to pay 100 percent of the expansion, I would assume most states will take the money.",
        "Let's bring another voice into the conversation.",
        "Joining us now is Richard Pildes, he's a constitutional law professor at New York University School of Law, he served as a law clerk for Justice Thurgood Marshall in 1984, and he joins us here at the Aspen Ideas Festival onstage in the Hotel Jerome.",
        "Thanks very much for being with us today.",
        "And thanks for having me here, Neal.",
        "And the drama of this day, it's a little hard to overstate just how big a decision this is.",
        "I think that's right.",
        "This is the most dramatic decision from the Supreme Court on a piece of domestic policy legislation, probably since the New Deal, since about 1937.",
        "This is obviously one of the most controversial pieces of domestic legislation, as well, as a matter of policy and as a matter of constitutional law."

        "And the decision today was a phenomenal moment in U.S.",
        "Supreme Court history, surprising to many, not surprising I think to most constitutional law professors, who were generally of the view that the statute was constitutional, surprising in the way Chief Justice Roberts got there.",
        "And I would say this decision is going to elevate Chief Justice Roberts personally to a stature that probably already makes him one of the most significant chief justices of the last 40 years.",
        "At his confirmation hearings, he said it's my job to play the referee.",
        "And it's interesting to look at the language of his majority opinion today, where he said look, I'm not ruling on the wisdom of this policy or whether this is the right thing to do, my job is to say fair or foul, strike or ball, it's constitutional or it isn't.",
        "Well, what's particularly striking about his decision is that he accepted the conservative or libertarian critique of the mandate.",
        "So he joined five members of the court, made up a five-member majority to hold that Congress had acted unconstitutionally under the commerce power by trying to regulate people who were not engaged in commerce, who did not have insurance, were not actively participating in the market.",
        "Now, if you thought he was doing that simply because he was hostile to the policy of the health care act, that would have been the end of the matter.",
        "But he then turned around and said no, on the other hand, this law can be upheld as a valid exercise of constitutional power under the taxing power that Congress has.",
        "So that's a very, very impressive, in a sense, feat of constitutional statesmanship on his part.",
        "David Savage, let's get back to you.",
        "One of the things that there was some speculation beforehand that if this was struck down on the basis that the \"\"commerce clause\"\" did not provide this kind of authority for Congress, that that would be a major decision.",
        "Does this ruling in that aspect change the way the court's going to go?",
        "Well, I assume maybe down the road.",
        "I suppose some conservative academics would say, you know, the silver lining here is that the court did sort of put a limit on Congress' power in the \"\"commerce clause\"\" to mandate the purchase of goods.",
        "And I assume also down the road, you know, Congress wouldn't do that again because the court has said it.",
        "So I think probably in a constitutional-law-doctrine sense, you could say the court did indeed put some limits on Congress' power, but practically speaking, by upholding it this way, I think most people will think Congress, you know, came out of this ahead.",
        "Rick Pildes, would you agree?",
        "Well, I would agree with that.",
        "I think it's important to recognize that the health care act really was an unprecedented and novel form of national economic regulation.",
        "I think the critique of it in those terms was correct: It was novel and unprecedented.",

        "By holding the statute unconstitutional as an exercise of the commerce power, the Supreme Court responded to the novelty and the unprecedented nature of this form of governmental power at the national level, but I don't think that that decision will have dramatic implications down the road because Congress has never tried to use national power in this way and is unlikely to probably try to do so in the future.",
        "David Savage, take us to the minority opinion, the dissent.",
        "What was the argument there, and how vehement was it?",
        "Pretty vehement for - Justice Kennedy read his opinion in the court, and as you know, in the - it's a rare day when there's a very big decision, and Justice Kennedy is in the dissent.",
        "You know, most of the people were sort of watching to see how Kennedy would go, thinking it would be outcome, that he would determine the outcome, and this is not so.",
        "He seemed to buy all the conservative arguments.",
        "He seemed to - he said that this is a unconstitutional, unprecedented mandate, and we ought to strike it down as that.",
        "And then we also out to say this is - you know, Congress has never done this sort of thing using the tax power to force people to do something.",
        "So he would have thrown it out on the tax grounds, too.",
        "And of course Justice Scalia and Justice Alito and Justice Thomas agreed with him.",

        "This was a series of, I gather, what, six different rulings.",
        "Well, let me see.",
        "There was a question about the anti-injunction act, whether they, of course, could rule on this.",

        "There was a separate decision on the Medicaid provision, and as we said, Roberts joined with the sort of conservative side in limiting the Medicaid power.",
        "And then there was a question of whether the mandate was constitutional.",
