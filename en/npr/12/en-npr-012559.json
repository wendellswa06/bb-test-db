        "And the president avoided, I think, what would have been a terrible, terrible defeat, to have his signature achievement thrown out in whole or in part.",
        "So it's a boost for him but still a huge target for Romney and a way that he can energize his base.",
        "Speaking after this morning's decision at the White House, President Obama acknowledged the controversy, acknowledge the polling, which shows that this law is not especially popular, but noted that, well, it did have bipartisan support.",
        "Even though I knew it wouldn't be politically popular and resisted the idea when I ran for this office, we ultimately included a provision in the Affordable Care Act that people who can afford to buy health insurance should take the responsibility to do so.",
        "In fact, this idea has enjoyed support from members of both parties, including the current Republican nominee for president.",
        "And of course not support when it came down to a vote in Congress, not one Republican voted for it, but he's talking about Mitt Romney as the intellectual father of Obamacare.",
        "That's right, and Romney has said in the past that he thought the mandate was constitutional, at least the one in Massachusetts.",
        "And Republicans are now saying they're going to run against Obamacare because it includes a tax.",
        "The mandate is no longer a mandate, it's a tax.",

        "First of all, nothing's going to happen in this election cycle because nothing's going to pass Congress in this election cycle.",

        "They voted to repeal it in the past, and Eric Cantor said today they're going to vote again on the 11th.",
        "It's not going to go anywhere in the United States Senate.",
        "However, Mitt Romney has promised that he will repeal it on day one, and if he is elected, and the Republicans take the Senate, which is completely possible, he will have the votes to do it.",
        "Now you can say, well, the Democrats could filibuster him.",
        "But because this is now a tax, it seems like they only will need 50 votes to repeal it just as the Democrats passed it in the Senate, with 51 votes."

        "So in terms of this election cycle, if you include 2013, I think that the health law will be overturned if Romney is elected, and it will be maintained if President Obama is re-elected.",
        "Now, one thing that Romney has talked about a little bit is that he will replace it with something else that controls costs, and he says that it will - he will make sure that people who have pre-existing conditions know they'll be able to be insured, and they will not lose their insurance.",
        "I think there he's talking about people who already have insurance, a kind of form of COBRA, where they can keep it, but not for people who have pre-existing conditions and want to get it.",
        "That, he hasn't been too detailed on.",
        "And Mara, we note that - again, the polling shows this is not popular.",
        "There's no way to guess, but could the Supreme Court decision in some way validate the president's law and change people's minds that, well, maybe this is a better thing than we thought?",
        "That's a really good question, and I was just talking about that with Julie here.",
        "Up until now, the White House has said all along as soon people know what's in this law, as soon as we get some facts on the ground, implement some of these provisions, the law will become more popular.",
        "That never happened.",
        "The universal coverage part of the law doesn't go into effect until 2014.",
        "So there's no way that they can demonstrate the law's - what they consider to be the law's positive effects between now and the presidential election day.",
        "But the question is: Does the Supreme Court still have enough standing in this society that the bipartisan imprimatur of the court, and this is John Roberts and the liberals, this wasn't just one of those five-four partisan decisions, will that change just enough swing voters' minds about the law?",

        "There's been little discussion about the highly - the word unprecedented has been used, but we haven't discussed the unprecedented procedure that was used actually to pass the health care bill, where the filibuster was circumvented by the Congress in order to get the bill passed.",
        "And I'd like to know your thoughts on that in terms of how our democracy works and the legitimacy of the bill and whether that should be a subject of discussion.",
        "He's talking about the legislative fast shuffle where it was ruled appropriate to use a procedure in the United States Senate that avoided the filibuster by talking about it as a tax but not really a tax.",
        "Yeah, so I think historically, many of the major pieces of American domestic policy legislation have been wrestled out of Congress through a variety of procedural mechanisms that bypass various gridlock points and veto points in the Congress.",
        "For example if you think about Lyndon Johnson and the enactment of the 1964 Civil Rights Act - I'm in the middle of reading Robert Caro's wonderful third volume in his biography on Johnson - they bypassed committee chairs.",
        "They did all sorts of things to avoid some of the veto points in Congress."

        "And I think this is actually very typical behavior in American history when you have, you know, deeply controversial legislation, particularly when you have a Congress that is so polarized and so divided.",

        "The administration now says that there's 3.1 million young adults under the age of 26 who have remained on their parents' health plans, that's something that the law provided.",
        "That has turned out to be extremely popular, so popular, in fact, that the Republicans got in a bit of an argument about whether, if the Supreme Court had struck down the whole law, whether they were going to have to act almost immediately to try to put that back.",
        "The doughnut hole in prescription drug coverage for seniors that's gradually being closed under this law, that's pretty popular, although there are some seniors that don't quite understand that that's being closed under the provisions of this law.",

        "Obviously, the main parts of this law, the expansion of Medicaid, the exchanges where people will be able to go and shop for health insurance and the subsidies to help them pay for that insurance, those things don't happen until 2014.",
        "And now with the sort of limbo being lifted from this law, states that are going to have to do that are going to have to really, you know, get their act together and start working on these things."

        "Yes.",
        "Thank you all.",
        "My question is about unintended consequences.",
        "I know there were penalties, I believe, $3,000 per employee for anyone - any company not offering health insurance, and I know they would lose their tax exemption.",

        "You can all go to the exchanges.",

        "It has.",
        "And, you know, there have been a lot of - there has been a lot of speculation about this, a lot of polling done of employers.",
        "Obviously, as the caller points out, there are penalties.",
        "It would be way expensive for a lot of employers to stop offering insurance.",
        "And the penalty applies if you stop offering insurance and someone goes into the exchange and gets a subsidy.",
        "That's where the penalty takes place because then basically taxpayers are now footing the bill for someone that the employer used to be covering.",
        "But basically, I think a lot of employers are going to continue to offer health insurance because, as I am told by most of the employer groups, it's good for, you know, competitive reasons, good for hiring workers.",
        "Employers want to have a healthy workforce.",
        "It's the same reason that they've been offering health insurance all these years, anyway.",
        "Remember, it's not required now, and yet, most employers, who can afford to, do it.",
        "It's currently voluntary, and yet, that's the norm at least for large employers.",
        "Small employers tend not to do it because they can't afford it - the idea of this law and these exchanges that it will make it more affordable for the small employers to be able to do it.",
        "Yet, Mara, that point that Julie just made, voluntary, there's the aspect of this law that it is not voluntary that you are now required by the government to either go get yourself some health insurance, either through your company or through an individual policy or you will be facing a penalty - well, maybe a reduction in your tax return.",
        "That's about it.",
        "But nevertheless, this is a powerful argument in American politics.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's a powerful argument, and it certainly has been a powerful argument up until now.",
        "And it's really interesting that this is an argument that the conservatives who designed the mandate saw it as a personal responsibility mandate or an anti-free rider tax.",
        "And the president never wanted to kind of embrace that argument at all.",
        "But now, that the Supreme Court has said the mandate itself is not constitutional but a tax is, he could try to argue if he wants to that nobody is being forced to have insurance.",
        "They're merely going to be taxed if they don't have it.",
        "But I do think the whole question of whether employers dump large numbers of people onto the individual market, how many people would rather pay the fee than get insurance, those are all questions that we're - that are going to be answered as this thing goes forward and gets implemented.",
        "But Republicans do feel that that the mandate was a powerful argument for them, and a tax is just as powerful.",
        "And you have to think that they're onto something because the White House tied itself up in knots to not call this a tax.",
        "They could have called it a tax all along.",
        "They could have called it the anti-free rider tax and maybe avoided some of the problems in the courts.",
        "But they didn't want to because they didn't think this thing could pass if it was called a tax."

        "Yes.",
        "Well, obviously, you know, everyone, even the people who supported this bill thought that it went pretty lightly on the cost-control part of health care.",
        "No one thinks that it was - it did enough, and partly, it's because no one really knows how to do that, how to really slow health care spending without actually taking health care away from people.",
        "I think most people's perception of this law is that it does a better job at expanding coverage than it does at controlling of cost.",
        "But nobody has a really, you know, good idea about how to do that.",
        "Clearly, there will be more efforts, I think, as people go forward, but, you know, part of the problem is that there is such partisan gridlock on this subject now.",
        "It has become such an issue in the campaign that Democrats and Republicans really want to go in such opposite directions right now that it's hard to imagine them coming together to agree on anything when it comes to health care.",
        "And, Rick Pildes, the Ryan plan embraced by candidate Mitt Romney does call for big cuts in health coverage in various parts, and that is voted again and again by the Republican majority.",
        "How does this decision today change that argument?",
        "Hey, James.",
        "Well, I think the big uncertainty about today's decision is going to be how the court's ruling that the Medicaid expansion was unconstitutional in part is going to affect the states.",
        "So this is actually a very important part of the case that we've not talked about too much yet.",
        "One of the major ways this statute expanded health care coverage to the uninsured was with a massive expansion of Medicaid.",
