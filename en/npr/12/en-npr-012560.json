        "It was the most unpopular portion of the law, although there - then it was considered to be kind of a lose-lose for the president.",
        "If the mandate got struck down, that would certainly be a loss also because it was his signature domestic achievement.",
        "So I think there are those who consider it to be less of a loss to have the law upheld than to have the mandate struck down, but now, obviously, the president is going into this campaign having what some people consider a policy albatross around his neck, even though his law has been upheld.",
        "The insurance industry is still - even though they get all of these new customers with this law is still unhappy about aspects of the law.",
        "They worry that this penalty or now if you want to call it a tax - since that's what the Supreme Court is calling it - the tax is too small to encourage enough people to actually buy insurance, and that people will be able to basically buy insurance.",
        "Now that they have to sell to people with preexisting conditions, they'll be able to buy insurance at the last-minute when they need it.",
        "So there are concerns that that penalty really needs to be either larger or people will have to - people - there needs to be more encouragement for people to buy insurance when they're healthy rather than wait until they get sick.",
        "So there may be if not losers they're worried that that more needs to be done to encourage people to buy insurance when they're healthy."

        "But one of the complaints about the mandate or the tax was that there's a very large group of young healthy people who do not want to spend their money on health insurance at this stage of their lives who are being brought into this system precisely for the purpose of subsidizing the people who have preexisting conditions and who would otherwise face very high premiums who are now being brought in to the system.",
        "So it's actually very tricky to talk about who the uninsured are, but certainly, among the losers would be the people who would say I don't want to spend my money on health insurance right now.",

        "So I'm wondering which is it?",

        "And someone would basically be in charge of knowing everything that happens to them rather than going to one doctor for one thing and another doctor for another thing and another doctor for something else.",
        "These are all ways of not only improving care, but lowering cost and improving value and, hopefully, making everybody's lives better, the patients and the doctors.",

        "The Medicaid expansion is the one place where states will, obviously, have a choice of whether or not to do it.",
