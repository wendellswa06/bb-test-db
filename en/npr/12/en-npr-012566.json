        "General David Petraeus, who I have enormous respect for - I think he's highly skilled, highly competent and took over a mess - he would be someone who could shed light on what has gone wrong, what we need to do better, how we engage other countries in the region to be part of this effort.",
        "And then in terms of who we ask to come before the committee, that's something that I think depends upon what information we're able to gather.",
        "Now a lot of these things that you're talking about, are things that were happening as the war started.",

        "As long as we're perceived as an occupying force in Iraq, we are not going to be able to defeat an insurgency.",
        "There were reports this week from the Wall Street Journal, that as part of President Bush's strategy that he'll be announcing next week, he's going to suggest that billions more go to Iraq, go to Iraqi reconstruction, go to actually the political parties in Iraq.",
        "Is that something that your committee would have oversight over?",
        "It's certainly something that we need to oversight and investigation of what has happened to the billions of dollars of reconstruction monies that we have already sent.",
        "We have invested billions and billions of dollars into an infrastructure for police and security in Iraq, and they literally have nothing to show for it.",
        "We need to find out why.",
        "Now, the oversight and investigation sub-committee that you will chair is under the House Armed Services Committee.",
        "But there are reports of other similar investigations and oversight panels under other committees that are being formed right now.",
        "Isn't there a risk here, that the Democrats might be on some sort of a partisan witch-hunt?",

        "And in the end, it's about the constitutional responsibility that our forefathers gave the Congress of the United States.",
        "When the Congress of the United States appropriates hundreds of billions of dollars, there is a responsibility to make sure that that money is being spent wisely and effectively.",
        "And that simply hasn't happened.",
        "And we need to do everything we can to makes sure that we don't waste another hundred to 200 billions of dollars doing the same thing."
