        "And they created an organization called AJUA, and they have been organizing their community.",
        "They've been doing incredible work meeting, or trying to meet with the police, with the sheriff, setting up meetings with the local school district, trying to get this police officer removed and create a policy so that that doesn't happen anymore.",

        "They're true leaders.",
        "They inspire me.",

        "And right now, you know, this week, they're standing in line at local immigration attorney's offices trying to figure out how to get in line with this new policy and try to achieve their dreams and their dreams of - that their families have for them.",
        "It's interesting.",
        "We live in world where dreamers is a term of art in this conversation.",

        "And I can't help but feel that there's this incredible upsurge of simple, basic humanity, you know?",
        "You mentioned with Reza earlier about the Internet.",

        "I am a bit cynical because I'm a political agnostic.",
        "So, you know, I say, OK, the DREAM Act, sure it's an election year, and my side wants to beat their side, and their side might pick a Latino vice president to try to beat my side.",
        "You know, I understand we're in a chess game.",
        "But the symbolism of the DREAM Act being, at least, protected a bit is very powerful.",
