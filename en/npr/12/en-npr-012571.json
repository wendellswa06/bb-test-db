        "What's their answer?",
        "We know it's not been politically advantageous, but what's their answer?",
        "Well, the whole public reason for this bill has been to give cities and towns, and state governments, the tools they need to cut costs.",
        "And if you're going to cut costs - if public employee unions are driving up costs, it would seem disingenuous to eliminate two public employee unions, which are pretty sizable throughout city and town budgets.",

        "What about on the other side?",
        "Has that been well-funded, too?",
        "No, well, well-funded being - I mean, they've raised $8 million, which is a good deal amount of money, but it's only about a quarter of what the opponents of the collective bargaining limits have raised.",
