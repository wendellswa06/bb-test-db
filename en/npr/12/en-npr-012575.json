        "And Janet, why the decision to go with Blu-ray?",
        "Well, Madeleine, the company says Blu-ray has proven to be more popular with consumers, so Blockbuster has decided to boost its inventory of Blu-ray discs to 1,700 stores by midsummer.",
        "But you know, it's not really that surprising that Blu-ray rentals are outpacing HD-DVD rentals when you can consider that Blu-ray is the format of choice for most of the movie studios - Fox, Sony and Disney don't offer any movie titles in the HD-DVD format.",
        "But what's the difference between the two?",
        "I know, and they're hard to say, right?",
        "Blu-ray discs apparently offer more space, so - and studios like that because you can put more stuff on them.",
        "There's room for like director's cuts and deleted scenes.",
        "And for some consumers, that's the whole reason they buy a DVD, so they can get the stuff that they can't see in the theater.",
        "Another difference is picture clarity.",
        "Blu-ray beats HD-DVD on that score.",
        "But you're going to have to pay more for Blu-ray.",
        "The Blu-ray player costs about $550 and the HD-DVD, with rebates now, you can get one for about $250-450.",
        "So this move by Blockbuster, is that powerful enough to basically say the war is over, Blu-ray won?",
        "Well, it's not quite game over just yet.",
        "I spoke to Richard Doherty about this.",
        "He's with the Envisioneering group.",
        "That's a tech assessment market research firm.",
        "And he says it's important to see if other movie rental companies choose one format over the other as well.",
        "Blockbuster is the number one renter of titles.",
        "But they're not alone.",
        "And so we think in coming weeks we'll hear of HD-DVD trying to do deals through other retail outlets where they may have a greater percentage of HD-DVD audience, like the game stores, for example."

        "And this is most especially the case when we think of people like our own grandparents who have lived so long before we even appeared on the scene.",
        "And even more so the case with someone like my own grandfather, who not only was in India and pursuing a life in India that I had very little sense of as a fruit merchant, so different from my physician father, but also as someone who had spent his childhood in Burma and had literally walked and pursued a very, very complicated and treacherous journey back to India from Burma during the second world war.",

        "He was running a small grocery shop, essentially.",
        "And when he and his family there began to get news of the Japanese incursion into Burma, what eventually happened was my own grandfather and his brother joined about - somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 other men, women and children who took a particularly treacherous route through the Arakan Mountains in western Burma - a route that was along - that unfolded along a military road through thick jungle, a route along which some 10,000 to 50,000 of those people who passed that way actually died.",
        "And he talks of their bullock cart literally running over - the wheels of their cart literally running over the bodies of those who had fallen along the way, of having to cook and eat and sleep beside the dead bodies piled up along that path.",
        "I think a lot of Americans might begin to contemplate living through an experience like that and thinking OK, if I survive, though, I could spend the rest of my life just recuperating.",
        "But that is when the rest of your grandfather's life began.",
        "It's quite extraordinary to think that my grandfather is a man who is nearly 95 years old, and this journey of which I speak took place in his early 20s.",
        "So the vast majority of his life, what the pieces that he had to pull together and put back together, were all things that happened in the wake of that journey - his return to that small village where he spent a lot of his childhood, his marrying my grandmother, their movement to a growing market town in South India, their children and the circuitous routes their own child took to wind up in the United States and other distant places.",
        "One of the most extraordinary things about my grandfather's story, for me, is the simple sweep of what we can see when we pay attention to the minutia of the life of someone such as him."
