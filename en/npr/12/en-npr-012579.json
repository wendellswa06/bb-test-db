        "There's no rhyme or reason as to why one perfume smells better to you than another one.",
        "And there's no rhyme or reason why one comic is completely your style, and another one isn't.",
        "And I found that really fascinating.",
        "The most poignant thing that I found Jerry Seinfeld to say is that stand-up comedy is not a monologue, it's a dialogue because the laughter is as important as the monologue itself because laughter has different sizes and shapes and sounds and tones to it.",
        "And you have to be able to create that conversation as fluidly as possible.",
        "And that's when you become a good comic, when you're creating a dialogue rather than a monologue.",
        "That's a great point.",
        "I can't imagine, like, being a monologist and rehearsing by yourself."
