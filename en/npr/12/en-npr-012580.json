        "It's really interesting.",
        "And it reminds me so much of those days when we all hung out together and tried to figure out these things together.",

        "You talked to a number of women comics...",
        "Yes.",
        "...female comedians, but I have to say, the most interesting part on the aspect of doing that was when you talked to Chris Rock, who said that when he's on stage doing relationship stuff, he is essentially a woman comedian.",
        "Yeah.",
        "He goes - because he gets inside their mind.",
        "He's not putting women down.",
