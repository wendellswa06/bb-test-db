        "That's one reason for these sessions, to take suggestions from the public and especially those affected.",
        "Under the draft guidelines, there are three categories of victims who will receive help from the fund - families of the 17 who were killed, those that were hospitalized or received other medical treatment for injuries and probably the largest group, those who have been receiving counseling for psychological trauma.",
        "Most of those at today's meeting were in that category.",

        "Flamm found that 179,000 nursing home residents are receiving antipsychotic medication even though a federal law says that they have the right to be free of, quote, \"\"chemical restraints.\"\" Those are drugs that are administered for the sole purpose of making residents docile.",
        "Flamm found that the government doesn't enforce that law.",
        "Our quantitative analysis found that between 2014 and 2017, 97 percent of citations for inappropriate use of antipsychotic drugs, there was no mandatory financial penalty that attached.",
