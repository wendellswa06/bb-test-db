        "Yeah.",
        "So because he has pass-through businesses, he would also - Trump would also benefit from this.",
        "But Trump would benefit in another important way.",
        "Steve Rosenthal of the Tax Policy Center says the new bill would allow income made from rents, royalties and licensing fees to pay the new lower rate.",
        "And of course rents, royalties and licensing fees make up a really big part of President Trump's income.",
        "Instead of paying at that top rate, he will pay much less than that.",
        "Are there any other ways Trump would or would not benefit from the tax plan?",
        "Yes, there are.",
        "I mean, consider this.",
        "A few months ago, his 2005 tax return was leaked.",
        "Part of it was.",
        "It showed he made more than $150 million and paid $38 million in taxes.",
        "But he only paid that because of the alternative minimum tax which kicks in when people with high incomes try to take a lot of deductions.",
        "If it weren't for the alternative minimum tax, he would have paid a lot less, maybe as little as $5 million.",
        "Trump has called for eliminating the alternative minimum tax, and the bills that are now before Congress would do that.",
        "Thirty-three million dollars' difference - that's a lot of money.",
        "And in just one year.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Another change that Trump has called for is the elimination of the estate tax, which is a tax people pay on the money that they leave behind when they die.",
        "How could that affect Trump?",
        "Oh, it would absolutely benefit him, especially the House bill, which would eliminate the estate tax altogether.",
        "The Senate bill would benefit him a lot less because it keeps the tax in place, although it increases the amount of money that's exempted from the tax.",
        "So Trump would benefit.",
        "We don't really know how much because we really don't know the size of his fortune.",
        "Trump has sometimes said, you know, he's worth as much as $10 billion.",
        "A lot of people think that's exaggerated.",
        "But you know, the federal estate tax typically amounts to about a sixth of the estate's value.",
        "So even if Trump is worth half or a quarter of what he says, I mean, we're still talking about a lot of money.",
        "NPR's Jim Zarroli, thank you so much."
