        "You know, the general world standard is to have so-called one-in-100-year protection for floods, and that's seen as more or less adequate.",
        "Well, the Dutch have always had one-in-10,000-year protection in terms of the North Sea, and they're going to move that up to one-in-100,000-year protection, meaning that they are protected against a flood that would only happen one in 100,000 times.",

        "We're in an economic downturn, and if we begin our development now, even just as little as, say, searching for water in the geological table, making our, you know, Midwestern desert states more inhabitable, come the time when sea levels rise and people are migrating inland.",
