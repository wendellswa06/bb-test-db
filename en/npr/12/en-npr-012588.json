        "Of course, we've got to reduce the emissions as quickly as possible because we're already locked in to very serious impacts.",
        "Three feet of sea level rise is going to be very challenging to adapt to.",
        "We don't want to make it 10.",

        "leader, which is Seattle King County out in Washington state, where they, as they put it, ask the climate question, which means go to your scientists, find out what kind of rainfall and temperatures and other impacts we're going to be facing by the year 2050 and then work backwards from there to figure out what we need to do today to deal with that.",
        "And in Chicago's case, they basically have two big issues.",
        "It's going to be a lot hotter there, and there's going to be stronger storms.",
        "They have the advantage of not being on a coast, so they don't have to worry so much about hurricanes or storms, and they also will have adequate water supply.",
        "So they've got that going for them in Chicago.",
        "They are going to have to deal with more extreme storms in both summer and winter and the higher temperatures.",
        "So one of the things they're doing is planting a lot more trees in Chicago to reduce the temperatures in the urban heat islands.",
        "They're also beefing up their health and emergency services and public outreach and education efforts so that people know that when the temperatures are going up that they need to take steps.",
        "They need to get to cooling centers.",

        "So what I hear you saying, Mark, is that there's not one plan for everybody?",
        "Every plan has to be local because you have different needs where you live.",
        "Every plan does have to be local, but there are certain core principles, which is one - and this was the - when I asked the Dutch, what's the one piece of advice you would give?",

        "And then finally, you want to make sure that your adaptation measures complement rather than contrast with the mitigation.",
        "That is to say when you are trying to prepare yourself, don't do things that are going to make global warming worse, such as turning on a lot of air-conditioning that is powered by coal-fired power plants.",
        "That's going to make the front end of the problem a lot worse.",
        "You say that the government needs to lead a rapid shift to green energy.",
        "You hear the president talking about this all the time, but no one is listening, you know, in terms of making a rapid shift.",
        "I think a lot of people are listening, but he is facing a Congress that is pretty in the pocket of big corporations and others and unions and others who are tied into the status quo.",

        "Look at our history, we've had strong oil and coal resources and therefore industries over time.",
        "And they really do call the shots in Washington to the point that even a president like Barack Obama, who came into office clearly understanding the urgency of the climate problem.",
        "I was in Grant Park in Chicago the night he won the presidency, and he astonished me by mentioning that climate challenge is one of the three big challenges he faced as president.",
        "And yet, he's come into office and done very little, shown very little leadership.",
        "When he talks about so-called clean energy along the same lines, he includes so-called clean coal, which is something that does not exist.",
        "It is literally a coal industry P.R.",
        "specialist phrase that has no business coming out of the mouth of the president of the United States.",
        "So he, I think, has been a disappointment on this front, but it is largely because he faces a Congress where the power of big money so far still is overreaching the power of the citizenry.",
        "We'll see if that continues as he goes forward.",
        "And in the last minute that I have, what about this - the nuclear disaster in Japan, a lot of environmentalists were looking toward nuclear power as an answer."

        "You know, I wrote a book on the nuclear industry in 1983 and interviewed a lot of the executives, and it was the very first time I heard about something called global warming.",
        "The nuclear industry was saying back in the early '80s that global warming was going to save their bacon because it was right after the Three Mile Island accident; everybody thought the industry was dead.",

        "Yeah.",

        "It's because nuclear is so expensive that a dollar that you invest in nuclear power compared to a dollar that you invest in energy efficiency, that dollar you invest in energy efficiency will save about seven times more carbon emissions quicker and cheaper than that dollar that you invest in nuclear.",
        "So if you invest in nuclear, you are making the problem worse by diverting scarce capital towards a dead-end economic solution.",

        "And also, do you believe that the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation should be more active in pushing a new version of the civil rights agenda?",
        "Well, we've already started with a new version of the civil rights agenda by renewing the Voting Rights Act, being a part of that dialogue that took place in the 109th Congress.",
        "The new civil rights is making sure that young people and people of color have not only access to capital, but to be a part of trading that capital that young people need to be able to access.",
        "Also, one of the major initiatives that we're pushing now is to have more in terms of color on Capitol Hill, and also provide more scholarships to allow people of color in the 43 districts that we represent, including the entire state of Illinois, to have access to college through scholarship opportunities to help them with their tuition."
