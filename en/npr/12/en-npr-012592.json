        "Well, you described inflammation pretty well.",
        "It's the attempt of some specialized cells in the body - and also the brain, as we'll talk about later - whose purpose is to defend self from non-self.",
        "This system, in us, exists in all organisms and it's there to protect us from invasive, you know, bacteria, viruses - all the things that would happen after you cut your finger, as you described - and it's there to protect us.",
        "Dr.",
        "Libby, can this immune response lead to sort of a runaway inflammation that just doesn't stop?",
        "That's right.",
        "The immune and inflammatory response is very important in our usual defenses against invaders and repair of injury, but it can get turned against us when it's deployed inappropriately or when it is, as you implied in your opening comments, fails to turn off.",
        "Ann Marie Schmidt, you're looking at a gene that is part of the immune response in many different diseases.",
        "Tell us about this RAGE gene.",
        "The RAGE gene is a gene that interacts with distinct molecules that our laboratory and others have shown - these molecules appear to be increased in chronic inflammatory settings.",
        "And it's our hypothesis, that when these molecules specifically interact with this receptor, that they form a part of the mechanism that amplifies inflammation and basically leads to chronic types of diseases.",
        "And what's interesting about this gene, is that it is up-regulated in settings where inflammation is present, such as in diabetes, in Neurodegenerative disorders, and also in classical immune inflammatory settings as well.",
        "So might this sort of be a master switch for inflammation?",
        "That is our hypothesis, and certainly the biology of this receptor is really driven by the specificity of the specific molecules that interact with it.",
        "But what we and others have shown is that this family of binding molecules that interact with RAGE appear to have one of their common facets being up regulation relief in inflammatory settings.",
        "How then would inflammation be a factor in a disease like diabetes?"

        "Well, in diabetes - that's a very good point.",
        "Because certainly, as you know, subjects that have diabetes are affected, not only in their large blood vessels - that is a vulnerability, increased susceptibility to heart attacks and strokes - but also they have diseases of what we call their micro vessels, and this is, for example, in the eye, in the kidney, in the peripheral nervous system.",
        "And many researchers now have shown, that at least one component of these complications that occurs in these individuals, is due to an increased inflammatory response.",
        "So our laboratory has focused on studying animals with diabetes, observing and studying the molecular pathways linked to inflammation, and then showing how the RAGE molecule - and specifically its antagonism or genetic modification might modulate the course of inflammation -and interestingly thus, the course of complications.",
        "Dr.",
        "Libby, we're talking about, in passing, inflammation playing a role in heart disease.",
        "I always thought that, you know, it was the plaques and the cholesterol and all that kind of stuff that caused heart disease.",
        "Where does inflammation come in here?",
        "Well, we used to think of the atherosclerotic plaque as a fatty deposit of cholesterol on the wall of the artery that we formerly envisaged as a lifeless tube.",
        "And we now understand that it's really quite different from that, that the lipids - the fatty material that accumulates in the artery wall when we have too high a cholesterol or when or good cholesterol isn't high enough - actually can incite this inflammatory response call in the blood cells, just like the knife wound that you discussed in your introductory comments, and set up a spiraling signaling cascade that sustains and amplifies the damage that's done to the artery.",
        "And eventually, sometimes after decades of brewing silently, can express itself as a blood clot that can cause a heart attack or a stroke or gangrene of a limb.",
        "I'm shocked.",
        "Most Americans - I don't think I'm exaggerating here - would see those conflicts in terms of the experience of the American troops.",

        "Muslim Americans also serve in the armed forces just like (unintelligible) Americans.",
        "Of course.",
        "And they also - though I think it's particularly - if they have family there or if they have family in nearby countries, then they feel the conflict in a more intimate fashion than a lot of other Americans.",
        "So I think one of the things that you see is that the Muslim American community is very diverse and it comes from the most - a lot of different places, and that they can bring a lot of different perspectives to the table.",
