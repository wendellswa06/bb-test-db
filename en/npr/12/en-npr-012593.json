        "Yeah.",
        "You know, one of the advance Muslims that have got up in Portland, Oregon, you know, kind of changed it a lot in terms of the viewing of your friends and how, you know, people asked you about what do you see as, you know, as an individual.",
        "So one event always kind of traces back to, you know, your living situations, you know, (unintelligible) and all other places.",
        "So I didn't expect that, you know - but unable the event to happen in Portland, Oregon.",
        "So when I had it, many friends have called me, telling me, you know, you had it.",
        "How do you feel about it?",
        "It's like as if, you know, they always connect you to those events.",
        "So that was one of the things that reminds me of the memory.",
        "And so, the events that happened completely outside your experience is somehow - you're implicated by just - by being a Muslim?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Mainly, because, you know, people connect, like if one have, like the similar event, like the event that happened in Portland, Oregon, looks like, okay.",
        "Many people do view - because if they used to - enable - to allow us - connect us together with friends, you know, that - isn't that event is changing the whole thing.",
        "People view you as a different person.",
        "And, again, the guy who is, you know, from Somalia, and I'm a Somali person, that connects us, you know, to a bigger issue.",
        "And then it creates a lot of implications for youth even to connect with the other fellow friends from other religions or other, you know, beliefs, yeah.",
        "And thank you very much for the call, Mohammed.",
        "And we wish you the best of luck in the coming year.",
        "And Moustafa Bayoumi, I think he's referring to the alleged Christmas tree plot that was stopped in Portland just a little while ago.",
        "And the - I guess - is there an element of collective guilt?",
        "I think quite definitely there is.",
        "In fact, what happened afterwards was there was an arson on the mosque in Portland, shortly after the announcement of that arrest.",
        "And so, this is one of the problems - social problems that I think we have to deal with.",
        "The idea that somehow blame can then be just transported across to the whole community is kind of scapegoating, a kind of ethnic or religious scapegoating that, unfortunately, does have its own precedence in the American history.",
        "And I think it's something that we should be vigilant in trying to prevent as well.",
        "Here's an email from Chris(ph) in Minneapolis: High unemployment equals high anti-Muslim sentiment.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that that's partly true.",
        "I think that there's a way in which - when the economy is doing badly, people are looking also, again, for scapegoats.",
        "I also think that it's wrong.",
        "It's too narrow to see it as only a Muslim problem right now.",
        "I think that - you also have a kind of anti-immigrant sentiment that's quite common in the country, perhaps most clearly expressed by the Arizona law, SB 1070.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And so, you have that kind of anti-Muslim movement going on in the country.",
        "You have a kind of anti-immigrant sentiment that's popular as well, and I see that it's actually connected also to this idea that at least 20 percent of the population now believes that the president himself is a secret Muslim according to some polls."
