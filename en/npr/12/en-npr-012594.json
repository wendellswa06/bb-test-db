        "Do you have a sense of what's driving that divide?",
        "Well, it's really pretty interesting because I think most people would not be surprised that religious beliefs would influence opinions on abortion or same-sex marriage really either way, conservative or liberal direction.",
        "But given the amount of activism we've seen recently on issues like immigration and the environment on the part of religious organizations and clergy, it was to some people a little bit surprising that those issues seemed to have very little impact on the attitudes that people had.",

        "No, it (Technical difficulties) about politics, really, and we were (technical difficulties) various things that might influence people's opinions on a variety of issues.",
        "And the way the question was asked was to ask people what the most important influence on their opinion was.",
        "So this isn't a comprehensive measure, but it does tell us where people think their religion or their education or their personal experience were the most important impact on their opinion.",

        "Much of that discussion has been in the context of faith, really on both sides of those arguments.",
