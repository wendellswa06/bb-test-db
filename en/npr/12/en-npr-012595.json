        "And in a faith-based context, most or many religious leaders would argue against the current trend of American public opinion.",
        "Yes, indeed, and so it is interesting.",
        "I think part of this may just be history.",
        "There's another factor here that I think is important: Some issues are easier to connect with religious values, and some are more difficult.",
        "And because of the traditional emphasis in many religious institutions on sexual morality, perhaps it is easier for some people to draw a straight-line connection between beliefs and views on sexual matters, such as abortion or homosexuality.",
        "It may be when we come to other public policy issues like the environment or welfare payments or immigration that there's not quite as easy a path between religious beliefs and political attitudes.",
        "Well, is it also possible that people hold a certain set of beliefs, and they're the ones we see reflected in the opinion polls, and when they're in church, they accept the church's teaching on those they agree with the church on, whatever church or synagogue or mosque that may be, and when they - when the teachings of their religious leaders diverge from their opinions, they stick to their opinions?",
        "You know, that's entirely possible.",
        "Many of us have selective perception of arguments, not just in a religious context but in other contexts, as well.",
        "And, you know, it may very well be that people tune out teachings that they really don't want to hear.",
        "For example, why would they not hear something about charity or, you know, welcoming a poor neighbor?",
        "Exactly.",
        "It may very well be that there are teachings, and the same survey had some reports on what people were hearing in their congregations, and people were hearing about some of these issues where they didn't report much of a religious connection with their attitudes.",
        "So it may be partly people screen out the things that they don't want to hear, but it also could be that they have other opinions.",
        "For instance on the issue of immigration, religious values might be one factor in opinion, but issues of national security might be another factor.",
        "Or in the case of welfare payments, it may be that arguments for charity are one kind of basis for an opinion, but economic interests might be another argument."

        "And in fact, if we could ask people a lot more questions, we might find that on some of these issues, religion is an influence.",
        "It's just the fourth or fifth influence and not the first influence on their opinion.",
        "Let's bring another voice into the conversation: Robert Putnam, the author of many books, including \"\"Bowling Alone.\"\" His latest, co-authored with David Campbell, is \"\"American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us.\"\" He's also a professor of public policy at Harvard and joins us today from member station WBUR in Boston.",
        "Nice to have you with us today.",
        "Good to be back, Neal, and good to be on this show with John Green, who is one of the gurus of religious studies in America.",
        "Well, I wonder what you make of his latest survey.",
        "Well, I think it's a really interesting study, and it rhymes with much of the things that we investigated in the course of our research.",
        "The one additional point I'd make about it is that it's possible that what people hear, or think they're going to hear, opinions in church, that they personally disagree with, they don't change their opinions, and they don't just tune out, but they actually stop going to church.",
        "That is in some sense, it's possible, at least, that people's views on many of these issues, especially the issues of sexuality and family values that John has been talking about, their values are actually most fundamental, and if they come to think that religion is wrong on those issues or that religious preachers or that organized religion is wrong on those issues, they vote with their feet and leave.",
        "And indeed, I think one of the things that we've discovered in our work, which this is a - the book \"\"American Grace,\"\" that David Campbell and I have written, is a big book, and it covers a lot of topics, but one of the topics that we talk about is the so-called rise of the young nones, that is young people over the last - that's N-O-N-E-S, not N-U-N.",
        "I was going to say, not Catholic sisters.",
        "No but the rise of the people who say, when you ask them what religion they have, they say I don't have any religion, I'm just not religious at all."

        "Historically, that figure in America was roughly five percent of Americans said they had no religion, and 95 percent said they had some religion.",
        "But among young people, since 1990, among the people who were basically 20-somethings across the country, that figure has now skyrocketed from about five percent to about 25 or 30 percent, a huge increase in detachment from organized religion among America's young people.",
        "And that has a number of causes, but we think we have evidence that the most important factor is that for those young people, people who are coming of age in the 1980s and 1990s, for them, looking around, religion seemed to be mostly about sexual morality and, as they would have seen it, intolerance and homophobia and so on, and they had a very -much more tolerant view, especially about homosexuality.",
        "And so many of them said, well, if religion is just about being a conservative Republican, that's not for me, and they stopped thinking of themselves as religious at all.",
        "They may not have been around in church to hear those other messages about charity and immigration.",
        "But John Green, I wonder how you - would that comport with some of the things that you're finding, not necessarily in this survey but in others?",
        "Oh, I think so.",
        "And by the way, it's a great pleasure to be on this program with Bob Putnam, who is really very insightful on these issues.",
        "Religion influences politics, but politics can also influence religion.",
        "And over time, we may see people sorting themselves into environments where they hear the kinds of messages they find congenial, and they may be absencing themselves entirely.",
        "And Neal, your point, which is a useful one, if young people were leaving traditional churches because they were hearing what they regarded as messages of intolerance, they might not be around to hear the messages about charity and being good stewards of the environment.",
        "And so in some sense, they are out of the mix, and that may help explain some of our finding.",

        "And the thing I think you're going to find, and I think that might have something to do with some of your findings, is that I find that a lot of people my age, well, in general, are people who are sincerely religious, and that is to say they're using, you know, it influences their whole lives, including their politics, tend to take most of their opinions and most of their voting and whatnot to the - at the local level, at the state level, where their influence is more directly felt.",
        "I feel like a lot of people, at least people who I talk to that share some of my same beliefs, you know, tend to find that because we respect the separation of church and state, and we find the national stage is not really the place to discuss - what's the word I'm looking - it's not really the place to discuss the - we're not going to force our opinions on the whole nation.",
