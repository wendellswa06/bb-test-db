        "Well, you know, what's really surprising me right at the moment is the religious aspects of the Tea Party movement, which we've been hearing an awful lot about.",
        "In terms of the public statements of Tea Party activists and candidates, it seems to be mostly about economic issues - and I think for a good reason, given the state of the economy.",
        "But what we find in our surveys is an awful lot of conservative religious people have also been mobilized by the Tea Party.",
        "So it's not surprising that some culturally conservative issues are part of the mix among those people.",
        "Let's go next to Bob, and Bob's with us from Cleveland.",
        "Hi.",
        "Hi.",
        "Go ahead, Bob.",
        "Yeah, I had a - I went through kind of an epiphany.",
        "I used to be a, you know, a conservative voter, Republican, and then I started to realize like issues on abortion, you know, we'd put Republicans in office like, you know, Ronald Reagan and then the first George Bush, expecting them to appoint justices that would, you know, be against abortion, as much as - but then I began to realize and I began to look at a lot of issues that the Republicans just kind of use these, play religious voters.",
        "I mean, if we - if Reagan and Bush and the Republican Party had really wanted to end abortion, they could have done it by now with the chance for appointments they have.",
        "I've never seen a justice that a Democrat appoints, you know, change their opinion, you know, like if - and vote against abortion.",
        "So you feel manipulated.",
        "And so - is that an accurate...",
        "Yeah, I felt manipulated, but I also felt they were - you know, they were kind of bending Christian values.",
        "Like, you know, you have conservatives referring to homeless as human debris, and that always bothered me as a Christian."

        "But I'd never heard anybody in the Republican say hey - Party, say to these, you know, these very powerful, let's say, political commentators that used words like that, they would never say to them: That's not very Christian.",
        "Or at least David Frum did, in a way.",
        "But, you know, I found myself becoming much more of - I guess you would say - a Democratic voter now, and, you know, especially after the second Bush, where you had, you know, the debacle at Walter Reed Hospital, where our wounded veterans were, you know, being mistreated.",
        "And leading conservatives weren't -you know, just as a Christian thing, you would expect them to say, hey, this is wrong.",
        "But it didn't - it, you know, it just seemed like a number of issues, Republicans only seem to talk Christian values.",
        "You know, it's just talk.",
        "It doesn't really mean anything.",
        "So I guess I - it caused me to, you know, kind of change and look for candidates who are really, you know, doing the things they are saying and not just, you know, reciting words that I want to hear.",

        "Yeah.",
        "There was another point that Bob was making that I thought was quite important.",
        "You know, the background - we are now all accustomed to thinking of a natural correlation between religion and politics that Republicans are drawn from the more religious end of the spectrum and Democrats from the more secular end.",
        "But that's a very recent phenomenon.",
        "As recently as the 1960s and 1970s, there were lots of progressive Democrats in the pews and lots of unchurched conservatives.",
        "And - but since the 1980s, the period that Bob was talking about - Reagan and the first Bush and then, of course, the second Bush - those two categories have become rarer and rarer.",
        "That is, there are fewer and fewer progressives in the pews, and fewer and fewer unchurched conservatives.",
        "And people are sort of sorting themselves out religiously, as much as politically, into two groups, the more - the people who share the same religious values and political values at one end, and then people who share the same, more secular values and, you know, liberal or progressive political values.",
        "And are you...",
        "That's a new development, and it's not necessarily good for our politics."

        "Back when Ronald Reagan was president and articulated a pro-life position, there were still lots and lots of pro-choice Republicans - and there, in fact, still are some.",
        "So once he got into office - and I don't mean to pick on President Reagan, it occurs with lots of public officials - it became very difficult to have a pure, unambiguous pro-life position.",
        "So I think that fits very much with a kind of polarization that Bob Putnam was talking about.",
        "It was interesting: President Reagan used to attend, I think, all of those rallies by phone from across the street in the White House.",
        "He didn't attend in person.",
        "And, of course, he was a president who did not attend church regularly, either.",

        "So what I did, actually, as a personal endeavor is to separate faith from religion.",

        "I mean, you could be a Christian, a Muslim and a Jew or a Hindu, and then you are - you're having a similar faith, because faith is about God, about, you know, from where did I come, where I'm going, and where I'm going is a basic question that the state has nothing to do with."

        "Well, yes.",
        "But if you look at Islam, per se, the Quran keeps on emphasizing the fact that there is no compulsion in religion and that the Prophet himself have no right to compel people to believe or not to believe.",

        "But that divide he was making between religion and faith strikes me that that is the same divide that some of the nones you are talking about -the N-O-N-E-S - the younger people who are rejecting organized religion, they may be making that same distinction.",
        "Yes, I was thinking the same thing, Neal.",
        "There's - you know, there's - Malki's contribution to the conversation opens up another line of conversation, and that is, in some respects, America is quite unusual.",
        "It's partly because of the separation of church and state that goes back to the Constitution.",
        "But Americans are, compared to other peoples in the world, other - certainly other advanced -economically advanced countries - way very, very religious.",
        "We are - the average American, in terms of attendance at church or saying that important - religion is important to them, and so on, the average American is as religious - a little religious than the average Iranian.",
        "So Americans are very religious.",
        "We are also very diverse in our religions.",
        "Not only between Catholics and Protestants, which was historically the big difference, but now increasingly other religions, too.",
        "In most parts of the world, places that are deeply devout and diverse religiously have a high index of mayhem - that is, there's a - taken in high doses, religion is generally toxic to civic health."
