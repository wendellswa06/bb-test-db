        "But America, despite what we've been saying about the polarization - and that's, of course, true over the last generation - Americans actually, including religion - religious people of all sorts, are surprisingly tolerant of other people.",
        "And so - and certainly way more tolerant than you'd expect given the fact that we're very religious and diverse in our religiosity.",
        "Dr.",
        "Wenk, would we then say that inflammation can play a role in all kinds of different diseases?",
        "Would it be fair to say that?",
        "First, what do you see as the threat to international politics posed by Donald Trump's presidency?",
        "So part of the puzzle and part of what's happened over the last 50 years, as we describe in - as David Campbell and I described in our book, \"\"American Grace,\"\" is not just that America is becoming more polarized in religious and political terms - that's true - but also that we've become, in some sense, at the grassroots, much more connected with one another across religious barriers.",
        "Why do you say that?",
        "Well, for example, the rate of intermarriage across religious lines has risen sharply and steadily over the last half century, so that now more than half of all the marriages in America today are - just like Chelsea Clinton's marriage - across religious lines.",
        "A generation or two ago, the idea of a Methodist marrying a Jew would've been really, really astonishing, but now it's completely normal, and nobody thinks anything about it.",
        "About a third of all Americans are no longer in the same religion they were raised in.",
        "So that means that they're worshipping in some faith other than their parents' faith, or other than their kids' faith.",
        "Half of all of our most intimate, personal friends are people from other faith traditions.",
        "So we're - we, the average American - in fact, almost all Americans know someone personally, really well, love someone who is in a different religious faith than they are.",
        "And it's hard to demonize people who are - you know, nominally, you'd say, well, of course, you know, poor Aunt Sally.",
        "She's not going to make it to heaven because she prays to the wrong God.",
        "But, I mean, come on.",
        "Aunt Sally is Aunt Sally.",
        "She, for sure, is going to heaven.",
        "So all of us have an Aunt Sally in our family or in our circle of friends.",
        "And for that reason, it's become increasingly hard for Americans in their own personal lives to demonize people of other faiths.",
        "And, in fact, we find, and other - John Green's research at Pew also finds that there's a surprisingly high level of personal tolerance across these divides.",
        "We're talking with Robert Putnam, co-author most recently of \"\"American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us.",

        "Hi.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Greetings from an extremely red state.",
        "I find myself in kind of an odd, almost a hybrid-type situation, being a social conservative with regards to gay marriage and the abortion issue, and yet very progressive on other issues, on social justice issues.",
        "And so I'm really encouraged to hear this kind of a conversation coming out.",
        "And one of the comments I wanted to make was, you know, when Barack Obama was elected and Rick Warren from Saddleback Church was being interviewed on \"\"60 Minutes\"\" because he had prayed at the inaugural ceremony, and they said, well, what about the Democrats' view on abortion?",
        "And he said, look, there's been four Republican presidents and - since Roe versus Wade, and nothing's really been done.",
        "Why do people raise such an issue every time a Democrat's elected?",
        "Why don't they take care of it when there's a Republican in office?",
        "And so I just wanted to make that comment about that.",
        "And I wanted to ask you, David, though, in - are you - are all your positions on those issues - abortion, immigration, the environment, gay marriage - are they influenced by your religion?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "When it comes to immigration, I think about what Christ said about, you know, who is our neighbor (technical difficulty) teaching of the Good Samaritan, you know, that our neighbor doesn't - isn't necessarily defined by borders.",
        "And so that's an extremely important issue.",
        "And then when he teaches about doing to the least of these, he's talking (technical difficulty) sick, the homeless, those without clothing, those without food, and those (technical difficulty) those in prison.",
        "So, yeah, there's plenty of biblical references to back up a social justice, despite what Glenn Beck says about social justice.",

        "Yeah.",

        "Yeah.",
        "It's - I certainly have to recognize that there are some young people who share Keith's views that there's a strong connection that homosexuality is wrong, maybe a sin, and that their faith calls them to oppose it.",
        "And there are young people like that.",
        "But we know very well and it's - again, this is not just from our work, but from John Green's and others - that most young people have moved very, very sharply in the direction of being more accepting of homosexuality.",
        "And that puts them more out of touch with the traditional religious organizations on this issue.",

        "We're beginning to think that it plays a role in many different neurological diseases, especially those that occur with aging.",
        "And I think Dr. Libby has touched on it.",
        "Just similar to what you see in the periphery, in the brain, time seems to be the key factor.",
        "In our studies here at OSU, you know, we've discovered that acute inflammation isn't as damaging to the brain as long-term chronic inflammation.",
        "So I think time is our greatest enemy when it comes to inflammation, because it always seems to be in the background, just working away.",
        "It's got good features, it has bad features, and we're trying to identify how to augment the good and somehow attenuate the bad.",
        "Let me ask all of you, if inflammation is suspect and the criminal in this case, why don't we just take an anti-inflammatory drug - pop an aspirin, an Advil or something every day - and combat it that way.",
        "Who wants to jump in on that one?",
        "Go ahead, Dr. Libby, you can go first.",
        "Okay, well, you know, the kinds of doses which are anti-inflammatory really are the kinds that cause significant side effects, such as ringing in the ears and problems with increased stomach problems with bleeding.",
        "And the doses of aspirin which actually work to reduce heart attacks - which it certainly does in certain populations - are doses that can interfere with the blood element that causes blood clotting, that is the platelet in our blood, but doesn't really have a direct anti-inflammatory effect.",
        "So the problem with your concept of putting everyone on anti-inflammatory drugs is that we don't have a safe enough anti-inflammatory drug for widespread use.",
        "And a lot of where we're going in medicine in general, and in this area in particular, is personalized - where we want to be able to learn more about an individual so that we can get exactly the right recipe of interventions - both in lifestyle, and occasionally we need to use drugs to try to improve their outcomes, and decrease their risk of having events in the particular disease that we're interested in.",
        "Dr.",
        "Wenk, you wanted to jump in there.",
        "Yeah, I did.",
        "With regard to the brain, aspirin doesn't cross into the brain very well.",
        "It doesn't get across the blood-brain barrier hardly at all, and it doesn't need to to treat a headache or, you know, a bruised limb of some kind.",
        "So when you look at the epidemiology of people who've taken aspirin and asked the question, are they less likely to get Alzheimer's disease, and the answer is then no. The data correlates much better with drugs like ibuprofen, what we know as Advil, which does seem to cross the blood-brain barrier, and other anti-inflammatories that can get in.",
        "So with the brain, because it's protected, there's another barrier to get across when people are taking these things.",
        "So as Dr. Libby mentions, dose becomes critical, and you want to find something that's safe but also gets in at a dose that actually has some impact on the brain.",
        "We've heard stories about - medical reports and research about the statins.",
        "The statins is fighting off cholesterol, but also helping in heart disease because it's an anti-inflammatory drug.",

        "Yes, this is Peter Libby.",
        "We have definite evidence that the statins can be anti-inflammatory, and maybe by combination effect lowering the bad cholesterol so that we remove one of the stimuli to the inflammation - one of the triggers - and also because the pathway which leads to the makeup of cholesterol by the body has more than 20 steps.",
        "And along that long complicated biochemical pathway, there are little side roads that lead to modification of some of the signaling molecules that we think are crucial in regulating - in modulating the immune and inflammatory response.",
        "And there's very good biochemical and molecular, as well as clinical evidence, that we may activate those side roads of the cholesterol synthesis pathway in a way that actually will put a break on inflammation.",
        "And I think you can't just think of inflammation as the flame that burns ever brighter, because there's actually a tug of war going on in these chronic diseases, between our body's own anti-inflammatory mechanisms, these counter regulatory measures and the inflammation.",
        "So it's really a complex tug-of-war that's going on in the brain that's affected by chronic inflammatory diseases, as well as the blood vessel, as well as many other organs.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "We're talking about inflammation.",
        "Are you saying that we might go too far in the other direction, you know, that inflammation may be good for us?",
        "Dr.",
        "Schmidt, we might go too far in fighting the body's own defense mechanism?",
        "Exactly.",
        "The body, basically, is designed into, in terms of inflammation, the innate inflammatory response, which is really a very ancient and critical response to, for example, bacterial infections.",
        "And then, along the line of how the immune response evolved, we have the adaptive immune response, which is the type of immune reactions that can lead to, for example, the types of things we're talking about, as well as autoimmune diseases, in general.",
        "So it surely is a fine line in terms of being able to retain the ability to react rapidly and acutely to pathogenic settings such as infection and wounding, and the ability to know how to modulate this properly in order to not shutdown affective responses that are critical for our survival in complex environments in which we live.",
