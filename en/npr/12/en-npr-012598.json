        "Good question.",
        "Dr. Libby, can you tackle that one?",
        "And before the break, we heard that aging plays a huge role in inflammation in the periphery, and that's especially true in the brain.",
        "So it's been difficult to find ways to reduce inflammation in brain.",
        "And I think that's why this recent research on, you know, these marijuana-like compounds is so exciting.",
        "For the first time, we may be able to help people out when inflammation develops as they age.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, unrefined carbohydrates are generally easier for the body to deal with, metabolically, than the highly refined carbohydrates such as granulated sugar or white bread, which causes a real burst of insulin.",
        "And over the years, that can put a stress on the pancreas, which is where insulin comes from the body.",
        "And it really can stress out the cells that pump out insulin because if you have these big spikes in your blood sugar because you've had these quickly broken down carbohydrates, then the cell of the pancreas that makes the insulin - we call the beta cell - can get tired.",
        "And that's one of the reasons that we think people can develop diabetes, because they get stress on their beta cells.",
        "1-800-989-8255.",
        "We're talking about inflammation, this hour, on TALK OF THE NATION Science Friday from NPR News.",
        "Thank you for calling.",
        "I hope that answers your question.",
        "So is the Holy Grail, Dr. Schmidt, I know that Columbia's working on a patent that - for the RAGE gene, correct?",
        "Is the Holy Grail, then, defines one of these master controllers of inflation, or a simple drug that might keep inflation in check and then ward off a lot of diseases?",
        "Well, you know, obviously, this is something that's been tested by we and others in cell culture systems and also in animals.",
        "And certainly, the real test of this concept that this family of molecules that is linked to inflammation that interact with this receptor, that the blockade of those pathways might be beneficial, is certainly one of the things - as physicians - that drove us may years ago to try to reach that point.",
        "There are early stage clinical trials in progress, now, with patients who have diabetes, and also, patients with Alzheimer's disease, really testing that concept that blocking this receptor might actually afford benefiting this chronic settings."

        "So certainly, that is open to clinical trial testing and this is a work that's very aggressively being pursued at this time.",
        "Dr.",
        "Libby, there is a marker of inflammation that can be correlated with coronary artery disease, and some people have - we've heard about the C-reactive protein - had sort of had its up and downs.",
        "Is it still considered a good and reliable marker?",
        "Well, it is a controversial matter, and one that the experts can debate for days, and have, in the last year.",
        "The C-reactive protein is a simple blood test that is sort of an overall gauge of the inflammation that's taking in your body.",
        "And it turns out to be a very good predictor of your cardiovascular risk in the future that adds to what we can figure out from the usual, traditional risk factors that everyone knows about that is age, and sex, and smoking, and blood pressure, and good cholesterol, bad cholesterol.",
        "And what those of us who are working in this field are becoming convinced of is that when we measure the C-reactive protein in addition to all those traditional risk factors, which still hold up very, very well - we can sharpen our ability to predict who might be at risk, at a higher risk for a cardiovascular event in the future.",
        "And that can be very important in trying to select people who need special attention in terms of their diet, in terms of physical activity and people are now testing whether or not we can guide therapy with drugs based on this C-reactive protein measurement, in addition to the traditional risk factors.",
        "Well, we also look toward this new age of individualized medicine where we look at the genetic makeup of each individual and decide what might work for them?",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "That's the goal, is to try to find markers, which look at different pathways that leads to disease, and can each give us additional information.",
        "So we think that the C-reactive protein, bringing out information, is giving us a view of the disease that we don't get from the traditional risk factors, and that's why it's not just gilding the lily, it's actually added value.",
        "We're going to take a short break and come back, take your questions about inflammation, talk lots more with Gary Wenk, Ann Marie Schmidt, Peter Libby, about inflammation and about what role inflammation may play in some of the many diseases we have.",

        "We'd be very happy to take your questions.",

        "Good morning or afternoon.",
        "Great show.",
        "On the marijuana situation, with the recent research that show the prophylactic effect for lab animals, mice and rats, as far as Alzheimer's, and it also showed that it slowed the progression once these animals had contracted the disease.",
        "Is that due to anti-inflammation?",
        "And if so, does that anti-inflammatory characteristic carry through to any other organs on issues of inflammation?",
        "Good question.",
        "Dr. Wenk?",

        "Actually, yes, indeed it does.",
        "The mechanisms of action of cannabinoids, you know, the active ingredient in marijuana, has not been fully worked out, but we're making some progress of that.",
        "In fact, since the last time we spoke, there's been a real landmark study by Marshall Lanch(ph), showing that aged animals and therefore, by extension, we hope aged people - may be able to benefit from cannabinoids.",
        "You know, the stimulation of the brain's own endogenous marijuana receptors might be able to reduce inflammation in an aged brain.",

        "And given what we've heard about inflammation of the periphery from other two guests, there is every reason to believe that if an anti-inflammatory works in the brain, it's likely to work by the similar mechanisms in the rest of the body.",
        "So I think it's very exciting.",
        "The epidemiologists suggest that it should work.",
        "Animal studies suggest that it should work.",
        "So I think if we can just find a nice, safe, effective drug that gets into the brain and doesn't, you know, produce the psychoactive high, which would simply make, you know, the symptoms of dementia worse, then I think there's a lot of hope for what might lie down in the future for the treatment of a number of different degenerative diseases of the brain.",
        "But that's such a hot button political issue?",

        "But what we're saying is that the epidemiology has led to some, I think, some awareness, recognition, that there's something in this plant that when it gets in the human body, has some very positive, sort of controlling influences over the runaway inflammation that we've been talking about.",
        "We can see that inflammation is a double-edged sword.",
        "It is good for us.",
        "It is bad for us.",
        "Sometimes, there is bystander injury.",
        "And you know, cells of the body will suffer due to the presence of these inflammatory proteins and genes such as RAGE and the things that it controls.",
        "So what we've seen - because so many people over the past few thousand years have been using this plant, you know, recreationally and obviously illegally - they've indicated something to us that we can see now is beneficial.",
        "So hopefully, we can isolate, you know, the beneficial aspects of this plant and take advantage of it.",
        "We've done this in the past.",
        "The pharmaceutical industry has shown themselves to be very creative at finding ways to extract things out of plants and to use them effectively as treatment for diseases.",

        "Well, this is the future of it as well.",
        "So Ira, they're actually - it cuts two ways, with marijuana and also our body's own endogenous kind of marijuana, we call them endocannabinoids.",
        "It turns out that there are two kinds of receptors that are molecules on the surface of cells that engage these molecules, the cannabinoids, the marijuana-like molecules - and cause changes in the biology of the cells.",
        "One of them, the first kind, actually causes the munchies, and it is the target of a drug, which will probably be approved in the U.S.",
        "shortly, which is quite effective in controlling weight because it sort of combats your endogenous munchies.",
        "The other receptor, the second kind of receptor, is one that regulates the immune and inflammatory system.",
        "And in experimental preparations, where we can make mice atherosclerotic, if you stimulate the second kind of receptor, you can actually attenuate the atherosclerotic lesion.",
        "So I would underscore what Gary's saying, is that with creative chemistry, we may be able to block one of these receptors that seems to be a bad guy and causes us to gain weight and stimulate the other in a modulated way, which may ratchet down the immune and inflammatory response and really have a very nice menu of biological consequences.",

        "Dr. Libby?",
        "Well, Gary can answer about the central nervous system, but certainly we have a very large body of clinical trial evidence that consumption of fish and that fish oil supplementation can benefit cardiovascular outcomes.",
        "And we think we have some insight into how that's working at this cellular and molecular level.",
        "The fatty acids do get incorporated by the cell, and the fatty acids that are found - the fatty substances that are found in fish and in fish oil - have some particular anti-inflammatory effects because they may engage some receptors inside the cells - we call them nuclear receptors - that again can have beneficial effects in terms of increasing the synthesis of good cholesterol and decreasing the synthesis of bad cholesterol.",
        "And in addition, we may have some effects that stabilize the heart rhythm that protect us against sudden death if we have predisposition to it because it's a sick heart.",
        "So there's both good clinical observations and epidemiologic observations, as well as basic science - which is getting more solid by the year - that gives us a very important link between dietary variables, such as fish and fish oils, and improvement in outcomes.",
        "That's why lifestyle is so important in combating the development of these chronic diseases associated with aging.",
        "But what about the antioxidants, and the antioxidant supplements like Vitamin E, Vitamin C.",
        "The really - research has shown there really is no beneficial effect of taking these supplements on heart disease, is there?",
        "No.",
        "For the cardiovascular end points that have been studied, Vitamin E, Vitamin C, alpha-tocopherol, have really crashed and burned as useful therapeutics.",
