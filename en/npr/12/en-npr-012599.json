        "And how's it work?",
        "Kale, possibly cauliflower or romanesco.",
        "So there are targeted agents that we think may be better, and that's being tested in clinical trials.",
        "And even in the coming year, we'll have some of those trials that will be becoming available and will give us more information about this possibility of antioxidants - not vitamin antioxidants, but different kinds of antioxidants - as therapeutics in the cardiovascular area.",

        "Schmidt, I know that one of your colleagues is working on the link between obesity and inflammation.",
        "Can you fill us in on why fat causes inflammation?",
        "Yes.",
        "These are very exciting studies from Tony Ferrante and Rudy Leibel at Columbia, in which they hypothesized that in the setting of adipose tissue increases - this is the fat tissue - that part of the mechanism involved in the development towards insulin resistance or hyperglycemia, might be related to inflammation.",
        "And what they showed for the first time was that in the adipose tissue, the fat tissue of mice that were fed very high-fat diets, that there was an increased accumulation of macrophages, which are very critical inflammatory cells in the body.",
        "And these macrophages were shown to be producing a number of different inflammatory mediators.",
        "And indeed their work focused on the idea that this inflammatory mechanism might contribute and be along the parallel lines of development of insulin resistance and ultimate hyperglycemia.",
        "So indeed, our laboratory, in fact, is collaborating with Dr. Ferrante in that very context as well, because it may be a vicious cycle of events in which inflammation may lead to insulin resistance, and then once individuals develop insulin resistance and perhaps (unintelligible) diabetes, this in turn sets up additional inflammatory mechanisms, as I mentioned before - in the large and small blood vessels - which then contribute to complications.",
        "So inflammation is becoming a hypothesized important, critical link to not only the pathogenesis of complications in diabetes but, perhaps, be very importantly involved in the development of Type 2 diabetes itself.",
        "And Dr. Ferrante and colleagues - Dr. Leibel, Ferrante and colleagues - showed this very clearly in animal models, in which they showed the critical importance of inflammation in the setting of high-fat diet fed to the animals, to the mouse model.",
        "Are there any symptoms in your body that inflammation is overrunning?",
        "Like, I'm going to give out one, for example.",
        "Let's say your gums are inflamed.",
        "Does that say to you that the rest of your body is inflamed, and maybe your other organs or your arteries, Dr. Libby, might be inflamed also?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, what the - in chronic infections in various places - it could be the gums, it could be bronchitis, it could be prostatitis, it could be a bladder infection - those are all fairly localized but could have systemic effects."

        "I think that one of the kinds of inflammation that we're measuring with the C-reactive protein that isn't read out by the usual risk factors are these inflammatory conditions in other tissues than the blood vessel.",
        "What we do know, at least experimentally, is that when we have systemic inflammation, that it can first of all change the blood in a way which makes it more likely that we're going to have a blood clot, because it ratchets up some of the pro-coagulant chemicals in our blood and inhibits some of the anti-coagulant and clot-busting molecules that we have.",
        "And in addition, within the atherosclerotic plaque itself, we think that when we have systemic inflammation, that it can augment the inflammation within the plaque.",
        "So there's sort of an echo of systemic inflammation within the artery wall, and we think that that really is one of the ways that we can link some of these remote infections in peripheral tissues such as the gums and the cardiovascular events.",
        "Now in terms of symptoms, it's been known since the ancients, the first century A.D., there was a physician named Celsus, and in his book \"\"De Re Medica\"\" told us that heat, swelling, and redness, and pain are the cardinal signs of inflammation, and we teach that to our medical schools today.",
        "But those are more the obvious kind of acute inflammation, and as Gary said earlier, these chronic diseases that are associated with aging are a smoldering kind of tug-of-war inflammation that goes on for many decades, often.",
        "Talking about inflammation this hour on TALK OF THE NATION Science Friday from NPR News.",

        "And a second one, when you talked about an unhappy overreaction, after years of nano-debris occurring in your arteries - when your body finally recognizes this, its response makes it far worse.",
        "It takes a little bit of debris in the system and fills it with clots, and suddenly you have a heart attack.",
        "Thank you.",
        "You're welcome.",

        "Any connection there, anybody know of?",
        "Anybody see any connection?",
        "No. Okay, and the debris.",
        "Might this inflammation be from years of just debris floating around your arteries?",
        "Well, I think the listener has really got it right, and that is that the hardening of the arteries, or arthrosclerosis, sort of smolders on for decades and can be totally asymptomatic, without producing any symptoms whatsoever.",
        "Yet one day, it seems like a lightning bolt, someone will get a heart attack.",
        "But in fact, that's only the end process of what's been smoldering under the hood of the plaque for decades."

        "And we think we have a very good understanding of why that happens.",
        "And it turns out that inflammation is critical in changes in the biology of the plaque that make it likely to pop open like a boil that bursts and cause a heart attack.",
        "You can imagine if a boil bursts inside your artery, that it could cause a blood clot, and that's indeed what we think happens, and inflammation is critical to that transition from…",
        "But could it be a chronic inflammation from a disease, or exercise, or something that suddenly turns that on?",
        "Thank you.",
        "The inflammation has probably been going on for a long time, but it manifests itself suddenly, seemingly suddenly, because the - just like a boil will be there for days and not burst - when we have inflammation that is peaking, it can burst, and when the plaque bursts, then it can cause a blood clot that we see as a heart attack.",
