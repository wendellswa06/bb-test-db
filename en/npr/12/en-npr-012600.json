        "Is there any reason for liberals to feel optimistic after a year of political disasters?",
        "Is there even a shred of silver lining to be found in the tatters of Brexit, Donald Trump's election and European disunity?",
        "Well, those are two questions posed by Ian Buruma in a recent article.",
        "Mr. Buruma is a human rights and journalism professor at Bard College who has written extensively about European history.",

        "She's covered Africa for over 10 years.",
        "When I spoke with her from the shores of the Mediterranean, Pineau was still shocked her documentary was screened in front of the international audiences.",
        "That's why I'm so amazed to be here, because it really isn't about documentaries, particularly serious documentaries like this.",
        "Perhaps Michael Moore gets in, but not many people that do a film like mine.",

        "How did you get this idea?",

        "We are taught in America, I think, from the time we are young, that Africa receives and we give.",

        "People think that you have to have good governance.",
        "What I really wanted to show was, yes, good governance makes it easy, but even in the worst of situations there is a human drive to build a better future for your children.",
        "And that's exactly what Alieu did.",
        "He came into Congo as the rebels were coming into the airport of Kinshasa.",
        "He had his manager design a cell tower.",
        "The locals got together and collected scrap metal, soldered it all together, and he built a tower.",

        "And yet at the same time Africa attracts the least amount of foreign direct investment.",
        "So you have to ask why.",
        "And a lot of people say that's because of the risk factor.",
        "And what I think is that it's not the risk factor.",
        "We're not even there to discussing the risk factor.",
        "Right now, when you mention investment in Africa, the door is just shut.",
        "People just don't see Africa as a place to do business.",
        "I think that as we can start getting some of these images out there, you know, an Africa that is not just refugee camps and animal parks but an Africa that's a lot more complex, as it really is on the ground, that investors will start seeing Africa in that way.",
        "Final question.",
        "How did you gather the funding for your film?",
        "I ended up going to the World Bank and to the vice president, then, of the Africa region, and saying to him, `No one is funding this, but we need to get these images out there.",
        "And this falls on the World Bank to do.",
        "And he agreed.",
        "And the unfortunate thing about films like this is that nobody in the media is funding anything like this.",
        "If there is any coverage of Africa, it's of the wars and disasters, which is very important to cover, but to exclusively cover that really just feeds into the stereotype that all of Africa is just coast-to-coast war and disaster.",

        "We're not sure why The Stranger was on the president's summer reading list, but we do know it's still read by a lot of high school students, more than 60 years after its publication."

        "They display what we call reversed sexual role, where the male is a quite a small, dowdy little bird; the female's much bigger, much brighter, much bolder, and more aggressive.",
        "When they pair up for a short time during the breeding season and the female lays her four eggs, she leaves the male to do all the incubating and all the care of the chicks while she goes off to look for another mate.",
