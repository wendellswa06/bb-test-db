        "David Bowie was the most influential pop musician on the planet during the late 1970s.",
        "He was someone who, to quote a friend, did for artistic pretensions what Jimi Hendrix did for electric guitar.",
        "During the 70s alone Bowie morphed from British folkie to the androgynous space creature Ziggy Stardust to The Thin White Duke and helped invent Goth, punk, and techno.",
        "(Soundbite of song \"\"China Girl\"\")",
        "(Singing) Now I'm a mess without my little China girl.",
        "Bowie's gift for high impact pop statements, not to mention hit singles, is one reason his music has been gathered into numerous CD anthologies over the years.",
        "This one, the newly released David Bowie: the Platinum Collection, is one of the best.",

        "Here you'll find a generous helping of songs that still light up Classic Rock radio, including Changes, Rebel Rebel, Suffragette City, and this song: Life on Mars, one of the first times Bowie turned swishy theatrics into anthemic pop.",

        "Oh man, look at those comemen go.",
        "It's the freakiest show...",
        "The second disc covering 1974 to 1979, focuses on Bowie's run as The Thin White Duke, the effete genius who turned out some of the most innovative music of his era with help from electro pop guru Brian Eno.",
        "(Soundbite of song \"\"TVC-15\"\")",
        "In addition to chic up-tempo stuff like TVC 15 you get dense unsettling stuff like Boys Keep Swinging, a relative obscurity from 1979 in which The Duke sets pansexual lust against an overstuffed but rollicking groove."

        "Making it a strong bet for its potential devotees in search of broad glimpse into Bowie's shape shifting world.",
        "I'll leave you with Underground, a little-known cut from the soundtrack to the 1987 film Labyrinth and a reminder that despite his 80s decline, Bowie's gift for gaudy flights of fancy still surfaces from time to time.",
