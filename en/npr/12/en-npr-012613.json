        "troops surged into southern Afghanistan last summer, pushing into Taliban territory and setting off fierce fighting.",
        "The region is called the Arghandab River Valley, and there American soldiers have faced Taliban snipers as well as landmines and booby-traps.",
        "The fighting has claimed hundreds of American and Afghan lives.",
        "Civilians fled the area and some villages were so completely wired with bombs that the U.S.",
        "military razed them to the ground.",
        "We've heard reports about this from the military and from journalists traveling with the military, but today we have a report from NPR's Quil Lawrence, who visited the area without an American military escort.",
        "This summer, U.S.",
        "troops in Arghandab had to unlearn one of their most basic instincts.",
        "When they took fire, they had to remember not to hit the dirt for cover.",
        "Arghandab was so full of homemade land mines - what the military calls IEDs - that lying down on the ground was more dangerous than standing up amid the bullets.",
        "But Arghandab went quiet a couple of months ago, either because the U.S.",
        "troop surge finally drove the Taliban out or because the Taliban left, as the dense foliage they used as cover fell away for the winter.",
        "Some of the ideas that come up in these conversations about why some people thrive more than the rest of us are all about hard work, social skills, brains, luck.",
        "Do any of these resonate more than the others to you?",
        "Well, I think the very simple definition of self-esteem is that it's a belief or judgment about the worth or value of the self.",
        "So just an overall sense that `I'm a person of worth, I'm a person with value.'",
        "How does it relate to the, I guess, older-fashioned concept of character?",
        "Oh, well, character is usually considered to be virtues like perseverance or morality...",
        "Mm-hmm."

        "...and self-esteem might be based on those things or it might be quite independent of those.",
        "So it's not clear that people with high self-esteem necessarily have character in that old-fashioned sense.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And similarly, is it clear that people who have discipline, perseverance, good moral values have high self-esteem?",
        "Not necessarily, no. They're really pretty independent constructs.",
        "OK.",
        "So...",
        "There's been a lot of disagreement about self-esteem over the years.",
        "Can you briefly recount a decade or so of debates?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Self-esteem research really burgeoned in the 1960s when standard ways of measuring self-esteem were developed.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And very quickly, psychologists began to ask: `What are the benefits of self-esteem?",
        "What's it associated with?",
        "And we know for sure it's related to having more positive emotions; people with high self-esteem are more happier, they're more satisfied with their lives.",
        "But psychologists began to think that self-esteem might have benefits that go far beyond that, that kids with high self-esteem might do better in school, be less likely to abuse drugs and alcohol, be less likely to get pregnant as teen-agers and so on.",
        "So interest quickly shifted to this idea that self-esteem might actually--high self-esteem might actually prevent people from having all these problems later in life."

        "And did that prove to be the case?",
        "Well, it has turned out not to be the case.",
        "So the idea that high self-esteem actually causes people to be more successful in their life or that low self-esteem is the cause of problems like drug abuse, teen-age pregnancy and poor school achievement, the evidence is just very, very thin for that kind of argument.",
        "The associations are very weak and we don't know for sure whether high self-esteem cause a little bit of improvement in school achievement or better school achievement actually causes high self-esteem.",
        "So let me just go back on that just a little bit.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, if you have high self-esteem, you're happier, but you could be satisfied with just average grades.",
        "That's right.",
        "So high self-esteem people sometimes maintain their high self-esteem by blaming other people, by saying, `I just don't care whether I succeed in that area.",
        "So there are a lot of things people can do to maintain and sustain a sense of their own self-worth that aren't necessarily going to promote success.",
        "And similarly on the other side, high-achievers can be driven to some degree by maybe low self-esteem.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "So many people who work extremely hard and are simply trying to prove something about themselves because they harbor doubts about their own worth.",
        "Is self-esteem something that we are born with, or something that is nurtured?",
        "It's probably some of both.",
        "There's some evidence of a genetic basis of self-esteem, although it might be more of a genetic tendency to experience positive emotions more generally.",
        "So that's clearly part of the story."

        "For example, kids with secure attachment styles who believe that their caregivers will be there for them reliably tend to have high self-esteem.",
        "So there are those early effects on self-esteem and then there are experiences throughout life that can shape people's self-esteem.",
        "So losing a job can hurt your self-esteem.",

        "I think that's right.",
        "In a way, both of those are the flip side of the same coin.",
        "So when you praise kids for not really accomplishing anything, or you're afraid to give them failure feedback, you're communicating the message that failure's unacceptable.",
        "So in a way, that's just as bad as never praising them, saying `You're never good enough.'",
