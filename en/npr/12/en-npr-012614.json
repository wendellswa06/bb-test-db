        "Well, I think, you know, life is complex and I see self-esteem as really reflecting that complexity.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I think there's also a physical part to it, which a lot of people don't like to talk about, which has to do with physical appearance, possessions, kind of the materialistic part of self-esteem.",
        "And then I think there's another thing that you've mentioned and that's character and your ability to follow the rules, to be courageous, to confront anxiety, to persevere and to be concerned for other people.",
        "So I think what you find is that we all have what you might call a self-esteem profile.",
        "Some people are good in all four areas, some are good in a couple and not so hot in a couple, as the caller was.",
        "I think she said, `Socially, I felt like I had a hole in my self-esteem, but academically I tried to make up for that and it didn't totally work.'",
        "Hmm.",
        "Well, sometimes those things can get in the way of each other.",
        "But I wonder, Jennifer Crocker, do you think self-esteem can be worked on and improved as many advice books will say?",
        "I think people can improve their self-esteem, but ironically, I think it happens most when you don't work on your self-esteem directly but try to--well, let me back up and say I think that people often think that if they could raise their self-esteem, it would solve their problems, that there are things they can't do or are afraid to do because they lack self-esteem.",
        "And if only they had self-esteem, then they would be able to do what it is they really want to do with their lives.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And instead of that, I think it's much more likely to be the case that if people are really acting on their goals, they will ultimately derive a sense of self-worth from that.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Jennifer Crocker, thanks very much for being with us today.",

        "Well, high self-esteem--you've got to keep in mind, you want high",
        "self-esteem to be realistic high self-esteem.",
        "There are a lot of people otherwise known as sociopaths who have very high self-esteem, but their personalities are quite abrasive, they're overly aggressive and on.",
        "So if we want high, realistic, positive self-esteem, I think that is a byproduct of a life well lived.",
        "And so if you're a parent or if you're an adult, I think--and you want to have high self-esteem, as Jennifer was saying, I really think it's true: You don't focus on self-esteem so much; you focus on living your life well, doing good in school, getting along with people, you know, following the rules and so on.",
        "Low self-esteem is an interesting thing.",
        "There used to be a syndrome a number of years ago called the imposter phenomenon, and that described a person who was doing very well in life but they always evaluated themselves negatively.",
        "And it's kind of like Avis, `We're number two, we try harder.",
        "A lot of people's low self-esteem actually benefit from that because they are more successful, they get along better with other people.",
        "Internally, they suffer a lot, but for the rest of the world, they're often a boon to humanity.",
        "I always tell employers if you're going to hire somebody, don't hire somebody with too high self-esteem; you might consider hiring somebody with too low self-esteem."
