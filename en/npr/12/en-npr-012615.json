        "Yeah.",
        "Hey, Neal.",
        "Hey.",
        "I had a question.",
        "Just to what extent do physical characteristics such as beauty have on self-esteem?",
        "And I guess I can take my questions or comments off the air.",
        "Thanks for the call.",
        "Thomas Phelan, you were talking about that a couple of minutes ago.",
        "I knew somebody would ask this question.",
        "This is one of the touchy one about self-esteem, the thing about the materialistic or the appearance.",
        "It does have an effect on self-esteem, there's no doubt about it.",
        "It's one of those four parts that I was talking about before.",
        "You will find a lot of people, you know, if they are--just happen to be good-looking, this is one of the things where luck will affect your self-esteem.",
        "But you want to keep in mind it's only one out of the four, and it's funny because a lot of people--they may be good-looking, but they don't do well in school and they don't have any friends and their character stinks.",
        "Their self-esteem is still going to have a lot of problems with it.",
        "You also have people who are quite physically attractive but they have a little bit of this imposter thing we were just talking about.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I think a lot of it is luck.",
        "And, you know, everybody else thinks they're really good-looking, but they think that their ears are just a little bit too big, their nose sticks out a little too much and they can't appreciate what they have."

        "Hi.",
        "Thank you for taking my call.",
        "Sure.",
        "I had a comment about growing up gay and how that affected your self-esteem knowing that you were different and how society has, you know, really chastised children and there's a high suicide rate for homosexual kids and just how it's affected their self-esteem growing up and you really don't catch up with that until later in life.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Thomas Phelan.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Growing up gay--I mean, you think about it, a lot of people kind of go through their sexual awakening when they're getting into the adolescent years.",
        "And teen-agers want to be normal, which means like everybody else.",
        "Well, imagine that all of a sudden you realize, as you're sexually awakening, that you're attracted to the same sex.",
        "Well, that's not normal and it's a real shock to a lot of people, and society still has a lot of mixed feelings about it.",
        "There is--as the caller said, there's a lot more depression, anxiety, suicide risk is harder in people that are gay.",
        "And a lot of people--you know, they argue about what's the percentage of the population that experiences that and it might be quite significant.",
        "Some people say if you include, you know, heterosexual and bisexual, it may be over 10 percent.",
        "That's a lot of people."

        "I think most people--yeah, if you ask people, you know, `What's the most different thing about you?",
        "I think everybody will have something to say.",
        "And that brings up another interesting point is: Doesn't everybody really feel, deep in their heart, that they have some significant hole in their self-esteem?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And I think they do.",
        "I--you know, and the reason I say that is because from the outside, you look at everybody else, they look kind of confident like they're, you know, moseying through life and they're not having too much trouble.",
        "Well, you don't know what's going on inside them.",
        "And the more--I think maybe being a psychotherapist had something to do with this, although people don't come to tell you how happy they are, but I think as you get to know people, even your friends, you find out that everybody has gone through some significant self-esteem trial, I think.",

        "And it was one thing we never allowed was once you started into something, you completed it, and that taught them perseverance, which increased their character and also increased their self-worth is the way we looked at it.",
        "And both of them are very well-adjusted children."

        "How long have self-esteem programs been used in schools?",
        "They really started in about the 1960s, when teachers began to get wind that they were concerned about numbers of kids coming in who they perceived to have low self-esteem, not taking a risk or feeling as they were such a failure they weren't willing to try.",
        "And what they were looking for was an approach to help them develop--what they really wanted was an internally motivated kid.",
        "Someplace, though, along the way, Neal, I think we got lost into it by giving it too much of a `pump me up' approach or the vacuum--you know, the sticker, star approach.",
        "When--there's now been a backlash and teachers realize number one is it needs to be earned and deserved.",
        "I think we're right on board on that one.",
        "Number two, that--we really need to make sure that we create most of all, Neal, the conditions in a school or in a home that will nurture self-esteem.",
        "And we know that that is now something we can do.",
        "You can't teach self-esteem, but you can create the conditions, and you can also teach specific skills so kids can do this wonderful thing called bounce back when they do fail, which is going to be part of life.",
        "I'm wondering if--well, here's an e-mail that we got; this from John Santini(ph), I think is his name: `As a teacher, I got an incoming student from an Arizona private school, and his grading system was A, B, C, D and NY: not yet.",
