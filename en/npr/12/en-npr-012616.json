        "You know, one of the things I think we have to realize is we're not dealing with kids with low self-esteem here, thinking that--they're also very smart.",
        "So it doesn't make any difference if you use a green pen or a purple pen or an NY or an F; kids still get it and can interpret it one way or the other.",

        "And most of them came to class in the junior and the senior level, and probably read at the fifth-grade level, or I figured out they had finally learned they didn't have to work for a grade.",
        "I stuck with them for the whole year.",
        "The first two grading periods were pretty disastrous.",
        "After that, it began to improve, and you could see the self-esteem appear in their eyes.",
        "Their pride was worth looking at.",
        "I had very, very, very few failures, but we finally got the word from what we call the ivory tower there were too many old, white and--get this--men teachers who wouldn't change.",

        "Oh...",
        "I--well, I love what Bob just said, because I think that's the most wonderful way to create self-esteem, is earned, deserved.",
        "And one of the things I think we did a little while back--you know, maybe, mm, about 20 years ago--is we thought that watering down our expectations would do justice to our children, and it certainly did not.",
        "I always tell a parent, though, you think of it like a rubber band.",
        "Your goal is to stretch your child and keep stretching them to be the best they can be, but your goal is to stretch them gently along the way, without snapping it, which means your expectations are always met with what were you currently--you know, what were you previously able to do--like Bob just mentioned, they started at the fifth-grade level--but you keep stretching and knowing that's where you start, and keep working your way up until you finally said, `I did it on my own.",
        "That's the true point of the whole thing in self-esteem.",

        "I had a son who was in special ed during the '70s and also went to a private learning center to help him along, and it seemed the focus was on--everything was `We have to build his self-esteem.",
        "We have to build up his self-esteem.",
        "So every little thing that he did was just bowled over with encouragement and it was the greatest thing in the world, and it seemed like it built a false sense of esteem in him, and he has gotten to the point where he can't take any kind of criticism, and anybody who praises--excuse me--him, tell--you know, acts kindly and friendly towards him, he gets drawn right into a lot of false relationships with people.",
        "And it seemed like it really stunted his social development, you know, rather than helping it.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Is it--is this specifically worse for kids with developmental problems, Michele?",
        "If the Americans rebuild this village and help us stand on our own feet, and keep the Taliban out, then they will be our good friends, he says.",

        "You realize it's not easy for you.",
        "And I think the story he just mentioned is so right on.",
        "If we can think of self-esteem as a balance--and here's, I think, where the misconception went.",
        "It's--for so long, we looked at self-esteem as just a one-sided approach of making the child feel good and make him feel worthy.",
        "We now know that true self-esteem is an actual balance between two sides, one of which is helping a child feel that they're a worthy, valuable, significant human being, which is the approach that parents--the teacher was doing for the child there, but they forgot that there's another side to it, and that's also helping a child to feel confident to cope with life.",
        "That's the academic side.",
        "That's also the ability to help handle failure, to be able to bounce back, to get that resilience notion.",
        "So if you think of a plane landing at night and there are two lights on both sides of that runway, and you're balancing those two elements, therefore, you're doing a darn good job in terms of your parenting because you're running in right there smooth in your landing.",
        "And that's the best approach we have to helping the child become adjusted in the real world without us, which is the only job--barometer that you're doing a good job of parenting: Your kid can survive without you, without pumping them up, making them feel good.",
        "They need to be able to thrive without us.",
        "And we're seeing something that's kind of an interesting trend.",
        "Freshman year in college--fascinating new book came out that was actually published by Harvard, saying that they'd never seen no many kids who cannot cope with life but are also some of the smartest kids they've ever seen.",
        "Dave, thanks very much for the call.",
        "I just--one quick comment.",
        "It's...",
