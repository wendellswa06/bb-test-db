        "We seek His wisdom in decisions, little financial things that might seem silly to others, we'll pray about, whether or not we're going to - for example, we bought new bookcases for the front room and we prayed about that decision, going, OK, this is going to be a different expense than usually is in our budget and let's take some time to pray about this and seek God's wisdom."
