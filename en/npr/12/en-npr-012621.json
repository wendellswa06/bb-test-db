        "I think most of us who have no idea what's involved here.",
        "And that whole area of kind of a harsh interrogation, as the Bush administration might just put it, is something that's very, very obscure to most Americans.",
        "And I think their work is trying to bring some form to this.",
        "Now, Michael, I'm going to stick with you for a second.",
        "This is something that is affecting people across the country.",
        "We're talking about mortgages.",
        "And the FBI recently announced that investigation into 14 companies involved in the subprime loan business.",
        "And insider trading and accounting fraud are two of the big issues they're looking for.",
        "So these mortgages are bought and sold between companies.",
        "How hard is it going to be to pin culpability on any one organization?",
        "Well, it's going to be - I'll be interested to see how this investigation, kind of, progresses because not only are mortgage bought and sold now, they're now - they're repackaged into securities that are sold across the globe.",
        "So the trail of money, you know, literally circles the Earth.",
        "So - and a lot of this business is unregulated and that's been part of the big problem with what we've seen with the credit crunch and mortgage crisis that the country is facing now.",
        "Essentially, people don't know who's holding the bag, who's going to end up losing money.",
        "And the result has been that many lenders have pulled back.",
        "So, you know, it's not sort of fraud probably in the sense that when you think of people lying on a mortgage application, even though there seems to be plenty of that to go around as well.",
        "But, it'll be interesting to see - my guess is that you won't see a lot of indictments in the end, at least on the secondary part of this.",
        "You might see the front end where you have a lot of instances where you have homeowners who are now, kind of, underwater of their home saying that mortgage brokers encouraged them to lie about their income, overstate their income, they didn't seek to document their income, that sort of thing.",
        "I think those cases will be easier to prove.",
        "But it'll be - I'll be interested to see what happens with sort of a broader kind of securities piece of this.",
        "Adaora, you are in this position of getting ready to start something, start your show and you're going to be based in New York City.",
        "New York City, in some ways, has been insulated because there's so many people who want to buy there.",

        "But more importantly, I think, we'd like to really take a look at how this is affecting people.",
        "We all see the charts.",
        "We see the numbers.",
        "But what does this really mean?",
        "We've even seen some pictures of neighborhoods where every other house is for sale.",

        "And so how does that change their life?",
        "How does that change the decisions that they're making about their lives for their families?",
        "So, I think that we're going to take a look at this from just about every single angle.",
        "Marcus, when it comes down to investigating things like these, a lot of times you have people coming from different agencies.",
        "So we're talking about the FBI, but also securities and exchange.",
        "And then individual state attorney generals are going to get in on the action.",
        "Is that going to help or is that going to muddy the issue?"

        "And if you admitted to your crimes - that was the whole point, you would not go to jail.",

        "I think those who are suffering, who are underwater now, who were the victims of fraudulent mortgage lenders in particular, obviously investors who were then sold these bad mortgages that were secure ties, and to debt that could be traded, and was showed - literally that debt was sold all across the world.",
        "You feel that somehow this has a corrosive effect on society.",
        "I just read a story not long ago in the paper about a little village in Norway that finds itself broke because it invested in subprime, when they thought it was actually grade A, triple A quality debt, and it wasn't.",
        "So I think the damage is done.",
        "I think the most we can do now is hope these investigations will bring to light what happened, where we went wrong.",
        "Because the next time we have -once again, you know, the Fed right now is trying to loosen credit, so that people will keep extending credit and taking out credit.",
        "The next time we have too much credit - right now, we have too little and the pendulum always swings back and forth.",
        "We're going to need to know what do we need to look out for to make sure people don't abuse the loose credit that's going to come again one day.",
        "That's a long way from now, but we need to find out how these things happened.",
        "Marcus, you used the term underwater, so did Michael.",
        "Just real quick, there is this lawsuit a federal judge threw out involving the Army Corps of Engineers in the levee break during Hurricane Katrina.",
        "There were half a million claims by businesses, government entities and residents and the judge said that although the Corps failed to protect the city, the law does not hold them accountable.",
        "Is this a blow - yet another blow to the people who've been battered by Katrina and do you think this will affect the future of the city?",
        "I think it is a blow.",
        "I think if you talk about, again, you know, justice, which is never repaid, I think the tragedy of New Orleans and of Katrina is exactly that, it's justice that will never be - there will never be justice for the crimes that were committed there largely as this case alleged by our own government and its own incompetence.",
        "Unfortunately, there will not be retribution.",
        "And unfortunately, once again, those folks are abandoned.",
        "I think as a matter of law - and I didn't go to law school like Adaora - but as a matter of law, I think, you know, this relies on the Flood Control Act of 1928, which actually indemnified the government, said the government would not be liable for any failures and levees and systems that it set up.",
        "So I think as a matter of law, it seems pretty clear cut.",
        "But again, as a matter of justice, that's another issue.",
        "Adaora, since you do have a law background, is this something - what's the plan B?",
        "Is anyone going to be able to sue someone else, some other government entity on some other grounds?",
        "Well, I think Marcus said it exactly right.",
        "There's really two tracks here.",
        "The law, it does appear to be very clear.",
        "That's not unusual that government entities and agencies are immune, you know, immune from illegal action of this kind.",
        "I guess I was actually there at New Orleans during Katrina and sort of saw very firsthand the absolute incompetence that built those levees and the Army Corps of Engineers.",
        "And there's no question - and the judge noted that in his decision.",
        "But the question is, what comes next now in terms of suing other people?",
        "As we all know, there's lots of litigation going on with insurance companies, and that will continue for sometime.",
