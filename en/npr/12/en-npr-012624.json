        "You're already - you already have a civil suit that's going to happen that's - I mean, it's pretty all-encompassing.",

        "Right.",
        "So we already have this in the works.",
        "I feel like unless there's just overwhelming evidence that there was, you know, willful, criminal - somebody - you know, let's say the guy, let's say you could narrow it down to one guy responsible, and if the one guy responsible was drunk at the time, OK, criminal negligence.",
        "But other than that, you know, I don't think an accident, what by all measure that we can tell is an accident, should be prosecuted as a criminal charge.",
        "That doesn't make sense to me.",
        "David Uhlmann?",
        "Well, it's a great point that the caller's making.",

        "So that doesn't mean you have to know that you're breaking the law, but you have to at least act intentionally.",
        "Right.",
        "But here's what the law says.",
        "The law says that that intentional act is a felony violation of the Clean Water Act.",
        "But the law then also says that if the same discharge occurs with negligence, it's a misdemeanor violation of the Clean Water Act."

        "Twenty-three.",
        "And particularly in the environmental crimes arena, that really opens up a whole host of questions - unlike, say, bank robbery, where if you're in a bank with a gun and a note, that's a crime; everyone knows it's a crime; and there's only one thing that's going to happen there as a prosecution.",
        "Is this the worst of the worst?",
        "It is the worst - the BP case, and again, I know you can't talk about that, but can you understand the outrage of the public in, for example, an Exxon Valdez situation, saying: This terrible thing happened.",
        "Somebody has to be held responsible.",
        "If we don't hold corporations criminally responsible, you're not going to make them behave better in the future.",
        "All those things, I think, add into a prosecutor's and an agent's view of a case as it develops, to push it either in the direction of a crime - a criminal prosecution - or to say well, no, this ought to really remain in the civil context."

        "And how much does public outrage play a part in decisions as to whether to file civil or criminal charges?",

        "Well, getting back to the Exxon Valdez case, David Uhlmann, I think that was, in the end - what, $125 million?",

        "So compensation to the government for harm to the environment.",

        "And I wanted to ask you, Warren Hamel: The idea that if you make something, you ought to be able to fix it if it suffers disasters - is that part of the theory of negligence?",
        "Well, it's certainly part of the theory, and I think therein lies the real danger of it.",
        "And I think one of the things that's important to this conversation is to step away, for a moment, from the Exxon Valdezes and the current matter with BP, and think about what are the vastly larger and more numerous instances of environmental violations that could, if pushed, be made into an environmental negligence criminal case but frankly, are just screw-ups.",
        "And so there's an aspect of the program - you know, using the U.S.",

        "And we've talked a lot about the legal regime that most often determines how the government responds to pollution, other kinds of violations.",
        "Do those laws, do you think, go far enough?",
        "And I don't understand why that context doesn't mean that for criminal penalty purposes, they should not also be treated as individuals so that when they commit a grave crime - which happens frequently - that they get their corporate charter removed for eight years, the same way that somebody who went to prison would lose their freedom for eight years.",
        "That would effectively put them out of business.",

        "I mean, if you were a doctor, you would have a hard time getting back into your practice.",
        "But if you want a criminal sanction that has some deterrence, and if you're going to treat corporations as individuals with individual rights, they should have individual responsibilities, too.",

        "I wanted to ask Warren Hamel to come in here.",
        "There's a point that a lot of people make - that sometimes, when corporations commit violations - and perhaps not rising to the criminal level, but violations and regular violations - they look at the cost-benefit analysis and say: You know, it's easier to pay $5,000 every time we do this thing rather than fix the cause.",
        "And they just budget that and so therefore - say, you know, there's no point, that the fining system is just simply not penalty enough.",
        "And if that doesn't work, or perhaps if the violations are so egregious, then maybe they go directly to a criminal prosecution.",
        "I think that is a very common way of looking at, you know, sort of the system if it's not functioning properly in that first instance."
