        "And the crispest example that you can think of is BP, where they have a series of repeat, major violations - one after the other after the other - and they don't ever get enough of a sanction so there's a real deterrent.",

        "They just have to.",

        "And in certain cases, the defense would, obviously, vigorously oppose that evidence coming in.",
        "But stepping back from the court case itself, the point is: To what extent does that play into the decision of a prosecutor to bring criminal charges or not?",

        "Yes.",
        "And, you know, the fact is - I mean, here's the problem.",
