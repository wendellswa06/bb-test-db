        "Thank you.",
        "It's good to be here.",
        "Also with us in the studio, Bishop Harry Jackson, currently presiding at the Hope Christian Church here in Washington, D.C.",
        "And nice to have you on the program as well.",
        "Thank you for having me.",
        "And Bishop Stith, let me turn to you first.",
        "How different is what Reverend Wright's sermons say from what you've preached throughout your ministry?",
        "Probably the language or the selection of phrases.",
        "But I hope that in my ministry, for 57 years, that I have attempted to be both a prophet and a personal deliverer of salvation.",
        "I hope both things are important.",
        "And where - give us some background on black liberation theology.",
        "How did it affect your thinking?",
        "Where does it come from?",
        "There are two ways of looking at it.",
        "The terminology came, of course, from Brazil with the Catholic Church and their movement there with most of the people.",
        "But more importantly, Riddick has his history as far back as the Old Testament.",
        "And my understanding of it goes back to the prophet's themselves who declared the liberation of the people and those who were in distress within their communities, and then evolved into Jesus, who we conceived to be the great liberator of people.",
        "And we can talk more about that later.",
        "Sure.",
        "But, so, I think it begins there.",
        "And to call it a current thing is to misunderstand its great history and roots.",
        "And for people who have undergone oppression for centuries in this country, church was a place you could gather amongst yourselves and have your own people, your own authority figure speak to you."

        "Exactly.",
        "In the midst of slavery and eventually segregation discrimination - and Jim Crowism and all the rest, there had to be an answer.",
        "And the answer came to an understanding of Moses and Jesus who were the great liberators.",
        "So would you consider what we're calling black liberation theology mainstream?",
        "To me it is, but to others it is not because it's emphasis and priorities are little different from traditional Western Christianity.",
        "In what way, do you think?",
        "In Western Christianity, there was a sanitizing of the gospel of Jesus.",
        "They eliminated some of the Beatitudes in a sense, eliminated the great commission - that I call a great commission - which was Jesus' job description that he is called to set the prisoners free and the captives and brined up the broken hearted, and to announce good news to the poor.",
        "All that was kind of cleaned up; the kingdom parables were pushed down, where they gave the kingdom to those who are poor and wretched and put the ones who are rich into Hades.",
        "Easier do for a rich man to pass through the eye of a needle.",
        "Yes, we - remember that terminology.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And many others.",
        "Reverend Jackson, let me bring you into the conversation.",
        "Again, is black liberation theology relevant to the churches today, do you think?",
        "I think it's a little bit out of step.",
        "I think that it's a voice or a message for another time.",
        "Right now, we're living in a unique moment in which we can solve the race problems.",
        "A recent book that we've read and called \"\"Personal Faith Public Policy\"\" says that there are seven urgent issues that only the church can solve in the world today.",
        "I believe that racial reconciliation is one of them.",
        "In fact, Friday, we'll be releasing a letter from about 40 pastors commemorating Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, saying that we can in this decade end the segregation of the church and begin the process of healing America based on Christian love, being the basis of our coming together."

        "You know, the Bible teaches that we, when we are born again or no longer one separate group of people or I should say - reverse that - we become a new racial group.",
        "It's us against them, not black against white, but the believing world seeking to win the non-believing world with kindness, Christ-likeness and that kind of thing.",
        "And that was what's missing in the dialog or the messages, I should say, of Jeremiah Wright.",
        "It seems that his comments can be incendiary and tantamount to pulling a scab off of a wound.",
        "And I think that that kind of rhetoric that comes out in liberation theology, sometimes, is based on this.",
        "James Cone said in the 2003 PBS special that he was at one moment ready to leave the Christian faith because he was torn between Martin Luther King Jr. on one hand and Malcolm X on the other, and that he came up with this kind of understanding of things that way.",
        "His synthesis, yeah.",
        "It has been quoted - it has recently been quoted in the press.",
        "But as NPR's Julie Rovner reports they were narrowly trumped by those arguing in favor of women's health.",
        "Republicans came out swinging against the contraceptive rule in today's Senate floor debate.",
        "Even after it was amended last month to satisfy some religious employers, said Utah's Orrin Hatch, it still goes too far.",
        "This amendment is necessary because of ObamaCare, the health care law that manifests new threats to personal liberty and individual rights with each passing week.",
        "But the proposal would not just apply to contraceptives and it would not just apply to insurance companies.",
        "It would have allowed any health insurer or employer to decline to offer any benefit that is, quote, \"\"contrary to the religious beliefs or moral convictions of the plan's sponsor.",
        "The bill's sponsor, Missouri Republican Roy Blunt, defended the scope of that language.",
        "If you are of a faith that believes that something is absolutely wrong, as an employer, why would you want to pay for that?"

        "We believe that, you know, if someone is heavy and they're obese and they get diabetes, we have a moral objection to helping them because, you know what, they didn't lead a clean life.",
        "Still, the debate never strayed too far from the issue at hand, access to contraceptives for women.",
        "Vermont Independent Bernie Sanders said sponsors of the amendment were trying to roll back the clock on women's reproductive rights.",
        "If the United States Senate had 83 women and 17 men rather than 83 men and 17 women, my strong guess is that a bill like this would never even make it to the floor.",
        "But others, like Louisiana Republican David Vitter, said the debate has been mischaracterized by the media.",
        "This isn't merely about contraception.",
        "It's about abortion.",
        "It's about abortion-inducing drugs, like Plan B.",
        "For the record, Plan B, the so-called Morning After Pill, is classified by the FDA as a contraceptive.",
        "It's not the same as the abortion pill, RU-486, but one of the ways Plan B may work is by preventing the implantation of a fertilized egg into a woman's uterus.",
        "So for those who believe that life begins at fertilization of egg and sperm, that drug could be considered to cause very early abortions and that has added to the controversy.",
        "But, still, it's a debate that Democrats like Assistant Senate Majority Leader Dick Durbin mostly welcome.",
        "The vote today should be a clear message to those who are following that if we take extreme positions from the social agenda that we hear so often in these Republican primaries and bring them to a vote, common sense and majority feeling in America will prevail.",
        "In fact, the 51-48 vote was closer than the 63 percent majority that supports the contraceptive coverage requirement.",
        "That's according to a new poll out today from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.",
        "The poll also found, however, that half of those surveyed think the whole issue is being blown up now largely because of election year politics.",
        "But now that it's on the agenda, expect both sides to continue to pursue the religious freedom and contraception issues as the campaign season wears on."

        "How do you go about developing a clone of someone else's drug?",
        "Well, we study the chemistry of the drug and start producing the drug first in the laboratory, and then scale it out.",
        "It's a three to five year cycle to reverse engineer a drug and make an identical clone.",
        "It's not so easy.",

        "And I said of course, and that we would keep our factories open night and day, because this is an emergency.",
        "The problem comes that it is still covered under patent in America till 2016, therefore you can only get the drug if you ask for a compulsory license or under emergency.",
        "So you're not actively trying to get it in the United States, but you're certainly willing if somebody makes the effort...",
        "We are willing.",
        "If we are asked, we would certainly cooperate in whatever way possible.",
        "If someone were to ask you, how quickly do you think you could get your version of Tamiflu, Antiflu, into the United States and over whatever hurdles there may be?"
