        "I just wanted to say that it's similar to another commenter who called, the black church for me as a young, you know, woman growing up in a predominantly minority educational system kind of helped to sturden(ph) my self-confidence as I was growing up.",
        "And so, I can understand the way that caller felt.",
        "And so, I think that the reason there's a need for what we say in the black church that's slightly different from, you know, what you hear in other churches is because of what he was talking about everyday when you're out in the world, you're reminded that you're a little bit different, not really, you know, because someone says that you're not included, but because when you show up because you've called, they're kind of surprised that you're a brown person, you know?",
        "So there are subtleties in every day life that kind of, you know, just kind of nab at you.",
        "But the church serve as a way of saying, you know, you're accepted here, you have - you know, let's boost your self-confidence, you're able to go out and do whatever you need to do no matter what you're faced with.",
        "And that's through the power, you know, of Christ in you."

        "Now, historical black church has been just that for people until the context of where people live changes, which is the world around us - until that changes, then there will always be a need of a church that can speak specifically to a person's need.",
