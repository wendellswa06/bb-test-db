        "Sure.",

        "He puts things like ping-pong balls and other objects directly onto the piano strings, an amazing, amazing, pianist.",
        "It's an old trick that was actually invented in the 1940s by John Cage.",
        "This record is called \"\"Silfra.\"\" And I really like it because it pairs up these two very, very different musicians - our man Hauschka, the avant-garde guy from Germany, and then American Hilary Hahn, one of the top classical violinists today who usually plays Bach and Tchaikovsky."
