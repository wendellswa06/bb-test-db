        "But he also has been composing on the side.",
        "And I think his reputation as a conductor will - is really starting to be eclipsed by his reputation as a composer, especially when you hear this music, which I think is just fantastic.",
        "It won the Grawemeyer Award last year, a very prestigious composing award.",
        "He wrote it in 2009 for the violinist who we're hearing here, Leila Josefowicz, who plays it just to perfection, I think.",
        "And it debuted in one of the last concerts he gave with the LA Phil.",
        "It's really an eclectic piece, a lot shimmering colors, shifting rhythms.",
        "And, Guy, I think it's probably the only concerto that features a duet for violin and high hat."

        "Well, there are a couple, there are two different ways to look at this.",
        "the first is, who and when applying for eligibility, for those who don't have it, I would say that you don't get the benefits until you can show that you are a citizen and you are who you say you are.",
