        "Hiromi, thank you so much for coming in.",
        "Now to hear about the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of this new law we turn to Ron Pollack, executive director and vice president of Families USA, who's with us here in Studio 3A.",
        "Thanks very much for joining us.",
        "Thanks for inviting me, Neal.",
        "And, as Ms. Pollack was just saying - excuse me, Ms. Norwalk.",
        "You're Mr. Pollack.",
        "As Ms. Norwalk was just saying, you know, the eligibility requirements haven't changed, it's just the identification.",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "If I may, Neal, one quick point.",
        "You indicated that Families USA is bringing the suit.",
        "Actually we're working with the counsel in the suit.",
        "The suit is being brought by the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, and a few other counsel.",
        "I think what needs to be understood here is that there's a real irony in this law.",
        "The irony is that the proponents of this legislation wanted to appear tough on illegal immigrants, as you suggested.",
        "But the people who are actually going to be hurt are people who are U.S.",
        "citizens.",
        "Take, for example, people in nursing homes, people who have mental disabilities or other disabilities, people who suffered from some kind of natural disaster like Hurricane Katrina.",
        "Many of these folks can't come up with the documentation and those are the precise people who are going to be hurt by this requirement.",
        "Along with the any illegal immigrants who may be registered as well.",
        "Right.",
        "But I think that virtually everybody that has looked at the Medicaid program has made clear that there aren't in any significant degree illegal immigrants in the program.",
        "Indeed, you're not even allowed to participate in Medicaid even if you're a legal immigrant if you haven't been in the country for over five years."

        "And so the people who are going to be hurt are actually U.S.",
        "citizens who are not in a position to come up with this documentation and they're the ones who're going to be kicked out of the Medicaid program and join the ranks of the uninsured.",
        "And you're not satisfied with the provisions that Leslie Norwalk was describing about, at the end of the day, the states first of all have to help you look for documentation, and at the end of the day if you can find two people who can say you're a U.S.",
        "citizen, you're okay.",
        "Well, what Leslie didn't describe is that the states are under a real compulsion here, under a short period of time, to get this done.",
        "If they don't get this done quickly, they actually are going to lose their federal funding under Medicaid.",
        "And there are some states, like California and Ohio that have complained that this is going to be very difficult to do.",
        "It's an unfunded mandate.",
        "And so I think as the states try to produce in response to this statute, very quickly, there are a lot of people who are going to fall through the cracks.",
        "And this idea that you can have affidavits - remember most people gain their citizenship through birth.",
        "Now, unless you've got people who were actually there, who know under what circumstances you were born, you can't actually provide such an affidavit.",
        "And somebody in a nursing home or somebody with a mental health problem is not likely to be able to marshal the information that is going to be required.",
        "And what, briefly, does the lawsuit hope to accomplish?",
        "Well, what the lawsuit does is it tries to stop the implementation of this statute, which is, as you said, scheduled to go into effect on July 1.",
        "If this, if the lawsuit is effective, it will wind up preventing the implementation beginning on July 1 - the lawyers are seeking a temporary restraining order, so that at least this is postponed, if not totally taken off the books.",
        "Postponed until the court can then look into the case?",
        "Ye.",
        "When you get a temporary restraining order that normally delays the implementation of something that will cause irreparable harm, and then you have a hearing on the merits.",
        "Before going to court, I wonder, did you try to address this in other ways?",
        "I mean, as this act was going through Congress, did anybody call up and say, hey, this may have unintended consequences."

        "Now these are all estimates, because nobody truly knows.",

        "And by the way, there's still an opportunity to get this changed through legislation.",
        "There is going to be legislation that will be considered by the House and Senate sometime probably this year, a so-called Technical Corrections Bill.",
        "And it is our hope that at a minimum in that Technical Corrections Bill, this requirement will exempt people who are on Medicare and people who are on SSI.",

        "Psychiatrist Jack Vaeth says having an open-ended stay not controlled by insurers means doctors have time to make difficult diagnoses.",
        "At least two kids came to Overlook with a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, but it turned out they both had a mild form of autism, requiring very different treatment.",
        "Insurers, though, say that when they pay for treatment at traditional facilities, they pay for all that is medically necessary, and they'd be interested in seeing data on whether the amenities or the level of clinical care at Overlook make a difference in how kids do.",
        "Psychiatrist Vaeth doesn't have the data, but he thinks Overlook could prove cheaper than multiple short-term stays at other hospitals and that insurers might learn from some of Overlook's approaches.",
        "If this program flourishes and does well and people say, wow, if you have $1,700 a day you will do well, psychiatrically, then why couldn't we develop a similar program but maybe scale it down to $1,000 a day?",
