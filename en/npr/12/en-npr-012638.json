        "It started very late last night.",
        "Israeli helicopters moved into the eastern part of Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, very near to Baalbek.",
        "They dropped three groups of commandos near a hospital and there was very heavy fighting in the area for several hours between the Israeli soldiers and the Hezbollah guerillas.",
        "Israel says its helicopters also provided cover for its soldiers, and ultimately ended up firing missiles and heavy machinegun fire.",
        "They targeted several suspected Hezbollah sites around the hospital in Baalbek itself and some other areas.",
        "Lebanese sources say that 19 people were killed in the strikes, and that included four children.",
        "When it was all over, though, Israel said it had captured five Hezbollah fighters and they were taken back to Israel.",
        "Now Hezbollah says those people who were captured were not part of their organization, that they were civilians.",
        "However Lebanese security officials say, in fact, the men who were captured were low-level members of Hezbollah.",
        "And why this place?",
        "Why Baalbek?",
        "Well, Baalbek is a Hezbollah stronghold, no question, and it's also where, actually, Iran's Revolutionary Guard trained Hezbollah guerrillas during the 1980s."
