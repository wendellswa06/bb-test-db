        "It was very dangerous to have the wrong opinion.",
        "He did not kill film directors because they had an international reputation and it would have ruined his propaganda in America.",
        "But Eisenstein was literally making the movie of his life because his career had gone way south and he needed to have a movie that put him in Stalin's good graces.",
        "So he decided, at Stalin's suggestion, to make a movie about Alexander Nevsky, who was a Russian who saved the country in 1242 when the Germans foolishly invaded."

        "He got Sergey Prokofiev to write the soundtrack.",
        "Right.",

        "You know, two armies across a vast distance.",
        "The difference, of course, is when you see 1,000 soldiers in this movie you're seeing 1,000 people.",

        "Well, I think a lot of it has to do with the president's strategy and obviously with the tone and the rhetoric that he uses.",
        "Now, the president concluded in 2016 that it made great sense for him to run a base strategy, essentially to try to win older white voters.",
        "And that was a successful strategy and especially in the Midwest - I think in states like Florida.",

        "And to ask a blunt question - what kind of future does the GOP have when it takes that approach in a country that's becoming more diverse every year?",
        "Well, obviously, it's a challenge for the future.",
        "But I think what's even more dangerous is that our country and our society are being further divided.",
        "We're really headed down a path where it appears that there is one party for older white voters and then there's another party that's for people of color and immigrants."
