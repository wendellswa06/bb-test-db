        "Once it happens, I think God's role is to give us the strength and the vision to come through it - and come through it with our faith intact.",
        "God is there to send us people to hug us and hold our hands and dry our tears so we don't feel abandoned, not by God and not by friends.",
        "And then in our response to the tragedy, then we have something good that comes out of it.",
        "Can I take you back to a time before all of this?",
        "When you were growing up in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn in the 1940s, from what I understand, it sounds like you had - rather a happy childhood.",
        "Oh, I did.",

        "Renee, I am embarrassed to remember how I counseled some families who had a tragedy - in my early years as a rabbi, before I had to try those words out on myself and discovered they really didn't comfort very much.",
        "And I can imagine that you - in other words, it was somehow God's will or...",
        "Yeah, I can remember one case, my first year as a rabbi, the 17- year-old son of a family in the congregation was killed.",
        "He'd been joyriding on the back of a truck and fell off, and the car behind hit him and killed him.",
        "I felt utterly helpless.",
        "I mean, what do you say in a case like that?",
        "I said something to the parents like, we can't understand why this happened, but we have to believe that somewhere down the road, we'll see that it made sense.",
        "And God, I wish I could take those words back today, 60 years later.",
        "I guess, as someone who spent some time - a little time in Pakistan and talked to a lot of people on the ground in Pakistan as I have, I think one of the things I'd come away with is that Pakistanis are not foreign to taking a punch, are not foreign to tough love.",
        "But I think many of them will tell you that they hope that the administration is as aggressive in asking them and pushing them in a particular direction as it is in addressing the needs of the Pakistanis.",
        "John, a story that your paper, The Miami Herald, is covering closely, a breakthrough in Honduras.",

        "taking such a prominent role in the standoff there?",
        "Well, Guy, I think one of the things that folks in Honduras will tell you is that their four-month-long nightmare is just about concluded.",
        "The deal has been broken.",
        "But the one thing it's condition on is Zelaya putting his fate in the hands of Congress.",
        "The question is whether or not Congress, which overwhelmingly tossed him out of office, was - voted against him anyway, is willing to put him back in.",
        "As far as the U.S.",
        "is concerned, the administration has been under intense pressure from Republicans in Congress who are objecting to the administration siding with Zelaya.",
        "Many of the Republicans feel that Zelaya has been too closely allied with Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and they are concerned about spreading Venezuela's socialist revolution throughout the region.",
        "They're saying that the administration should've sided with Micheletti, who is the de facto president.",
        "If they can get this through parliament, the U.S.",
        "can then come back and say, look, we tried to broker a deal, now we move on to the elections in a month and the U.S.",
        "can move this off the front page and get this behind us."
