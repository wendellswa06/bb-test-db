        "But how does Craddock go from defending belly dancing in 1893 to becoming this voice for sexual liberation, this person who writes how-to guides, sex guides, for married couples?",
        "It's a circuitous path, that's for sure.",
        "I mean, one of the things that really is leading her into this is that she's been doing a lot of reading in folklore and comparative religions and comparative mythology.",
        "And she thinks she's discovered that ancient religions were originally much more open to sex.",
        "And that has made her interested in this possibility of somehow recovering that world.",
        "And then belly dancing becomes this catalyst for her to decide, hey, this is the reform work I really want to do, and she starts putting together these little how-to guides.",
        "She was arrested a number of times, and her main nemesis, who we've mentioned, is Anthony Comstock.",
        "He was the head of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice.",
        "It sounds like something out of Saudi Arabia or Iran.",
        "It's amazing that there was such a group in America, but this is Victorian America.",
        "How did he become so powerful?",
        "Right.",
        "Comstock really wants a badge, and he lobbies Congress in the early 1870s to create an anti-obscenity law.",
        "This is a law that becomes known as the Comstock Act.",
        "Exactly.",
        "This is a law that's basically named for him, the Comstock Act or the Comstock Law.",
        "A law that he - and he can effectively judge what is indecent and what is not.",
        "Right.",
        "So Comstock has that going for him.",
        "He has an incredible success rate by the time he's really taking on Craddock in 1902.",
        "He's had 2,000-plus convictions.",
        "He doesn't lose that many cases.",
        "In 1902, he shows up at Ida Craddock's apartment in New York City with three other officials.",
        "They have a warrant to search the property, and they arrest her.",

        "He's able to get her on a state anti-obscenity law, and he's also able to indict her in federal court.",
        "So in a sense, what he has her is in double legal jeopardy.",
        "And that's because she used the postal service to mail these pamphlets.",
        "Right.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "The federal charge is based on her putting obscene materials in the mail in violation of the Comstock Act.",
        "The state trial comes up first.",
        "And it becomes clear pretty quickly that, you know, Comstock has her in a court that's highly favorable to his view, and she loses the case and is put in jail for three months at that point.",
        "She gets out of jail in June 1902.",
        "At this point, she's become something of a civil liberties hero.",

        "Right.",
        "I mean, now, people are picking up this story.",
        "I mean, here is someone who's claiming her right to freedom of expression, freedom of speech and Comstock has thrown her in jail.",
        "But Comstock still has the federal trial and that is, you know, set for a few months later.",
        "And again, she's a repeat offender at this point.",
        "She's really fearful that if she's found guilty, she's going to get the maximum sentence here.",
        "She'd get five years imprisonment, perhaps a hefty fine.",
        "And so she really sees all the chips being on the table in that last trial.",
        "So she decides that she is not going to show up for the sentencing.",
        "And what happens that day?",
        "She has decided that the deck is stacked against her.",
        "And so the night before the sentencing, she writes two notes: one to her mother and one to Anthony Comstock.",
        "She then methodically goes about sealing up her room and turns on the gas and is then found dead the next morning by her mother.",
        "She felt like the only option at that point was suicide, that that was the only way she was going to die a free woman."
