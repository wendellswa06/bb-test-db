        "The story of Indiana's new law regulating sellers of sexually explicit material begins here, along Interstate 65, about halfway between Indianapolis and Louisville, Kentucky, where an adult superstore called The Lion's Den has been under siege for - how many days, Rob?",

        "The surrounding neighbors were good to these folks, and then they deceived them and lied to them.",

        "If you imagine you get an infection in your skin and one cell is stimulated and, if that one soldier, if you will, now has to move from, say, the bottom of your foot up to a nearby lymph node, which would behind the knee for example--and that's quite a long way for one cell to go and its likelihood of getting there is very low.",
        "So what we think happens is that the cells through the tubes say, `Hey, guys, there's something going on here that shouldn't be going on.",
        "And then a whole host of cells go running off to the lymph node.",
        "Once they get to the lymph node, other cells kill off the invading germs.",
