        "Well, that's sort of emblematic of the challenge he's got in front of him.",
        "Many, many challenges.",
        "For starters, the last secretary, Lawrence Small, was very controversial.",
        "He came from a corporate background, and by all accounts, he was living a champagne lifestyle at taxpayer's expense; that's how one senator put it.",
        "He would throw parties that cost thousands of dollars and say they were fundraisers and charge it to the Smithsonian.",
        "His salary and compensation reached above $900,000.",
        "And part of this was that he kept the Board of Regents, which is supposed to oversee what happens at the Smithsonian, at arms length.",
        "And many have also criticized the Board of Regents, saying that while Lawrence Small was kind of running the ship in a very imperialistic style, they were asleep at the switch.",
        "And many of those people, by the way, are still there.",
        "Well, if you put aside the difficulties of the past few years with Mr. Small and just look at what confronts Wayne Clough in running something like the Smithsonian, what kind of job is it?",
        "Well, the mission statement of the Smithsonian already poses a problem, it's the increase and diffusion of knowledge, and that has baffled secretaries from the very beginning.",
        "Right now, the biggest problem is money.",
        "They have a $2.5 billion backlog, and that is just for maintenance and repairs.",
        "And the problem is Congress.",
        "Congress funds 70 percent of the Smithsonian.",
        "They have said, don't come to us looking for that money.",
        "But it's also very hard for the Smithsonian to find big private donors because most private donors don't really want to spend money on fixing the leaky roof.",
        "But I definitely got the sense from Wayne Clough today that he has worked with boards before, and that's very important.",
        "That he will be able to be independent from the board and challenge them when necessary.",
        "He really does seem like someone who knows how to run a place as complex as the Smithsonian.",
        "NPR's Elizabeth Blair on the naming of Wayne Clough as the new secretary of the Smithsonian.",

        "The state has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country.",
        "In Texas, in contrast, in the last day or so she's focused much more on foreign policy, saying that she'd be a stronger commander-in-chief.",
        "She had an ad running with a phone ringing at the White House in the middle of the night, suggesting at three in the morning if that call comes through and there's a crisis, she'd be the person that Americans would want in there.",

        "We look at a state like California, they helped Hillary Clinton pull off a victory there and they're hoping for the same thing in Texas.",
        "Speaking of the ads, Obama is running a lot more than Hillary Clinton.",
        "Is she taking note of this somehow?",
        "Her campaign certainly is.",
        "The campaign actually had a memo to reporters, which suggested that the media has anointed Barack Obama the frontrunner.",
        "They say that he's like it, spending a lot more money, and they're using that to set expectations, suggesting now that since he is spending so much money he has been seen as the frontrunner.",
        "If he doesn't pull off wins in all the states on Tuesday, they're suggesting that might show he has a problem.",
