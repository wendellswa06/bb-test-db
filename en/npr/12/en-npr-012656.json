        "There is a deal.",
        "A short time ago on Capitol Hill Senate moderates, Republicans and Democrats, stepped forward to announce an agreement to avoid the partisan showdown over judicial nominees and filibusters.",
        "Republican John McCain of Arizona stepped to the microphone first.",
        "We have reached an agreement to try to avert a crisis in the United States Senate and pull the institution back from a precipice that would have had, in the view of all 14 of us, lasting impact, damaging impact on the institution.",
        "John McCain was joined by Democrat Ben Nelson of Nebraska and 12 others.",
        "The senators said there will be an up or down vote on three of the president's nominees.",
        "Other nominations were left in question.",
        "We're joined now by NPR's congressional correspondent, David Welna.",
        "And, David, tell us about the deal.",
        "Well, Robert, the deal is one that has Republicans agreeing not to vote for the so-called nuclear option, which would do away with judicial filibusters altogether.",
        "This is seen as--was seen by them as being a very drastic step that actually could hurt Republicans should they end up in the minority, and on the part of Democrats it was an agreement to not block up or down votes on three of the judicial nominees who were renominated by President Bush.",
        "They were filibustered in the last Congress.",
        "Janice Rogers Brown, William Pryor and Priscilla Owen would all be allowed to be voted on on the Senate floor.",
        "There would be no filibuster for them.",
        "There was no commitment made for William Myers, who was nominated for the 9th Circuit Court in San Francisco, or for Henry Saad, who was nominated for the 6th Circuit Court.",
        "And there's a certain understanding that they may not actually make it out of the Senate without that understanding.",
        "But Democrats said that they would only filibuster in the future, and this could include Supreme Court nominees `under extraordinary circumstances'--those were the words they used.",
        "Let's make sure we understand this.",
        "There will be, as I understand it, up or down votes on some of the president's nominees, but on the others the Democrats retain the right to filibuster and the Republicans in this deal acknowledge that it requires 60 votes to close off debate on those nominations?",
        "And I'm not sure you accept Clay Shirky's analogy, but if you get into the tote bag business, we're going to have a problem.",
        "But while that may be true for some manufacturing firms, it is not true for all of them.",
        "Construction equipment maker Caterpillar, for example, reported a 34 percent jump in second-quarter profits, largely due to strong demand in the US and abroad.",
        "And in recent months factory employment in some areas has started to rebound.",
        "National Association of Manufacturers economist David Huether thinks for that reason even the manufacturing sector may start to see a hiring pickup in the months ahead.",
        "Businesses are beginning again to invest in product and equipment, and as a result we're going to see, I think, stronger manufacturing production in the second half of the year.",
        "I think that's going to translate into some modest gains in employment.",
        "I don't think we're going to see enormous gains in manufacturing employment, but we could see gains in the area of, say, 10 to 20,000 a month.",
        "Much of the weakness in manufacturing last month was confined to the automotive sector, which continues to grapple with excess capacity.",
        "In addition the the fairly strong jobs numbers for July, the government also revised upwards its job growth figures from May and June by a total of 42,000.",
        "Jack Speer, NPR News, Washington."

        "Unanimous concern and disappointment - some of America's closest allies vented their anger this weekend over President Trump's tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.",

        "- are calling out its seventh member, the United States.",
        "White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow this morning downplayed the friction, calling it a family quarrel.",
        "There is one organization, though, tasked with dealing with international trade disputes, the World Trade Organization.",
        "And Canada and the EU have already filed challenges to the tariffs with the WTO.",
        "Jennifer Hillman is a former member of the World Trade Organization's appellate body, and she joins me now.",
        "Welcome to the program.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "OK.",
        "So just briefly, why are these countries coming to the WTO?",
        "Because they believe what the United States has done violates its WTO obligations.",
        "The United States promised, as part of a series of tariff negotiations, to limit its tariffs on steel to 0 percent duties and to limit its tariffs on aluminum to somewhere between 0 and 6 percent on average.",
        "And secondly, they're complaining because one of the other rules of the WTO is that you cannot discriminate as among WTO members.",
        "And, here, the United States is applying the steel and aluminum tariffs to some countries but not to Korea, not to Brazil, not to Australia, not to Argentina.",
        "So the other complaint is, at its core, that there's been discrimination against the EU, Canada Mexico and the other countries that are subjected to the tariffs.",
        "Could this dispute turn into something more serious, depending on what the WTO rules?",
        "Well, if it ruled, it would hear this complaint and figure out whether they agree or don't agree with the European Union or Canada or any of the challenges.",
        "And I think the chances that the WTO will decide against the United States are very, very strong.",
        "I mean, it's a very clear case of a violation.",
        "What will get tricky for the WTO is, what are they going to do about the defense that the United States intends to raise?",
        "So that defense is national security, apparently?",
        "It's national security.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And so what the United States is going to say is that there is a provision in the WTO that says, yes, you can break your tariff commitments.",
        "You can discriminate if you fall under the terms of this security exception.",
        "And that's really the problem for the United States - is that it's not clear that these steel or aluminum tariffs fit within any of those boxes.",
        "All right.",
        "So the WTO is going to have to arbitrate this.",
        "But whatever they rule, will it have teeth?",
        "I mean, what will the WTO do?",
        "So, again, what happens at the end of a WTO case is that countries are asked to come into compliance.",
        "If you do not, then there are sort of two other options.",
        "One is that the countries - the European Union, Canada, et cetera - could ask the United States to compensate them for the amount of trade that's been lost or disrupted as a result of the tariffs.",
        "The last option is that the EU, Canada and others can add on retaliation duties against the United States."

        "What do you think the likelihood of a trade war breaking out is?",
        "I fear that it's higher than I would ever have imagined and would like to see.",
        "I think the Trump administration has miscalculated the willingness of Europe, Canada, Mexico and many other countries to react to these steel and aluminum tariffs.",
        "I fear that what they thought is that everybody would agree.",
        "And obviously, what's happened is most of the countries have said no. No, you don't have a right to put on these tariffs in the first place, so I'm not going to agree to limit my trade just to get out from underneath your illegal tariffs.",
        "The WTO is really an institution that was built around trying to prevent trade wars happening.",
        "And just remind us why that is.",
        "Why are trade wars damaging?",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "Its whole purpose is to set up a set of binding rules that everybody will agree to because what happens is when one country says, I'm going to raise my tariffs on you, other countries then get into the act and say, well, I now need to raise tariffs to protect my market because all of the steel or the aluminum that didn't end up in the United States is now ending up in my market and hurting my suppliers.",
        "So everyone starts raising tariffs on each other.",
        "And at that point, you end up where we were in the late '20s and early 1930s, which is the entire trading system crashing and the economies of the world crashing.",

        "That's true, except that there's an understanding also that the use of a filibuster would be very exceptional, and one very key element to this agreement is that no one of the seven Republicans who signed on to the agreement is under any obligation to stick to the agreement on an individual basis if he or she feels the Democrats are not keeping good faith with their promise to support filibusters only under what are called `extraordinary circumstances.",
        "So we could see a return to the so-called nuclear option in the future if these Republicans feel that there are people being stopped from getting up or down votes for what they feel are not extraordinary circumstances."

        "Who were the winners and who were the losers tonight?",

        "And I think that the losers are those who felt like these filibusters has to come to an end altogether and who were very worried about what groups who support them in doing away with the filibuster might do if they didn't get rid of them.",
