        "And so it raises - you know, obviously the moral dilemma turns in part on what you think about abortion as, you know, all - so many debates in American life and culture come back to what you think about abortion.",
        "But it does raise questions like to what extent is a sort of eugenic spirit different if it is parents making the choices rather than the state, right?",
        "I mean, this is obviously a huge difference between that era and our own, that it is not state sponsored.",
        "It may be state encouraged.",

        "But anyway, so those were some of the issues that I was trying to raise.",
        "And no small issues, and it gets into very - some murky areas because, as you suggest, nobody is talking - nobody is talking about the state making these decisions for anybody.",
        "Given that, don't parents have the right - if abortion is legal, don't parents have the right to make these choices on the basis of the best information available?",

        "Thanks so much, Neal.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "And you wrote a piece on - called \"\"The Year of the Paywall,\"\" which said 2012 might just be the year in which newspapers abandon the idea that all readers are customers.",
        "Right.",
        "I think the thing to understand about the model that's being tried now by the New York Times, by the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, by the Chicago Sun Times, finally gives up on the idea that every reader online can be treated as if they were someone who is purchasing the paper, the kind of online equivalent of someone who's purchasing the paper when it was just a physical product.",
        "In fact, what all three of the papers are doing, and I think an increasing number of papers are copying them, is saying we will never get a majority or even a sizable minority of our readers to pay us directly, but we can design a system in which some of our most passionate, engaged readers pay us directly, and the rest of the readers, the casual readers, we can keep around for the advertising revenue.",
        "And squaring that circle has been the hard conversation for the last really 15 years of paywalls.",
        "It looks like now maybe that we've got a solution that deals with both halves of that equation, both the user fees and the advertising.",
        "And you suspect that will change things in a number of interesting ways.",
        "We'll get to that in just a moment.",
        "But first, you - your conclusion is that most people who use the newspaper aren't necessarily reading the coverage of the Florida primary; they're checking the sports and the horoscopes.",
        "Right, I mean, you know, newspapers have always been a bundle, right?",
        "They have sections for a reason, and it's not to maximize the chance that a Mets fan is going to see news from the Honduras, right?",
        "There are people who go to the sports section first.",
        "There are people who go to the business section first.",
        "There are people who read only those things.",
        "As long as the newspaper was a bundle, no one ever had to care that people were buying it for radically different reasons.",
        "But once you go online, and people can unbundle things, where you can traffic directly to a story without going through the home page or any of the rest of it, suddenly what it - the individual choices made by individual readers come to matter a lot.",
        "And so online it became impossible, really impossible, to get the casual readers to behave like committed readers who would read every section or every story or what have you.",
        "In fact, if you graph what people are reading on any given newspaper, the absolute commonest pattern is the user who reads one article in a month."

        "So if you raise the bar, say you can have 20 articles a month for free, you're going to get most of your readers still and the advertising that is directed to them.",
        "That'll still sell, but that's not going to pay a lot of your costs.",
        "You can, though, charge those motivated subscribers a fee, and it looks like they're going to be willing to pay for it.",
        "That's right, and it certainly - I mean, what we're seeing now - again with the Times, the Star-Tribune, the Sun Times - is that a small core of readers will come forward and support the paper.",
        "And this is I think a really interesting change because it isn't just, hey, we got a new source of money, which is always welcome in the newspaper world, but also because psychologically it moves the Times, the New York Times business model closer to NPR's, where a majority of listeners don't donate in any given year, but those of us who do sign up, become, you know, members, in my case WNYC, become members of their local station give money, are supporting the enterprise for the rest of the population.",
        "So now the Times has this similar group of very committed users who are disproportionately supporting the paper for the rest of us.",
        "It's interesting.",
        "You wrote about that in this article: Lest NPR seem like small ball, it's worth noting, you write, that the Times has convinced something like one out of every 100 of its online readers to pay, while NPR affiliates' success rate is something like one in 12.",
        "Right.",
        "We've been at it a little longer than they have, but...",
        "Practice, practice makes perfect, yes.",

        "Now, when you go to advertisers, typically in the open market, when it was just, you know, here's our Web traffic, an eyeball was an eyeball is an eyeball, as the phrase is in the online marketing world.",
        "But when you are actually deriving some of your revenues from users signing up to give you, in the Times' case five bucks a week, what that - what makes that user base loyal and what makes that user base recruit more users to become loyal suddenly becomes a business imperative.",

        "But there is a very loyal minority of folks who told us through rounds and rounds of research that they value the New York Times content, they'd be willing to pay to support the New York Times content.",
        "And so the key for us in this model was threading that needle - remaining open to the Web, enabling those who are coming to us for that one article or two article, et cetera, to still enjoy the content but at the same time enable those who are very loyal to have some kind of a different experience with us.",
        "And threading the needle in terms of how many stories you can access for free per month and the price point.",
        "Yes, that's right.",
        "We did a tremendous amount of research in the lead-up to the launch of the pay model.",
        "And I want to just actually throw something out here, as well.",
        "We keep talking about the quote-unquote paywall, but I think it's important for your audience to understand that this was a holistic strategy, and it's across all of our digital platforms.",
        "So it includes not only our website, but it includes our mobile devices, as well, and that is - you know, I think everybody knows is becoming increasingly an important way for folks to access content.",
        "And we're seeing some very interesting user behaviors as it relates to that.",
        "So it's important just to understand those distinctions.",
        "But price became very important, understanding how our users were using the website, how many articles they were accessing; really setting the meter on the website at the exact right place really was the trick to the success that we've seen.",
        "Here's an email we have from Victoria: I love the New York Times and often thought I would pay for the information they were giving away for free.",

        "I wonder how much the smartphone and the tablet have changed this equation because they are so much more like the newspaper experience.",
        "Well, they've changed the equation less, I think, than you'd imagine.",
        "And in fact, I think one of the Times - one of the things the Times said in launching this, in launching their system - I don't like to call it a paywall because something that lets out most of the content, the wall isn't the right metaphor for it.",
        "Maybe a membrane then.",
        "Exactly, fair enough, right, semi-permeable membrane - that consumers are increasingly converging on their expected behaviors.",
        "And in fact the difference between the phone and the tablet and the computer are shrinking as the tablets and the phones get more capable.",
        "So there was this thought originally that the tablet would be this kind of ideal walled garden, but unfortunately Apple also shipped it with a browser, and so the Web is still present and in fact more present in the mobile phone ecosystem than it has ever been before.",
        "And so I think increasingly publishers are saying if we're printing something and then putting it on a truck and putting it in your driveway, as you said, Neal, then that is essentially one form of delivery, and digital is a different form of delivery.",
        "Most of the kind of pure iPad plays have worked out only if they're newsletters, which is to say for a small, relatively tightly organized group of readers.",
        "But once it's really a newspaper, once it means to be a general, you know, an omnibus publication for a large group of readers, digital content goes to the various devices users want it to, and if you add too many distinctions in there, the user frustration goes through the roof, and it stops being worth the segmentation in the first place."
