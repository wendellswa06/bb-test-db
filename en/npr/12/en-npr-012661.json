        "We're talking with Clay Shirky, an associate professor in the Interactive Telecommunications Program at NYU, author most recently of an article called \"\"The Year of the Newspaper Paywall.\"\" Denise Warren is also with us, senior vice president and chief advertising officer at the New York Times Media Group, general manager for NYTimes.com.",

        "Paywalls for news content still a matter for significant debate in the online world and indeed in newsrooms too.",
        "Meghan Peters from the social media and digital culture news blog Mashable recently called 2011 the year the paywall worked.",
        "Others push back, arguing paywalls only work in very specific situations for certain kinds of readers.",
        "That may not be a bad thing on the national level at organizations like the New York Times and for local publications like the Honolulu Civil Beat.",
        "We want to know what it's like where you live.",

        "This is the Indian food that I grew up with.",
        "Yes, hello.",
        "I've been a lifelong newspaper reader, and I used to - of course, I live in the Bay Area, so I used to get the Chronicle.",
        "And I love reading the New York Times online, and I did so for several years for free.",
        "And then when the New York Times started charging for it, I think I held out for a month or two, but I can go through 20 articles very quickly.",
        "So I finally decided to pay, and I get the Sunday Times, the printed newspaper, and I pay for the digital content, and I'm happy to do so because when you think about it, I mean, most people, at least if you're over a certain age, you used to pay for newspapers all the time.",
        "You just took it for granted.",
        "And certainly for the quality of the New York Times, I think it's well worth it.",
        "And I wonder, do you think, though, as a digital subscriber, you should be forced to see all the ads that everybody else sees?"

        "News and Google News, which are good news sources, but the ads on those sites just seem more obnoxious.",
        "So I don't know if the Times is trying to have a certain aesthetic standard for their ads, but yeah, fewer ads for people who are subscribing would make sense to me.",
        "Denise Warren?",
        "Actually, Robert, first let me thank you for being a loyal, long-term paying customer of the New York Times.",
        "We do appreciate your support.",
        "Yes, in fact, the New York Times does take its ad quality very, very seriously.",
        "We actually have an ad acceptability department that monitors the quality of advertising across all of our platforms.",
        "We do take great measure to make sure that there's a balance between the advertising and its quote-unquote intrusiveness, or I think obnoxiousness might have been the word that you used, Robert, and we really are very careful about that because it is the entire user experience that really does matter to our customers.",
        "So that is very important to us, and I'm glad you've noticed it.",
        "But if there are digital subscribers like Robert, who is paying the five bucks a week or whatever it is, shouldn't he be maybe screened off from more ads?",
        "I think the real answer to your question, Neal, is the economics, as I said earlier, of producing the quality content that the New York Times produces.",
        "It's such that it demands both an advertising and a subscription revenue stream.",
        "All right, Robert, thanks very much for the phone call, appreciate it.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Clay Shirky, you speculate, though, in your article that motivated readers like Robert are going to come eventually to want maybe different things than the 90 percent who will never subscribe.",
        "Right, there's actually been a very interesting conversation kicked off after I'd put out that piece, in which the New York Times public editor, Arthur Brisbane, who I should say does not speak for the New York Times directly, he's in an ombudsman role, but he asked about fact-checking.",
        "He asked should the Times become truth vigilantes, as he memorably put it."

        "And the pushback that he got on that idea of essentially how hard should we push politicians not to either bend the truth or sort of use weasel words to get around these issues, he had a kind of a sophisticated conversation about how, you know, how much leeway should we give them.",
        "And the universal that came back from politically committed readers was none; we rely on you to go after the politicians and not allow them to essentially get away with distorted political speech.",
        "And when you see that kind of uprising - and it happened several times in a row because Brisbane went on to explain his point of view several times in a row, when you see that kind of uprising, you think there is unmet demand here in what those users want from the paper relative to what at least Brisbane's conception of the job is.",
        "And when you get a paper that has an increasing integration of its social functions - the Times recently moved the comments directly onto the page with the articles, they've made the comments section more conversational, so user-to-user conversation is simply going to be more important and more engaged on that platform in 2012 than it was in 2011.",
        "At the same time there is this small group of users for whom their commitment to the paper is significant enough that they're going to be handing over five bucks a week.",
        "And I'm speculating that when those two forces come together, you're going to see that group of people start to ask for things that are different from what the people just showing up to read the occasional business article or the occasional celebrity article are going to ask for.",
        "Denise Warren, is that part of the conversation at the Times?",
        "Yeah, go ahead, please.",
        "Yeah.",
        "As a matter of fact, we're not waiting for them to ask.",
        "We're starting to give products and services to our paying subscribers.",
        "So for example, last year we launched two apps.",
        "One was a politics app on the iPhone, and another was called the collection app, it's a fashion app on the iPad.",
        "These apps will be no charge to our paying customers on those platforms.",
        "And you cannot access that content unless you are a paying subscriber.",
        "So you're starting to see us experiment with this as well.",
        "There's also subscriber newsletters that we are giving to our paying customers that help them understand the back-story behind some of the more significant news pieces that we are reporting on.",
        "Again, this is only something that is going to our paying customers.",
        "So we're starting to do this already and experiment with that approach.",
        "We should also point out, I think your publisher said that in the event of a horrible event like 9/11, maybe that instead of 20 articles a month, that could be moved considerably upwards as people wanted to access stories on a situation like that.",
        "So this is flexible.",
        "Unlike the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times is available on Google.",
        "Just go to the New York Times site, see a story you want to read, paste the headline into Google, and there's the full story for free.",
        "You can do this as many times as you'd like."

        "It's more hassle than subscribing, but not a lot.",
        "A friend of mine who works at the Times told me the paper is fine with people who do this because it ups the page views and hence increases the amount they can charge for ads.",
        "Denise Warren, is that true?",
        "MARKETPLACE's Janet Babin joins us.",
        "Janet, these are Sesame Street-associated toys and I imagine they're pretty popular.",
        "Yeah, so when we originally were constructing the model, it was very, very important to us to do a number of things.",
        "One was certainly - obviously the business objective was to create a new revenue stream while maintaining a very robust and growing advertising revenue stream.",
        "But equally as important was our mission, and it was incredibly important to us that we remained open to the Web.",
        "We had, as you noted earlier, an experience with Times Select, where this was many years ago, it generated over $10 million in revenue, so it was a successful model, but what we learned form that experiment was that a certain number of our very important voices, mostly our opinion journalists, were quote-unquote walled off from the rest of the Web.",
        "And we did not think that moving in that direction really made a lot of sense for the New York Times.",
        "So one of the core principles for executing this model was to remain open to the Web.",
        "So we were very generous with the number of articles that users can access, as well as remaining open to search and social and all the referral points back to the New York Times.",
        "When we first launched, there was a lot of discussion and debate about this approach, and we took a lot of criticism for it, and there was a lot of quote-unquote gaming of the system.",
        "But nine months later, I can tell you that we really haven't seen a lot of people manipulating URLs or cutting and pasting.",
        "We haven't seen a very big difference, you know, in terms of that now versus prior to launching.",
        "I think, you know, the basic headline here is that most of our users are honest, most of them are going to sort of abide by the rules that we've laid out, and they don't really want to work that hard, if they really want to read an article, to go back to Google and, you know, continue to operate that way.",
        "Denise Warren, thank you very much for your time today, we appreciate it.",
        "Thank you for having me.",
        "Denise Warren, senior vice president and chief advertising officer at the New York Times Media Group and general manager for NYTimes.com.",
        "And as we mentioned, Clay Shirky, it's not just the Times, it's not just the Wall Street Journal.",
        "The Journal and the Financial Times always seen in a special category, business news, time urgent, they had proprietary information people were always willing to pay for.",

        "Right, well, so - and this is I think the thing that finally - the newspaper industry moves in a pack because in a way they've all had the same business model for so long.",
        "They've all looked for some kind of synchronized solution to the current economic problem.",
        "And so when an individual paper would have an individual experiment, it would be regarded as interesting but not evidence of anything.",
        "Now that you've got the Sun Times in Chicago and the Star-Tribune in Minneapolis and so forth experimenting with this model, you - I think we're starting to see real movement away from the classic paywall of you pay me or you don't read it to this kind of metered threshold where if you're a casual reader, we're going to treat you as useful for the advertising base.",
        "But if you're a passionate reader, past a certain point we're going to ask you to support the mission of the paper as a whole, and this is exactly the same surprise as when Radiohead puts up an album for free and asks people to pay, or Louis C.K., the comic, puts up a show for free and asks people to pay, is that people actually do it.",
        "They actually pay for it because they think it's the right thing to do - not in a completely bloodless I'm-calculating-an-economic-transaction way, but because they care about the person or the institution on the other side of the browser page.",
        "And that, I think, is - that - this is going to be, now, a big sorting out for American papers, between those papers for whom readers have, as you said in the article, what I call the God forbid reaction, right?",
        "God forbid, the Chicago Sun Times go out of existence.",
        "The people who feel that way are going to be disproportionately likely to support the Chicago Sun Times, not just because they think I'm buying content and that's what I used to do when it was on paper, but because they think of themselves as supporters, as people who care about the institution as a whole.",

        "Newspapers, a cool medium.",
        "Well, so this then gets into the big open question, which is the hollowing out of the American metropolitan newspaper between 1980 and now, where a majority of the content for the kind of mid-sized metro daily papers for towns of 100, 200,000 people.",
        "They're not so small that they're just doing community news, but they're not so large that they can cover everything the way The New York Times famously can.",

        "No. And they're - they are available for free.",
        "Right.",
        "And so we're going to start to see newspapers sorted on this kind of hot-to-cold spectrum that McLuhan first introduced.",
        "People who have a passionate relationship with a particular paper or - are going to be the people disproportionately likely to support it.",
        "But if you turn that around, papers that are good at not just delivering a product that users were willing to pay for when it was printed, but papers that are good at actually getting people in their town or city to say, I like this institution, I'm committed to it in a hot way.",
        "Those papers are going to be disproportionately better positioned to survive this transition than the people who've just been bundling the AP newswire and a bunch of comics from, you know, a syndicated service and wrapping it inside a thin veneer of local news.",
        "Those papers are going to suffer."
