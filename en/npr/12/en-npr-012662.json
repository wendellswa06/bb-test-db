        "We're talking, of course, about Marshall McLuhan, the media theorist of the 20th century who - I guess his best-known book was \"\"The Medium is the Massage.\"\" You can hear the pun in there.",

        "Unfortunately, a lot of the pay scale started to happen during the worst economic downturn.",
        "I feel that I have become less informed because of my inability to pay for The New York Times.",
        "And I love The Times.",
        "I love it.",
        "But my statement is this, that because I've become less informed by The Times and not being able to read as much, the Denver Post here in my area has picked up the slack a little bit in the fact that it's put more Facebook posts out there, and I'm able to access it better that way, and I feel more informed that way.",
        "That utilizing social media and maybe apps, you know, is one of the things that The New York Times needs to, you know, maybe look into more.",
        "And I'll take my comment or my answer off the air.",
        "OK, Rod.",

        "There is no such thing as the news business.",
        "There's only the advertising business, which used to cross-subsidize news, right?",
        "So the old hook model was you write about the football team so you could take money from the car dealer and give it to the guy on the city desk.",
        "And it was crazy system, but it also worked for a really long time.",
        "Now that the economic model that supported that is under, you know, debilitating pressure from the Web, papers have to rebalance how much of what they're doing is about pursuing the revenue that supports the mission, and how much of it is about broadcasting the results.",
        "And I think everybody looked at what happened to The Times and Sunday Times, which are very significant papers in the political conversation in the United Kingdom.",
        "And after they went by the paywall - even more dramatically than what Rod is talking about with The New York Times - just large parts of what The Times and Sunday Times published never resonated with the general public.",
        "So there is now this tension, and Rod's got it exactly right.",
        "If you put out everything to everybody, you cannot generate a real stream of revenue from your most passionate users.",
        "On the other hand, any threshold is going to cut off some number of people who would be interested in reading more, but are not, for one reason or another, going to come up with $5 a week, or whatever it is that The Times is asking for.",
        "And that re-alignment is actually, I think, going to be a really big shift in the newspaper environment.",
        "Because, as he said, the Denver Post, may, in fact, be able to goose its advertising revenues better by staying more free longer and picking up some of the territory The Times cedes."

        "So the - instead of saying, the whole newspaper industry is now going to adopt this one new business model - we're just going to move from point A to point B - I think you're going to see this big scattering of some papers using social media better, as Rod was saying, others pulling back from it.",
        "Some papers charging more, other papers charging less.",
        "And it means that the whole, essentially, the assumed business model that lay under every newspaper in the United States is breaking up, to be replaced not by a different business model, but by a whole range of business models around how open or closed they want to be.",

        "Just food for thought.",
        "I mean, the reason you pay for news is to get the news that you haven't received for free.",
        "So Twitter's the source of news in two different ways.",
        "Some of it is truly, genuinely, breaking news, right, if you subscribe to any of the Occupy feeds because many New York City police forces have actually made a practice of arresting journalists, which is, you know, I think an affront to the First Amendment but certainly part of the recent tactics, then finding out what the occupiers themselves are saying as they're being cleared out is the way to get direct news.",
