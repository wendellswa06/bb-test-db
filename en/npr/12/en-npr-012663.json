        "I think it's true that - and certainly, I wouldn't want to be seen as making the argument that, you know, there is this sort of horrific Nazi-style future lurking around the corner and so on.",
        "By the same token, I think one thing that does happen with slippery slopes is that they slip sort of slowly and imperceptibly, and we just sort of get used to the fact that we've slipped down them.",
        "So in the case of Down syndrome, I think if you had gone back to the America of 30 or 40 years ago when a lot of these techniques were just being pioneered, and you would have said, well, you know, in the future, 90 percent of fetuses that where there's a positive test for Down syndrome will be aborted, I think that would have been perceived as kind of a wild leap, perhaps, from where the science was in 1975 or 1980, where the technology was and so on.",
        "But, in fact, once you put this information into people's hands, those tended to be the choices that the made.",
        "So I just - I'd be cautious about downplaying the slippery slope argument completely.",
        "Well, I'm not.",
        "I mean, like I said with my - in my decision and I was, you know, I mean, however terrible it sounds, I guess, I mean, for me, I can, you know, they talked about, this 90 percent, how terrible it'd be.",
        "But I guess that is a matter of perspective though.",
        "And it's 90 percent in some places.",
        "These are localized studies.",
        "Well, I'm just saying, whatever the decision is, it's very - it seems like it's easy in common language, in common - just in general to say, wow, you will terminate your child's pregnant - but I mean, I feel very - I do feel conflicted about it.",
        "Obviously, if it were to happen and I would make the decision, it wouldn't be easy.",
        "And I'm not saying that I would make one or the other, but I can see me reasoning to the point to say that we would, you know, we'll terminate the pregnancy and have another child.",
        "Well, and a lot of it, again, depends on what you think about the moral status of the fetus and the embryo because if the fetus and the embryo doesn't really have human rights, then in a sense, this is this gift, in a way, that we have this period when we can sort of eradicate these conditions, alleviate human suffering and so on.",
        "I'm obviously skeptical of that idea, but it is an idea that follows from certain popular premises."
