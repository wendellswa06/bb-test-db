        "Here's an email we have from Mary in Massachusetts: I know of a lady who's told by her doctor that her baby was going to have problems after an amniocentesis, and she considered an abortion.",

        "And you're dealing with - you're making one decision based on a set of probabilities that leads to another decision that even if it isn't based on probabilities, there's always the possibility of error.",
        "So it's incredibly fraught, and I don't really have anything to add to the caller from Salt Lake City's comments excepts that that's actually kind of, sort of a remarkable portrait of how these kind of issues in sort of quite, maybe not often talked about ways, interact with married life, parenting and so on in America.",
        "Patty emails us: I grew up with a parent both physically and mentally ill, and with that burden upon me, looked within and sincerely decided, as childbearing was at that time an all-or-nothing situation with no opportunity for pre-birth information, that I could not risk bringing a child forth and possibly being tethered with a significant burden again.",
        "Had the option of this post-conception but pre-birth test been available, I would have had a chance of being a natural parent.",
        "I do believe this is risky moral ground, but my personal experience, of course, allowing this testing to continue.",
        "And again, just as I don't think any state-sponsored eugenics is in the offing, I don't think bans on this kind of testing is in the offing either.",
        "Oh, no. It's almost impossible to imagine a ban on that kind of testing.",
        "You could potentially imagine, I supposed, a ban on abortion in some circumstances associated with some tests as, you know, I mean, it's a separate debate in many ways, but we've been having a debate here in Washington about a ban on sex-selective abortion, which is obviously a big issue in east and south Asia and, arguably, an issue in some immigrant communities in the United States.",
        "And in both case, you have this question that goes back to the initial debate about abortion rights.",
        "To what extend can we as society say abortion is OK in general, but we're going to pass judgment on the specific reason for abortion?",
        "And it's obviously a very tricky ground.",

        "Why is that?",
        "Well, what happened is, after the 2000 election, several states created a series of laws or policies to secure the voting system, and Florida ended up on the far end of the spectrum.",
        "So, at this point, you have a handful of laws.",

        "And there's a third one that doesn't allow people to correct mistakes on their voter registration form within a month of the election.",
        "So, taken together, these laws, many voting rights advocates argue, make Florida one of the most difficult states to vote, to register to vote and to get your vote counted.",

        "Why do they say that Florida needs these?",
        "Well, some of the law makers that I talked to said that Florida needs to err on the side of caution because of what happened in 2000.",
        "And that the idea is to create some kind of more transparent system, so that it's very clear on election day, this is what's counted, and this is what's not.",
        "You know, the question is whether or not, that kind of transparency will actually happen, in the midst of a heated or close election.",
        "And so why do the opponents of these, why do they think that it will unfairly exclude minorities, poor people, older people?",
        "Well, speaking just to the idea of third-party voter registration groups, most of these groups focus on generally under-represented groups, which tend to be Hispanics, blacks, or old people.",
        "And a lot of these groups tend to vote Democratic, or so their opponents believe.",
        "And so their sense is that, because this is where these groups focus, this is the groups that those legislators are trying to keep from voting or to make it more difficult for them to vote.",

        "And so, what they fear is that one volunteer, who is a rogue volunteer, or someone who is angry at his boss, might lose a bunch of forms intentionally.",

        "And the idea there is, according to the supervisor of elections, is that they need some time to process a lot these things, and that, basically, there's a wave of new voter registration that comes in just before the deadline.",
        "And that, if they were allowing people to fix them constantly through this period, it would simply get confused, and they would be overwhelmed.",
        "So the upshot being what, that a lot of people aren't going to vote in November?",
        "A scenario that you can imagine is that people go to the polls on election day in Florida and find out either that there's a mismatch or an omission on their registration form, and either they're turned away from the polls, even though they're eligible voters, or they're allowed to file a provisional ballot, but then their vote is not counted.",

        "Oh, possibly.",
        "Although I'm not so sure that anything could be worse than the hanging chads debacle.",
        "At this point, there are a lot more, in certain cases, there's a lot more that's been done, and some of these groups do feel that the system works better than it did eight years ago.",
        "It's just that it still may not be perfect or even close to it."
