        "...Rather disappointingly.",
        "Nonetheless, you know, officials here are expecting big crowds for the inauguration of possibly half a million.",
        "So there's a huge security operation.",
        "But it's also New Year's Day, and Brazilians really celebrated, as you know.",
        "And so let's see whether they turn up or how - and how many of them decide to carry on partying somewhere else.",
        "I mean, Bolsonaro had been seen as this very divisive figure, right?",
        "During the campaign, hundreds of thousands of Brazilians, especially women, were on the streets urging people not to vote for him.",
        "So is that changing?",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean Bolsonaro was elected in October with a very comfortable margin of some 10 million votes.",
        "Polls indicate, though, that since then, he's become even more popular.",
        "It seems Brazilians have really high expectations of him.",
        "And you often meet people here who say that they don't agree with everything Bolsonaro stands for.",
        "But anything's better than the leftist government that ruled for most of the last decade and a half, a period that saw the country's worst ever recession, a massive corruption scandal and an epidemic of violent crime.",
        "I was actually out in the streets here when the new year dawned earlier today, talking to people about their new president.",
        "And I met Alan (ph) Hubner, a computer programmer, and I asked him to tell me why he supports Bolsonaro.",
        "Security.",
        "Yeah, I want to feel safe here, you know?",
        "Hubner told me that he's gay, and Bolsonaro, of course, is notorious for making offensive homophobic comments.",
        "A lot of LGBT Brazilians are worried about what his presidency might mean for them.",
        "And I asked Hubner about that, and he says, in a country where there are tens of thousands of homicide every year, making Brazil safer matters more to him than anything Bolsonaro said in the past.",
        "People say that he is homophobic.",
        "Oh, he's a homophobic.",
        "He going to kill gays.",
        "I don't believe he going to kill gays.",
        "I believe that everybody's getting killed here.",
        "It doesn't matter if you're gay, if you're straight, if you're black or white.",
        "Everybody's getting killed here.",
        "I mean, that's going to be a huge issue that Bolsonaro's going to have to deal with, clearly, if people feel that way.",
        "But what can you tell us about other policy agenda - the other policy agenda items that Bolsonaro is going to focus on?",
        "Well, all eyes are going to be on what he does with the environment.",
        "He's been talking about withdrawing from the Paris climate change agreement.",
        "Bolsonaro is also a big fan of President Trump and used some of his tactics during the election campaign, communicating directly, for example, via Internet.",
        "So we're going to see a shift here towards the U.S., and that has regional implications, for example, in the handling of Venezuela.",
        "Meanwhile, domestically here in Brazil, Bolsonaro wants to greatly increase the public's access to firearms.",
        "That's very controversial.",
        "So we'll see what happens there."

        "And these toys were manufactured in China between April and July and sold in the U.S.",
        "and elsewhere worldwide between May and August.",
        "But Mattel thinks that only about 300,000 of them in the U.S.",
        "were actually sold, the rest it managed to remove from store shelves.",
        "So the problem, as with the Thomas the Tank Engine a couple of months ago, is that the toys could make children sick.",
        "That's right.",
        "They may contain a surface paint with excessive amounts of lead in it, and we all know how dangerous lead can be, especially for young kids; it can lead to brain damage.",
        "What kind of safety record does Mattel have?",
        "Well, you know, in the industry they're known for being more diligent than many companies.",
        "They have strict controls in place.",
        "They have, of course, had a number of toy recalls in the past.",
        "But still, in the industry this comes as a surprise and maybe even a wake-up call.",
        "The company says it's still investigating.",
        "But at this point it thinks that this was apparently a single contract manufacturer in China that the company had a long-standing relationship with.",

        "Government officials said that Chinese products were overwhelmingly safe and they called on the foreign media not to hype the problems of the small minority of products.",

        "It wobbles a little bit like a top or a gyroscope.",

        "When it gets to be wintertime, the sun drops low in the sky, and if you're a solar-powered Rover, that's a bad thing.",

        "We think the chances for survival are actually quite good, but we think it's likely that the Rover is going to have to drop into a kind of a hibernation mode for a number of months, and we may actually go two, three, four, six months, even without hearing from the vehicle."
