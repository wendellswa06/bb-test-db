        "But then when springtime comes, and the sun rises higher in the sky, good chance that Spirit will wake up and start talking to us again.",
        "So it's so crippled that you can't even now tilt it to the right direction that it would need to be tilted?",
        "Mr.�SQUYRES: We could the only way you can tilt this vehicle is by driving it onto a hillside that faces the direction you want to tilt, and we're only moving small distances right now as we turn the wheel.",
        "So that's tough to do.",
        "What about all the suggestions that have been coming in, things like using the robot's arm, you know, to lift it up and all that kind of stuff?",
        "Mr.�SQUYRES: Yeah, those are great.",
        "I have gotten so many wonderful emails from people because, you know, people have gotten wrapped up in this drama.",
        "And everybody has had an experience of getting their car stuck somewhere and trying to figure out how to get it out.",
        "So this is a familiar predicament to many people, and we've gotten so many suggestions.",
        "You know, some of them are actually very useful, very helpful, and some of them we have been using.",
        "Others, for example using the arm wish we could do it.",
        "You know, I wish we could use the arm to help us, but that arm was designed for precision placement of delicate scientific instruments.",
        "It is not strong enough, I'm afraid, to push spirit out from its current location.",
        "So we're stuck to what we can do with the wheels, and we're doing the best we can with that.",
        "Gosh, I remember those days we used to rock the old car out of the sand back in the if you can't do that.",
        "But can you use the arm to shove sand under the wheels?",
        "Remember in the beach, if you got too deep, your wheels would start spinning because the sand is holding the car up now, and there's no traction.",
        "Mr.�SQUYRES: One thing that we've talked about would be using the arm to try to nudge a rock underneath the left, front wheel.",
        "It doesn't help to put anything under the right front wheel because that wheel doesn't turn.",
        "It's one of the ones that has failed.",
        "We've talked maybe, come springtime, about moving the arm to try to nudge a rock under that left front wheel and get a little traction that way.",
        "We'll see.",
        "If the Rover survives the winter, and springtime comes, and that looks like it's still a useful thing to try, then maybe we'll try it."

        "Charles(ph) in Birmingham, Alabama.",
        "Hi, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "Mr.�SQUYRES: Hi, thank you for taking my call.",
        "I just had a quick question and, I guess, a comment.",
        "I really appreciate the Rover being up on Mars and it being our first step toward, I guess, space exploration.",
        "I guess my question is: What are we working towards to further along our exploration in space, knowing that us living on Earth, we have so much knowledge out there in space.",
        "What are we what is our next step past Mars?",
        "Thanks, Charles.",
        "Mr.�SQUYRES: Well, there are a lot of things still about to happen on Mars.",
        "Besides the continued operation of Spirit and Opportunity and a couple of orbiters, several orbiters that are orbiting Mars right now, there's a new mission called the Mars Science Laboratory Mission that's going to launch in 2011, is going to put a big, more capable Rover than Spirit and Opportunity on to the surface and operate that for probably a fairly extended period of time.",
        "What I'd like to see happen on Mars sometime in the future is a mission that would actually bring rocks back from the Martian surface: land on the surface, collect rocks, bring them back to Earth and put them into the best laboratories on Earth and really find out in much more detail what those are like.",
        "Look further out in the solar system.",
        "You know, my favorite thing out there has always been Europa.",
        "It's one of the moons of Jupiter.",
        "It's got a crust of ice.",
        "Beneath that crust of ice, there appears to be an ocean of liquid water, and boy, I'd love to know what's in that ocean.",
        "Yeah, but there was a plan, if I remember back in my dusty memory, of something called a Mars Sample Return Mission that was planned.",
        "Did that just get scrubbed, or there was no money for it after a while, or what happened with that?",
        "Mr.�SQUYRES: We've been talking about Mars Sample Return for a very long time, bringing samples back.",
        "It turns out that when you look hard at what it really takes to do it, it's an enormously challenging mission technically, and it's going to be very, very expensive.",
        "And so it's not something that's in the immediate future right now.",
        "We've got to probably take the problem and kind of break it down into pieces, have one spacecraft that goes and collects the samples, another one that goes later and picks them up and takes them into Mars orbit, maybe another one that goes and finds those and brings them back to Earth."

        "So by breaking up the problem into several parts, you can probably make the whole thing a bit more affordable.",
        "So where is Spirit's sister-ship, so to speak, sister Rover Opportunity?",
        "Where is that vehicle?",
        "Mr.�SQUYRES: Opportunity's on the other side of the planet, has six good wheels and is doing very well.",
        "We just today pulled up to the rim of the freshest impact crater we've ever seen on Mars with either Rover.",
        "Yeah.",
        "There are two sort of peak snowflake temperatures.",
        "I think it's right below freezing and then five degrees Fahrenheit, also.",
        "It's a crater called Conception.",
        "It's named after one of Magellan's ships, and geologically it formed yesterday.",
        "Now, I don't know when it actually formed, but it's the youngest, freshest, most-recent crater that we've ever seen on Mars.",
        "It's kind of a scary-looking place, actually.",
        "I just saw the first good pictures of it this morning.",
        "If you go to marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov, you can see the pictures virtually as they come down from the spacecraft, and it's a very rocky, blocky, kind of dangerous-looking place.",
        "So we're going to have to watch our step around Conception, but it's a very interesting feature, unlike anything we've seen before.",
        "Is that where you were headed all this time?",
        "Mr.�SQUYRES: No, this is just an interesting stop along the way.",
        "Where we're headed is a crater called Endeavor, which is huge.",
        "This thing is more than 10 miles in diameter.",
        "It's an enormous feature.",
        "It's still quite far away.",
        "But this is sort of an interesting little way-station on the way to Endeavor.",
        "So when getting back to Spirit, when do you decide to give up trying to pull her out of the sand there?",
        "Mr.�SQUYRES: Well, we're never going to give up trying to move the vehicle, okay?",
        "Our intention is to continue to try to move the vehicle whenever we can because even if all we get is small amounts of motion, even if it only moves five centimeters, 10 centimeters, we have an arm on the front of the vehicle, and it's only about the size of a human arm."

        "It doesn't have a very long reach, and so if you can just reposition the Rover even slightly, you can bring new patches of soil within reach of that arm, and you can study new things.",
        "So we're going to keep trying to move it, but how far we're going to move is hard to say, and our recent experience suggests not very far.",
        "One thing that we do have to realize, though, is that very soon, probably simply within the next few weeks, we're going to have to stop all attempts to move the vehicle as winter becomes more severe.",
        "We just won't have the power to do it, and that's the point at which we'll just kind of hunker down and try to survive until spring comes, and that's coming real soon.",
        "So it has a power-down mode to just go to sleep for a while?",
        "Mr.�SQUYRES: It has yeah, it has kind of a hibernation mode that it goes into, and we don't command it to do it.",
        "We don't tell the Rover it's time to hibernate.",
        "The Rover senses that it has very little power and goes into that hibernation mode all by itself and kind of stays that way until the power comes back up again.",
        "That's the way it preserves as much power on board as it can.",
        "So you just have to keep your fingers crossed that, come spring, it'll power itself back up?",
