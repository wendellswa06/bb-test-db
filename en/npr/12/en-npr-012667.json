        "Wow.",
        "And you can see them in the video on our site.",
        "sciencefriday.com, Video Pick of the Week on the left side there.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And so did he teach you how you can do this yourself?",
        "How you can go on this snowflake safari?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, you know, I think beginners might just literally start with a magnifying glass, and you can test to see if your glass is good enough by looking at back of a penny.",
        "And if you can see Abe Lincoln sitting in the chair, then that's good enough to see some of the bigger flakes.",
        "The smaller flakes are gonna be tougher to see.",
        "And one thing that I thought was really interesting is that different conditions breed different crystals.",
        "So you're sort of more likely to see, you know, a stellar plate at some temperatures than you are at others.",
        "And he said - in your video, he said there was an ideal temperature, right, for the formation of a snowflake.",
        "Yeah.",
        "When I was about 15 years old, I used to have a lot of jam sessions at my house.",
