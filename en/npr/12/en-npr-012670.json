        "There's nothing in the law that would really start trying to ratchet that down yet.",
        "That's something that that the sponsors of this law hope will happen but not for several years, so there's been a lot of blame thrown round that these premiums are going up because of this new law.",
        "That's by and large not the case.",
        "The reason that premiums are going up - one of the big reasons that premiums are going up so much next year is that because of the bad economy of the last couple of years, a lot of people put off getting medical care and a lot of those people whod put it off got medical care in 2010 and so, ensurers were seeing that increase in use, and they're building that into next year's rates.",
        "Now, I'm assuming we have been talking about individual health plans so far.",

        "In fact, many of these benefits are for these plans, including some of these what we call the grandfather plans.",

        "Some of these new benefits don't go into effect if you're in one of those what they called the grandfather plans.",
        "Some of these benefits where there regardless of that.",
        "Some, of the other benefits don't necessarily take place, and it's sort of benefit by benefit.",
        "But a lot of these benefits were across the board.",
        "Individual plans, small group plans, large group plans, these are - were what they called the patient's bill of rights that we argued about 10 years ago.",
        "These were all the early benefits.",

        "So, again, if you allow if you could maintain continuous coverage and this is from a law that passed in 1996 you can't have preexisting condition exclusions.",
        "If you're in a group plan and you go from group plan to group plan, you're not allowed to be excluded for preexisting condition exclusions.",
        "But if you allow your coverage to lapse for more than 63 days, then you can be required to wait.",
        "And it's up to, I believe, 12 months.",
        "So you really should if that's something that you're concerned about, you really should maintain coverage.",

        "But if that's something you're really worried about, it's something that you might want to look into while you're looking for another job.",
        "Are there limits in terms of what you can accrue as far as the expenses that are a part of this new law?",
        "In other words, can an insurance company kick you out because you have cost them too much because of your condition?",
