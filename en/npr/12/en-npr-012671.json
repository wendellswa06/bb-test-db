        "But I understand under the TRICARE program - which, you know, after putting 20 years in the military was - that my daughter will no longer be covered because she's not still in school, and the same thing with my son, where - I understand everything else can go until age 26.",
        "Is that correct?",
        "That is correct.",
        "Hugh, thank you.",
        "That is correct.",
        "There was a lot of concern about this.",
        "A lot of the people who are in TRICARE were very worried about changes.",
        "You know, they were pretty much - they were very happy with TRICARE, which is a very good program for retired military people, were afraid that it would get changed.",
        "They didn't like the possibility of changes, and they very much wanted to keep TRICARE out of all the changes that were going to come.",
        "And Congress basically did what they were asked, and TRICARE was not made part of this.",
        "Well, come to find out, an awful lot of people in TRICARE have these kids age 22 to 26 that say: How come we're not getting this benefit?",
        "And the answer is you said you didn't want to be part of this.",
        "So, basically, people in TRICARE are not going to be part of - they're not going to be a part of any of the changes that they're not going to like, but apparently, they're not going to be part of the changes that they might have liked, too.",
        "Now, there have been efforts to include TRICARE in this.",
        "So far, at least not to my knowledge, they have not come to fruition yet.",

        "And I think because that now requires that mental health care be treated at the same - to the same degree as all other ailments, I think that Congress really saw no reason to do anything else with it.",
