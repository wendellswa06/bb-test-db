        "Well, if you accept the notion that most of the time we give ourselves a cold because we get virus on our hands and then we stick it in our nose or stick it in our eye and that's the point at which infection occurs, the hand sanitizers - the problem with them is that rhinovirus, which is responsible for at least half of colds in adults and children - rhinovirus kind of likes alcohol, which is the active ingredient in all the hand sanitizers that are available.",
        "It's sort of laughing at you then when you pump out?",
        "Well, it kind of likes it.",
        "And there's actually been some field work, not done by me but done by Don Goldman's group at Boston - in Boston, where they found that active use of hand sanitizers in the homes apparently had no effect on secondary illnesses, that is illnesses acquired after somebody else brought the virus home.",
        "So, I think that there's a cheaper way actually - although hand sanitizers aren't very expensive.",
        "There's a cheaper way, which is simply washing your hands before you pick your nose or rub your eyes.",
        "Or just washing your hands in general, anytime during the day.",
        "And how - is there a method - a right way and the wrong way to wash your hands?",
        "And the Democrats, you know, we'll just have to kind of try and hold damage to a minimal on some level.",
        "Yes.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF MEN TALKING)",
        "Scenes of combat flash next to still images of soldiers asleep - grenade blasts and the voices of soldiers create a surreal, dream-like soundtrack.",
        "Kamber says the installation shows what made Hetherington stand apart from other war photographers who were just looking for that quintessential combat shot."

        "And so he did this amazing series of portraits of these soldiers at sleep in their bunks, and then he came back and created this whole multimedia piece based on their dream states, sort of tying in, you know, their interior worlds and the exterior violence that they faced every day.",

        "Yeah, and I can't tell you that rubbing your hands with a lemon is going to make any difference, but the reason - well, rhinoviruses are differentiated from another group of similar viruses by virtue of the fact they're sensitive to acid treatment.",
        "It, you know, chews the virus up or inactivates it.",

        "The place that we have focused on is the home, actually, in work we've just finished.",
        "But we had previously, a year or so ago, did a study of adults who had colds and we put them in a hotel room overnight to see - and then the following day, we went in and asked them to point out 10 places that they had touched in their overnight stay.",
        "And then we sampled those and tested for the presence of virus - well, really, for the presence of the RNA of the virus.",
        "And not surprisingly found something - a third to 40 percent of the sites that they pointed out to us had evidence of virus having been there.",
        "And it was the usual sites that you can imagine - the light switch and the telephone and the TV remote and the faucet handle in the bathroom, that sort of thing.",
        "One of the most interesting negative findings was that we did not find virus on the toilet handle in any one of the 10 samples that we tested.",
        "So, I don't know, this allows me to speculate all kinds of way about people's behavior toward the toilet handle, but colds spread best in the home.",
        "I think that's probably fair.",
        "And perhaps the most impressive evidence against airborne spread is that, although you and your coworker may very well have a cold at the same time, from work we did in an insurance company some years ago, the type - the serotype, or the virus that you have and the virus that your coworker has, are probably not the same.",
        "But if you go into the home, you can find each worker's virus circulating in people in the home.",
