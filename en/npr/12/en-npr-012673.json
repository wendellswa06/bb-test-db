        "Dr.",
        "Palese, is that - flu is not spread the same way, is it?",
        "They are - we should say that common cold is caused by a virus, and influenza is also caused by a virus.",
        "But there are really differences among these two families of viruses, those which cause the common cold and those which called influenza proper.",
        "And with influenza, which is very seasonal - in other words, we only really see it from maybe December to February, March.",
        "So, it's highly seasonal during the winter months, in contrast to common cold viruses, which can be observed or can be caught throughout the year.",
        "So, there are differences between these viruses, and one of them is also that for influenza - again, I'm not against washing hands, but it's probably more likely to be transmitted through the air as an aerosol, that there is airborne transmission by being in the same room, by being in the same elevator, et cetera.",
        "OK, Dr. Palese, let me stop you there because we have to take a break.",
        "We'll come back and talk lots more about cold and flu viruses.",
        "Stay with us.",

        "Also taking calls at - Twittering, @scifri is our Twitter and also on Second Life, you can go to Second Life island.",
        "Let me go - before we take a phone call or two, let me ask you, Dr. Palese, how do environmental or air conditioning sorts of things affect the transmission of the flu?",
        "So, transmission of influenza cannot be studied very easily with patients because there are ethical reasons to - not to allow those kinds of studies.",
        "It used to be that we had medical students and asked them to stay in a hotel room and then they get infected and then we were able to study transmission.",
        "At this point, we really have to go into animal experiments and mice - the laboratory mice are sort of the animal of choice for influenza.",
        "But it turns out that influenza is not transmitted very easily among mice.",
        "And so we had to develop a new animal model and that is guinea pigs.",
        "And it showed us that influenza is really transmitted much better at cold temperature and at low relative humidity, as compared to high temperature."

        "So, high temperature would be what, above 80 degrees Fahrenheit?",
        "Above 80 degrees.",
        "So we found - and this is sort of a finding which probably is interesting for us - at 81 degrees, we were not able to find - to observe transmission from one guinea pig to the other.",
        "And that would suggest that if we could warm - or if we would warm our rooms and buildings to above 81 degrees, we would avoid influenza transmission.",
        "However, we would buy a lot of other problems.",
        "First, the cost of heating, the very uncomfortable high temperature and high humidity, which would lower the transmission, would also allow growing of bacteria.",
        "So, this is not a practical solution, going above 81 degree Fahrenheit.",
        "What about if you limit it to, like, hospital waiting rooms or doctor - patients' offices where you know that these people with the flu are sitting?",
        "I believe that this is still unpractical, even in a sort of high-risk environment, as a waiting room for a physician.",
        "I think this still would not be good.",
        "However, what it tells us scientifically is that, yes, the virus is much less stable at the higher temperature.",
        "And the other side of the coin is that the virus is more stable at low temperature if you go down to 40 degrees and low relative humidity.",
        "And this stability of the virus under those temperature and humidity conditions makes the virus much easier to be transmitted.",
        "That's why we get it in the colder weather?",
        "And that is most likely the reason we get it during colder temperatures, and also it turns out that there is some change in the respiratory tract, the mucus is more viscous, so we are not able to clear viruses and probably bacteria as rapidly as at higher temperature.",

        "OK.",
        "I'm very much aware of this paper.",
        "This is actually Swiss money though, this is a paper when they used Swiss money and they were able to show that, indeed, under those circumstances, virus was stable.",
        "I'm sort of somewhat - firstly, I was told that the Swiss currency is very different paper, very different material from our currencies.",
        "And I'm somewhat - I mean, I'm not refusing to believe it, but I think it is probably less likely that this is a major way of transmitting influenza.",
        "But how long, Dr. Hendley, might cold virus survive on a dollar or paper currency?"

        "Then, they took the chips and the poker - and the cards into another room where there were susceptible volunteers and got them to play with them, and I find surprising, but anyway, they found no transmission by way of the poker chips and the cards that went there.",

        "So, although we focused on the hand/self-inoculation route, the possibility that it spreads through the air always is there.",
        "And as Dr. Palese's told us that - I was going to ask him, as a matter of fact, his speculation as to why influenza was so remarkably seasonal.",
        "And I think he's already given the answer, which is it's presumably that the virus survives in the air better when it's cold than it does when it's warm.",
