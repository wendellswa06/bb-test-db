        "Whereas if you wipe it on - I can imagine even wiping it on a wet cloth as a means of removing the virus, certainly from surfaces you can remove virus - remove rhinovirus very easily with wiping.",

        "At least, some of us want to do that.",
        "So the best, probably, is still vaccination.",

        "Yeah.",

        "Yes.",
        "The avian influenza, the bird flu, is - I always say, is very bad if you're a chicken.",
        "So, this is a very highly lethal, highly pathogenic virus, where up to 70 percent, 80 percent of a flock of chicken, of turkeys can die.",
        "So, it's a very virulent virus.",
        "But in humans, only under certain circumstances, probably high doses can cause disease or can cause death.",
        "In general, this virus is not transmitted from human to human and I think at this particular point, we are really safe from any outbreak of avian influenza.",
        "It is really a bad disease if you're a chicken.",
