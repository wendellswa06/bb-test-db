        "What has baffled you most?",

        "OK.",
        "What's baffled me the most is, even if you kill the virus a little bit, you really don't alter the course of the disease, probably because the inflammatory response, which is what is causing the symptoms that you have, has already begun, and just killing the virus then doesn't make it so you feel better immediately.",
        "That's a little troublesome to me.",
        "All right.",

        "And even though I personally think, you know, that was a just cause that we were fighting, I think, you know, the fact that he was able to opt out was extremely important.",
        "Yet there were other people able to take his place in those circumstances and in health-care situations, sometimes that's not the case.",
        "Well, I mean, I guess I'd have to see the situation where services are just not available whatsoever.",
        "I think that, you know, in a case where you can't provide legal services, then rights of the patient come into play in a much more severe way.",
        "I think that if you have a set of religious or conscientious objectors to certain health-care practices, but you're able to provide the services, it seems obvious to me that you should allow them to opt out.",
        "A pharmacist, for example, of the only pharmacy in town in an isolated community - should that person be required to issue the morning after pill, if that's legal, or to dispense condoms and other birth-control devices, even if that's against their conscience?",
        "Well I think that - you know, for the most part, I'd say, no, they shouldn't be.",
        "I mean, one way I put this is, you know, the greatest ethical dilemma of our age is people doing what the institutions that they are embedded in demand for them to do, and then not being held responsible for their own actions by virtue of the fact that they were, you know, doing what their job description demanded.",
        "Just following orders.",
        "Yes, exactly, and I mean, you know, this really is the source of the most monstrous crimes of the last century.",
        "And so I think we ought to take very seriously people's conscientious - you know, I'm - personally, I'm not pro-life, I'm pro-choice.",
        "But, you know, these conscience causes - I mean, respecting people's conscience means nothing if you only respect it in cases where you agree with its results, you know.",
        "And I think that we ought to bend over backwards to allow people to opt out in this situations as their conscience demands."

        "Alta Charo, let me bring you into the conversation, and I know that you disagree.",
        "Well I disagree with what's been going on in the United States, but I think what we've been discussing so far actually doesn't capture the real debate going on.",
        "Virtually every ethics code of physicians, pharmacists, nurses, physicians' assistants and others says that in a case of a requested service for something that the professional finds morally objectionable, that it is permissible to decline to offer the services provided that an appropriate referral is made so that the patient is not left abandoned.",
        "And to that extent, this compromise has been in place since the mid-1970s.",
        "The controversy in the United States today has been focused on those who do not, in fact, wish to provide an effective referral and therefore are, in fact, hoping to abandon the patient not only by not referring to another physician, often claiming the right to not even inform patients of their legal options.",
        "I'd also note that we are not talking about people - professionals being told to do something against the wishes of the person who's being acted upon at the behest of a government; for example, in the allusion there to World War II and Nazi Germany, where doctors are being told to perform horrendous medical experiments on inmates.",
        "This is, in fact, a decision to refuse the requested service of a patient.",
        "So it's the assertion that one can simply abandon patients and leave them on their own in a system where they often do not have many options, their insurance does not cover going to a different doctor, different hospital, different pharmacy, and simply leave them without an effective way to exercise their own legal options.",
        "Yet you could understand the position of a doctor who says, if I refer you to another doctor who will perform an abortion, I'm participating in a murder.",
        "That's certainly true, but the dilemma here is that there are core functions of the medical profession that cannot be picked and chosen depending upon whether or not you like them.",
        "They are part of the practice of medicine.",
        "Now, reproductive services exist right at that border for many people between the core practice of medicine and those things they view as elective or lifestyle.",
        "So again, this would be a much easier debate if non-physicians, non-nurses, non-pharmacists were able to provide those services, and we had a truly open market.",
        "But state by state, in all 50 states, we specifically limit by law the dispensing of prescription drugs or the prescribing of a drug to these licensed professionals.",
        "And thus, we create essentially a kind of collective monopoly on these services and make them into medical services, and at that point, it's almost like an issue of public accommodation.",
        "You are the sole purveyor of these services and there is, therefore, an obligation to make sure that there is access for the entire public.",
        "A full range of services are available.",
