        "I'm a relatively new nurse, and we got very good training in the beginning on end-of-life issues in pregnancy and anomalies and decisions like this.",

        "Well, I mean, I guess I would encourage almost anyone to try to take as much responsibility for their own actions as they can.",
        "Acting, you know, in the capacity of a health-care provider or a soldier or a professor, let's say, doesn't relieve you of the responsibility for what you actually do.",
        "And if you regard what you are yourself doing as evil, you know, after you go home at night and, you know, and you regard it as part of your job description and that's something you're going to do, you know, all day, every day at your job, I'd say you're in a serious moral difficulty.",

        "Well, yeah, I think that's an interesting problem.",
        "But I can see even that as a legitimate opt out.",
        "Now I would suggest, you know, that pro-choice groups and pro-choice physicians and so on need to organize to make sure the patients can get access to the information they need.",
        "You know, I'm a little leery about this idea that people are trapped, that they can only get a prescription from one pharmacy, that their insurance only covers one doctor and so on.",
        "You know, if that's - to the extent that that's the case, then we need to worry about that.",
        "But, you know, in other words, the people who should be providing these services and the information with regard to these services are people who don't have a fundamental religious or moral difficulty with those services themselves.",
        "And I think the separation of my function from my beliefs and my conscience is truly one of the moral difficulties of our age and should be solved the other way around than it's being right now.",

        "Each time, the health care provider has objected on the basis of personal or religious beliefs.",
        "Our focus today is on the right of conscience versus a patient's right to care.",

        "Alta Charo, I wanted to get back to you.",
        "This issue, for some people, is a very practical issue, one that focuses on their access to the kind of care they say they need.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "For those Americans who are lucky enough to have health insurance, a very substantial percentage of them are enrolled in some kind of managed-care program, which really does quite significantly limit the range of options with regard to which physician, which hospital, which pharmacy they can go to and still get the coverage that they've paid for.",
        "So, we do not have a truly open market.",
        "I think if we were talking about this in the context of store owners, we would be having a very - store owners that are selling clothing, for example, would be having a very different conversation.",
        "In addition, patients do not stand in an equal relationship with the medical profession.",
        "It is an unequal relationship.",
        "This is not a contest of two people with equal moral claims or equal moral entitlements.",
        "The professional has actually taken a certain kind of oath of service.",
        "That's why, for example, if a physician is asked to treat a man who's just battered his wife and to set the broken hand, that the physician knows, once healed is likely to batter that wife again, the physician is expected to nonetheless set the bones.",
        "That is, we do not, as a rule, have the health professions make judgments either about the moral worthiness of their patients or the ends that their patients will put their healthy status toward.",
        "It is a sacrifice on the part of health professionals to take that road.",
        "But in a sense, it's exactly what makes this conversation not one about patient's rights versus health professionals' consciences.",
        "It's not a battle between those two, it's an integration of them, and it's a request that the health professions see within their conscience a higher obligation to serve all the people of the public before they serve their own personal preferences.",
        "Well, nevertheless, I mean, a health-care professional is a human being with the basic ethical obligations of any human being and the basic ethical responsibilities of any human being.",
        "And you don't shove that off.",
        "I mean - now, I think one of the ironies with regard to the abortion debate, is that many of the arguments in favor of abortion rights are arguments about the individual conscientious action of a woman and her right to control her own body.",
        "Now, those, you know, I think those arguments, there's no reason, it seems to me, no principal reason why those arguments shouldn't extend to health-care providers and that if the moral and religious conscience of a woman considering an abortion is the ultimate arbiter of her choice, then the same should be said for the health-care providers.",
        "That, you know, their conscientious take on abortion rights should be the ultimate arbiters of their action, of their participation in these practices.",
        "You know, some people regard abortion as a kind of holocaust.",
        "Now, I don't regard it that way.",
        "But I think that if you regard something as a holocaust, you have a moral obligation not to participate.",
        "And that a measure of the quality of the institutions in which you're embedded are their ability to allow you to make such judgments and respect you for making those judgments.",
        "Now let's - oh, I'm sorry.",
        "Did you want to come back at that, Alta Charo?",
        "If I may and very briefly because I know you have callers.",
        "This discussion is exactly why, since 1973, the compromise has been that professionals need not perform an abortion in particular abortions but nonetheless, needs to refer.",
        "And the reason for that is that the absence of the referral now constitutes an actual obstacle to the patient being able to obtain a service that is, despite the professional's opinion about its morality, nonetheless legal.",
        "If I choose to have an abortion or not, it does not impose my views on any other person.",
        "But here, we're talking about a health professional being able to actually impose his views on a patient by virtue of setting up obstacles, whether it's a non-referral, lack of information in the case of Wisconsin, a pharmacist who actually refused to return the prescription to the patient so she could try to find somebody else who would fill it.",
        "All of those actions, all of those refusals being based on this argument of complicity that goes beyond the mere entitlement to not perform the service oneself.",
        "Now, let's get to some of those callers.",

        "Yes.",

        "I attempted to get on the Michigan Pesticide Notification Registry, which requires a doctor's certificate.",
