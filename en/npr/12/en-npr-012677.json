        "Well, look, what if the institution legally mandates stuff that we all know is repugnant, as many institutions have?",
        "I mean, you know, the argument that laws, for example, supercedes individual conscience has been an utter disaster for our species.",
        "And you know, and also I think a profoundly anti-democratic idea and this is the way you get, you know, a whole society mobilized into a moral disaster.",
        "So, you know, I mean, this is more like - what if they were requiring you to dispense heroin to heroin addicts or something like that, you know, well, I mean...",
        "Eventually, that could come up in the context of people legalizing drugs and if that context did come up, then you would be obligated to do so.",
        "I mean, there are a lot of people that feel that the war on drugs is basically an abomination, that it doesn't work (unintelligible).",

        "You know, if I may - if I will just make one comment here.",
        "I think it's extremely important that we separate the examples in which the health professional is being told by the government to do something against the wishes of a patient, which I think we have often seen abused.",
        "Nazi Germany, your slavery example, whatever, versus a situation which this particular emergency room physician is talking about in which a patient comes in asking for a service and the question is, can the physician stand in the way?",
        "We've already made the compromise, a compromise beyond what this physician caller has suggested, of allowing physicians to simply refer to a colleague next to him, next door, a colleague who'll do it instead.",
        "That has been a compromise that we have lived with for 30 years.",
        "But now, suddenly, the question has become, can a physician not only refuse to provide the service, but actually actively try to stop the patient from being able to access the service?",
        "That really is a very different kind of refusal.",
        "Craig, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Appreciate it.",

        "Hi.",
        "I'm another ER doc with just a little bit of a different comment than the one that you just heard.",
        "I just want to kind of make a nice point for the colleagues I work with.",
        "I see us handle this issue very elegantly.",
        "I have physician colleagues who are willing, for example, to write for the morning after pill - to write a prescription for that.",
        "I've other physician colleagues who feel strongly that they shouldn't do it.",
        "Similarly, I have nursing colleagues who are willing to dispense that prescription or give the prescription to the patient, and I have other nursing colleagues who aren't.",
        "And we've collaborated really well together to take care of patients.",
        "We kind of know where people stand on the issue, and we work together so that we can both serve the patients we're trying to take care of and also kind of live by our own moral standards.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Oh, sure.",
        "You know, I mean, that's a prescription I'm happy to write for, and if one of my colleagues sees a woman who's requesting that pill and he's uncomfortable writing the prescription for some reason, he will find me or vice versa.",
        "Do you encounter the situation that we've also been talking about, where some people decline to refer patients, feeling that that would be participating in a process that they're uncomfortable with?",
        "I haven't and I think - and I've worked both in large metropolitan areas and also in small towns.",
        "And I think it speaks to the goodness of the kind of people who get drawn to this kind of work, that - usually, you know, in my - I guess in my experience across the board, they've tried to find a way to care for the patient.",
        "And I think people who have objections to certain things have felt like their conscience could be clear if they directed the patient to someone who could take care of them.",
        "Annie, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Well, I think that's a pretty good, you know, scenario and I hope it's a typical scenario.",
        "And it speaks well for the atmosphere of the institution itself that's not operating by a set of rigid rules but in terms of collaboration and mutual respect.",
        "I think that's exactly the right kind of approach to this.",
        "And you know, I do see the problem with the referral issue, you know, that's - you know and actually erecting barriers to people obtaining legal services, that is a problem.",
        "Yeah, go ahead.",
        "And we'll give you the last tip in 20 seconds.",
        "Go ahead, please.",
        "Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "I didn't mean to - just but unfortunately, though, there are a number of cases like that and then there's a whole rash of state laws that have been written to specifically allow physicians, pharmacists, ambulance drivers and others to not only not perform, but to not refer, even give information.",
        "So, what we're seeing is state law that is reaching way beyond what most professionals are asking for, which is the chance to just refer, and is now setting up a situation where we really do have a conflict with the patient's needs and rights."
