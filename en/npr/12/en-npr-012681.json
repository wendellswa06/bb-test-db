        "So as this goes on, Steven Pearlstein, the commodification of this debt has spread all throughout the financial system.",
        "Okay.",
        "All throughout, and these packages are not necessarily sold as wholes.",
        "They are actually - some are these CDO packages, some are even on the mortgage-backed securities.",
        "The first of the packages are sliced into what's called tranches.",
        "And I won't go into it, but basically that goes from the least risky tranche to the most risky tranche.",
        "And each tranche gets a different rating from the rating agencies.",
        "And so people who want to take the toxic tranches - those are the most risky - those might go to hedge funds, and the safest ones might go to pension funds.",
        "And so who owns these things now?",
        "Who holds that fellow's mortgage?",
        "Well, a portion of it could be held anywhere - German banks, Australian hedge funds, rich Brazilians wanting to invest, certainly the Middle East bought all of these, the Bank of China, the Central Bank of China might be holding it, who knows?",
        "The fact of the matter is that all along the way, very nice fees were earned by people who basically pass the hot potato along.",
        "And they didn't want to look too carefully because they were collecting fees.",
        "They had no residual interest in how the story turned out.",
        "And this, as turns out, has been the big weakness of what's called the securitization process.",
        "You call it commoditization process.",
        "But this is the big weakness, is - this is a form of moral hazard, which is the person who's making the loan isn't responsible in the long run.",

        "You know, we're spending our money trying to do this and suddenly, I found out that I can't make an offer on our property in the next-door county because I'm retired and everything else is going haywire."

        "And they understand that 90, 95 percent of the mortgages in them might be fine.",
        "But they don't know that and they now know that no one really gave them a good scrubbing, so the response to that is I'll buy none of them.",
        "And as long as this - what's called a secondary market from mortgages has essentially dried up.",
        "And it's not just subprime mortgages, it's all the way up to prime mortgages and jumbo primes.",
        "As long as that secondary market is dried up, that means the bank would have to make the loan or the lender would have to make the loan and hold it.",

        "Well, they could actually go out and borrow money except, guess what?",
        "No one wants to lend them money either.",
        "And so there is a credit crunch in housing.",
        "But here's the thing, it's not just housing anymore.",
        "And it's not just housing because the same lenders who have got in trouble, the same securities holders basically, now, they don't want to buy any asset-backed mortgages because - or any asset-backed securities whether they're backed by credit card debt or receivables debt -they don't want any of it.",
        "And furthermore, many of the lending institutions like banks have decided they need to put more cash in their vault because people are coming in and they're not paying loans and other people are wanting loans, they need more cash.",
        "And so there's a reluctance to lend all through the system, and that's what we call a credit crunch.",
        "And it's basically the same as an old-fashioned bank run, only the bank isn't at the center of it anymore.",
        "What's at the center of it is the securities market where assets are bundled and used as collateral for securities for bonds.",
        "And let me ask you about another thing that Jerry was saying, and that was that, you know, we need to bail this out so we can get the whole thing liquid again and moving again.",
        "But there's a lot of people saying, wait a minute, these companies had bad business practices.",
        "They deserve to be punished, and punishment for these companies going bankrupt, that's how the market gets to correct itself.",
        "That's how it makes changes.",
        "Well, it's two parts to that.",
        "One is that nobody is proposing to bail out anybody who made a bad loan a bad bet.",
        "But what happens in markets like these as I just described is people become irrational, and they don't distinguish the good loans from the bad loans.",
        "They just make no loans and they dump the loans that they have indiscriminately.",
        "And that creates a real crisis because it has this domino effect that we've been talking about.",
        "And if you're the government, you say to yourself, that's going to - if that persists, it's going to cost so much trouble for the economy, so much pain to people who had nothing to do with any of it, who don't need to be punished, who don't deserved to be punished, brings the economy to a session.",
        "That's overkill.",
        "And we have to be a little careful about saying that any time the government does anything to relieve this process, that's it's a bailout.",
        "Nobody, and let me repeat this, nobody has ever at the moment proposed that the people who made bad loans be made whole in any way, shape or form.",
        "So let's just calm down, and really talking about, oh they're going to bail him out like this SNL crisis."
