        "And so if the perception - if there was a perception on the part of people -well, all of a sudden, everyone can afford houses, well, maybe they couldn't.",
        "And now we're coming back to that reality, which is that you can't increase home ownership rate by two, three, four percentage points in a matter of a couple of years without there being a concomitant increase in national income, which there was not - a household income.",

        "And along with all the loans that were being made, there were sub - there were equity loans being made also in the market.",
        "And my question is do subprime loans don't fall under the same category as a mortgage?",
        "Is that correct - those equity loans, I should say.",
        "So what ends up happening from what I understand, just - I'm not extremely well educated man, I'm not an economist, by any means.",
        "But the secondary loans that were made - when the banks - that (unintelligible) was changed so that not the mortgages - the mortgages can be forgiven by bankruptcy.",
        "But the equity loans that people have taken out on these houses and sometimes up to 100 percent of the value of the home, from what I understand, those loans can be called on by the bank and the people who took out those equity loans are now accountable for those loans and they were not forgiven by bankruptcy.",
        "So the people who have these second loans are now accountable for them.",
        "And also, they can have their wages furnished by the banks for those loans.",
        "Is that correct?",
        "Steven Pearlstein, is he got that right?",
        "Well, I'm not a bankruptcy lawyer but I believe that if they signed personally as well as putting the house up as collateral - and many times you have to in a home equity loan, if you sign for it personally - then you may not be able to wipe that out through bankruptcy under the new law.",
        "Now...",
        "So that leaves a whole, probably millions of Americans basically.",
        "And I know this is going to sound kind of big, but it leaves some inter-indentured servitude because now they lost their home that they have to live in, they have to re-rent a home to live in and they also have to pay the banks back the bad loans that they - instead of - in the old days, the banks used to take some responsibility for the loan if it was a good or a bad loan.",
        "So, you know, these are predatory tactics.",
        "So who's coming out ahead are the banks who now hold these people accountable not for the first loan but for the second loan for the rest of their lives, or well into their retirement.",
        "So we're going to have a bankrupted system for not, in my opinion, not for the next three to four years or seven years after the bankruptcy is wiped out, but for the next 20 to 30 years after these people who have signed these huge equity loans on these houses also."

        "Well, right now, Neal, the big focus on the markets is not in mortgages, although that's still a big cloud hanging over the markets but it's - when in the area called commercial paper, which is sort of a short-term loans that lots of companies get to finance their ongoing operations.",
        "And because some of the issuers of commercial paper were mortgage lenders, or people who lent to mortgage lenders, or hedge funds, all of a sudden, the entire market for commercial paper is now in trouble.",

        "Right.",
        "And because so many people are going back to their banks and saying, look, I need to take advantage of that line of credit that you promised me.",
        "The banks need money, and so the banks are having to do two things.",
        "They're having to borrow more money, which is why the fed did what it did the other day.",
        "But what it also means is they're cutting off new lending.",
