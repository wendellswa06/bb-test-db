        "What do - why did this program start?",
        "Well, the inspector general at the Justice Department had done a study of radicalization in prisons that looked at both chaplains, and also found that many of the prisons had no sense of what was in their chapel libraries.",
        "This is where prisoners might go to read and study their religious faiths or learn about other religious faiths.",
        "And the idea was to get a hold of what was in these chapel libraries that prisoners had access to.",
        "So the Bureau of Prisons initially said, let's try to take an inventory, and then when they got to something like 80,000 titles coming in, decided this is overwhelming, this is too much, instead, let's come up with some list of acceptable titles.",
        "So for each of something like 20 religious faiths or religious groups, they said, you can have up to 150 books and 150 audiovisual resources.",
        "And everything that's not on those lists, you chaplains have to remove from your prison libraries.",
        "And the effect of that was, essentially, it stripped a lot of these chapel libraries from almost all their resources because they had a lot of things in their libraries that they had accumulated over the years, donations from churches or things that publishers had sent them or things that prisoners had donated when they left.",
        "But they weren't on the list.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Necessarily titles that were dangerous or problematic, it simply that they didn't show up on the list, so the bureau said, sorry, you have to pull them."
