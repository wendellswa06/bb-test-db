        "Well, it is an alarming idea, a federal agency deciding what text folks can read, even if they're in prison.",
        "Okay, so today, NPR received a statement from the Federal Bureau of Prisons that it has decided to alter its planned course of action.",
        "I'm just going to read one section of it.",
        "It says: The bureau will begin immediately the return to chapel libraries materials that were removed in June 2007 with the exception of any publications that have been found to be inappropriate, such as material that could be radicalizing or insight violence.",
        "Laurie, did that sound like that's going to assuage the critics?",
        "Well, I think it might, because this is what the critics had asked all along.",
        "Why remove everything, why not just make a list of what's problematic?",
        "And what is confusing about this is that the Bureau of Prisons had, in part, done that.",
        "They had already come up with a list of publishers whose material was problematic.",
        "They included both Muslim and Christian resources.",
        "And they said, you can't have anything from those publishers.",
        "Why they then took this next step to say, here is a list of the exclusive books that you may have, nobody understands.",
        "And all kinds of religious organizations - it really united religious organizations across the spectrum, both interfaith and then also politically, who said this is absurd and unnecessary.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Gregory Saathoff, what do you make of this?",
        "Was this a good move by the Bureau of Prisons to do something like this?",
        "Was it necessary in your view, given the research you did on this?",
        "Well, certainly, the Bureau of Prisons has attempted to be responsive to Congress and the Office of the Inspector General.",
        "And in reading the 2004 report and hearing the concerns, I think there was an interest in moving, and it appears perhaps moving too quickly.",
        "I'm not surprised at all that the Bureau of Prisons has modified its position a pretty substantial way.",
        "You know, these issues - I think there certainly is agreement that government does have a legitimate and compelling interest to screen out things that tend to incite violence in prisons.",
        "But the devil is in the details, and I think that operationalizing any approach, particularly one as sensitive as this -involving religions, the First Amendment - this is major issue."

        "Well, let's put that question to Gregory Saathoff who did this report.",
        "In fact, Mr. Saathoff, your report doesn't just single out the possibility of Muslim extremism, you also talk about Christian groups as being potentially dangerous as well.",
        "That's right.",
        "And I think that the decision of the Federal Bureau of Prisons not to focus just on Islam, but to focus on religious texts throughout, really underlines the fact that this was an equal opportunity decision that antagonized numerous religions."

        "I mean, isn't that the primary concern here?",
