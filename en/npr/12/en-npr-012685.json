        "And I think the thing that was concerning to officials is that this was only discovered during a robbery.",
        "One of the perpetrators had dropped a cell phone.",
        "And from that cell phone, then authorities were able to learn about what was going on within the prison in terms of this radicalization recruitment.",
        "So, yes, I agree that prisons are certainly a very surveilled population.",
        "But in terms of being able to allow researchers in the prison to better understand what's going on, it's remarkable how little we know in some ways.",
        "I disagree with that entirely.",
        "Go ahead, Frederick Al-Deen.",
        "Gregory Saathoff, one of the things that your report talks about is a shortage of resources in federal prisons and a shortage specifically of Muslim chaplains like Frederick al-Deen.",

        "Let's go to Joey, Joey with us from San Francisco.",
        "As a chaplain, the - under the leadership of Susan Van Baalen, who I think is still chaplain at the Bureau of Prisons, and other fine chaplains in the bureau, the bureau has been provided with exhaustive information on groups from Wiccan to Native Americans, to Hindus, to whatever you can think of.",
        "And there is this one manual that explains all of this, all of this.",
        "And secondly, the Bureau of Prisons has a resource list of rabbis, Native American shamans, imams, anything they need that if they really had a question about - even the nation of Islam, that if they have a question, all they need to do is pick up the local resource directory and call the local contact.",
        "But there's no doubt that, in fact, that there is (unintelligible) of information is more than a mystery to me than whether or not a person could be radicalized.",

        "So what kind of pressure did you face?",
        "First, it was for - because I'm white, the whites approached me, and they wanted me to join, you know, their Christian identity.",
        "And then the blacks, they wanted me to be Muslim, and then, you know, it's really hard to function there without friends, and you don't really make friends unless you join a - you know what I'm saying?",
        "If you're there a long time, it takes you a long time to, you know, get respect, and, you know, be known for who you are.",
        "You know, lot of people right off the bus, join, you know, some type of religious group, and you don't really realize how extreme it is until you're already neck-deep in it, you know?",
        "Well, Andrew, let me get Frederick Al-Deen, who was a prison chaplain for eight years to respond to you.",
        "How do you respond to that?",
        "That does sound like some pretty intense pressure that Andrew is talking about?",
        "Is that something that you came into contact with and would help your inmates deal with?",
        "Well, as I recall, my experience at Leavenworth Penitentiary when a young Caucasian former member of the Aryan Brotherhood with tattoos, long hair and tattoos all over the body, walked into the chapel and says, Imam, I want to become a Muslim.",

        "There is intense pressure to join groups, but there's also ways that you can avoid that.",
        "And that is typically by immersing yourself in books, exercise routines, making a wide array of social contacts within the prison system, and also making contacts with the correctional staff and let them know if there is a problem that you're encountering, and they'll see to it that if it gets too intense, they'll move you.",
