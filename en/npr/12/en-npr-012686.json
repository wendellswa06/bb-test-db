        "And we advocate for a mandated certification program for anybody, male or female, working in a federal prison, a college or university, or any other public institution where Muslims are - be they prisoners, students or what have you - so that we can, as a community, take more control of our faith and be a better helper, a resource to the government in what we know is a war against the use of force and violence to change people's attitudes and political situations.",
