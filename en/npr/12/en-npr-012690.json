        "Hello there.",
        "I just wanted to say I am big fan of yours for many years.",
        "I can't think of many better to follow Helen Mirren in this role of Helen Mirren.",
        "And I love all your - I say - I don't know if I've seen all of your movies, but I love the diverse roles you've played.",
        "I think you were judicious in the roles that you played.",
        "And I cannot wait for tomorrow night.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",

        "I just wanted to - I had just one comment.",
        "I see Emmy nominations in your future.",
        "And second: what's it like switching from all those roles in the movies and now doing something like the grinds of a network TV?",
        "And I'll hang up to take my call.",
        "Thanks.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "First, I want to say, that was so kind of you, everything that you've just said.",
        "Thank you so much very much.",
        "As I've said, I've never probably been so excited for something to come out.",
        "I never thought I would go back to TV, mostly because, when I had stuck my foot in it before, it just seemed - not very creative.",
        "An actor wasn't really allowed to express him or herself, and I got terribly bored.",
        "And also, my friends who worked in single-lead shows, they worked 12-, 13-, 14-, 15-hour days and never saw their kids.",
        "I have a 10-year-old son, and I work in Haiti part time, and I - so I passed on the project.",
        "And the producers called me in and I said, I can't - I don't want to live like that.",
        "I don't define myself as an actor.",
        "I'm a mother, I'm an activist and I'm actor, and I don't want to give up those other things in my life.",
        "And they said, well, you won't have to.",
        "And they have held true to their promise.",
        "It's been incredibly collaborative and creative.",
        "And I have a life outside of my job.",
        "We thank Donna for the call.",
        "We're talking with Maria Bello, whose new show starts tomorrow night.",

        "Email us: talk@npr.org.",
        "And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, which is coming to you from NPR News.",
        "You mentioned you work in Haiti.",
        "You are in New York, I suspect, not to shoot exteriors, but because you were there at the Clinton Initiative, correct?",
        "I was.",
        "I came for the Clinton Global Initiative.",
        "And I'm honored to say that I was invited to - by President Martelly of Haiti to be part of his advisory council on economic growth and investment in Haiti.",
        "So we just had our first meeting.",
        "Some of the members are ex-President Bill Clinton and Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, and 30 other amazing individuals from around the world: politicians and activists and business people.",
        "So, I was incredibly inspired and hopeful about Haiti this morning."

        "I'm going to echo everything that the woman said before.",
        "I think you're a fantastic actress, and it's always fun to watch you, because I think your characters are really deep and round, and really, you know, you are a beautiful woman and you're smart.",
        "You're the epitome of pretty and smart and yet, you've never let yourself be pigeonholed as just pretty.",
        "How do you - two questions.",
        "One, how do you, sort of, choose the roles you take?",
        "And then secondly, do you find it frustrating that being a celebrity, sort of, almost prevents you from being a stronger voice in your activism, especially when you're coming up against politicians who are, in my humble opinion, much smaller-minded about lot of the topics that some very passionate celebrities apply themselves to?",
        "Oh, that's a very interesting way to say it.",
        "What was the first part of your question?",
        "How you pick your roles, because",
        "Oh, how I pick my roles.",
        "That's right.",
        "somebody like you can get pigeonholed, I imagine, in Hollywood.",
        "And yet, you've managed to find roles that are really, I think, really fascinating.",
        "And that might just be the way you play them.",
        "Well, you know, I - certainly, I don't believe in victimization.",
        "I think that if someone is being pigeonholed, they pigeonholed themselves by taking roles and accepting roles that are, you know, that are only the shell of a woman, for instance.",
        "It's still in a lot of Hollywood big budget films, I noticed, especially going to some with my son, like shoot 'em up films.",
        "Oftentimes, the women have really nothing to do except stand there and look pretty.",
        "And my whole thing is, if an actor decides to do that, fine, you know, but then don't say, well, I'm just cast in the pretty roles.",
        "Also, people say, you know, after 40, there's no roles for women after 40.",
        "And my, you know, my response to that is, well, there are if you're not 40 trying to look 20.",
        "So I do think that is changing.",
        "And I take roles that move me and that are inspiring, I get to work with great people and that I know I can create a fully-formed woman.",
        "And your activism, you hadn't - the second question was the frustration that I imagine you must feel trying to spearhead some of the causes that you're passionate about.",
        "You know, that's true.",
        "There's two sides to that.",
        "For some reason, because I'm a celebrity, I do have a voice.",
        "I can continue and I do continue to keep Haiti in the news, to keep international women issues in the news.",
        "I write about it and I talk about it.",
        "And not only that, but I'm on the ground, I have an organization there called We Advance and working in the poorest community in the Western Hemisphere.",
        "So I really have my finger on the pulse.",
        "And the more I work there, because I've been there for three years, I have a lot of respect from the community and politicians because I'm doing the work on the ground.",
        "So I think I'm in a little bit of a different position.",
        "I think that if you're a celebrity and you're just using your voice but not actually doing the work, or you don't have the background or the facts to back it up, I think that people won't listen and don't respect you, and it totally backfires."

        "But I'm not sure that they triangulate exclusively based on op-ed pages, and certainly the myth that all of the media is left-leaning is simply not true.",
