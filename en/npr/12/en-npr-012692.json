        "But, you know, we can talk about it.",
        "But the point of the conversation wasn't to hear me ramble off the sites slowly in no particular order.",
        "It really was a dialogue with Ofeibea, who's the expert.",
        "So she's got my back.",
        "Now, I also had a conversation this week with Arthur Mutambara.",
        "He heads the Zimbabwean Movement for Democratic Change, or at least one faction of that political party.",
        "His is one of the main parties opposing President Robert Mugabe.",
        "Now, while I enjoyed my talk with Mr. Mutambara, listener Desmond Jolie(ph) writes: Enough of the incessant reports on Zimbabwe.",
        "There are dozens of countries in Africa, lots of them as repressive and ill managed as Zimbabwe.",
        "It's possible that the real reason for the West's disdain and determination regarding Zimbabwe is that he dispossessed whites of their lands.",
        "I do not admire Mugabe, but like Barry Bonds, he seems to be singled out because he displeased white people.",
        "So that again is from Desmond Jolie.",
        "Now, Desmond, first off, we cover many countries in Africa from many perspectives.",
        "Second, I did ask Mutambara about allegations that his party was a front for colonial interest.",
        "Third, we did, and are reaching out to President Robert Mugabe and hopefully we'll get him on the air.",

        "I think it has to be seen in the context of the cooperation - the newfound cooperation between the al-Sadr hierarchy and its Mahdi Army, its militia, on the one hand, and the American troops in Baghdad on the other.",
        "As I'm sure all your listeners know, the American troops with the Iraqi army have been patrolling frequently, every - daily now, in Sadr City recently.",
        "And this is all the result of close negotiations and cooperation between the al-Sadr movement and the Americans.",
        "Yeah.",

        "It was the only time that the al-Sadr movement actually fought against the coalition.",
        "Since then, despite all the fiery rhetoric, the al-Sadr movement has been participating in the constitutional and democratic project in Iraq.",

        "Do you think Mr. Shibani has changed his basic views?",
        "No, I doubt it.",
        "But we also have to remember that these people take -in this movement - really take their leadership very clearly from al-Moqtada al-Sadr himself.",
        "This isn't - Shibani is not a Zarqawi-type.",
        "He's not a true thug and terrorist, conducting anti-civilian violence on his own.",
        "You know, he's a member of a movement that has joined legitimate politics.",
        "It was more of a spectacle and a show, an attempt to appease what I would have hoped that clergy would have been with the president challenging him to support universal health care, challenging him to support a living wage, challenging him not to put more money in the military and less money in caring for the least of these.",
