        "Obviously very controversial - knowing what we know now, would you have authorized the invasion?",

        "In 20-20 hindsight, you would make a different decision.",
        "Yeah, I don't know what that decision would've been.",
        "That's a hypothetical, but the simple fact is mistakes were made.",

        "I sing in 10 different Native American languages.",
        "But why did you decide to take what essentially are, for the most part, on this CD, hits that had already been or songs that had already been established by the band and, to some degree, redo them, give them a new twist?",
        "Well, we set up an independent company, first of all, that enabled me, after a certain time, to re-record some of my songs so that I owned the master recordings.",
        "I had an issue with the major music corporations in that the artist pays for the cost of making the recordings and--but don't get to own those recordings that they've paid for, and that seems patently absurd.",
        "And so I wanted to just make sure that I had, for my own integrity, versions that I was proud of of these songs that I've written.",
        "(Soundbite of music)",
        "But the real reason, the most important reason for me, why I did that, was that I'm now 20 years singing professionally, and my voice is seasoned.",

        "And that's \"\"Holding Back the Years.\"\" When you know that you've hit a song so well the first time out, was there any trepidation in remaking this one?",
        "Yeah, of course, but I think it's better to understand that I've been singing this song throughout the world since 1985, and the song has actually evolved with me.",
        "I've not been doing the identical arrangement from the original hit.",
        "I've really tried to go for something that feels more timeless than just like an '80s arrangement or something that's very fixed in time stylistically."

        "Mick, do you ever look back now, 21 years into the career and some 50 million albums later--are you at all amazed at the success that you've been able to find?",
        "By the success of it, very much.",
        "I was confident that I would be doing this as a profession, because I've been singing since I was four years old and there wasn't really anything else I was ever going to do.",
        "And once I picked up the bug to also write songs at about 16, then, you know, whatever level of success I was going to achieve, this is what I was going to do.",
        "And whether it be singing on a ship, a cruise ship, or singing to thousands of people, this was what I was going to do.",

        "Here in the United States, when the first album was released, you had such a tremendous outpouring of love.",
        "Sometimes when you reach that success, that level of success, the first time out it can be daunting to try to either match that or continue.",
        "Was that anything that you struggled with?",
        "Oh, very much.",
        "I think it was a very difficult time for me to--I'd been thrown into it so fast.",
        "After graduating from university, I was unemployed for four years and I was living in a really bad area of Manchester, and within the space of three or four months, I was famous, you know?",
        "It seemed to go so fast.",
        "And then for it to happen in America--I didn't quite know how to handle it, you know, in a lot of ways.",
        "There is a phenomenon for artists from Europe or, say, artists from America working in Europe, that we tend to go--when we're thinking across the water, we tend to go for the next new thing.",
        "We reach out for something that's brand-new, almost like consumers would, you know, if they marketed something brand-new as more appealing.",
        "It's much harder to do to establish yourself as a regular artist that people don't get bored with.",
        "But also, we've enjoyed a huge success, a much bigger success in Europe than we have in the States, probably principally because we're Europeans, you know?",
        "We're British.",
        "There are many American acts that come over to Europe that are huge here, but just can't get into Europe, you know?",
        "So it's roundabouts and swings, I think, in some ways.",
        "Well, you haven't been doing too badly here, we should note, and the new CD is something for the real music connoisseur to lavish in, in the sense that you have a little bit of everything: the Latin flavor, the classic \"\"A Song for You,\"\" as well as the Simply Red classic, \"\"Holding Back the Years.\"\" It's all here, a new take on it, and it is a great CD.",

        "But I think this haunts the whole Republican Party.",
        "In particular, Hillary, of course, voted for the war, but she's made very clear for a long time she thought it was a mistake.",
        "I found it really somewhat shocking that Republicans who supported the war were suddenly attacking Bush for being uncertain and then, you know, having to do these flip-flops because this question really is important.",
        "Many of the war's staunchest supporters don't want to concede that Obama and other opponents of the war were right because many of them now favor a hyper-interventionist foreign policy.",
        "So we're not done with this question yet.",
        "I think Bush's critics in the Republican Party are going to have to answer some for why, in some cases, they defended the war a few months ago and then jumped on Bush now.",
        "So I think it's a problem for the lot of them.",
        "You know, an issue that's going to haunt Democrats - this issue of economic equality - and this week, President Obama spoke on a panel at the poverty summit held at Georgetown University.",
        "E J, you actually moderated this panel.",
        "And do you see this conversation on poverty actually changing in American politics?",
        "I mean, what did you hear from the president here?",
        "Well, the president was very powerful.",

        "The greatest insult he ever hurled at me was that I was the only person he knew whose eyes lit up at the words panel discussion.",
        "I believe that on both counts.",
        "And they did in this case.",
        "And the president was really walking an interesting line.",
        "On the one hand, he was very insistent that family matters.",
        "And I asked him a very pointed question about criticism he's come under from Ta-Nehisi Coates and other African-Americans for seeming to criticize the African-American community.",
        "He came on really strong, saying, when I speak to African-American young men, I want to be - use my position to say, I was also fatherless, and you can turn your life around.",
        "But he was also very, very insistent on funding programs that are necessary - criticized conservatives for their unwillingness to do so.",
        "There was a very interesting exchange between - a set of exchanges between him and Arthur Brooks of the American Enterprise Institute, who was trying to get conservatives to stop demonizing the poor.",
        "He is defending the safety net, but I don't think there was accord on the level of funding needed for programs."
