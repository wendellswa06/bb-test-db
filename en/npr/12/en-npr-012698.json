        "So our new opioid addiction epidemic is sparing African-American and Latino communities, and it's striking when you look at the data.",
        "Whether you're looking at overdose deaths or emergency room visits for opioid use problems or treatment admissions for opiate addiction, it's very clear that this epidemic is overwhelmingly white.",
        "And it begs the question, why?",
        "I can share with you a theory, and it is a theory that's based on evidence.",
        "Something that we do know is that doctors prescribe narcotics more cautiously to their non-white patients.",
        "It would seem that if the patient is black, the doctor is more concerned about the patient becoming addicted, or maybe they're more concerned about the patient selling their pills, or maybe they are less concerned about pain in that population.",
        "But the black patient is less likely to be prescribed narcotics, and therefore less likely to wind up becoming addicted to the medication.",
        "So what I believe is happening is that racial stereotyping is having a protective effect on non-white populations.",
        "Are doctors acknowledging that they're less likely to prescribe narcotics, pain medication, to black and Latino patients?",
        "I don't think they're aware of it.",

        "Very different.",
        "Why?",
        "What we saw from policymakers, what we got from policymakers was a message that we could potentially arrest our way out of the problem.",
        "What we got was a war on drugs and a crackdown on crime.",
        "What we're seeing now is a very different response now that we've got an addiction epidemic that's disproportionately white.",
        "What we're hearing from policymakers, even conservative Republican politicians when they talk about the opioid crisis, many begin by saying, we can't arrest our way out of this.",
        "We have to see that people who are addicted can access effective treatment.",
        "We didn't hear that during the crack cocaine epidemic.",
        "It's good that we're hearing it now.",
        "It's too bad we didn't hear it then.",
        "If they start thinking that everybody is another Monfort, we'd end up in an armed camp.",
        "This is not how things were supposed to go for South Sudan.",
        "Back in 2011, there was huge hope for this place.",
        "Mostly Christian South Sudan had broken away from the predominantly Arab/Muslim North and became the newest country in the world.",
