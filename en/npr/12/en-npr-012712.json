        "At the Vancouver Olympics yesterday, the men's 500-meter speed skating final had to be delayed for over an hour because of problems with the ice.",
        "After the first half of the race, the ice resurfacing machines left the oval marred by slushy puddles and ridges.",
        "Bad ice, said U.S.",
        "skater Shani Davis before he pulled out from the race.",
        "It took three Olympia resurfacing machines and much consternation before the oval was deemed fit for racing.",

        "Well, Jamie Gibson is here to explain.",
        "He is assistant director of operations at the Verizon Center here in Washington, that's the NHL venue for the Capitals.",
        "And Jamie, more importantly, you have been resurfacing ice for 23 years now, right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay, so you know what you're talking about.",
        "You looked the footage last night, right?",
        "Yes, I was watching.",
        "To me that looked like a pond that I would have skated on when I was growing up: big ripples in the ice.",
        "What do you think happened?",
        "Well, there were a couple of things.",
        "The one that I saw was the ice was actually, we call it, crawling.",
        "The surface tension of water...",
        "Hmm.",
        "...pure water - and you try to use purer water when you're making ice.",
        "The surface tension of water is greater the purer it is.",
        "So, if the ice temperatures run too low, it'll actually pull together and leave wrinkles on the top of the ice.",
        "So, it kind of buckles.",
        "Yeah."

        "Now is that a problem with the resurfacing machine or with the temperature of the oval itself.",

        "Hmm.",
        "So...",
        "Well, let's talk about these resurfacing machines.",
        "We probably know them as Zambonis.",
        "The ones in Vancouver are actually Olympias.",
        "How do they work?",
        "What do they do?",
        "Both machines have a blade that runs across the ice in the conditioner - that's the part that drops down and touches the ice.",
        "They've got wash water to rinse the ice in front of the blade and that gets recycled back into the tank and then they have ice-making water coming out at the back.",
        "And then any ice that's shaved goes through the horizontal conveyer when it's thrown to the vertical conveyer and goes up in the front of the machine.",
        "Would this be an ice-maker's worst nightmare, I mean, this is the most high profile venue...",
        "Pretty bad.",
        "...a very high profile event.",
        "Yeah, pretty bad.",
        "It's a tough one."

        "Even though you might not be in total control of the situation, there's a lot to goes in ice making: the water you use, the building conditions, the outside conditions, it's just - and here's a fine line because what you are basing everything on is the surface temperature of the ice.",
        "Have you had this happen to you, ripples on the ice like what we saw last night?",

        "Yes.",

        "So, with the Olympic committee and dealing with them, it's kind of a different situation.",

        "That's their theory, is that he wielded a great deal of religious mind control over his followers and that his word was equivalent to the word of God.",
        "So if they didn't obey him, they were disobeying God."
