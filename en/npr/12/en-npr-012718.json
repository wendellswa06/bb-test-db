        "There are 11,000 drugs on the market.",
        "Is the FDA really monitoring all of them to see if there is new information that should be noted on a label?",
        "Why isn't the fact that a certain number of people are getting gangrene - why isn't that new information that justifies the manufacturer strengthening the warnings on the label?",

        "End of case.",
        "The risk of gangrene is not new information.",
        "Diana Levine's lawyer, David Frederick, rebutted that answer when he stood to argue.",
        "In the years since the label was approved by the FDA, he said there have been more than 20 amputations in cases involving the IV push method.",
        "Wyeth knew about these, but did not connect the dots, he said, to warn that the IV push method should not be used.",
