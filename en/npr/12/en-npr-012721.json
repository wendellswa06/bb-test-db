        "Well, what the inflation picture shows is a very, very different situation from earlier this year when inflation was at it highest level in a decade, and food prices were soaring to around 20 percent, and there was a lot of worry in the government that ordinary Chinese were not going to be able to afford to eat meat.",
        "Now there have been other figures that came out today.",

        "Now China says the key to growth is consumer spending.",
        "Is this package going to boost consumer spending?",
        "It will certainly have some effect, but China wants to have a consumer economy, and they're still many years away from that.",
        "If you talk to Chinese people, the reason they're unwilling to spend is because they're worried about who's going to pay for their retirement and who's going to pay for their medical bills.",
        "And the government has been working on this for years, but it'll still take a long time before they're ready to open their purses.",
        "And we have to remember that China remains mostly rural and the rural population has an income that's about one-third of folks in the cities.",
        "So even if they wanted to spend the money, they don't really have it.",
        "OK, so how much of this package is actual real spending, and how much of it is what we might call creative accounting?",
