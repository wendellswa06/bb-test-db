        "But, unfortunately, that has not been consistent throughout the country.",
        "From January this year to March, there has been an increase in civilian casualties across Iraq, that is, victims that have been both killed and injured by car bombs and suicide vest.",
        "As the Baghdad security operation has unfolded, it appears that Sunni insurgents and Shiite militiamen have, in many cases, left the capital and focused their operations on other locations in Iraq.",

        "At least 150 people were killed in attacks in the Iraqi capital today, more than 200 others wounded.",
        "It was one of the worst days of violence since the U.S.",

        "The second struck another market not too far away about 15 minutes later, and then a third at another open square just 10 minutes after that.",
        "Now the explosions seemed timed for maximum casualties.",
        "Usually there's a great deal of apprehension after an explosion.",
        "People don't like to get too close because of the fear that another may follow.",
        "Just a couple of days ago three bombs went off at a bus station and as people were tending to those who were wounded, gunmen drove past the scene and sprayed gunfire at everyone.",

        "Yes, that's right.",
        "Shiite militiamen loyal to Moqtada al-Sadr quickly came out in force.",
        "They fired off a series of mortars at a nearby Sunni neighborhood called Azamiya and they struck the Abu Hanifa mosque, which is the Sunnis' most holy shrine in Baghdad.",
        "It's also the last place that Saddam Hussein was seen in public before he was captured in 2003, so for many Sunnis, it's a very, very important shrine.",
        "There were also attacks on the office of the Muslim Scholars Association, which is the most influential Sunni group in the country and which is said to have links with insurgents and has also been very, very critical of the Shiite-dominated government.",

        "Well, it went on for at least three hours until American soldiers, both ground troops and in helicopters came and intervened.",
        "There were ministry workers trapped inside the building.",
        "We understand that the Sunni gunmen who attacked used rocket propelled grenades.",
        "They even struck the building with mortars and they set up checkpoints around the area to block off access for Iraqi police who were trying to come in and help the people who were trapped inside the building.",
        "Do you have any idea what the Sunni gunmen were hoping to achieve with that specific attack on the Health Ministry?",
        "Well, the Health Ministry is run by a man who's connected politically with Moqtada al-Sadr.",
        "And it's also located in the middle of a Sunni area and many Sunnis who live nearby just to get home have to go through a lot of the checkpoints that the militia protecting this building have set up.",
        "And for a lot of the Sunnis, passing through these checkpoints is tantamount to a death sentence.",

        "So it could have been a strategy on the part of these Sunni gunmen to take over the building, take over the area and establish a corridor for Sunnis living in that area to not have to go through these checkpoints.",
