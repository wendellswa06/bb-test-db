        "And that has saved us money, which we in turn have then reinvested in our programs.",
        "It's estimated Vanderbilt has saved hundreds of thousands of dollars by streamlining athletic finances and, as Gee says, the school has reinvested the money by upgrading the baseball stadium and renovating basketball locker rooms.",
        "According to Vanderbilt officials, the other main aspect of restructuring has been successful as well: integrating athletes into the regular flow of campus life."
