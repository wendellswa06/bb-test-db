        "And not - I don't remember kindnesses specifically to me, but there were times when he would come in when he was not drunk, and he was not in a mood.",
        "And the house would be a lot lighter than it would otherwise be.",
        "He would be - he would be very fun to be around.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I remember probably the last major fight that, you know, went on in the house was the one where he - it's detailed in the book - the one where he pulled a gun for the second time - a rifle for the second time, and where I wound up with a cut across my face.",
        "And I remember jumping on his back and pounding the side of his head.",
        "And I really wanted to, you know, at that point, I really wanted to take him out.",

        "So how did you heal those wounds when you became a father and were you afraid to be a father?",
        "I think I was afraid to be a father, but the thing is that I was a father before I had a choice in the matter, really.",
        "I fell in love with a woman who already had two kids.",
        "As for healing, I think writing the book was my way of healing, to tell you the truth.",
        "I don't even think that I'd realized that there was something that needed to be healed until I got into writing the book and dealt with a lot of these men and their unresolved feelings towards their father and the realization that I had a lot of those same feelings and needed to do something about it, or else see it carried forward into the next generation, which I did not want to do.",

        "And yet, the fact that his father - I believe his father was abusive, if I'm recalling the story correctly.",
        "And, you know, the life that he had lived with his father just sort of sent him on this downward spiral of drugs and of misdeeds.",
        "And he had wound up abusing the woman who he said was, you know, life and breath to him.",
        "And he was in recovery when we met and was trying to salvage his life.",

        "And, you know, we sort of left the interview there.",
        "And then, at the end, as I'm walking out, he says - he whispers almost to himself - even now, I want his approval, even now.",
        "And it's sort of like, you get this sense of, you know, of how he has lied to himself about this so much and for so long that I don't think even he realized how much he was hurt by the fact that his father had not been there for him.",

        "It's, you know, from racism in the society.",
        "But then I think what's happened is that we, you know, our families have sort of mutated in response to this to where it has become the norm that dad is not home; it's not an exception.",
        "What's an exception, what's \"\"weird,\"\" and several people in the book reference this, is when dad is home.",
