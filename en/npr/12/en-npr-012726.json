        "He's the superintendent of the district there.",
        "Mr. Thweatt, this is a pretty extraordinary step to take.",
        "Why let teachers and staff members carry guns?",
        "Well, Alex, it's kind of a half truth, at least on this particular case.",
        "We're not exactly doing that.",
        "It is a concealed handgun policy.",
        "When looking at school shootings that we've been looking at across the nation, considering especially after - starting with Columbine, after the gun-free zones were established.",
        "This is where we're starting to see gun shootings, and we're concerned about our school's safety.",
        "Now, we're in the middle of nowhere, obviously, but we are next to U.S.",
        "287, a very busy highway, and we're concerned about that because, you know, there are a lot of people passing through.",
        "We have gone to extremes with security measures such as key entry, no - keyless entry, magnetic locks and cameras.",
        "But when we started looking at possibly someone coming into our school, we looked at the Pennsylvania shooting and realized that there was a problem there, that that was a known entity that came in.",
        "I believe it was a milk delivery man who came into that particular shooting in the Amish.",
        "The other one that was disturbing was the recent one with the Virginia Tech, within the last year and a half.",
        "And that was disturbing because they basically went in to some kind of lock-down, where they closed doors and got into classrooms and, you know, kind of bunkered down.",
        "But that wasn't good enough because he came into the rooms and began shooting them in there.",
        "And that was a concern to us because if someone gets into our school, what are we going to do?",
        "We are 30 minutes from law enforcement.",
        "Now many people who live in - and listeners who are probably living in cities, and they are not that far from law enforcement, but we were.",
        "This is a sleepy little place out in the middle of nowhere.",
        "As I understand the policy, in order to have a concealed weapon at school, teachers must have a Texas license to carry a gun.",
        "What other requirements will they need to meet?",
        "OK.",
        "Now, yeah, just because they have a concealed license doesn't mean they can bring it on public - on school property.",
        "They must be approved by the school board individually, and then they must undergo training, and that training is extensive.",
        "This is something that - along the lines of police officer training.",
        "So really, what we're doing, we're not doing anything really any different than they're doing in many of our schools across the nation."
