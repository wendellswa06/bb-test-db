        "But see, sometimes what the guitar gives you, the player, back can be often different from what is actually happening, you know, 10, 20, 30 rows away, so it's important to me that it's the guitar that sounds best, you know, at least in my hands, for the audience.",

        "He and I have each prepared, like, a few snippets of pieces, and you wanna play something quickly and right away pick up the next guitar so you get the comparison, you know, side-by-side.",
        "So...",
        "So you're gonna have guitar A and guitar B...",
        "I've got 'em on either side of me.",

        "Uh huh.",
        "...and he's gonna play each of 'em, and you're gonna stand out in the pews and listen?",

        "I'll sit close.",
        "I'll sit to the side, and then I'm gonna do the same.",
        "You know, just, I'm gonna do the same because we're gonna achieve two things here by even recording the process so that for, you know, just, we can hear how the guitar record in front of a microphone and compare it to the guitar I was playing before and made recordings on before."
