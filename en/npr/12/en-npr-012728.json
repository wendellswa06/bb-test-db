        "What's that?",
        "The ease of the playability of guitar B, it comes through musically.",
        "Yeah, because I feel like I can do more things.",
        "I hear very, very little production noise, either from the right hand, and only from the left hand in one little passage do I hear you actually moving around the guitar so much, which we've worked so hard to eliminate in recording, but it just doesn't exist here.",
        "Vieaux likes what he hears and describes the distinct characteristics he values in each guitar.",
        "A is precise, translucent, bright, refined.",
        "It's very elegant, incredibly elegant guitar.",
        "B is warm, not only warm, but just, it's more exuberant.",
        "I think both guitars have like character and each have their own sort of personality.",
        "B is to A like, you know, the Odd Couple?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oscar is like B and Felix is the neat one, right, the clean one, right?",
        "And that's A.",

        "You know, B is like, you know, a little bit more lusty and there's something, you know, about that, I suppose.",
        "Jason Vieaux says sure, one guitar might sound a little better for baroque, another for Spanish compositions, but he's going to travel with just one instrument, that's why he wants a versatile guitar, one that he can use for performances and recording.",
        "His next CD will be a collection of Bach lute suites.",
        "It will be recorded right here in Cleveland's St. Stanislaus church.",
        "His producer and engineer will set up in the middle of the night when the streets of this working class neighborhood are quiet.",

        "So he doesn't have to work so hard on the lower strings.",
        "It's very clear with this guitar A, although you hear the occasional flat buzz again, so hopefully with B it will be as clear without any buzzing.",
        "That's like Hill Street Blues.",

        "A is beautiful in it's own way, but there's a mellowness, there's a relaxation that I feel when I hear B, which, we want the listeners.",

        "I think it's meant to be uniform and even.",
        "Evenness is the calling card of that guitar, whereas B, you know, it sounds like other things.",

        "You know?",
        "Well, I would conclude for the Bach lute suites recordings in late summer that you start practicing with B all the time.",
