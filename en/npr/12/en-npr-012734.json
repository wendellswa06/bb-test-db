        "All in one.",
        "When you look at this picture, I'm going to describe it.",
        "It is - all these different angles on a person who has all these different colors, two mouths and one part has what looks like hair, the other part doesn't.",
        "And what does that mean to you?",
        "Well, it expresses that no matter who we are, what we look like, we shall all still maybe get along, have each other's back, no matter what.",
        "And it's a good thing that if that happens, it'll be a great thing.",
        "Do you think it is happening in New Orleans?",
        "Well, yes, even closer to happening.",
        "Now, you see more people hanging out with each other, standing up for each other.",
        "So, even if you have this (unintelligible), we all have each other's back or even around the world, it'll be great.",
        "Laura, what's the most poignant moment that you had while filming the documentary?",
        "Something that made it on camera or something that didn't make it on camera?",
        "There were a lot of moments that were very poignant, that the kids just kind of opened up, one little girl, Destiny, when she started talking about her experience at the Superdome.",
        "And she started drawing, and it was like this floodgate opened, and she couldn't stop talking, and drawing, and talking about this man, he was shot and then this happened, and then this happened, and this.",
        "She was crying and it was unbelievable, like a volcano of words and drawings.",

        "Yes.",
        "We really wanted this to be a portrait of New Orleans and all the different facets of New Orleans, and that's why Ericka's drawing was so extraordinary because it really represents the film, because we did - we wanted to have kids from all different walks of life, privileged, underprivileged, and everybody in between.",
        "And we tried to have the demographic kind of reflect the demographic of New Orleans, because it affected everybody, but obviously to very different degrees.",
        "And that's part of the story too, the similarities and the differences.",
        "We look at what President Bush did with the steroids in baseball, and he threw his weight around with that and actually, you know, got Congress and went on involved with baseball.",
        "So I actually think he could do it with college football and do something with a playoff system, but I just think with the timing of them signing that new contract, I don't think it will work right now.",
        "But if he gets elected eight years and Michelle does, maybe we possibly can.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "All right.",
        "Well, Barack Obama might be the next leader of the free world, but this is, as you say, Kevin Figgers, college football.",
        "That will be a real test.",

        "So, moving on, fellas.",
        "It seems like every week a sports figure says something that gets him in hot water.",
        "Last week, Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donavon McNabb did not know that a pro football game could end in a tie.",
        "That's after his team tied with the Cincinnati Bengals 13-13 on Sunday.",
        "Took a lot of flak for that, but apparently a lot of guys in the NFL don't know the overtime rule, either.",
        "So the question, Kevin, is shouldn't the quarterback, the team leader, know better?",
        "You would think so, especially a veteran like Donavon McNabb who's been in the league for, I believe, what, 11 years now?",
        "Yeah.",
        "So he should definitely know what the rules are.",
        "And you know, the - he's been in the league a long time.",
        "He's a veteran.",
        "He's played against a team that - in the post-season against Michael Vick, a Falcons team that actually went into an overtime game.",
        "So when you know that a team was 9-6-1 that you played in the post-season before, you have to know what the rules of the game are.",
        "I realize these guys are athletes and a lot of them really don't pay a lot of attention to external things like that.",
        "They're so focused on the game they're trying to win that they don't really recognize all of the rules.",
        "So I can kind of see that, but in a certain way, if you're the team leader, you need to know what situations your team needs to be in in order to win or to prevent overtime or to prevent a tie."

        "Now, in his defense, Carron, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Rothlesberger says he thinks about half the guys in the league also don't know the rule.",
        "But McNabb, who's already under fire for Philly's 5-4-1 record, which is dead last in the NFC East, didn't help his popularity with such an uninformed comment, especially coming from him.",
        "Is he headed out the door now in Philly?",
        "I believe he is.",
        "Ben Rothersberger took up for him, but like he said, 50 percent of the guys in the league - but 50 percent of the guys in the league aren't the face of their franchise like Donavan is.",

        "So I mean, he goes to a situation where they run the football, they play great defense, all he's asked to do is to manage the game, but then when he's actually put in the situation where he had to win the game last week, he did that with three touchdown passes in the second half.",

        "I mean, he got fined $50,000 for two low hits on the Texas quarterback, Matt Schaub.",
        "Yeah, but the thing is, I'm seeing all fines lately with these hits, and it's football.",
