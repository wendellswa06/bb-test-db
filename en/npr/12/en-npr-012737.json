        "And the punch line from the study was that a physician's weight, or their BMI, appears to impact obesity care.",
        "So if you're a normal-weight doctor, you're more likely to provide recommended obesity care and feel comfortable doing so, as compared to an overweight or obese physician.",

        "You have more confidence in providing diet and exercise counseling.",

        "And were you surprised by this?",
        "I was very surprised.",
        "So, you know, the background to this is we had done a bunch of work where we had looked at, you know, why is it that obese patients are not getting good care when they go to the doctor.",
        "And I was at the dentist one day, and I'm looking at my dentist, and he's got terrible teeth.",
        "And I'm thinking to myself: How can you care for my teeth if you can't care for your own teeth?",
        "And so I started thinking about this issue as related to weight, and I thought, well, could it be that a physician's body weight has an impact on how they care for their patients?",
        "And so I thought that there might be some effect of physician BMI and how they care for their patients.",
        "I did not expect the effect to be as large as we found.",
        "Doesn't it make a degree of sense that a doctor who's overweight or obese might have a problem making this argument to patients?",
        "It makes perfect sense.",
        "So I think from both a personal respect, the physicians themselves who are overweight or obese could be embarrassed to be giving advice to patients.",
        "And I think also, you know, statistically speaking, 60 percent of the population is overweight or obese, and about half of doctors are overweight or obese.",
        "So if a heavy patient walks into a doctor's office and that patient looks like the doctor, the doctor may not see them as actually having a weight problem, and so they may not actually be diagnosing it.",
        "And as we heard from the doctor earlier on the phone call, a lot of patients' charts don't actually have BMI or body mass index included, so it may not be a red flag to doctors to say this particular patient has a weight problem.",
