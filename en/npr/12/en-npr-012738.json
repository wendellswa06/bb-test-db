        "And if they're not ready, you can read the riot act until they're blue in the face, and nothing is going to happen.",
        "So you have to work individually with each patient to see where they are, as - and how much work they're willing to put in to change these lifestyle issues.",

        "So, in other words, to qualify for these reimbursements, they would not take patients who were obese?",

        "So as a medical system, we have to adjust to the reality of having a lot of obese patients.",
        "And I think some of the people who feel not welcome in physicians' offices is not just because the doctor says I don't want to treat obese patients or I don't want to have to deal with it, but also the environment itself is not welcoming.",

        "I mean, these Preventive Services Task Force recommendations recommend a 12-week intensive program.",
        "So I think it's more of a call to change what we're doing and expand the primary care team and have more targeted resources, more evidence-based, effective resources, and particularly doing it in groups and moving away from this Marcus Welby model where it's all one-on-one and we're having the same conversation over and over.",

        "And that's been a really helpful story to have for patients, to tell them, yes, you can do this and use it as an example and just to try to break it down for patients into little steps.",
        "And like the study showed, if you can be a positive role model for your patients, they're more likely to believe you.",

        "Perhaps it's time you did.",
        "I think she's dead-on, and I appreciate her blunt and accurate observation.",
