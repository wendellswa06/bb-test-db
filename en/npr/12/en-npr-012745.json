        "We can't blame all this on one poor Texas schoolteacher, this is all of America.",
        "And Johnson, at the same time, as much as he loathed King politically, for not being loyal on the Vietnam War, understood why he was doing it.",
        "And you never hear any nasty language.",
        "So I think the fact that you are dealing with icons, the sad thing for history is that it lends itself to myth and conspiracy and makes it harder to sort out the history which is why I think the sixties have been this big bugaboo for people ever since.",
        "It's interesting as I read, and tell me if I'm wrong here, but the perception, and one might think that this is a ludicrous statement out front, but one could even sometimes look at King and feel that he's underappreciated by virtue of the idea of really sticking to the message of nonviolence, and as you say, sticking to the idea of merit versus allowing personalities to come in.",
        "Oft times we don't look at this side of it.",
        "I agree, Ed.",
        "And I think it was a big surprise to me how much he emphasized nonviolence almost as a drumbeat toward the end of his career when nobody was paying attention.",
        "He kept saying nonviolence is leadership for all of America, he predicted it was gonna liberate the White South and it was gonna be, when people really struggle about what equal citizenship means, its gonna have benefits far beyond eliminating terror, it turn the poor South into the sunbelts and it de-stigmatized Southern politicians so they could run for President and run both political parties.",
        "And it spread all around the world.",
        "In South Africa and the Berlin Wall, you have the inspiration of nonviolence as a democratizing force, so, and yet we tend to pigeonhole him as a leader just for black people, so I do think King is vastly underappreciated as a historical force.",
        "I call him a modern founding father.",
        "Let me ask you this, and here's an interesting point.",
        "When you think of King in the latter days, again, speaking out, sometimes as a lone voice against the war, particularly in Black America for one who had a pulpit, there are going to be some who love the conspiracy theory, who simply suggest that he overstepped his boundaries and the reason that King did not live is because he stepped outside of his bailiwick, if you will, the idea of taking on the war.",

        "You talk so much about whether or not he was truly consumed in the last days with the thought of dying, being killed, etc. I have heard both stories, that, in fact it was so true to him that in that last speech in Memphis he said, I may not get there with you.",
        "There are others who say that he said that before, that it was kind of dramatic license for him to allow the point to get across.",

        "The drum major instinct sermon, where he preached his own funeral, was only a month before.",
        "So that was constant, that he felt these threats.",
        "But what was new was that he felt that the movement itself had lost the ear of the American people and that the poor people's campaign might not succeed and he talked about it as possibly our last movement, that he might be killed while people aren't really paying attention to him the way they had paid attention to the movement at Selma when he was right at front and center.",
        "In that sense, saying I may not get there with you, he didn't think that the movement itself was gonna be fully realized.",

        "The bubble mindset here was infectious, but it didn't affect everyone.",
        "I think that's one of the hardest challenges, it's one reason I didn't call this a biography, I called it a history of America in the King years, because I don't want the burden of having to explain every heartbeat.",
        "Nevertheless, it seems to me that he valued truth above all else and that what you have to do here, particularly when it became an issue in the movement and he's having meetings with all of his staff, what am I gonna do about this, they're trying to blackmail the movement, the stakes are too high, I've gotta change my behavior.",
        "He felt that he was taking great effort, some people said, overboard, to reject money.",
        "And to reject disloyalty, anything to the idea of nonviolence.",
        "And to be pure in every respect.",
        "But he could never give up the straying on the road.",
        "And he called that a failure.",
