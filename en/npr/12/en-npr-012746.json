        "I think that it's very difficult.",
        "It's the hardest part of my challenge.",
        "Particularly because it's a historical fact that people have always tried to dodge the challenge of what he had to say.",
        "You very rarely hear people say, gosh, that's really amazing.",
        "And since you're a flawed human being, I can be even a better example.",
        "You don't hear that.",
        "And I'm afraid that his personal life is the latest example of the way people dodge his message.",
        "And it's hard.",
        "You don't see people saying, well, gosh, we need to tear down thee Jefferson Memorial because Thomas Jefferson had children by a slave.",
        "It is an obstacle, there's no question.",
        "Because people are afraid or contemptuous of Dr. King, they will seize upon things to bring down his image.",
        "But, I, nevertheless, I think that in the long run of history we will deal with him as an historical figure and that King really is a modern founding father in the sense that he is doing just what they did.",
        "Confronting systems of oppression and converting them into fellow citizenships.",
        "That's just what Madison and Jefferson did and that's just what King did, and in that sense, that historical role will grow in appreciation in the long run.",
        "You've lived with this for a quarter century.",
        "Yes, sir.",
        "When you look at the idea of King as a martyr, and he did become that.",
        "Do you believe that that ultimately helped the civil rights movement?",
        "I think that it stunned people to remember what he really stood for.",
        "He had really faded out of the front of people's consciousness, quite frankly.",
        "And so I think that it did stun people and say, this was a man with a message and it touched us deeply and froze that moment, but, you know, we're still battling over what that means.",
        "And I think that's why his image, on the one hand, we wanna pat him on the head and say you did really good and let's be nice to black people on King day, and on the other hand you've got people like me coming around and saying this is a founding father with lessons for everywhere including Iraq when we're trying to extend democracy around the world.",
        "He's saying the heart of democracy is nonviolence and our movement lifted the whole country in ways we take for granted.",

        "OK.",
        "There's quite a list of accusers.",
        "It's gotten longer even in the last day.",
        "So what's an evangelical case for sticking with Roy Moore?",
        "Well, first, I don't hold that evangelical case for sticking with Roy Moore.",
        "I think the accusers are credible and The Washington Post is a credible source.",
        "But I do think for some, they have kind of tuned out from what they call the mainstream media and they therefore don't believe the accusations in many, many cases.",
        "And therefore they have maybe hardened their support in some ways, some saying they've known Moore for decades, and therefore I think they're saying, no, we just don't believe the accusations, we're going to stick with him anyway.",
        "Hold on a second here.",
        "Because to say, I don't believe the mainstream media, this is actually people from Alabama talking, and you can go online and watch the video of many of them talking yourselves.",
        "So to say the media is doing this...",
        "Well, no question, which is, again, why I said, as I start with, I believe these allegations are credible.",
        "I believe Roy Moore should step down for the good of his party.",
        "But more important for me, for the damage he's causing to the reputation of Evangelicals.",
        "But I think for many people, their views hardened.",
        "We saw the same thing when there were credible accusations against President Clinton.",
        "Their views hardened, and people - those core supporters hardened in their views.",
        "I think that's unhelpful.",
        "I think ultimately we need to believe people.",

        "To whom do we need to go?",
        "We need to go to the authorities and more.",
        "I think Christians need to act like Jesus in the midst of this, show mercy, be focused on the hurting and help them through the pain.",
        "And I think that the opposite reaction has happened for many people in Alabama and elsewhere.",
        "This must be tricky because if you're evangelical, of course, you believe we're all sinners, that everybody makes mistakes to say the least, and that you try to forgive them when you can.",
        "But it is interesting to note surveys that evangelicals in particular have been much more forgiving, according to surveys, of politicians who commit indiscretions, including those who don't even apologize.",
        "I mean, President Trump comes to mind.",
        "(as Sherlock Holmes) How so?",

        "The payment was $750, I think, and the very first payment we sent in 10 extra dollars.",
        "And they sent it back because we had to pay at least a whole month's principle, and that was $15 or something - I forget the exact number, but it was more than we'd sent in.",
        "Every month, they sent in a little extra.",
        "They're Mormon and say their faith guided them to be fiscally responsible.",
        "Sure, they got calls from mortgage brokers who were eager to help them turn their home into an ATM.",
        "But they resisted.",
        "They weren't even tempted.",
        "I'd hear the commercials on the radio about OK, this is the ultimate refinance.",
        "And then three months later, the same company and the same radio host was, this is the ultimate final refinance.",
        "And you know that things just can't keep going like they're going without something happening.",
        "You think, this is crazy.",
        "This is insane.",
