        "Why would so many evangelicals change their views for apparent partisan political gain?",
        "Well, and I think that's the question I'd like to ask.",

        "And, like, it's actually a year old, and when it first came out.",
        "But I think ultimately the intervening variable between there was President Trump.",
        "And when 81 percent of white evangelicals supported President Trump, I think they needed to recalibrate their ethical stands to do so.",
        "I think that was an unhelpful, even sinful recalibration.",
        "I'm not saying that every person who voted for President Trump is sinful or has made the decision, but I am saying that to change your views on morality in order to support a candidate is deeply troubling.",
