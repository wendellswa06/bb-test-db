        "(unintelligible) And it's almost like trying to cope with somebody that's passed away in - or has been killed in a road accident.",
        "But the biggest thing which I had to deal with was the fact that your whole life is mapped out in front of you, of what you're going to do for the last sort of, like, 20 years of your life.",
        "And then instantly, your life is changed a thousand percent and all the planning which you've had has completely disappeared.",

        "And at Christmastime, it's even worse - that when you go home, there's nobody there and there's not the smells - the woman that you loved is no longer there.",
        "And it does take an enormous effort to actually progress from that period of grieving and to say to yourself, I have to get my life back in order and make the next step to continue life - your life and go and meet people.",
        "I'm so sorry for your loss and for the loss of anyone who's listening who has experienced such a loss.",

        "I do know that - my husband told me that it was a sign of love when one partner was able to go on after losing another, that it meant that the relationship was really good and that you needed someone else in your life because you had had something good.",
        "And he had said that to me when he wasn't sick and nobody was thinking about dying.",
        "And I rather believe that's true, that it's a compliment to your spouse when you are able to remake your life.",
        "I know that my husband felt that way as a psychoanalyst, as a husband.",
        "I believe it, too.",
        "Yeah, the - at Christmastimes and major holidays, it is extremely difficult when you know that people are inviting you to go to places and there's a little bit at the back of your mind that the invite is a sympathy invite.",
        "And you feel really uncomfortable because people do not know how to speak to you about the loss.",
        "There's lots of people who say to you that you that they know exactly what you're going through.",
        "But nobody who has ever been through that experience actually knows.",
        "That's true.",
        "I have found that when I mention Herman or Herman's name in company, it relaxes everybody.",
        "And they respond better to me.",
        "I say, Herman would have loved this beef stew you made.",
        "They suddenly are able to say something about Herman and they feel better.",

        "It's the - if we can't talk about it, then it becomes much more of a problem.",
        "Yet - I don't mean to interrupt - but there was a point in which one of your friends said, boy, I'm glad I'm not in your shoes.",

        "On the other hand, realistically speaking, there's no reason why she shouldn't be glad that she's not in my shoes.",
        "And I just have to accept it.",
