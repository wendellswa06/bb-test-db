        "OK, Pete, thanks.",
        "I believe the question is, has my voice changed since I wrote the book or is my writer's voice different from my personal voice?",
        "And the answer is probably yes to both of those questions because a writer's voice is somewhat like a river or a stream.",
        "It moves on and you catch it where you catch it.",
        "There's not a lot of thought going into it.",
        "It just is what it is at the moment that you take - dip your glass into this river and you pull up the water.",
        "So, I'm sure that my voice has changed and some of my feelings have changed.",
        "When I read the book now or I look at a passage, if somebody asks me to read a passage out loud, I'm concentrating on small matters, like I should have cut that word out.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I used that word a paragraph before.",
        "How did I miss that?",
        "I'm noticing that I could've cut something here or there.",
        "So, I don't have - I can't read this book objectively now, though I think it still reflects what I felt, reflects what I still feel and is a true account of the experience as that river was running at the time that I was writing it.",
        "Upon rewriting - and that's a process every writer goes through - did you find yourself looking at yourself - this person you're writing about - essentially as a character?",
        "Yes, of course, because you have to have some distance.",
        "For instance, you quoted before the fact that I listed my husband's faults.",
        "At a certain moment I thought, I better be careful.",
        "I'm idealizing him.",
        "That's not right.",
        "I know better than that.",
        "I better look at what was wrong.",
        "And you know, I was catching flaws that might've happened - I'm sure I didn't catch all of them, but I caught what I could by second guessing and reading again and looking at things that I should've said that I probably didn't say.",
        "Here's an email from Sharon in Wichita, Kansas.",
        "This coming March, it'll be five years since my husband died of ALS - Lou Gherig's disease.",
        "That first year after his death - his birthday, holidays - I would find myself angry and out of sorts.",
        "Some good friends said this was to be expected and that I was on schedule to realize this, too, would pass.",
        "I even was able to realize what was going on, and that was a comfort.",
        "It took me four and a half years to quit sitting and staring and starting to volunteer.",
        "And I find that so important to me.",
        "The best to you always.",
        "And I say this in knowledge, that you have a birthday coming up in a couple of days.",
        "Yes, I do.",
        "I'm going to be 73.",
        "I can hardly believe it.",
        "It's almost three quarters of a century.",
        "And it's going to be hard to have that birthday without Herman, but I also have grandchildren and friends and plans for the next year.",
        "And I intend to go on living as long as possible, as long as I can enjoy it.",
        "Happy birthday."

        "But when given across millions of children across large segments of the population, which they are, rare serious adverse events can occur.",

        "Well, when these products were originally licensed, they were tested and found to be effective in adults but were never appropriately tested in children.",
        "And so at that time, the standard was for the Food and Drug Administration to simply divide the dosage in adults by 70 - say that that was the appropriate dose per kilo for a child.",
        "The problem with that is that children often metabolize or process drugs very, very differently than adults.",
