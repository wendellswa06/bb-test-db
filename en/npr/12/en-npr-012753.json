        "Alex Wellerstein is a historian at the Stevens Institute of Technology.",
        "He's devoted his career to studying nuclear weapons and the decision to use them.",
        "He says that spring, the military convened a target committee, a mix of officers and scientists.",
        "The minutes of this committee were declassified years ago.",
        "And they show it considered some far less deadly options.",
        "Their list included a remote military installation and Tokyo Bay, where it would have been detonated as a demonstration.",
        "But the target committee decided those options wouldn't show the world the power of this new bomb.",
        "They want people to understand that this is something different.",
        "And so picking a place that will showcase how different this is is very important.",
        "One reason was the committee wanted to scare the Japanese into unconditional surrender.",
        "But Wellerstein says the researchers choosing the target had an added motivation.",
        "The atomic bomb was top secret.",
        "But they were working on an even more frightening secret, a super bomb just a few years away, the hydrogen bomb.",
        "They feared H-bombs could destroy the world.",
        "Physicist Edward Teller wasn't on the committee, but a letter he wrote sums up the anxiety of the bomb builders.",
        "The situation that you've described - how does this conflict compare to other conflict zones that you've worked in, in your career?",
        "(Reading) Our only hope is in getting the facts of our results before the people.",
        "This might help to convince everybody that the next war would be fatal.",
        "For this purpose, actual combat use might even be the best thing.",
        "The target committee decided the A-bomb had to kill - and not just kill.",
        "It had to do something biblical.",
        "One bomb from one plane would wipe an entire city off the map.",
        "It would be horrible.",
        "But they wanted it to be horrible, to end the war and to try and stop the future use of nuclear bombs.",
        "If you thought that you could make it so that war was impossible, how far would you go?",
        "What would you do to get that result?",
        "They chose Hiroshima.",
        "It's just about the right size for the size of the bombs they're expecting to use.",
        "And there's also these nearby mountains that might help focus the blast wave in on the city.",
        "And as they put it, a large fraction of the city may be destroyed.",
        "Seventy years ago today, President Harry Truman made the announcement."

        "How much is riding on Monday night's Iowa caucuses, especially for those three candidates?",
        "Not much (laughter).",
        "You know, it'll winnow the field, but Iowa's become more polarized and more unrepresentative.",
        "So I'm - I'm a believer this thing is going to go on till April, May.",
        "And so, you know, this'll be a chapter.",

        "I think it'll be five.",
        "Just out of 11, you can't cull that much.",
        "If you look at the polls, I'm wildly over-interpreting the last three days - three or four days of polls.",
        "But Trump and Cruz have been sinking, and Cruz really got hit, I thought, in the debate.",
        "And Rubio and some of the others have been rising.",
        "Even Ben Carson has been rising.",
        "And so I think if that momentum continues, it may not look as clean as a Cruz-Trump race as it does right now.",
        "And, E.J.",
        "Dionne in Iowa, according to Nielsen, more than 12 million people got to watch a GOP debate minus Trump.",
        "Do you think that debate is likely to affect the outcome?",
        "Well, I think the big question about the debate, as David suggested, is whether Cruz, who got hit very hard during that debate, was hurt by it because I think that Iowa really, really does matter to Ted Cruz.",
        "I think he needs to win here to go on.",
        "And he still has a decent shot because he has some of the most important evangelical organizations.",
        "And I was down near the Missouri border in a town Keosauqua City - a little city where you saw some supporters of the socially conservative candidates who were really lagging - Santorum and Huckabee and Ben Carson - coming behind Cruz, at least in that area, because they see him as the person closest to them who can beat Trump.",
        "If for some reason Trump actually wins this, I think it becomes much harder for Ted Cruz to return - to go on.",
        "I think, similarly, it is very important to Bernie Sanders to win here because his chances over the long-haul, I think, depend on having a one-two punch against Hillary Clinton - winning here and winning in New Hampshire.",
        "And the one advantage Hillary Clinton has at this point is, a couple of months ago, she was expected to sweep here.",
        "Now, it's much closer.",
        "You can argue that the Clinton people shouldn't have let it get away from them.",
        "But in letting it get away from them, they lowered the bar on what counts as victory.",
        "I think a couple of votes will be enough.",
        "I think, months ago, we all expected that, on the eve of the Iowa caucuses, we'd be talking about Hillary Clinton.",
        "I don't think we expected we'd be talking about Bernie Sanders.",
        "So the question is, what do we make of this phenomenon?",
        "David, what do you make of Sanders?",
        "You know, Robert Putnam wrote a book called \"\"Our Kids.\"\" Charles Murray wrote a book called \"\"Coming Apart.\"\" It's about how the country is bifurcating along class and other lines.",
        "And we - a lot of us read those books and thought they were really important.",
        "But, at least in my case, I didn't make the connection to the presidential race as much as I should have.",
        "And the coming apart of the country and the segmentation of the country has affected both parties, and that's one of the reasons Bernie Sanders is doing so well - because he represents the disaffected people, or at least speaks about the disaffected people in the working class, as does Donald Trump.",
        "And Hillary Clinton, if you watch her and Bernie Sanders back-to-back, Sanders just talks with so much authenticity and force, and Clinton has not been able to match that.",
        "It's too much calculation and hesitation."

        "officials, they are saying they were firing at retreating Taliban fighters and they say they have the right to do this with an agreement of the Pakistani Army to enter Pakistani territory in hot pursuit of Taliban or al-Qaida fighters."
