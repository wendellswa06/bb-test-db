        "Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats were out of governing North Rhine-Westphalia, and the CDU was in with a solid 7-point lead.",
        "CDU member Yergin Brautmiller(ph) was already thinking about the next target, Berlin.",
        "As you can see from the result now, the overall impression that something has to happen, that there has to be a change in Germany.",
        "That is part of the explanation for tonight.",
        "Because such a big chunk of German voters live in North Rhine-Westphalia, the CDU always saw this election in part as a referendum on Schroeder's national leadership.",
        "But the conservatives were counting on a year and a half before national elections, time to get organized and perhaps prove themselves by governing well in North Rhine-Westphalia.",
        "Shortly after the polls closed, though, in a surprise move, one newspaper called the coup of a loser, Schroeder announced he wanted federal elections as soon as this fall, a year ahead of schedule.",

        "I think the big - the big talk here is, is Bernie Sanders closer to Howard Dean in '04, where Dean generated a lot of energy in the antiwar left of the party?",
        "A lot of volunteers came in for Dean, and it turned out he didn't have the depth on the ground.",
        "Or is he Barack Obama?",
        "I think it's already very clear that Bernie Sanders is stronger than Howard Dean in 2004.",
        "And the question is, how close does he get to where Barack Obama is?",
        "I think Dean - Sanders, rather - speaks for a very odd feeling a lot of Democrats have toward the president, which is they approve of him; they're happy he's there, but they still wish, at times, that he had been more progressive and had taken on the Republicans harder.",
        "And I think Sanders speaks for that and speaks for an idealism among the young that's really captured in that ad where - called \"\"America,\"\" which uses the Simon and Garfunkel song and really doesn't have any words at all.",
        "It doesn't have any words about policy in it at all.",
        "It's about a feeling of change.",
        "Yeah, and I would say that on both sides there's a debate about systemic thinking.",

        "I happen to think there's a lot of magical thinking there.",
