        "A few short years ago, Simon Gratz was one of Philadelphia's - and the state's - most troubled, violent and academically underachieving high schools.",
        "Today, Gratz is very much on the rebound.",
        "Terrell's goal for this night is to get 40 percent of Gratz parents to come to the school, meet teachers face to face, and get their child's report card.",
        "It's all part of the effort to make Gratz a positive hub for a community long challenged by high rates of poverty and crime.",
        "More engaging, more inviting, different strategies that we use; so like, personal phone calls, invitations, incentives for kids - hey, if your parents come, you get a free sneaker pass.",

        "How are we late?",
        "And you could see everybody rushing back to school 'cause nobody wanted the consequences of getting a demerit, or your house getting called - like, a lot of stuff that we weren't used to."

        "On the academic side, Mastery reduced class size, added tutoring programs and specialized reading classes.",
        "They've also re-vamped the curriculum.",
        "And robust intervention - whether addressing reading, truancy or poverty - has proved essential.",

        "Teachers are in frequent touch with parents, even helping link them with social assistance if they need it.",

        "There was a recommendation by Dr. Kissinger to go for it.",
        "There was an Israeli response that let's wait after - until after the elections, and Sadat felt that he could not afford to wait that long.",

        "Not really because I'll tell you, the moment I have arrived in Cairo and the immigration officer - back then in December '77- waved my Israeli passport in the air and said, first Israeli passport in Cairo.",
        "It was immediately after President Sadat visited Jerusalem and spoke in front of our Knesset, the parliament.",

        "Israeli intelligence figured they can't defeat Israel, they can't destroy Israel; therefore, they won't make war.",

        "They did not expect the Syrian army to launch such a fierce attack across the Golan Heights up north.",
        "So Israel, in a way, was caught by surprise, and it took the Israelis about a fortnight to launch their counteroffensive and basically encircle the Egyptian army.",
