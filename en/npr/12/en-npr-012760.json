        "However, another expert that I spoke to said that the money should be better tailored to make investments in the mental health care system because, obviously, opioid-use disorder is just one of many addictions that people could face.",
        "The backdrop to all of this are these lawsuits - right?",
        "- over the opioid crisis, and that there are possible payouts to states from drugmakers that they've sued over the crisis; we've seen this in Oklahoma.",
        "What lessons can we draw from your reporting about how that money should be spent?",
        "So it's a bit difficult to compare the money that comes in from a settlement to the money that comes in from a federal grant because the structures that decide how these moneys are spent are different.",
        "But that being said, one of the lessons that can be learned from this reporting is that we really need to, as a nation, identify the problem that you want to target with this funding.",
        "Now that we're seeing some progress being made on reducing the number of opioid-related overdose deaths, one of the drug experts that I spoke to said that we, as a nation, really need to look forward and see how we can allocate resources to really target the cause of why so many Americans are struggling with addiction in the first place.",
