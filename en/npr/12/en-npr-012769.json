        "Talk about the actual experience of holding the Nook compared to the Kindle.",
        "How are they different?",
        "The primary thing that's different about the Nook is that it has a second screen below it.",
        "It's a full touch color LCD, so you can browse through books using this touch screen.",
        "Kind of like if you've used an Apple product, you might recognize Cover Flow from iTunes or from an iPhone, where you flip through album covers, and this does something similar.",
        "And the top is e-ink and then the bottom is an LCD, like you'd get on a phone.",
        "So how does it look differently?",
        "What does e-ink versus LCD look like?",
        "Well, e-ink is not backlit so you - it reflects light, so it's just like reading words on a page, you know?",
        "Whereas with an LCD, you're basically staring at a light bulb.",
        "And there's no keyboard.",
        "There's no keyboard.",
        "There's no physical keyboard.",
        "But there is a keyboard that you can type on on the touch screen.",
        "So - which is one of the advantages of having a touch screen, whereas with the Kindle, you know the keyboard is always there.",
        "It's always in your way depending on, you know, your point of view on that.",
        "What other differences stand out between these two devices?"

        "Well, one really cool thing with the Nook is - so every Barnes and Noble has free Wi-Fi.",
        "And if you go into a Barnes and Noble with a Nook and get on their network, you can browse any e-book there for free.",
        "And that's, you know, an advantage Barnes and Noble has over Amazon.",
        "Barnes and Noble has stores you can go to.",
        "Every Barnes and Noble will carry Nooks, whereas, you know, Amazon you have to go online, order it and wait for it to come in.",
        "You can't play with it beforehand unless your friend has one.",
        "Amazon has gotten some heat for not allowing Kindle owners to lend a book to someone.",
        "The Nook actually allows you to do that electronically.",
        "How does that work?",
        "What we know is that you'll be able to lend a book for 14 days and at that point it'll expire from somebody's Nook reader.",
        "The problem is that - what we're hearing is that you're only going to be able to lend book once.",
        "You know, that's kind of restrictive and I think really sort of limits the potential of that feature.",
        "Consumers actually won't be able to get their hands on a Nook until the end of November.",
        "Right.",
        "Amazon is such a dominant player in this market.",
        "It's got a two-year head start.",
        "Apple is said to be, you know, rumored to be working on some kind of device, like a super iPhone.",
        "Do you think the Nook can actually stand up to those giants?",
        "Barnes and Noble has the best chance of anybody yet.",
        "It's been interesting to watch Sony try and play in this space as well, because they've been competing on technical specifications that are superior to Kindle in some ways.",
        "You know, people really don't care.",
        "What the Kindle has done right is the content delivery system in that you can buy a book in 30 seconds.",
        "And Barnes and Noble is offering something similar and we'll see how well that pans out.",
        "And obviously, once Apple jumps into the fray, it's going to look like something else entirely, because they're going to be offering a completely different reading experience, too.",
        "You're talking about reading on a tablet on a computer versus an e-book reader, which is a very different experience.",
        "How much does the success of these devices depend on publishers buying into it?",
        "I mean we, for example, we know that Stephen King's new novel is going to appear in hardback next month, but he won't release it as an e-book until Christmas Eve.",
        "Isn't that going to cause a problem for these companies that are trying to develop and popularize these e-books?",
        "It's sort of like the original days of downloading movies, like off of iTunes or other services, where for a while, you know, it'd come out on DVD, then you'd have to wait a while to download it.",
        "And eventually, it shifted so you see a lot more downloads are available the same day as DVD."

        "You know, this conference comes at a time when there's a growing weariness about how much help Afghanistan has been given compared to what progress has been made.",
        "And certainly, Secretary Clinton addressed this donor fatigue, if you like.",
        "Let's listen to a bit of her speech from today.",
        "Now, we know the road ahead will not be easy.",
        "Citizens of many nations represented here, including my own, wonder whether success is even possible - and, if so, whether we all have the commitment to achieve it.",
        "Still, Clinton and the other delegates here said that there was a commitment and that the U.S.",
        "had no intention of abandoning its long-term mission of achieving what she called a stable and secure Afghanistan.",
        "Well, Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, delivered the first speech today.",
        "What was his message for all of the donor nations there about progress so far?",
        "Well, he talked about his vision for Afghanistan as an economic hub in the future and a place that is stable and secure.",
        "Karzai acknowledged and he showed his appreciation for the help that has come in from the international community.",
        "But he also indicated that Afghanistan wanted to take more control of its future.",
        "And he asked the donors that, over the next couple of years, he'd like to see 50 percent of their assistance be channeled right through to his government.",
        "Now, that might be a bit of a hard sell because, again, of the corruption that's endemic here.",
        "And the other thing that Karzai said is he also wanted to see the Afghan police and soldiers take charge of security throughout the country by 2014."

        "And he said he hoped that the international community would both endorse and support those peace initiatives.",
        "Secretary Clinton said the U.S.",
        "is closely following those efforts to reintegrate insurgents who want to come into the fold.",
        "But she stressed that the rights of ethnic groups, and particularly the rights of women, cannot be sacrificed under the reconciliation process.",

        "He lashed out at the USA.",
        "He blamed the U.S.",
        "for a couple of bombings in mosques last week in the Iranian province of Baluchestan.",
