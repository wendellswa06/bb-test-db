        "And he was looking at it in the 17th century.",
        "He was actually looking at a thinly cut piece of cork.",
        "And while he was doing that, he noticed a series of walled pores that were not very deep but they consisted of boxes.",
        "And they reminded him of the rooms that monks stayed in.",
        "And those were called cellula.",
        "Interesting, that word also recalls another Latin word celare, and that means to conceal or hide.",
        "And from these origins came the word cell, and it made its literary debut in Hooke's 1665 book \"\"Micrographia,\"\" which was a big best-seller at the time.",
        "Well - so what did he actually use to look at these things called cells?",
        "Well, he was looking at a thinly cut piece of cork as opposed to...",
        "With a microscope?",
        "With a microscope, a sort of a set of magnifying glasses.",
        "It didn't look quite like the microscopes today.",
        "But people were very interested in using lenses to both look at the stars as well as the things that were not visible to the naked eye right in front of them.",
        "And why choose cork?",
        "Well, because it was so firm, you know?",
        "One of the things that advanced later on in the 19th century was how to cut living tissue so that you wouldn't destroy it.",
        "And you have a very sharp knife or what's now called a microtome.",
        "But you could also introduce artifacts if you didn't cut it correctly, you know, little folds or tears, it wouldn't necessarily represent the living cell.",
        "Right.",
        "And so a cork is, you know, kind of wooden and fixed, and so he could use that and cut it very thinly and do his work."
