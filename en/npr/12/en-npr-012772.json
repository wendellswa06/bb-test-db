        "I'm Craig McDonald.",
        "I'm one of the founders of Hourville.",
        "And Hourville is basically a social marketplace for people who offer anything that can be priced by the hour.",

        "And that was very important because the prevailing theory at the time was something called spontaneous generation, that some living organisms could simply arise, de novo, from nonliving or, you know, living matter or what have you.",
        "Right.",
        "And that got the ball rolling and that's where we are today.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And then, you know, Rudolph Virchow kept talking about this.",
        "And not only talked about normal cellular function which was based on, you know, physical and chemical changes, but also that disease came from results of a deviation from that normal function.",
        "So that really started a whole new field of cellular pathology, that we could cure diseases on the cellular level, so to speak, that too, really flew in a smack of a lot of ideas, because the bodily humors...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...were still much in vogue back then.",
        "Well, Howard, thanks for the history.",

        "The Cuban foreign minister told journalists yesterday all those who are political prisoners will be released from jail.",
        "The release comes as Congress considers legislation to lift the travel ban, and the Obama administration looks at measures to promote more contact.",
        "And Cuba's former leader Fidel Castro appeared on state television there this week.",
        "He's not been seen in public since intestinal surgery in 2006, and looked better than most expected.",

        "Great to be back, Neal.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And what does the release of these political prisoners represent?",
        "Well, I see this in several dimensions.",
        "Number one, it represents Raul Castro's desire to take a very thorny, very controversial and unappealing issue off the table for international purposes and domestic purposes.",
        "It represents also, importantly, the release of political prisoners for the prisoners themselves and for their families, an end to a very difficult period.",
        "And it represents a very interesting moment in diplomacy with respect to the role of the Vatican, the Cuban Catholic Church, the European Union, the government of Spain and the Cuban government working together to make this happen."

        "The 52 is the remaining number from 75 that were imprisoned in 19 - in 2003, excuse me.",
        "There are additional political prisoners, the numbers vary from a bit over 100, 150 Cuban human rights groups, to several hundred more, according to outsiders.",
        "What I gather - Foreign Minister Moratinos of Spain announced yesterday was that in addition to the 52, all political prisoners will also be released, once they figure out who that is.",
        "And this - a lot of this stems from concerted diplomacy from the European Union.",
        "Yes, it does.",
        "The government of Jose Luis Zapatero of Spain had the presidency of the European Union from January until the end of last month, and had been working prior to that presidency, and over the first half of this year, with the Cuban government, to get that - the prisoners released.",
        "There's something called the common position of the European Union, which is a sort of soft sanctions policy that's been in place since the 1990s, which Spain and other members states hope to get rid of and, of course, so does the Cuban government hope to, because this will open the way to cooperation, agreements, assistance and presumably greater foreign investment if the Cuban government opens in that direction.",
        "And then the sort of avenue of approach proved to be the Vatican.",
        "The Vatican - very important.",

        "Pope John Paul II was there in 1999.",
        "Gradually, the Cuban Catholic Church has opened up considerable more space for itself on the ground.",
        "And I can't overstate the importance of the Cuban Catholic Church, the Cardinal Jaime Ortega, Archbishop of Havana, and his intervention and dialogue and engagement with the Cuban government, specifically Raul Castro.",
        "And the other development, how much is Raul in charge, and how much is Fidel in charge?",
        "We thought it was Raul in consultation, occasionally with his brother.",
        "Then his brother appears on TV this week and looks, well, for a man his age, pale.",

        "In Fidel's hour-and-15-minute talk the other night with, which was taped over the weekend, he made not one reference to this political prison issue and not one reference to internal domestic matters.",
        "And there was a large internal domestic component to this prisoner release.",
        "And I have to ask you, Julia, when you saw Fidel on TV the other day, did you think - were you surprised at how well he looked?"

        "They're still huge and they're still growing.",
        "But one thing that I started to kind of hear about and people have seen some chatter on Twitter about it is a very tiny device called Poken, that's P-O-K-E-N.",
        "And it's a tiny device, looks like a little USB drive that you carry around.",
        "It's colorful and you carry it around like a business card.",
        "And when you meet someone who also has Poken, you lock them together.",
        "They have a little spoke looking things on them that lock together and it exchanges data.",
        "Now when you plug it into your USB connection on your computer later, the data shows you what your new acquaintances social network profiles are and that you can connect with.",
        "So, it's like exchanging business cards but instead you're trading LinkedIn or Facebook links that you can connect with letter.",
