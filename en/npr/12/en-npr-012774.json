        "The Boeing Company and the Justice Department have reached a tentative settlement to close two criminal cases.",
        "The agreement would get the aircraft maker back in the good graces of Washington, and appears to set a record for penalties paid by a Pentagon contractor.",
        "NPR's Peter Overby reports.",
        "There's no Guinness book entry to defense industry fines, but Boeing's does seem to qualify.",
        "It's $615 million.",
        "Senior Justice Department officials say they can't remember any bigger penalty for fraud by a defense contractor, and at the Project on Government Oversight, or POGO, a watchdog group in Washington, Scott Amey says it's nearly five times larger than anything in their database.",
        "He has an important caveat.",
        "Unfortunately, a lot of these settlements are done without the light of day.",
        "So it may not be the largest out there, but it's the largest that we found.",
        "Boeing had to clean up after two costly procurement scandals.",
        "First, employees in Boeing's rocket division obtained and used proprietary data from competitor Lockheed Martin.",
        "That gave Boeing an unfair advantage in contracts with the Air Force and NASA.",
        "And second, Boeing hired Darlene Druyan, the top Air Force procurement official, right after she helped Boeing secure a one of a kind deal to build tanker aircraft and lease them to the Air Force.",
        "Druyan went to prison and so did Michael Sears, the Boeing's Chief Financial Officer.",
        "Boeing's CEO, Phil Condit, resigned.",
        "The tanker deal was killed.",
        "Now, the agreement with DOJ would have Boeing accept responsibility for wrongdoing by its employees, but the corporation itself won't face any criminal charges.",
        "In fact, Boeing is already back in the hunt for a new Air Force tanker contract, and it's in partnership with Lockheed Martin on space vehicles.",
        "POGO's Scott Amey says the tentative agreement highlights anti-trust problems in the defense industry, as Washington has allowed or even encouraged corporate mergers.",
        "The government has pretty much placed itself in a position where it has to continually buy goods and services from contractors that violate federal law and federal regulations.",
        "The government's created its own monster, and it can only blame itself.",
        "The agreement puts Boeing under Justice Department oversight for two years.",
        "A department spokesman said that the agreement is expected to be signed in the next few weeks.",
        "But it's good news right now for Boeing, which has been cleaning house at the top.",
        "The new CEO, Jim McNerney, took command last July.",
        "In December, Ken Duberstein was named lead director on the board.",
        "He was President Ronald Reagan's last chief of staff, and has become one of the best-connected Republican lobbyists in Washington.",
        "Last Friday, Boeing hired a new general counsel, J.",
        "Michael Luttig, a federal appellate judge who has been on the Republican short list for a Supreme Court seat.",
        "And Monday's settlement with DOJ should further bolster Boeing's standing on Wall Street.",
        "How this was going to eventually shake out was a concern among investors."

        "That's Mark Davis, Senior Aerospace and Defense Analyst for FTN Midwest Securities in Cleveland.",

        "Clearly, whenever you're having these types of events, it never hurts to have news like this come out.",
        "Bottom line, it is nice to be able to say that these things are on their way or have been put behind Boeing, and that investors can now be focused on the core operations of the business.",
        "A business whose stock price fell about 1 percent yesterday.",
        "But even a record setting fine is a small problem compared to criminal prosecution.",

        "And to know just how worried we should be, it helps to check on what the government is saying.",
        "NPR's Jon Hamilton has been doing just that.",
        "And, Jon, before we get into more specific statements, what is the status of bird flu that's being tracked around the world?",

        "He was talking about foreign policy.",
        "This is something that he's been writing about in his reflections for the last several years.",
        "I think it's very clear from how this diplomacy took place, and between who and whom, that Raul Castro has the reigns of government and of foreign policy, and Fidel's intervention, if you will, was to show his stalwart base that he's the keeper of the ideological flame, the great leader, but not - by saying nothing about domestic matters or the political prisoner issue, clearly not running the show, but consulted as you said.",
        "And able to predict war between the United States and Iran without really addressing any of the immediate issues involving Cuba.",
        "Precisely.",
        "So he is providing a sort of orientation, talking about the - you know, Cuba, of course, has a principled position in terms of Cuban foreign policy that opposes the imposition of sanction -of sanctions - that sees the use of force to bring about regime change, whether in this hemisphere against Cuba or across the world in Iraq and Iran, as anathema.",
        "So Fidel getting out there and saying essentially to his political base, look, you know, we are cutting this deal with members of the European Union who are with the Americans, with our mortal enemy, but here is - you know, we still remain adamantly opposed to the kind of sanctions policy that our temporary allies on this political prisoner business are helping us to figure out.",
        "So I think that it's a parsing for the Cuban base within the party and within the military that Fidel is playing out while a very pragmatic foreign policy is actually underway on the part of Raul Castro, a foreign policy which I should add has a lot to do with creating space internally to go forward on a number of domestic, especially economic reforms, within the country that really couldn't happen until he took care of this large albatross hanging over his neck.",
        "We're talking about is this beginning of real change in Cuba with Julia Sweig, who's director of Latin American Studies, the Council on Foreign Relations.",

        "Hi.",
        "It seems to me that this prisoner release is more window dressing than anything substantial.",
        "These people, as I understand it, have to leave the country.",
        "They're not allowed to live in Cuba anymore.",
        "So they're going to be exiles.",
        "And it seems to me it's just perhaps a shallow attempt at Cuba trying to improve its relations with the rest of the world without really serious reform.",
        "Plus, as I understand it, only seven out of the 52 have been released.",
        "Nine as of today, but the others, we're told, will be released.",
        "Julia Sweig?",
        "I think the question of whether this is window dressing or not of course remains to be seen.",
        "The internal issues that are so critical in Cuba that have to do with participation, a more open society - I'm not going to say liberal democracy, market economy, because I think we're very far from getting to that within Cuba.",
        "But I think we have to see what comes after this release."

        "But I think it's to dishonor (unintelligible) this would happen - wouldn't have happened if Fidel Castro was still in office.",
        "Would it have been more difficult for Fidel to have climbed down on this issue?",
        "Yes, I think so.",
        "I think there were moments and opportunities when this has been on the table before.",
        "This is not the first prisoner release.",
        "Although I think it would've been more difficult for him to climb down on this issue, he himself when he was running the country officially as president released tranches(ph) of political prisoners over the last several decades, also with the intervention, for example, of Jesse Jackson, of Jimmy Carter, of the Catholic Church, of prominent Cuban Americans.",
        "So this is not the first time that this has happened.",
        "But this Fidel Castro in the late 2000s, when the relationship with the United States had become especially intense - that is, in 2003 on the cusp of the war in Iraq, where there was no prospect in that Fidel Castro's mind of a real rapprochement with Cuba - excuse me - with United States or with Europe, may have had a much harder time doing so.",
