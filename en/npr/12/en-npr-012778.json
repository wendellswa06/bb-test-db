        "He was one of several lawmakers who questioned him for hours yesterday about ethics and spending concerns, including the EPA's purchase of a $43,000 secure phone booth, significant raises to two staffers despite White House objections and travel expenses which have included first-class flights.",
        "Pruitt told lawmakers he has nothing to hide and described the allegations as politically motivated attacks.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "Let's have no illusions about what was really going on here.",
        "Those who have attacked the EPA and attacked me are doing so because they want to attack and derail the president's agenda and undermine this administration's priorities."

        "Well, it was really striking that he was so adamant that he was not responsible for these accusations of ethical breach.",
        "We heard...",
        "Conceded nothing.",
        "And he said that staff made the decisions when it came to the decisions about costly flights and moving him to first class.",

        "So I imagine people on the panel were not so happy with his responses?",
        "Predictably, Democrats were not thrilled with his responses.",
        "And there were some Republicans who had serious questions about the ethics of his decisions.",
        "But for the most part, Republicans in the House in general support this president, and they were very welcoming to the explanation from Pruitt that this was a political attack on the policies that he has put forward at the EPA, and it was quite effective for him to defend himself that way.",
        "Does that mean Scott Pruitt keeps his job after all of this?"

        "Well, I spoke with some people on the Hill who thought that approach was pretty effective for speaking directly to a president who has himself said that he likes a fighter, he like somebody who stands up for himself.",
        "And framing it as a political attack rather than a conversation about ethics and about spending made it very digestible to a president who has used that line and approach often in the past.",
        "So while it's not assured that he will be safe in his job, it does seem as if this defense line was well-received.",
