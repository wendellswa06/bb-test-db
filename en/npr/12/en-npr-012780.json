        "We're standing in a parking lot in Burtonsville in Maryland at a shopping mall with a McDonald's and a Dunkin Donuts and a telephone pole heavily laden with more gizmos that I can point a stick out.",

        "It's a pretty good specimen with a little bit of everything.",

        "Now at the top, you can three big wires, otherwise known as conductors.",
        "They call them primaries.",
        "They're the ones that carry the power for a fair distance throughout the area.",
        "These are probably a few thousand volts, maybe 4000 volts.",
        "A few thousand volts is about as much as a line worker can safely manage in a rubber suit.",
        "More than that and it takes expensive equipment to do repairs.",
        "Now if you look closely, you'll see that the conductors never touch the cross arms at the top of the pole.",
        "They're carefully suspended on a what an expert would call…",
        "Ceramic-like dinner plates.",
        "Those are the insulators.",

        "Electricity is like water.",
        "It leaks if you don't seal it.",
        "And as you come down lower, there are the power lines that carry electricity to the buildings around here at the 120 or 240 volts.",
        "These are the secondary lines.",
        "Next to them attached to the pole, you'll probably see something that looks like a big oil can.",
        "It is, in fact, full of oil and wires.",
        "It's a step-down transformer.",
        "It lowers the voltage from the primaries before it goes into the secondaries, otherwise you'd fry your TV or your electric toothbrush."
