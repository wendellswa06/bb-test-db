        "He left it to President Bush.",
        "He said he didn't want to interfere.",
        "So, this is going to be Barack Obama's debut on the international stage, his first trip abroad, and of course, the financial crisis has gotten only more serious since then.",
        "When it was conceived, this meeting was called the New Bretton Woods, and that of course is a reference to the conference that reshaped the world's economic system after World War II.",
        "Are we at that moment now?",
        "It's true.",
        "A few months ago - in fact, this was set, like you say, around the time of the November summit, this was seen as an opportunity to redesign the international financial system.",
        "It's actually taken on even more importance than that because the G-20 is, I think, on the verge of replacing the G-7, the major industrial countries, as the big international grouping.",
        "The G-7 excludes some of the most important players in the world today.",
        "It excludes China.",
        "It excludes what is called the trillion-dollar club, six countries whose GDPs are each over $1 trillion whose economy together represents a quarter of the global economy.",

        "Is President Obama going to have to defend the very notion of the American dollar?",
        "I think there is a real movement right now in the world not really to create a new international currency.",
        "It's actually to create something called the international reserve currency, which wouldn't be an actual currency.",
        "It would be more what they call - it's kind of technical - special drawing rights.",
        "It's a way for sort of countries to put their currency reserves into a kind of assortment of currencies, the composition of which would change, you know, as exchange rates fluctuate, and this is something that has been discussed for a while.",

        "It's never going to replace the dollar, and Barack Obama is not really going to have to defend the dollar.",
        "The dollar is here to stay.",
        "So, a lot of summits coming up here, Tom.",
        "Of course, the president moves from London to Prague for the EU summit.",
        "Now, France and Germany have expressed hostility towards the president's economic policies, the stimulus plan.",
        "But now, the prime minister of the Czech Republic has called the Obama stimulus plan the road to hell.",
        "That's really something.",
        "Not exactly diplomatic language, is it, Jacki?",
        "In fact, some of the other European countries that more or less share his sentiment sort of scolded him for using that kind of language.",
        "Now, keep in mind that his government had just collapsed, so he was probably in a bad mood at the time.",
        "But it is true that European governments are very cool to this idea of more stimulus spending, and I think they resent - you know, Barack Obama and Timothy Geithner have been putting a lot of pressure on the Europeans to spend more.",

        "It's not the first stop on the trip, but in a sense, he's keeping that promise.",
