        "And a lot of the commentary, interestingly, though, on social media in the region and in op-ed pages are criticisms of their own government.",
        "They're criticized sharply for not standing up to the Trump administration more, and they're criticizing their own leaders for not doing more at home to stop the violence and the gang warfare that's, you know, actually sending the migrants north in the first place.",

        "And the state has a lot of really aggressive subsidies to get people to go that way.",
        "Now, I'm wondering about how you pick your cities on your top 10 list, because, you know, I imagine every city - some place is doing something."
