        "What effect do you think his remarks will have on the White House?",
        "Well, it certainly creates a public relations problem for the White House at the moment because what was striking about Buffett's comments is that basically he said because the economic policies of the administration are not being communicated effectively, the economy was kind of in lockdown, that people were pulling back because they were fearful and they were not being given a sense of confidence.",

        "I mean, when Warren Buffett speaks now in this economy, do people listen?",

        "Warren Buffett made his remarks on Monday and the stock market, the Dow Jones went up nearly 400 points on Tuesday.",
        "So, if his remarks were making anybody nervous about Obama, it didn't reflect in the behavior of the stock market.",
        "I think it's generally seen as kind of nutty to link the movement - the day-to-day movement of the stock markets to anything that the government is particularly doing on that day, although certainly a lot of the president's critics have been trying to link him to the Dow's poor performance on a day to day basis.",
        "But that's one of the things we're in this unchartered economic period, and it's one of the things economists and policy makers are trying to figure out which is what exactly does influence the economy and its enormous capacity and what can they do to influence it to move in the right direction.",
