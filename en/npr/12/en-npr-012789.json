        "On Monday, a reporter asked him if he thinks this speech will be for all Americans, and the president said yes.",
        "But then 17 seconds later, he started talking about health care policy.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "What the Democrats' plan is is going to destroy the country, and it's going to be horrible health care, horrible health care.",
        "So not exactly nonpartisan, but if he gives a partisan political speech today, that could cause some legal problems for the White House.",

        "So President Trump has a history of going to events that are not supposed to be political and then sort of making them political.",
        "What do we know about - do we know anything about the content of the speech today?",
        "Well - and as you say, he has gone to places that are really not supposed to be political, like in Iraq the day after Christmas, talking to the troops, where he started attacking Democrats in the middle of his speech.",
        "A White House official who declined to be named - so they spoke on background - said that the speech today will be all about celebrating America - the flag, members of the military - specifically said it will not be political.",
        "It is a \"\"Salute to America.\"\" That is what the event is being called.",
        "But, you know, all assurances about what President Trump will do or say have to be taken with a grain of salt.",
        "And critics are already objecting to the fact that the White House gave VIP tickets to the Trump reelection campaign and the Republican Party to hand out to supporters.",
        "Now, they defend that, saying, well, this is a pretty common thing; if the - if it was on the South Lawn of the White House, we'd be doing that.",
        "And they also say that members of the military and their families, thousands of them, have also gotten these VIP tickets.",
        "So we mentioned that there could be some legal jeopardy for the White House if the president makes an overtly political speech.",
        "What might those be?",
        "What could those problems be?",
        "Yeah, so there are laws preventing the spending of government resources for political purposes, so if the president starts attacking Democrats or talking about his reelection campaign, that could be a problem.",
        "I spoke with Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center.",
        "He says that the campaign might have to reimburse if this turns political.",
        "If this does become a political event, then the president's campaign or the RNC should certainly reimburse Treasury for those costs.",
        "And this is already shaping up to be a much more expensive Fourth of July celebration than past celebrations, and I think there's at least the appearance that the costs are going to benefit President Trump's campaign.",
        "So the Interior Department has been organizing this, and Congress could - it could bring the Interior Department in for hearings and try to collect if this were to happen.",
        "Someone familiar with the matter told me that the White House is well aware that some people may accuse the president of making this a political event, and that ethics specialists within the White House and lawyers have been looking at this closely and that the plan is for the president to act within all applicable ethics rules.",
        "Just real fast - would this be the first time a sitting president gives a national address like this on the Fourth of July?",
        "Well, Harry Truman did it on the 175th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, and there hasn't been one since then, though remarks from Richard Nixon were piped in in 1970, and it was a big mess that ended in tear gas.",
        "Well, and the weather report isn't so awesome for Washington, D.C., tonight.",
        "So we'll see."

        "This time yesterday, we were telling you about how the Justice Department confirmed that forms were already being printed without the question.",
        "Without the question - but now a Justice Department official says they have orders to keep looking for a way to ask the question on the census.",
        "Now, those orders apparently came in the form of a tweet from President Trump.",
