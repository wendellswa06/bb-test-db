        "Contrived - so they didn't buy the administration's justification for the question, but at the same time, they opened the door.",

        "What do critics say is the real reason for the question?",
        "There are a lot of theories.",
        "Plaintiffs in these multiple lawsuits over the citizenship question - you know, the most recent theory that's come up is that this question, through the files of a GOP redistricting strategist.",
        "They believe that this question could ultimately be used to help politically benefit Republicans and non-Hispanic white people by redrawing political districts after the 2020 census based on the number of U.S.",
        "citizens old enough to vote, not on the number of total residents in any given area.",
        "That could ultimately benefit Republicans.",
        "So that's one theory.",
        "Another one is that - is this way to use the responses so that the census numbers that determine how many congressional seats each state gets after the census - if that number could exclude noncitizens.",
        "But that would be problematic for the court, we would assume, on several different counts.",
        "These would be legal questions that would certainly be challenged in the courts.",
        "So what happens next?",
        "I mean, who knows, but what's your best guess?",
        "Well, the Trump administration is facing a deadline.",
        "Friday 2 p.m. Eastern is when a federal judge in Maryland says the Justice Department attorneys have to represent whether or not the Trump administration is going to try to fight for a new reason for the citizenship question.",
        "And if they do, the judge is ready to reconsider the allegations that adding this question was a form of discrimination and also that there was a conspiracy amongst administration officials.",
        "Meanwhile, the census keeps getting printed."
