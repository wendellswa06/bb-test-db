        "And so I had to figure out something else to shoot.",
        "And so I decided to focus on hip hop fans who came down to attend the event.",

        "But from my perspective, as somebody who has done anti-sexist work and worked to educate boys and men about sexism and violence against women, to me it was critical to cover that scene.",
