        "So I think if it sits right with me, if it feels to good to me, if I feel like I'm not making any strong, moral or ethical compromises, then I will be interested in doing it, as long as I had the type of creative control that I desired I could really flex my muscles as a filmmaker and deliver the content that I want to deliver.",
        "It's very difficult to escape the fact that, you know, we live in a world where only a handful of media conglomerates control the media.",
        "And so I think that you have to sort of invade the media with content that resembles what everybody sees on a daily basis, but is subversive in terms of the message or at least is something that, you know, pushes people's awareness and makes people think critically.",
        "That's what I'm about as a filmmaker.",

        "Patent law says no, that you can't patent the laws of nature, which is what makes the case before the Supreme Court this week so very interesting.",

        "Now, the testing method, the testing method for homocysteine is not in dispute here.",
        "Rather, the Supreme Court is considering whether you can patent the thought process, connecting the dots.",

        "A testing company called Laboratory Corporation of America argued that the patent went too far, that the patent gave the owners too much control over a basic scientific principle, that high homocysteine levels mean a vitamin B deficiency.",
        "Supreme Court rarely hears patent cases, so this case really stands to have a lasting effect on patent law.",

        "Well, as you mentioned, the Supreme Court rarely takes patent cases.",
        "We can go years without seeing a patent case.",
        "And this term the Supreme Court has already taken four cases, which suggests that they have a high level of interest in what's happening in patent law.",
        "This case is very interesting because it touches on a fundamental notion of what is something that's an observation of a natural phenomenon, a law of nature that is free to all, owned by none and what is something you can actually control and lock up anybody's right to use for 20 years?",
        "In order to decide this case, the court's going to have to look back at cases from the early 1980s.",
        "And that may rethink, reshape, what we talk about that's within the patent law and what's outside the patent law.",
        "One of the most important things about this case is understanding what part of the patent everybody's okay about and what part people are upset about."

        "OK.",
        "Let's discuss that.",
        "Sure.",
        "So there is a level of knowledge about, and there was even before these folks came in who patented the invention, a notion that elevated homocysteine levels can suggest that a patient doesn't have enough vitamin C in their body.",
        "I'm sorry, a couple of vitamin Bs, B-12 and folic acid.",
        "And if you don't have enough of that, you can have some really serious health effects, cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment.",
        "Pregnant women, if they don't have enough of these vitamin Bs, their babies can be born with spina bifida, neural tube defects.",
        "If you can figure it out, you just give them a vitamin and that heads off all these problems.",
        "So it's an important area.",
        "We can't test for that directly any more than we can do a blood test and say, oh, you haven't had enough fruits and vegetables today.",
        "But we can look at this other thing called homocysteine because these vitamin B products break down homocysteine.",
        "They help break down homocysteine levels in the bodies.",
        "So if we see a lot of homocysteine we can make a connection that says, I think maybe my patient needs some vitamin B.",
        "The patent at issue was from a company that invented a test for testing homocysteine levels and correlating that with whether your patient needs vitamin B.",
        "And it's the kind of thing we patent.",

        "Here's what you do.",
        "That kind of specific test is fine to patent.",
        "But they added one more claim.",
        "They said, we claim any way of testing for homocysteine levels and making a connection between that and the thought that a patient needs more vitamin B.",
        "And that's what everybody's complaining about, saying that not just their test that they wish to control but they wish to control any way to get at this information.",
        "And people who are complaining to the Supreme Court are saying if you allow them to have this last claim, it's the same as locking up a basic natural phenomenon.",

        "For a long time, there has been concern that the appellate court, right below the federal circuit that hears appeals related to patents, is a very pro-patent holder and really will allow very broad patents, not all the time, but a lot of the time.",
