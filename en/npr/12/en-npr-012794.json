        "I would love to see modernization in the patent and trademark office, and there have been proposals for that.",

        "There are some changes, there are some small changes you make that might have a big impact.",
        "For example, right now, when you have a patent and you go to litigate that in court, there's a presumption that the patent is correct.",
        "And some people have argued that one shouldn't be doing that.",
        "Given how few the resources are for PTO and how many questionable patents seem to be getting through, we should change that.",
        "And we should say, this is information for the court to look at, but if you're going to argue this patent we're not going to give a presumption that it's correct.",
        "So that's another way to do it, is to begin to work on the rules.",
        "There are a number of ways in which people move patents through the patent system and they can ask for continuances and they can amend their patents and there's some concern this is a very arcane, archaic process, and that needs to be updated as well.",
        "Yeah, but what --",

        "The next case they're going to hear is the eBay case, and that, you know, hidden in the eBay case is concern about the question that business method patents have gone too far.",

        "The question before the Supreme Court is should you be able to avoid injunctions in certain cases?",

        "But the one thing that pulls all these cases together, and its why I think you'll see more cases, is an increasing interest on the part of the Supreme Court in looking at the patents and looking at what the lower courts are doing.",
        "So I don't think, I think this is the beginning but not the end of what they are doing.",
        "Because people thought they had no recourse until now.",
