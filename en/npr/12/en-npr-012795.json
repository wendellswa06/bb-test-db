        "And I'm wondering, from your point of view, Michael, how the quick turnarounds are affecting the business of predicting the outcomes?",
        "I think it's tougher because everything, as you said, gets compressed and pollsters will tell you that often things swing late.",
        "But, you know, late becomes a shorter time window now.",
        "And so a lot of the polling in New Hampshire was done, you know, by that Saturday.",
        "And, you know, by the time that ended, you know, things had shifted.",
        "So when you have a compressed window, it just makes it, I think, a lot harder to catch kind of the turns and the swings in the electorate.",
        "Knowing that, as you know, they talked about having some problems with the samples and did some - and there was a bigger turnout than anticipated so all of those things can skew what you see in the polls."
