        "Prince Bandar represents the other approach to dealing with Iran, says Alterman with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
        "Bandar was reportedly arguing for a much more aggressive policy - perhaps even verging out of policy of preemption in some ways - and was pursuing it with people in the administration whom he'd perceived to be sympathetic to that point of view, including the vice president's office."
