        "That would've been the natural thing.",
        "I do know that he did watch the 1968 election returns with Hubert Humphrey, and that had the election gone the other way, he would've been chief of staff.",

        "Do you have a sense of how that is going in South Carolina right now?",
        "Well, at this point, South Carolina is the battleground for so many different reasons.",
        "Obviously, blacks make up half the turnout in the Democratic primary.",
        "But beyond that, this result will set the tone for how the rest of the South may vote and provide significant momentum for the winner heading into the February 5th primaries.",
        "As far as the black vote here, the Clinton and Obama camps have taken sort of different approaches.",
        "The Clinton campaign had locked up early endorsements from prominent black politicians and ministers.",
        "While the Obama campaign - because they initially lacked the name recognition - built a large field organization aimed at reaching black voters directly in their communities.",
        "And at this point, Obama has now taken the lead from Clinton in the polls among African-American voters and Democratic voters overall in the state.",
        "And most significantly perhaps is that Obama now is tied with Clinton in the polls among women.",

        "Is there any sense that Obama's presence in South Carolina is going to affect the turnout particularly among black voters, Corey?",
        "I think so.",
        "There's every sign of that and that he is going after young black voters who have never voted before but what's also significant is that his huge portion of his get-out-the-vote effort relies on volunteers who are unpaid, who are black, who are under 35, and have never participated in the process before.",
        "So that's one issue.",
        "The other issue that the more it has become contested by both candidates, the more attention South Carolina gets, the more they get the attention particularly of the rural blacks.",
        "So as long as this is a hot battleground, there is every indication that this could be - if not a record turnout among blacks in South Carolina but a big one.",

        "Talk, if you will, about the timing of such an announcement and the attention that it has generated in the press.",
        "Is it skepticism, optimism, what?",
        "Well, I think among the press, there's a lot of skepticism because this is the same President Bush who, for so long, you know, wasn't really deeply involved in the Middle East peace process.",
        "I mean, they laid the roadmap, as they call it, in the early part of his administration.",
        "But since then, it has been a much of hands-off issue for President Bush."

        "And so I'm not sure if something is signed or not kind of how that might play out because, largely, I've seen and heard the candidates talk very opaquely about Iraq and about the Arab world because right now, the message seems to be focused on change and which candidate can actually claim the mantle of change and that is - and that to me is also on the GOP side as well as the Democrats.",

        "So this has reverberations for all the congressional elections that are going on this year.",
        "Well, Michael, you covered the White House before.",
        "Is there a point at which you determine, as a member of the press corps, that you see the White House prerogative beginning to move and diverging directions because, as Corey was just talking about, at one hand, you have to remain presidential; on the other, you have to protect the party, if you can; and thirdly, you have to try to protect the seats in Congress.",
        "You know, it's been interesting of this White House because I think a lot of Republicans in Congress actually are frustrated with President Bush.",
        "Before the midterm elections, for example, many Republicans are hoping he would make some kind of significant move in terms of change in strategy in Iraq.",
        "And he waited until after the elections to, you know, to fire Rumsfeld and things like that.",
