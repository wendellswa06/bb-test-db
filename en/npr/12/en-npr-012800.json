        "Hey, Audie.",
        "So we have multiple videos out now online of the same scene, but it began with one, and it showed a Native American man and a white high school student inches apart with this crowd of other students chanting and jumping and smiling around him.",
        "Do we have a clearer picture now of what led to that point?",
        "I think we do.",
        "I want to be careful about that, but I think we do.",
        "I mean, initially, this was a Rashomon moment meeting a Rorschach test, right?",
        "And what I think we now find is that these students were part of, in some ways, a three-party encounter.",
        "You had - a bunch of largely white, largely male students from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky outside Cincinnati were at the - in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial for the March on Life event Friday.",
        "You had a fringe hate group called Black Hebrew Israelites, African-Americans, heaping invective upon whites they saw - just incredibly ugly rhetoric.",
        "And into this wanders a couple of Native American activists, including Nathan Phillip, who plays a drum and sings a song that he later says - tells NPR and others that he hoped in some ways would bring peace and de-escalate.",
        "Some of the things the kids did were, you know, derogatory, derisive, denigrating.",
        "You saw some tomahawk chops from some students.",
        "You saw some chanting and mockery in some ways satirizing the Native American song.",
        "And so there was some ugliness as well as some other stuff there - perhaps not as bad as was initially alleged and charged.",
        "Now, how does the media fall into all of this?",
        "Well, of course, you know, the question you always have to answer is who?",
        "In this particular case, the FBI, the U.S.",
        "Marshals Service, they're not concerned necessarily with the crime that he is alleged to have committed, in essence in this case, murder.",
        "What the federal authorities are looking for him - for is that federal warrant that was issued for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution that basically says the FBI has reason to believe this individual fled from one state to another or even out of the country to avoid local prosecution.",
        "It's the job of the feds, the FBI, the Marshals Service to find him and then get him back into the country then it'll be the job of the local authorities to handle the substantive crime, in this case the murder investigation and prosecution.",
        "More now on the idea of a fatwa being issued.",
        "Reza Aslan is the author of \"\"No God but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future or Islam.\"\" He joins us from New York.",
        "Reza Aslan, what is the actual full meaning of the word `fatwa'?",
        "A fatwa is basically a legal pronouncement.",
        "It is the opinion of someone called a mufti; that is an Islamic legal scholar who is capable of pronouncing his judgments, his opinions on any kind of legal issue with regard to Islam.",
        "And how formalized is the process of being recognized as a mufti who is capable of issuing a fatwa?"

        "Well, it's simultaneously very formalized and somewhat fluid, particularly in Sunni Islam.",
        "In Shia Islam there is a very distinct clerical hierarchy with very well-established levels that one reaches depending on how much learning one has.",
        "In Sunni Islam one has to be, first of all, connected with one of a number of set schools of law.",
        "One has to undergo a very long and very rigorous education process, training process that first gives one the ability to even be considered a cleric.",
        "And then even then one needs to have had a certain amount of years, a certain amount of training in the clerical sciences and most importantly to have a certain amount of followers, disciples, which then allows you to issue your own legal judgments, which themselves are technically not enforceable except to anyone but your own followers.",
        "And there is no hierarchy at work, so you're not getting your fatwa approved by someone else or having it reconciled with another mufti's fatwa?",
        "No.",
        "In fact, fatwas can very easily contradict each other.",
        "There is a hierarchy, however, and it's sort of an unformal--informal hierarchy in that any cleric or any scholar with more training and with greater numbers of followers is essentially placed at a higher level.",
        "And so, therefore, his fatwa has more meaning, it has more influence than, say, a fatwa from a lower-level cleric.",
        "Well, how important and how influential do you think this fatwa issued today is likely to be?",
        "Well, it's enormously influential in that it is not targeted to the suicide bombers.",
        "This is--I mean, it's not going to make really any difference to those who are willing to, against Islamic law--against 14 centuries of Islamic law--strap bombs to their bodies and kill non-combatants and civilians.",
        "But the important thing about this is that it is targeted to those Muslims who feel some sort of empathy or some sort of relationship to these people.",
        "I think it's the language of the fatwa itself that targeting civilians is haram, forbidden, in the most religious sense of the term.",
        "And the idea that suicide bombers are criminals and not martyrs and it is forbidden to emulate them is an indication that these clerics are using their moral authority to reach the greater Muslim community and to make a very fine distinction that this is a criminal act and that it cannot be supported either physically or religiously or emotionally in any way.",
        "But given the great variety of movements within Islam, isn't there something circular about any fatwa; that is, it will be followed by those Muslims who respect the particular religious authorities who issue it but not by people who might honor either more conservative or more radical religious authorities?",
        "You're absolutely right.",
        "I mean, there is no central authority in Islam.",
        "There is no Muslim Vatican or Muslim pope.",
        "A fatwa is not a papal bull.",
        "It has no sort of divine ordination to it.",
        "That said, I think what we are seeing now--and this is not new, this fatwa, in the United States.",
        "Similar statements have been issued, of course, in Britain.",
        "Similar issues--statements were issued by the grand ayatollah of Germany.",
        "And I think what it indicates more than anything else is that Muslims, particularly Muslim leaders, are starting to realize that there is a civil war taking place within their faith to define the very future, the very meaning and substance of this wonderful and magnificent and yet misunderstood religion.",
        "And that awareness is far more important, I think, than this discussion about how far-reaching fatwas like this are going to be.",
        "Reza Aslan, thank you very much for talking with us today.",
        "It was my pleasure, Robert.",
        "Reza Aslan spoke to us from New York.",
        "He is the author of \"\"No God but God: The Origins, Evolution, and the Future of Islam."
