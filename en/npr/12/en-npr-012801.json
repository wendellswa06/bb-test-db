        "The Flint water and Detroit school troubles have focused a lot of attention on emergency managers and Michigan's emergency manager law.",

        "Very few states give the kind of authority and power that we do.",
        "Eric Scorsone is an economist at Michigan State University who studies local government finances and says about 20 states have laws allowing state intervention in local finances.",
        "But Michigan's arrangement goes farther than most.",
        "Once an emergency manager is sent in, that person has sweeping power to take an ax to spending, eliminate jobs and renegotiate agreements regardless of what residents or local elected officials want.",

        "They have eyewitness identification, people who saw him on a bus going from the United States into Mexico, in which he engaged in conversations.",

        "Realize that, of course, the FBI cannot go charge in across the border guns drawn and arrest someone in a foreign country.",
        "They have to rely on the aid and the assistance of Mexican authorities to help conduct the investigation as well as to conduct the arrest, get him to the Mexican-U.S.",

        "And that could involves some legal processes as well, of course, in terms of, you know, appeals against extradition - that sort of thing but that all remains in the future.",
        "Obviously, the FBI would then want to provide Mexican authorities with as much information as they could.",
        "Yeah, and they have to.",
        "You know, they've gone to some interesting and unique means, Neal, at this point to find him.",
        "Number one in the Unite States, they activated a series of - dozens of electronic bulletin boards on interstates where his picture and background information where shown in areas that they thought he might have fled to.",
        "Now, since they believed he's in Mexico, they have the traditional wanted by the FBI wanted flyer or poster containing all of his information, his aliases, his physical description as well as information about a $25,000 cash reward that has all been converted into Spanish and has been circulated in areas that he's believed to be in Mexico.",
        "So what the FBI is relying on is a hopefully the good faith of Mexican authorities to help find this guy as well as the $25,000 cash reward.",
        "And then the other normal investigate techniques, as you suggested, they have phone taps and pin registers on all of his relatives in the United States.",

        "I think what he's relying on is the ability to do somewhat start to disguise his appearance, grow his hair out, wear sunglasses, do other things, his obvious knowledge of the Spanish language, and to be able to prevail upon friends and relatives in Mexico to help hide him from the U.S.",
        "authorities.",
        "Now, I think that that $25,000 cash reward may well go a very long way there and he's not the type of guy that - from my knowledge of his background he's necessarily going to be camping in the deserts and cutting cactuses in half to get water out of them to drink.",
        "Another aspect though, this is a guy about whom there's a - you don't want to prejudge, of course, but there's a lot of evidence, he may not think he's got an awful lot to lose once authorities close in on it.",
        "Well, you know, that's always the challenge as an FBI agent for 25 years from when I was out attempting to arrest fugitives, you always had to know that eventually I would become the person standing between the fugitive and what he thought to be freedom, and depending on the value that he put on this freedom that took away from the value of my life, so the investigators, the agents, the authorities always have to realize that.",
        "And as you suggest, this is a crime he's suspected of, there's a ton of evidence to suggest he is involved but for the purposes of the investigation, there is still a lot to be learned.",
        "His wife, for example, who's a Marine, she has been cooperating with the authorities, somewhat there is questions concerning what her level of involvement may or may not have been in the crime that he is alleged to have committed, but at this point she's cooperating.",
