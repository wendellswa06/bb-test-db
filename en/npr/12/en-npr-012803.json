        "So whether Dog the Bounty Hunter, is trying to go from Hawaii to Mexico and look for this individual, I think, there can be illegal bounty hunters who are down there.",
        "But most countries like Mexico and others frown on us especially some other international coming into their country, and as your last caller suggested inserting(ph) themselves into an investigation.",
        "So I think there are lessons to be learned for bounty hunters to leave it to the professionals, especially when you get into an international environment.",

        "And that is what I do as me and my teams; we follow footprints in the woods.",
        "And footprints to us with a lot of what I called dirt time become like a fingerprint.",
        "No two people walk the same way.",
        "So part of our job in the beginning is to isolate and identify key points on a footprint that would indicate this is our target.",

        "Well, you know that's subject to interpretation.",
        "You know, my school also deals in primitive wilderness survival.",
        "And I hear all these people thumping their chest of how good a survivalist they are.",

        "I mean, a pure wilderness survivalist is very difficult to find.",
        "There's very few of them out there.",
        "Eventually, they're going to have to make contact with civilization one way or the other.",
        "And in the Rudolph case, there was at least suspicion that he had help from some of the people in the area.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "Definitely, there's evidence of that - that he definitely had help stealing from grain factories, stuff like that, garbage cans, whatever.",
        "That is not a survivalist.",
        "That's nothing more than a homeless person that lives in the bush, as far as I'm concerned.",

        "I mean, a lot of the times, you do not have any other choice.",
        "But they should always let a trained tracker in first - whether it's a FBI tracker, local law enforcement, search and rescue, something like that - before the tracks become thoroughly obliterated.",
        "Who is the most difficult of the people you've searched for to find?",
        "Basically, number one, is somebody who knows their way around in the woods and has had some kind of military training especially dealing with escape, evasion, counter-tracking and things like that.",
        "That makes a tracker's job more difficult.",
        "So what has to happen is you have to jump track or cut track, take in an educated guess the direction of travel and then go a mile or two up on that direction of travel and try to cut back and pick up the tracks to get through the places where he's tried to erase or obliterate his tracks or confuse the tracker.",

        "Sure.",

        "Well, of course, we know the $25,000 reward has been put up.",

        "They're brought back to the U.S.",

        "I mean, I appreciate what your caller is saying that even though this is a potential murder case, there are a lot of high-profile perhaps terrorism cases.",
        "You know, your stalker or your tracker, Neal, that made me think that the British have developed software along the lines of what your tracker has said how different people walk differently.",
        "They lean one side or the other.",
        "The British have developed a software package that they can take the image of a terrorist, figure out how he walks his gait which way and then compare that with other people they see on the street so they - instead of identifying by someone's face, now, they're trying to identify by the way they walk.",
        "So there is a lot of technology out there other than $25,000 on the barrel head being employed.",
        "And just getting back to David's point, though.",
        "If in a case, certainly, like the one you worked on in the SLA case and Patty Hearst - such a huge-profile case, does the FBI then steal resources from other investigations to focus on something that's become such a big deal?",
        "Well, the answer is I think you do.",
        "And I mean, those resources are finite.",
        "You only have so many men and women to dedicate.",
        "Now, the FBI has probably got half of the resources dedicated to terrorism today.",
        "And fugitive investigation is not necessarily high on the list.",
        "But it's always interesting how this, you know, the media can drive a case.",
        "Him, being a Marine, she was pregnant - all of these emotions that are involved in the case, these decisions are not made in a vacuum.",
        "They're made and - if you can attach certain resources to a fugitive and if you really do a full court press, might should be able to get that person off the street faster than if you didn't.",
        "Someone is making the decision in the case of this Marine that those resources would help bring him to justice.",
        "Or otherwise, he might remain a fugitive.",
        "And as a fugitive, perhaps, commit other violent acts.",
        "So that's how the decisions are made.",
