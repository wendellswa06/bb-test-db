        "That really can lead us down the wrong path in terms of trying to provide good healthcare for everyone.",
        "Stanford University ethicist, Sandra Soo-Jin Lee, makes this point: if drugs are targeted to specific races, it can suggest a racial or ethnic group's health problems - like lower life expectancy and infant mortality among blacks - are genetic rather than social or environmental, which makes doing something about the problem less of a priority.",
        "Berkeley, California-based cardiologist Dr. Duane Stephens says environment is important.",

        "There are big stakes involved.",
        "Biomedical ethicists worry if BiDil succeeds and other drug makers follow, without more rigorous guidelines, the pharmaceutical industry may decide smaller populations - like Asians, Native Americans, and even African-Americans - don't account for enough market share to justify investing in new research.",
        "But for the moment, BiDil has opened the door for more dubious race-specific products - like vitamins - which don't require FDA approval.",
