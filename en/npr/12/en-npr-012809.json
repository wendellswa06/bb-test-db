        "It pushes the water up into the water drop tank a thousand gallons.",
        "The pilot actually hovers over the water source about 10 feet off the top of the lake or the reservoir.",
        "We fill up, and then we take off very quickly and get to the fire, make a drop, and then return to snorkel fill.",
        "Sort of the measuring stick that we use to see if the helicopter or an air tank is affective is how many gallons of water can be dropped per hour.",
        "With the Fire Hawk, we can make 15 drops in an hour, which would be 15,000 gallons an hour, which is just a huge amount of water.",
