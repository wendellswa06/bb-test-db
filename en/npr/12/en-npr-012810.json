        "It's my brand.",
        "We can say shtick, but I like to say brand.",
        "Your shtick - I'm from New York - it's your shtick - and being from the Bay Area.",
        "But you talk about the fact that you actually are from Alabama.",
        "So why did you decide to go to Alabama for this season?",
        "Well, as somebody who lives in the Bay Area, I mean, I've lived in Chicago.",
        "I've lived in Boston.",
        "And I used to go to Alabama every summer.",
        "I wasn't born there, but I used to go there every summer to visit my dad and my dad's side of the family, stayed at my grandmother's house.",
        "And I would always hear people in the North and the West be like, why would you go to Alabama?",
        "And when I was a kid, yes, there were times I would think the same thing.",
        "Why am I going to Alabama?",
        "But as I got older and I heard more people sort of condescend to the South in general, and I realized that I was like spending more and more time there, and especially after I had kids and it was really important me to take my kids there, I realize people don't actually know what's going on in the South.",
        "And especially with - after the election, there's this real sort of condescension to the South again renewed.",
        "And so for me, I was like, people think I'm from Berkeley.",
        "People think I'm from Oakland or San Francisco.",
        "But really, my roots and the roots I'm most connected to are in Alabama.",
        "Well, you talked about the fact that you didn't want your go-to to be, you know, finding the Confederate flag, but there are Confederate flags in this episode.",
        "And one of the interesting people you meet is a black woman.",
        "It's important to point out she's an African-American woman named Arlene (ph).",
        "We visit with her as she's giving a speech about the Confederate flag, and she actually is wearing a confederate flag pin.",

        "Let's start there.",

        "I don't think it caused people pain at the time that this Confederate battle flag was put out there.",

        "OK.",
        "OK.",
        "(Laughter) OK.",

        "That's one of my favorite conversations we had this season, by the way.",
        "Is it?",
        "Tell me why.",
        "Because it's a more nuanced conversation about the Confederacy than the one that people might expect me to have on the show.",
        "It would have been super easy to go find a 60-year-old white guy with a thick Southern accent talking about - who could be like, I love the flag but it's not racist, which I could have debated.",
        "Or I love the flag and I am a racist.",
        "It would be super easy to find that guy.",
        "I would - you know, you can sort of - you can step off a plane in the South and just sort of like - you don't have to go that before you find a Confederate flag on a car and talk to that guy."

        "I mean, Bill Cosby was just convicted of - on the second try of several acts of sexual aggression against a young woman.",
        "And, you know, I know because you have said that he was one of your inspirations, influences along with Eddie Murphy, you know, early in your career.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, my thoughts are, yes, Bill Cosby was one of my influences when I was a kid.",
        "When I refer to him generally, even before this - he was convicted, I call him the artist formerly known as Bill Cosby as a way to say, let's mark this in time that when I talk about him, I'm talking about him as I understood him to be as a child.",

        "I stand by all women.",
        "I'm a supporter of the Me Too movement.",
        "I think society is going through a reckoning, but part of it is a cultural reckoning.",
        "But I think the cultural reckoning helped sort of create the legal reckoning that had happened with him.",
        "I mean, his - the rumors about him started before the Me Too movement kicked off, but I think the Me Too movement has given gasoline and fire to that.",
        "So yeah, I don't in any way stand with people who think that he is being unfairly persecuted.",
        "Now, yes, the criminal justice system is racist.",

        "That report fueled fears that inflation was rising and that that might cause the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.",
        "Some economists say the inflation threat may be exaggerated, as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports.",
        "If you talk to people like Chris Mortensen, you know how hard it can be to find workers these days.",
