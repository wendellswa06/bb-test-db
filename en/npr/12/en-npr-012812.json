        "Is that accurate?'",
        "I don't think so.",

        "But did he create a market for this by popularizing it?",
        "It was his intent to bring lobotomy into the mainstream, and he did succeed in that, and so there was a period of time, maybe about 10 years between 1945 and about 1955, when lobotomy was a treatment, a preferred treatment, a treatment of choice for various mental illnesses.",

        "Well, women by and large did receive lobotomies more often than men, and that's because they more frequently suffered from the kinds of affective or emotional disorders that lobotomy was considered the most effective treatment for at the time.",
