        "Initially, Lappin was frustrated, because he couldn't get very far due to website issues.",
        "Yet any annoyance disappeared several weeks later, when he was actually able to compare the new options with his current plan.",
        "Right now, I have an individual plan that has higher deductible than this, and has higher co-insurance amounts.",
        "And it's about $45 more per month.",
        "Within a day, Lappin had researched, selected and purchased a plan at a significant savings.",
        "I anticipate between the two of us, we're going to save over $5,000 a year, and have better coverage and have lower out-of-pocket and co-pays.",
        "About three weeks later, at a press event with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Lappin pulls me aside.",
        "He tells me about the last time he signed up for health insurance.",
        "It was on paper.",
        "The process took a month.",
        "People have to relate it to what it was the old way, and what it is now.",
        "Technology has made this so much easier than it was before.",
        "Yes, it's not perfect.",
        "It's not three clicks, and it takes a little bit of time, but it is much better than it was.",
        "So as positive as Lappin feels about the health law, it's not an experience everyone trying to sign up in Georgia will share.",
        "The Atlanta area has lots of insurers competing in its markets, but some counties in Georgia have just one company selling on the exchange.",
        "And that's driving the price of premiums higher.",
        "For NPR News, I'm Jim Burress in Atlanta.",
        "This story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, WABE and Kaiser Health News.",
        "Let's check in again with Paul Salopek, the man who's walking across four continents.",
        "We've been talking from time to time with this National Geographic writer, who is following the ancient path of human migration - from Africa across Asia to the Americas, all on foot, and along the way, writing stories or recording diary entries; like this one he recorded near Djibouti, in East Africa."

        "(SOUNDBITE OF WIND)",
        "After recording that, Paul Salopek caught a boat carrying camels and sheep across the Red Sea, and we find him now - well, Paul, where are you?",
        "I just crossed the border into Jordan, from Saudi Arabia.",
        "The Arabian Peninsula has taken me about seven months.",
        "Going through what kind of landscape?",
        "We say desert, and we imagine sand.",
        "We imagine dunes.",
        "But what's it like, as you're traveling on foot?",
        "It's been mainly through a region of Saudi Arabia called the Hejaz, which is the northwestern segment of that country.",
        "Sand dunes, indeed, lots of sand, but also a coastline, because I've been hugging the Red Sea coast as I move north.",
        "So a very stark landscape of white land meeting ink-blue waters.",
        "Paul, when you say the Hejaz, the reason that phrase is familiar to me is because of books about Lawrence of Arabia.",
        "Is that the very landscape you're working through?",
        "It is, indeed.",
        "It's kind of a fabled corner of the world.",
        "And as far as I can tell, I might be the first outsider to actually walk along this coastline, through this arena of war and the sacred landscape, in many, many years; possibly since the Arab revolt itself, in 1918."

        "It stretches your sense of time.",
        "It stretches your sense of space.",
        "I mean, it's been a spatial adjustment, going from travel times that we measure in hours - say, in a car - to thinking that walking for 10 days to the next town is quite normal.",
        "You know, I'm thinking about the fact that you're trying to do 20 miles a day but also that in the desert, if you're on a relatively high place, you may have a view of many, many miles.",
        "Have there been days when you've woken up and looked out across the desert and by the end of the day, you haven't even made it out of that original field of view; you haven't even made it to the original morning's horizon?",
        "The sense of distance is really distorted in this minimal landscape.",
        "It is like being on a gigantic stage.",
        "And there have absolutely been times when I thought I'm walking to a little clump of thorn trees maybe a mile away, to take a little shade; when in fact, it turns out to be a shrub that's only 200 yards away, and it's 1 foot high.",
        "The sense of depth perception really changes, and gets distorted, when you have no scale to measure anything by.",
        "Paul Salopek, would you remind people why on earth you're doing this?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's basically - it's a project about storytelling.",
        "What I'm hoping to do is draw on my past experience as an international correspondent to string together all the stories that I've encountered - and new ones - into one, long, narrative storyline.",
        "And by connecting the past to contemporary events, I hope that my reporting has a little more depth and has some context - not just like, at a national level but through time, through deep history.",

        "And interesting connections, too; what's wonderful is, they're unexpected.",
        "One example is the issue of women driving in Saudi, a perennial social justice issue, a concern of human rights activists in the West for many, many years.",
        "But what I didn't realize is that there are actually thousands of women who are driving in Saudi Arabia, but they all happen to be deep in the desert with these vestigial pastoral communities - because they're driving out of necessity.",
        "And I saw them driving pickup trucks, hauling alfalfa for their camels.",
        "They're like women truckers in Texas.",
        "Any of them pull over and ask you if you needed a ride?",
        "Students get on the Web, and then they submit their papers on the Web, and in a matter of about two or three seconds, they get detailed feedback, telling them what they did right and wrong.",
        "Then they're allowed to make changes in their paper and revise it and resubmit it."

        "So it's like a suggestion program rather than a grading program.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It does actually give them a grade and tells them what their grade would be if that was where they stopped right then.",
        "But they have a chance to improve, of course.",
        "Why did you come up with this?",
        "Well, for years, I've taught a large introductory sociology course, and I've had to teach--I've had to use multiple choice questions for the tests because there really wasn't the possibility of having--being able to grade that many essays.",
        "And students didn't really like that very much, and I didn't really get a good sense of what they knew.",
        "And so I really wanted to do more writing and have them do more writing and find out more about them, and so we came up with this idea of trying to be able to incorporate more essay grading into large classes.",
        "And does this mean at the end of this process that a real human being does read their essay?",
        "Yes.",
        "In this course, they do.",
        "Aha.",
        "So I wonder, how have your students found their computer suggestions?",
        "Well, sometimes they have concerns about them.",
        "As often as not, they're wrong, and we agree with the program, but what we do is we let them--whenever they have a concern, they're able to tell me, and then I check it by hand and then tell them what the problem was, if it's their problem or the program's problem.",
        "And actually, as the program has improved, we rarely disagree with the program.",
        "But sometimes they do find something where the program needs to be fixed, and we fix it, of course.",
        "So you've tweaked it a couple of times.",
        "Yeah, sure."

        "And does the computer, I wonder--I mean, the first thing you'd wonder about is the computer would not seem to reward creativity.",
        "Well, we can't grade creativity very well, and so what we do is these are exercises where--our primary purpose is to find out, did they learn the content in this chapter in sociology and can they tell us about that in some way that's meaningful?",
        "And we encourage creativity, but it's really hard to detect that with a computer.",
        "There's so many ways to be creative is the basic problem.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "How do you find them all?",
        "And the...",
        "That's why we insist on having the human grader at the end, so that if there was some different way of doing it that doesn't quite match what we had in mind, but is still creative and worthwhile, we can still give them credit for that.",
        "And do you regard this as a major step forward from the multiple choice answers?",
        "Well, I think it's--yes, sir, I think it is.",
        "I think that the students are better able to tell us what they know, and I think they actually learn in the process, too, because they are able to revise it and resubmit it.",
        "And as we all--part of all of our lives in the future, I suspect, is going to be dealing with computer programs.",
        "They're learning how to deal with that, too.",
