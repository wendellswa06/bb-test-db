        "Alberto Nisman was investigating the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center that killed 85 people.",
        "He had linked that crime to Iran.",
        "But last week, he was found in his apartment with a bullet to the head.",
        "He had accused Argentina's president and others in her government of taking part in a cover-up.",

        "Yeah, Hector Timerman is the foreign minister, as you mentioned.",
        "He's also a prominent member of the Argentine Jewish community here, as was Nisman.",
        "Nisman named him in particular of carrying out a parallel secret diplomacy with Iran that was intent on shielding Iran from accusations that it was behind the 1994 bombing that was the worst terror attack in Argentine history.",
        "In particular, he said Timerman was trying to get five Interpol Red Notices canceled for five Iranian suspects in the case that Argentina wanted to interview.",
        "This is what he said.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)",
        "I never ever in my life asked Interpol to do that.",
        "But why did he say Nisman said he was doing that and how does he respond?",
        "Yeah, Nisman's accusation was that this was all a plot to get oil from Iran in exchange for wheat, that Argentina was going to sort of soft-pedal the Iran issue to get that deal done.",
        "This is a nation with a lot of energy problems, so that was the motive said Nisman.",
        "Timerman just denied that flatly.",
        "He said Iranian oil is too heavy for Argentina to process, so there's no motive for what Nisman alleged.",
        "Argentina cannot use Iranian oil because it is a very heavy oil and we cannot process such a heavy oil.",
        "So he's saying that oil from Iran is too heavy to be used by Argentina.",
        "If indeed they weren't talking about oil, how does Timerman explain his talks with Iran?",
        "What were they talking about, according to him?",
        "Yeah, he said he was trying to get access to the Iranian suspects.",
        "That his sole purpose in those negotiations, he says, was trying to get the two sides to talk.",
        "He says Iran doesn't allow extradition of its citizens, and Argentina does not allow trial in absentia.",
        "So this, he contends, was the only way to move forward in the case - to allow a judge, an Argentinian judge, to travel to Iran and interview those suspects.",
        "That, he says, was his sole purpose.",
        "And who does the Argentine foreign minister think was responsible for the bombing?"
