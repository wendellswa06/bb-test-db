        "The inside of the caterpillar gets pretty much converted to millions and millions of virus particles and then there are other enzymes that cause the exoskeleton to melt.",

        "But scientists wanted to know how the virus makes caterpillars lose their minds.",
        "Hoover and a team of researchers suspected that the virus was using a special gene, a gene that could control caterpillars' feeding behavior.",
        "To find out, the scientists infected some caterpillars with virus that carries the normal version of this gene and some with virus carrying an inactivated version.",
        "Then they put the caterpillars in tall plastic containers lined with screen.",
        "Every time the caterpillars were infected with the normal gene, they would die at an elevated position in the container, and if the gene was knocked out, they didn't.",

        "It could also help them determine when in the gypsy moth's life cycle it is most vulnerable to infection.",
        "And he says all that could help bring down the cost of spraying with baculovirus.",
        "Right now, he says, land managers often use cheaper methods, such as insecticides, or a deadly fungus.",
        "The advantage of the virus is that it is specific for gypsy moth larvae, and so it will impact no other animal, insect, plant in the treatment zone.",
        "Slavicek says gypsy moth outbreaks are less severe than they were a couple of decades ago.",
        "But the pest remains a major threat that can leave a forest bare in a matter of weeks.",
        "He says during an outbreak there are so many caterpillars that their remains make some roads dangerously slick.",
