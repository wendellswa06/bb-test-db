        "These days, each time the Federal Reserve meets, an announcement soon follows that interest rates will stay low - very low.",
        "Well, today it happened again.",
        "The Fed predicted that rates will remain low through late 2014.",
        "That's a longer time period than in past statements.",
        "It was an attempt to reassure financial markets, as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports.",
        "At a press conference after the end of the Fed's two-day meeting, Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S.",
        "economy is expanding moderately, and labor market conditions are improving.",
        "But he said the data in areas like retail sales and business investment is still mixed.",
        "DR.",
        "BEN BERNANKE: We are, obviously, hoping that the strength we saw in the fourth quarter, and in recent data, will continue into 2012.",
        "But we're going to continue to monitor that situation.",
        "I don't think we're ready to declare that we've entered a new, stronger phase at this point.",
        "For that reason, he said, the Fed is unlikely to raise rates for at least two years - and possibly longer.",
        "Fed officials have never made such a long-range projection about rates.",
        "But Bernanke wants to send a message to businesses and consumers that they can expect cheap credit for an extended period, as a kind of confidence-building gesture.",
        "Bernanke also noted that the Fed is ready to step up its efforts to pump money into the economy by buying long-term securities, if it thinks it's appropriate.",
        "In saying that, Bernanke was essentially shrugging off complaints from inflation hawks, who warned that the Fed is sowing the seeds of higher prices down the road.",
        "Today's meeting was the first time the Fed released projections from individual members about where they expect interest rates to be in the years to come.",
        "It's part of an ongoing effort by the Fed to be more transparent about how it operates.",
        "Six of the 17 policymakers think rates could go up this year or next, but five think they won't go up until 2014.",
        "And another six think it won't happen until 2015 or '16.",
        "Bernanke made clear that these are projections only, and that predicting the future path of the economy is a difficult thing to do.",
        "I think it's important to emphasize that we're not going to mechanically take the interest rate projections that participants provide, and just build policy off of that.",
        "But Bernanke said, like a business, the Fed has no choice but to try to make projections as best it can."

        "Well, it seems to be a tacit admission.",

        "And it wasn't an easy thing to do, though.",
        "The Cadbury's, as the other families and companies struggling with this, at first were marketing it, as you say, as a health drink, but it took a while to figure out how to make an eating chocolate, as they called it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Victorian chocolate is just not something that we would recognize today because there was no way of separating out the cocoa butter from the rest of the cocoa bean and so it could be very fatty, you know, with the oil sort of floating in suspension on top.",
        "And the early products had things like lentils mixed in with it, or pearl barley, all sorts of products to sort of mop up the fat.",
        "So it was a little while before we realized the magic that there was to get out of the cocoa bean.",
        "As I understand it, a lot of the big British chocolate makers in the early days were Quaker, a religion that one does not think of combining with big business.",

        "Right from the off, the business was to benefit others.",

        "And they didn't stop there.",
        "They then started to think, well, actually, the business shouldn't just benefit the workforce.",
        "It should benefit the whole community and that led to these Quaker utopian villages.",
        "And critics absolutely scoffed at this idea.",
        "You know, when George and Richard first said they were going to move their little chocolate factory out into the field, critics were saying, well, who ever heard of pleasant sights and wholesome smells making money; you know, these Cadbury brothers were fanatics and they were soon going to be bankrupt.",
        "But Bournville most certainly proved them wrong.",

        "There was, you know, a very hotly contested takeover battle, and a lot of opposition in this country.",

        "It ended up being one of the largest acquisitions in British corporate history.",
        "That's right.",
        "That right.",
        "By the end of the takeover battle, hedge funds had bought up 30 percent of Cadbury and wanted the company to end.",
        "So the idea that this iconic firm could be sold for short-term profits really caused a stir over here and has made people question the degree to which there is too much emphasis on short-term gains in business rather than long-term business goals, which is what those Quaker stewards were all about.",
        "And the challenge for Kraft really is to see what aspects of Cadbury Quaker history can be incorporated into the business model to make sure that Kraft really uses the business as a force for good.",
        "Well, thank you so much.",
        "Thank you.",
