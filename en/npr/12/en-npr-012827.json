        "Now, I want you to do something for us and help us understand, what it is that you do.",
        "I understand that you're actually a political scientist but your work is in an area called, common resources - oil fields, grazing lands, forests and fisheries.",
        "And you found that these common resources are best managed by the people who used them as opposed to private companies or even the government.",
        "Now, I know it's tough for the average person to understand economic theory but I'm hoping that you can explain why this is the case.",
        "Well, we don't have a universal that all governments are bad.",
        "Please don't let that become the assumption.",
        "The universal is that rules that are worked out that fit a local forest or fishery or lake or irrigation system are the ones that work the best when they are designed to fit a particular ecology.",
        "Where rules don't work is when we try to have all of the fisheries along the entire East Coast with the same rule, because the fisheries from Florida are dramatically different than the fisheries in Maine.",
        "So, it's that we have to be thinking about a match between the kind of rules that people are using and the ecology involved.",
        "Thank you.",

        "This is a big year for women.",

        "I'm wondering if women through all these field were whooping and hollering on you behalf?",
        "I hope so because I would be whooping and hollering for the other women who won this prize.",
        "What does it say about the participation of women in the field in economics, that it's taken this long for a woman to actually take the prize?",
        "Well, I think in many of the sciences, especially the social sciences, it has been only recently that women were full professors, getting grants, doing research.",
        "That doesn't say anything about their abilities.",
        "It's whether the opportunities were there.",
        "And now, slowly but surely, opportunities are made available and women are doing great.",
        "In advance of my conversation with yours, looking at a study that looked at the under representation of women in economics and it found that there was a lack of women entering this field because of a lack of female role models.",
        "Is this a real opportunity to help bring women into this field?"

        "Martin says it's also a sign that Buffett has a lot of confidence in Goldman's management.",
        "When he goes to acquire a company, he wants to acquire a company with good management, management in place.",
        "He doesn't want to have to run it.",

        "When business activity picks back up, one would imagine that Goldman Sachs is going to gain significant market share because many of their competitors have either been destroyed or are significantly damaged.",
        "If that's the case, Goldman is a major winner if it survives the current financial storm.",
        "Whether Goldman survives will depend in part of the fate of the Bush administration's plan to buy $700 billion in distressed securities.",
        "The plan has generated a huge amount of public criticism, and members of Congress are raising lots of objections.",
        "In an interview on CNBC today, Buffett said he understood people's anger over the deal, but he said it was important to do the right thing for the country.",
