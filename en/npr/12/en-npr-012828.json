        "First is NPR's Frank Langfitt, who brought us a little bit of sound here, which is creeping in.",
        "And Frank, what are we beginning to hear?",
        "We're hearing a furniture factory down in south China.",
        "And I was back there in January visiting a number of factories and kind of getting a feel for what had changed in workers' lives.",
        "Now, when you say a furniture factory in South China, what I imagine is, is hundreds if not thousands of people fresh off farms working under virtual slave labor conditions.",
        "Is that what happens today?",
        "And I remember talking to one guy who was saying he was going to go back home for Chinese New Year's, back to the farm.",
        "And he said, you know, I'll just find work back home.",
        "I'm not going to come back here.",

        "Alexandra Harney - she's a former reporter for the Financial Times, and she has a new book about manufacturing in southern China called \"\"The China Price.\"\" Welcome to the program.",
        "Thanks for having me on.",
        "So when Frank Langfitt says that workers seem to have more power, is this getting more like the United States, where people can demand a raise or walk?",
        "So friends of mine who are migrant workers - workers who come from the countryside into the cities - are finding work in real estate, in hair salons, in other places that you wouldn't have expected them to do, say, ten years ago.",
        "Okay.",
        "So what does that mean for U.S.",
        "companies who had been going to China for cheap products?",
        "But so far, Congress has not been very aggressive about answering these questions either.",

        "Here's another listener favorite from 2008.",
        "Now that China's becoming more expensive, American companies are going to have to start thinking about whether they're willing to pay more, whether they can shave more costs off by having more efficient logistics and supply chains, or whether they need to start looking at sourcing more from countries like India and eventually, perhaps, countries like Brazil or Kenya or Madagascar.",
        "Well, now, if part of the reason that we've hardly had any inflation in the United States in recent years is because of incredibly cheap stuff from China, does that mean that China's labor issues are part of the reason that we're worried about inflation now in the United States?",
        "But some retailers and importers I talk to are telling me that they are already starting to have to raise the prices in the U.S.",
        "We're talking about China's changing economy with Alexandra Harney and with NPR's Frank Langfitt.",
        "And Frank, what do Chinese officials do when they see business fleeing to Vietnam, India or elsewhere?",
        "And it's a lot easier to take a farmer out of Sichuan Province and teach him how to make a shoe.",
        "But are you going to be able to really kind of change the way people think so that they can be a lot more innovative, not always knock off all these Western products?",
        "And I think that's where the money is, and that's probably, at least from the perspective of the officials, where they hope the future of the economy is.",
        "And I think the next phase will be more about brain power than about manpower.",
        "But wait a minute, because you do have American executives right now saying we're very worried about India and China because they've got so many thousands and thousands of engineering graduates coming out.",
        "Are they not really that far advanced?",
        "They do have a lot of engineers.",
        "But some of the studies that I've seen show that part of the problem lies within China's education system.",
        "And I'm not in any way trying to say that Chinese engineers aren't good.",
        "They are great.",
        "But the education system tends to focus more on theory over practice.",
        "And what China needs is more experienced engineers who are able to work in a multinational environment, who are able to bring more to the table.",
        "I think one of the big challenges too is, you know, can they develop a really great global brand that's at the high end?",
        "And so far we don't really have that.",
        "I mean, they bought - Lenovo bought IBM, but we haven't seen, you know, a Boeing or an Airbus from China."
