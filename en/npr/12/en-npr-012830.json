        "On August 3rd, 1908, Colonel Allen Allensworth filed the site plan to start a town in California's San Joaquin Valley.",
        "He was born a slave in 1842 in Louisville, Kentucky, and went on to serve in the military.",
        "He eventually moved to California, where he purchased 800 acres in Tulare County, along the Santa Fe rail line.",
        "The town of Allensworth became the first in California to be founded and funded solely by African-Americans.",
        "At its height, it had a bustling economy with a schoolhouse, a church and a library.",
        "Allensworth is celebrating its 100th anniversary, and for some perspective, we return to Lonnie Bunch.",
        "He's the founding director of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African-American History and Culture.",
        "Lonnie, great to have you back on the show.",
        "My pleasure.",
        "So Allensworth, founded a hundred years ago in California's Central Valley.",
        "Describe what it was like to be a black person in that area at that historical moment.",
        "Well, imagine, if you will, it's the time in America when segregation is the law of the land, when discrimination against African-Americans was the norm, rather than being unusual.",
        "It was a time when a hundred black men per year were lynched in the South.",
        "It was a time when most blacks lived in the South and were stuck in low-level jobs, share croppers, porters, maids.",
        "It was a time when it was hard for people, especially African-Americans, to believe that there would be a better day, and yet they did.",
        "And Allensworth was really an example of how a community came together to believe, but also to work hard to find a better day.",
        "So who was the man after whom this town is named?",
        "Allen Allensworth, great name, one of the most interesting figures in history.",
        "This is a guy who was born as a slave in Kentucky, ultimately after two tries, escapes, becomes a free man and joins the United States Navy, because he wants to participate in the Civil War.",
        "After serving in the Navy in the Civil War, he basically has a religious conversion, becomes a minister around Knoxville and Nashville, Tennessee, and then he stumbles upon a former - a soldier who says to him, you know, we need black chaplains in the military.",
        "In those days, there were four units, the 9th and 10th cavalry, the 24th, 25th infantry.",
        "He applied to be the chaplain of the 24th infantry.",
        "He was there for 20 years.",
        "Retired as lieutenant colonel, came to California, because he'd been there many times with his troop, and was stunned by the discrimination he faced in southern California, and decided, along with four other men, that they would create a colony somewhere in California where, quote, the Negro could be free of prejudice."

        "So Allensworth was meant to be a haven from discrimination, and it wasn't the only town of its type.",
        "Well, what happens is that there have been a history of African-American towns in Massachusetts, in New Jersey, Boli, Oklahoma, Nicodemus, Kansas.",
        "And so Allensworth on the surface is just like that, an attempt to create an oasis free of racism.",
        "But what I think is so exciting about Allensworth as a community is that they recognized that what they were doing was greater than them.",
        "While they definitely wanted to have a community where there could be black business and shop keepers and school teachers, they recognized that their mission was bigger.",
        "If they could be a successful community and show economic progress, and show leadership, they felt that would be a beacon of change that would echo around the country.",
        "That people would see Allensworth and say, African-Americans can control their own destiny, can be contributing members of American society.",
        "And their hope would be that would help to change the racial dynamics in this country.",
        "Of course, you move on, and troubled times hit.",
        "The Colonel died in 1914 in a motorcycle accident, and that was just the start of a series of problems that really changed Allensworth.",
        "What happened?",
        "Allensworth, as a community, was really in an area where water was key.",
        "And when the land was acquired, they were promised that there would always be pumps, and there would always be the kind of level of water they needed.",
        "And that failed.",
        "And once the water started to go, that called into question of their ability to farm.",
        "They also made a business of being a depot station, where the farmers from the local area would come to put their crops, because the Santa Fe railroad train would go through there.",
        "But the farmers complained that they had to deal with these black people, and ultimately, a spur was created to bypass - for the railroad to bypass Allensworth, that took some of the business away.",
        "And then the notion was, Allensworth thought that maybe we could create a Tuskegee of the West, a school like Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, a vocational school for blacks.",
        "That could be in Allensworth, and that would provide both an economic engine for the community, but also a real, practical purpose for this community.",
        "That failed.",
        "And then when the colonel was killed in - run down by a motorcycle in 1914, suddenly the community doesn't have the bearings it once had.",
        "Let's listen to a little bit from one of the one-time residents, Ed Pope.",
        "He recently died, but here he is talking to filmmaker Pam Harris about the time right before World War II.",
        "We left Allensworth.",
        "That was in 1940.",
        "A lot of people were still here, and they just hung on, hung on, hung on.",
        "But when the war started - in 1941 - started, and jobs started to open up in the different cities, that's when everyone left.",
        "That was the last great days of Allensworth.",
        "You can hear in his voice this heartbreak.",
        "What lessons are we meant to learn from the life cycle of Allensworth?",
        "Which is by some people called, the town that wouldn't die.",
        "I mean, it's now - still exists as a state historic park, but it's not what it was."

        "I think that in some ways, there's a lot to learn from Allensworth.",
        "First of all, Allensworth was a place that helped people believe, helped people find some positive thing to hold on to, when the rest of the world told them there was no possibility there.",
        "And many of the people with family came out of Allensworth, as you heard in Ed Pope's voice, there was a sense of community, a sense of engagement, a sense of helping each other.",
        "But also, a sense that this was, in some ways, a special moment where the possibilities that were once there were now gone.",
        "And so I think one of the powers of understanding Allensworth is that this is really a proactive attempt by an African-American community, not to simply disassociate itself from America, but to be a kind of beacon of hope, a beacon of possibility.",
        "And some ways, its greatest impact is that the people that once lived there became people who believed in education, believed in change, believed that they could make America better.",

        "In the home, in her garden, and she raised all of her vegetables and her condiments for cooking.",
        "And then across the road, she had her cows and her chickens.",
