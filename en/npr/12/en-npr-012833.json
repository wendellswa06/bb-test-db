        "But for now, GM has lots of cash on hand and the union has made clear it's not going to give up any benefits before the current contract expires in 2007.",
        "To auto industry analyst Susan Jacobs, heath-care costs are only part of GM's problems.",
        "She says that if GM is to compete with higher-quality Japanese cars, it needs to lower its prices.",
        "But it can't do that unless it reduces costs.",
        "The key for General Motors right now is to realistically assess the magnitude of the problems.",
        "Jacobs says GM is simply too big and bureaucratic with too many divisions and too many factories running at less than full capacity.",
        "That's OK as long as the cars are selling.",
        "But in a downturn, cuts need to be made.",
        "But GM's labor contracts make it difficult for the company to close down plants.",
        "And when it lays off workers, it has to continue paying part of their salary.",

        "In the past, we were guilty of, perhaps, spreading a common product across a couple of brands and that has a tendency to water down the image.",
        "So we're making sure that if our product is a Pontiac, it really lives up to what the Pontiac image should be, ditto Cadillac or Buick or Chevrolet.",
        "In the long run, GM's biggest problem may be its image.",
        "Many customers simply consider GM cars less reliable than imports, a claim the company diligently tries to refute.",

        "And they're basically saying even though they've been used for almost 40 years now as over-the-counter drugs, that back then, when they were first put on the market, the FDA looked at data from adult populations.",
        "And they saw that these medicines were safe in adults.",
        "And so they extrapolated the data and took lower doses and said, well, if this dose is safer and effective for adults, perhaps this lower level is safe and effective for kids.",
        "They never did test these medicines on kids.",
        "And today, basically what the panel is saying is if you want to say these medicines are safe and effective for kids, you've got to prove it.",

        "Now, we - these medications should not be given to children who are 6 and younger.",

        "Actually, the committee voted today that there shouldn't be limits for children 6 and older.",

        "or in the rare, rare event when there are deaths, they find that the most vulnerable population are the young children, not surprisingly.",

        "When these drugs were used in small doses, you weren't getting reports of kids in the E.R.",
        "The concern really about safety is how easy it is for parents to mistakenly overdose.",
        "And they do have lots of research about how often that happens.",
        "Did they consider taking them off the market?",
        "Actually, that is not what this panel was tasked with.",

        "The question actually read something like: based on our discussions here today on the efficacy and safety, are there any age groups for which these ingredients, these medicines should not be used?",
