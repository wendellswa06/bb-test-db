        "And, you know, I think what the campaign is quickly finding out is not enough to say well, you don't get to tell me how I live my life or reinterpret what I did.",
        "You have to show them that this is how it happened and this is why I wrote it the way I did.",
        "Now, if you've expended something that did happen, you sort of embellished it, say that and everyone will accept it.",
        "(Laughter) It's just when you try to say it didn't happen the way you're saying it happened and then they're finding out well, yeah it did, that's when he's running into problems.",

        "And in each one of those, obviously, the developments yielded a civilian government, but then the military took over.",
        "The protesters - they tried to avoid that same fate for a third time.",

        "What is the spark there?",
        "There are similar reasons in terms of the hardships of daily life.",
        "And in the case of Algeria, the spark was that the former president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who to all intents and purposes - I mean, when you see him in - on TV, he's in a wheelchair.",
        "He doesn't always seem to be conscious.",
        "And yet, it was announced that he was going to run for a fifth term.",
        "Algerians took to the street to say no. We cannot have that.",
        "He must be just a puppet.",
        "There are other players behind him trying to manipulate the situation for their own advantage.",
        "That's how it started.",
        "In each of these cases, in Sudan and in Algeria, is there a sort of an opposition figure like we've seen in Venezuela, for example, where Juan Guaido has sort of - has become recognized as the face of the opposition - like, the preferred leader?",
        "Is that the case in either of these places?"

        "That has been a unique characteristic of all these revolutions throughout North Africa and the Middle East since 2011.",
        "They have not actually produced a particular figurehead, so to speak, to lead them.",
        "And maybe that was done by design because the people who have risen against their governments - they don't always trust the conventional opposition, and they often feel that it's in cahoots with the regime that they're trying to topple.",
        "But we have seen the downside of that in terms of these protesters needing somebody to rally around and, you know, make their word heard much more forcefully than it would have been otherwise.",
        "In the specific case of Sudan, that's also - definitely that has been the case of a lot of protests, a lot of protesters, but so far, we haven't seen one person who can take all these events and galvanize them to actually help push for change.",

        "I think you can argue that.",
        "If they say he admitted fabricating this story - that brings up a certain image.",
        "But at the same time, if Ben Carson says he was offered a full scholarship - that also brings up a certain image.",
        "So I think there's a lot of parsing of words, a lot of trying to define what the meaning of is is.",
        "And I think that's just part of the name of the game at this point in the campaign.",
        "Well, let me just very briefly on this point though, that Dr. Carson argues again that he's - that President Obama did not face the same level of scrutiny that he had.",
        "And since I have the benefit of having both a Democrat and a Republican here, what do you think, Michael Steele?",
        "I think it's a matter of degree.",
        "I think with respect to some aspects of Obama's story, at least initially - and I think that's probably more of what Dr. Carson's referring to - you know, at a similar point in the campaign when he was battling against Hillary Clinton.",
        "There was not a great deal of scrutiny on Obama.",
        "When he got to the point where he was competitive and then started to pass her, it did pick up, but it was different.",
        "It was a different kind of scrutiny in the sense that there were a lot of questions about associations and relationships that weren't necessarily - now, conservative media drove home those storylines.",
        "But the mainstream media, as many conservatives would argue, did not.",
        "So I think that Carson's trying to draw that distinction much more than anything else.",
        "OK, Dru?",
        "Quite simply, I find that comment laughable.",
        "That - I mean, really?",
        "I believe that if anybody went back to the record - just like you said, once he showed competitiveness, it was as equally deep into his background, talking about where he grew up, et cetera.",
        "Whether you want to say it was more from a conservative media outlet or general media outlet, everybody picked it up.",
        "Everybody still talked about it.",
        "He still was questioned about it.",
