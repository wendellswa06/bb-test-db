        "I think in Taiwan, it really depends upon your political leanings.",
        "I think for a lot of people in Taiwan, this is a - kind of a scary moment because there is the possibility that President Ma could lead president Xi to think that the relationship has progressed beyond what most Taiwanese are comfortable with."
