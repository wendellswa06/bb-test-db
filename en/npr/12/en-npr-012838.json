        "The book is a narrative.",
        "It's not just a collection of notes or memos.",
        "But the memos are the source of McCabe's observations and insights and judgments about President Trump, whom he portrays at times as a liar and a bully.",
        "What else do we learn from this account about the overall tensions between the FBI and the president?",
        "The fundamental tension is between what McCabe sees as the bureau's independent mission - the FBI's independent mission - and Trump's understanding of that mission.",
        "In McCabe's view, Trump is not interested in the facts or the law but in who is on his team and who is not.",

        "So right now, we only have a rough idea.",
        "What we know is that 400,000 Venezuelans have signed up to help him do this.",
        "Yesterday, at one of the organizing meetings I went to, one of the leaders said that Guaido was planning to lead a convoy from Caracas to the border.",
        "And that's usually a 13-hour drive.",
        "But Guaido is planning to do that as a 30-day trek.",

        "And that obviously sets the stage for what could be a confrontation that could easily turn violent.",

        "What are they saying about that?",
        "I've heard mixed emotions - anxiety, fear, hope.",
        "But the kind of overwhelming feeling I've heard is that Venezuelans are sick of the situation, and they want something to change.",

        "You'd think that they'd have a million questions for these people, but they don't.",
        "In the latest transcript, they have one or two but there's no follow-up.",

        "There could be a little bit of puffery involved, but fundamentally these people are telling the truth.",

        "It fits into the ideological narratives.",

        "But the CCR's Dixon says the validity of the confessions needs to be tested.",

        "Multi-faceted sounds from here as though it's going to involve lots of different negotiating points to stall for time.",
        "That's been the Iranian negotiating strategy for at least the last year.",
        "And getting fixated on details and parsing the fine points of the West's offer from Tehran's perspective is the best way to stretch these negotiations out as far as they can go.",
        "So it seems like it's just going to involve endless negotiating over small points.",
        "If what you anticipate is an Iranian effort to stretch out negotiations, do you get any implication from the Iranian leadership that they're amenable to compromise at some point, that the negotiations might lead to an actual deal?",
        "Well, were the deal to actually include what the Iranian government wants, which is primarily security guarantees from the U.S., that the U.S.",
        "will give up this language of regime change and accept Iran as an Islamic republic as it is, I think that would be very compelling for the Iranian leadership.",
        "The problem is they don't see the Bush administration as inclined to offer that and don't know whether they should even trust any security guarantees that this package might include.",
        "So the way they see it, there's really nothing that this Bush administration can offer them that they would feel that they could trust enough to accept.",
        "So more likely that they'll try and hold off for two years.",
        "Azadeh Moaveni, I want you to put Iranian behavior here in the context of other things happening in the region.",
        "How do the Iranians, for example, read the sectarian violence between Shiite Muslims and Sunnis in Iraq and the fighting between Shiite Muslims, Hezbollah, and the Israelis in southern Lebanon, for example?",
        "Well, Iran has really tried to strike a position in the region as one that's above sectarian violence.",
        "And that's why they declared Hezbollah's resistance against Israel - as they described it - as a great victory.",
        "Because the Iranian regime thinks that having public opinion in the region on its side gives it great strength in dealing with the international community when it comes to its nuclear problem."

        "So Iran, we've seen over the last several months that it has tried to gain more and more popularity in the region, and having Hezbollah become the equivalent of a rock star in the Arab world plays to Iran's advantage.",
        "How would Iranians in Tehran, say, regard the notion of Iran bankrolling the reconstruction of southern Lebanon and the southern suburbs of Beirut, say, the Shiite neighborhoods that were bombed heavily by the Israelis?",
        "Most Iranians I think would be extremely displeased to know that any government money or oil revenue is being used for those purposes.",
