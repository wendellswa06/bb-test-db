        "Harold Bloom appears to be having his own struggle with God in his new book, \"\"Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine.\"\" Bloom is a renowned author and literary critic at Yale University.",
        "He spoke with us at length from his home in New Haven.",
        "Bloom describes himself as a cultural Jew and he reads the Bible as literature.",
        "Yet he appears tormented by what he thinks is the absence of the Hebrew God from the world, and Bloom is troubled by the meaning of the covenant, God's promise to preserve and bless his chosen people.",
        "I think when I was a very small boy, undoubtedly following the influence of my late mother, I trusted in the covenant.",
        "In normative Judaism, you ask not for belief; you ask for `Emunah,' the Hebrew word, which is `trust.",
        "You're asked not even to trust in God, in Yahweh, but in the trust, you're asked to trust in the covenant between by Yahweh and yourself or between Yahweh and the Jewish people, which includes yourself.",
        "And you no longer have that trust.",
        "It seems to me that Yahweh could have been convicted of desertion and abandonment a very long time ago.",
        "Explain.",
        "All through the Hebrew Bible, the prophets perpetually proclaim that the Jewish people, that Israel, has failed to keep the covenant with Yahweh.",
        "Nowhere do they say what is palpably true on the basis of Jewish history and of human history in general, which is that Yahweh has failed to keep his covenant with the people.",
        "I say in the book again and again that when Yahweh, which is the name of the high god ultimately in the Hebrew Bible, that when Yahweh is asked by Moses to give Moses his name and in the Hebrew, Yahweh punning on his own name, massively says, `Tell them that (Hebrew spoken) has sent you,' which is translated in the King James Bible ultimately as `I am that I am,' which I translate in order to get it into an English that will make sense, `I will be present wherever and whenever I choose to be present,' which also implies its rather frightening corollary, `And I will absent wherever and whenever I choose to be absent.",
        "It seems to me that he has chosen to be absent throughout most of human history, including Jewish history.",
        "You're a literary critic.",
        "What does it mean to read the Bible as a literary critic?",
        "Most of us, obviously, don't read it in that way.",
        "What do you learn about religion from that view?",
        "I have never accepted, and I argue against it throughout the book, the distinction between sacred texts and secular texts.",
        "There is a sense in which necessarily Yahweh, Jesus Christ, Jesus of Nazareth, Jacob, Moses are just as much literary characters as are King Lear, Macbeth, Hamlet, Falstaff.",
        "There are people who, of course, have direct experiences of the divine.",
        "There are--I have talked myself in the course of my life to literally hundreds--I guess by now it's thousands of Americans who feel that they have had frequent conversations directly with Jesus.",
        "I do not question this; I do not doubt them.",
        "But the figure whom they believe they are encountering, whom perhaps they do encounter, nevertheless is a figure known to them in the first place because he is in the pages of a book.",
        "Therefore, in some sense necessarily, he and God, in any manifestation, are literary characters.",
        "We're speaking with Harold Bloom about his new book, \"\"Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine.",
        "You compare Jesus to Hamlet.",
        "The trendy thing these days is to ask, `What would Jesus do?",
        "People wear bracelets and such with little sayings on it as if Jesus would know exactly what to do in any situation.",
        "However, Hamlet is famously indecisive."

        "He may be famously indecisive.",

        "He is moody, he is abrupt, he is very violent, he is surpassingly intelligent and he is, in the end, a very dangerous if fascinating kind of a person.",
        "I just don't know that that is the image that we have of Jesus.",
        "We have, my dear, thousands and thousands of images of Jesus.",
        "There are, as I count them, seven different versions of Jesus in the canonical Greek New Testament, and they have nothing in common with one another.",
        "The one who fascinates me is the Jesus of the Gospel of Mark, almost certainly the first one to be written.",
        "Most people do not have the actual image of Jesus as he appears in the Gospel of Mark, where he is, like Hamlet, subject to sudden changes in mood.",
        "He is not violent, but he is unpredictable.",
        "He is abrupt.",
        "The Jesus of the Gospel of Mark speaks endlessly in riddles and enigmas and dark sayings and parables of one sort or another.",
        "He, by the way, never says that he is the Messiah.",
        "Indeed, he seems to be genuinely puzzled as to his mission and his own identity.",
        "He's perpetually saying to the disciples, `But who do people say I am?",
        "But he is an immensely moving figure.",
        "Unlike the Jesus of the other three Gospels, he goes through a night of incredible agony as he waits for the day in which inevitably he knows that he will be immolated, and that night is conveyed with powerful effect.",
        "Well, if Jesus is to Hamlet for you, Yahweh, the God of the Hebrew Bible, comes closest to King Lear, a passionate, impulsive figure.",
        "I think that Shakespeare probably founds his extraordinary figure of King Lear--irascible, jealous, intense, immensely awesome, angry, bereft, dangerous--on the Geneva Bible's version of--which is essentially not very different from what is now the authorized, the King James...",
        "I mean, I've got to interrupt you and just say that those descriptions that you just gave are not what we think of when people of faith think of God.",

        "He said 50 years from Bloody Sunday, the march is not yet finished but we're getting closer.",
