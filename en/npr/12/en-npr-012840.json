        "We're talking with Yale University Professor Harold Bloom.",
        "His new book is \"\"Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine.",
        "Harold Bloom, you say that Shakespeare would have never let Hamlet and Lear share the same stage.",
        "Absolutely not.",
        "No.",
        "And now you make the case that the God of the Hebrew Bible is just as incompatible with the God of Christianity.",
        "The basic argument of this book, \"\"Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine,\"\" is that we have three very different personages or beings: the more or less historical Jesus of Nazareth, a Jew of the first century of the common era; the Greek theological formulation, or God, Jesus Christ; and the original God of the Hebrews, now greatly shrunken into God the Father, Yahweh, he who will be present wherever and whenever he chooses to be present and will keep himself absent when perhaps we most want him and need him.",
        "These three figures are so incompatible with one another that I don't believe it is possible to bring them coherently together in any single statement.",
        "They come out of totally different realms of discourse.",
        "Trying to think them together is really an act of psychic violence.",
        "In the end, the disturbing thing I...",
        "What do you mean psychic violence?",
        "I mean that the operations of the mind have got to become extremely distorted in order to bring the more or less historical Jesus, the Greek theological God Jesus Christ and the human, all-too-human God, Yahweh, into some coherent relationship.",
        "The normal processes of thought are being disturbed, and an act of imposition is taking place.",
        "Now you write that a Messiah who is God and who dies on the cross as an atonement for sins is irreconcilable with the Hebrew Bible.",
        "Why is that?",
        "Yahweh does not commit suicide.",
        "And if one is to take the argument of Christianity, then Yahweh is, in effect, committing suicide through his supposed son.",
        "Yahweh also does not, even as a descending dove upon a human female virgin, bring forth a son.",
        "This is material that comes to one out of Greek and pagan traditions but has nothing to do with traditional Judaism.",
        "Harold Bloom, you conclude that it's really a myth for us to talk about this Judeo-Christian outlook."

        "I think that it is very good for social reconciliation, but Judeo-Christian tradition is a myth.",
        "As I quote the great scholar of Hebraic matters Jacob Neusner as saying, \"\"Judaism and Christianity are different groups of people talking different languages about different Gods to very different people.\"\" There is no Judeo-Christian tradition anymore than there could be, say, a Christian-Islamic tradition.",
        "And, of course, I'm a great realist, my dear.",
        "As I say at one point in the book, there are now at least one and a half billion people in the world who are Islam.",
        "There are at least one and a half billion people in the world who are self-described as Christians.",
        "Whether 50 years from now, there will be of the 14 million now self-identified Jews more than a mere scattering, I would not be prepared to say.",
        "What that means about the existence of Yahweh is also a very interesting question.",
        "He is, after all, covenanted.",
        "Would he survive the disappearance of the Jewish people if that, indeed, is what happens?",
        "I do not know.",
        "I may, as I say, lack trust in the covenant, but though I keep asking Yahweh to go away, I say so many times in this book, he won't go away.",
        "He haunts me.",
        "You really want Yahweh to go away?",
        "Yes, I would love him to go away, but he won't.",
        "He wakes you up at night.",
        "He wakes me up at night, yeah.",
        "He gives me nightmares.",
        "I brood about him during the day.",
        "My mother died fully trusting in the covenant with him, and I suppose my father did also.",
        "That Yahweh will not go away even though I want him to...",
        "It could be a sign of a covenant.",
        "I sometimes joke that if you come to our hospital missing a finger, no one will believe you till we get a CAT scan, an MRI and an orthopedic consult.",
        "We just don't trust our senses.",
        "Yes, but not a covenant in which I am willing to trust.",
        "He does not seem to me trustworthy.",
        "But, of course, rather massively, it may be that he never meant to be trustworthy.",
        "To say, `(Hebrew spoken), I will be present or absent depending upon where and when I wish to be present or absent,' is, from a literary as well as from a human point of view, an extraordinary remark.",
        "It carries enormous authority and force, and again, it is very difficult to argue with or against.",
        "Harold Bloom's new book is \"\"Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine.\"\" We spoke with him from New Haven."
