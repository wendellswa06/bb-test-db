        "Claudio, the Office for Civil Rights is back in business.",
        "That's Rosalyn Ali, assistant secretary in the Office for Civil Rights.",
        "Every year, she says her office gets about 6,300 complaints, violations that include suspending and disciplining black children more often and more harshly than other children, ignoring the needs of non-English speaking students, and denying students access to college preparatory and advance placement programs, just to name a few.",
        "The results, says Ali, are tragic.",
        "African-American students are six times less likely to be college and career-ready in biology than their white counterparts, or four times less likely to be college-ready in Algebra.",
        "We see districts where only 3 percent of high school English language learners are performing at grade level in math and in English.",
        "Ali says Latinos and blacks are also more likely to get the worst, least experienced teachers.",
        "Her task...",
        "Conduct 38 investigations around 40 different issues under our jurisdiction.",
        "School districts and states that have been targeted may not know for weeks who they are.",
        "Education Department officials want to carefully choreograph these investigations so that they're not perceived as lowering the boom without first reaching out to school officials and getting their cooperation.",
        "How the black community views these investigations is important, too.",
        "Many black parents no longer care if their children sit next to white children, as long as they get the same educational resources and opportunities.",
        "Latinos, on the other hand, pose a very different set of civil rights challenges.",
        "Tom Saenz of the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund says in some states, Latinos can't even register for school without proof of their immigration status.",
        "Which has been unlawful since 1982 in a United States Supreme Court decision.",
        "And yet it happens all the time says, Saenz.",
        "As for the desegregation of schools, Signs agrees.",
        "Like most black parents, Latinos just want good teachers and safe neighborhood schools, where their children at least have a shot at catching up with their white peers."

        "Wichita responded.",

        "We stopped Amtrak.",
        "We evacuated people.",
        "It was, you know, a lot of recovery for, you know, physical recovery for the firefighters, probably about a 12-hour ordeal.",
        "It was - I mean this is a fire that was burning so hot it was just melting cement cinderblock.",

        "How many of the nation's firefighters are volunteer, and who are they?",
        "Well, it's hard to have exact numbers, but there's approximately 1.1 million firefighters in the United States, and somewhere over 800,000 of those are volunteer."
