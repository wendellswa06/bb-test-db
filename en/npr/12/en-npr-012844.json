        "No, it happens in cities, as well, and in fact only the very, very large cities for the most part are completely career departments, paid career departments.",
        "Most suburban and urban departments out including rural and what - there's even a lesser developed title called frontier, which is the people that are way out in the rural, they're all staffed either in a combination or fully volunteered situation.",
        "And do you happen to know, is this something that's developed over time, or does this stem back from the way things used to be and still are?",
        "Well both.",
        "The history of the fire service is it started as a volunteer entity, and then somewhere when community demanded it by its needs, a paid department started.",
        "And I think that was - it might even have been in Philadelphia, I think, was the first paid fire department.",
        "But it's usually driven by the needs of the community and what the community is willing to pay for.",
        "And most of the time - and in fact I would say all of the time, really the most cost-effective emergency services are delivered through a combination system or an all-volunteer system, just dependent upon the situation at hand in that community.",
        "But they still must be funded somehow, right?",
        "Are their trucks and equipment?",
        "Is this tax dollars we're talking about for volunteer fire groups?",
        "It really covers a wide range of funding devices.",
        "There are many small departments that have no funding whatsoever, that everything that they do they have to raise on their own, and pancake breakfasts, car washes, raffles, and, you know, there's maybe some community organizations that donate to the service."
