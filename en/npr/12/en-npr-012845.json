        "The training, we are - I'm on a combination department, but I am on the volunteer side.",
        "But, you know, I have to - I have to be certified to hazmat operations level, to EMT basic life support level and fire one and two, which is hundreds and hundreds of hours of training and then continuing ed after that to keep yourself certified and up to date.",
        "And what's the call that you will never forget, Robert?",
        "Sure, OK, the worst calls, of course, are, you know, neighbors, people that you know.",
        "And that's one thing, anyone considering, you know, joining up with a volunteer department certainly needs to take into account that inevitably you're going to, you know, respond to a call, a critical call, and it's going to be somebody you know.",
        "It's going to be a neighbor.",
        "And that happened a number of times, actually, for me.",
        "But the one call was two young Amish kids that were - they passed away due to a car versus their horse cart.",
        "And then their three other siblings that were also on the cart were critically injured.",
        "We had, you know, we had to fly them out.",
        "So we had a lot of - we had a lot of response, personnel that responded and, you know, trying to coordinate landing zones and just, you know, patient care, but then just the aftermath of that, just, you know, seeing the parents around.",
        "And the parents actually had us over a year later for just a cookout, just to thank us, and, you know, it strikes to your heart because these are people that you work with.",
        "And then we, in turn, go to our day jobs and just have this, you know, this emotional stuff, baggage that we just need to deal with.",
        "And our department's pretty good about it.",
        "And I certainly - I make a point to, you know, deal with it and not bottle it up, because there are certainly guys that do that, and I just know that it comes back to get them in different ways, and I don't - yeah.",

        "It is small communities, and it is your neighbors, and that's the tough part.",
        "But the call I will always remember is my daughter, at a very young age - well, in her 20s - is a combat medic in the Army.",
        "And she was home on leave, and I got a call to a gunshot wound, to an attempted suicide.",
        "And she flew into the truck to go with me because she is qualified to deal with those things.",
        "And we were the first ones on scene.",
        "And I was a little spooked about how she was going to handle this, because it's graphic.",
        "And she didn't flinch.",
        "She was able to maintain the airway on our patient.",
        "She stayed with it the entire time, even when other people came.",
        "And she's a tiny little puff of smoke, and she didn't flinch, not once.",
        "She stayed on a bag valve mask, and she kept air to the patient for a considerable amount of time while we got a helicopter in and landed.",
        "And that was just a real proud moment for me to watch my daughter, who, you know, is sometimes squeamish and everything, but when it came down to going to work, she went to work and she did the job, and she did it better than men that I have watched do this that have done it for 20 years.",
        "And on the spot, she succeeded at an amazing level.",
        "You must be very proud.",
        "Ty, thank you so much for sharing that.",

        "Yes.",
        "I just wanted to thank all of the volunteers that you've had on the air and all of those out there listening.",
        "But I also want to make mention of the fact that when that alarm goes off, or when that pager goes off and those men go out the door, that there are families left at home who just sit and wait.",
        "And as the wife of a volunteer firefighter, it's just something that you just have to learn to accept and deal with.",
        "And at first, it's very difficult, but I don't want to say that you get used to it, but it's less alarming every time they head out the door.",
        "Thank you so much, Morgan."

        "They do have a tendency to be, for the large majority, blue-collar workers.",
        "And a lot of times what they find - as was mentioned earlier - looking to give back to the community.",
        "They're also looking to be a part of something a little bit bigger than themselves, and maybe doing something a little bit more than what they do that puts food on the table and pays the bills.",
        "They want to have that self-satisfaction that they get from helping their neighbors, from helping the people that pass through their communities and for giving at just a little bit higher level.",
        "There has to be a great deal of pride and ownership because of the sacrifices that they make to be there, like was mentioned earlier, where they get up and leave the place.",
        "They get up and leave Christmas morning, birthdays.",
        "All types of family events are interrupted when the tones go off.",
        "And so that sacrifice has to come from deep within those people, or they just won't do it.",
        "And anybody can do it, but not everybody can do it.",
        "It takes a huge commitment on the individual and the family.",
        "And that's why the most successful departments are those departments that truly encompass and involve the family in all aspects of the department.",
        "And as a reminder of just how dangerous this volunteer work is, we have an email from Kim in Reno: The most memorable was September 17th, 1983, when I was severely burned while fighting a wildland fire, given less than a 5 percent chance to live.",
        "I am still alive and kicking and participating.",

        "Volunteer firefighter, EMT.",
        "There isn't a volunteer who doesn't go through the exact same training as any paid firefighter.",
        "So the giving is immense.",
        "It is about the community, but it takes a special person to be able to deal with that.",
        "The worst call would be my partner, we're the two biggest ones, so we were paired together.",
        "And we get this smell up here, and we get suicides.",
        "The gentleman's brother was - had done himself in in the bathroom with his belt, and my friend was big enough to lift him off.",
        "And, anyway, I started compressions, over a hundred beats per minute.",
        "That was done for the family.",
        "We knew he was gone, but there's so many things that we do do that people don't know about, and we don't expect a thank-you (unintelligible)."

        "Where does it stand?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "With the economy, the funding has been impacted on all levels, and it's put even a larger burden on the firefighters themselves to try and raise money and to do even more than what they would normally do, which takes more time - more time away from their family.",
        "And then one thing...",

        "Several women have come forward with stories of moments, they say, in which Mr. Biden made them feel extremely uncomfortable by hugging them or getting too close.",
        "Yesterday, the former vice president made his first public appearance since those allegations and commented on the matter.",

        "It is Mitt Romney, who's been at or near the top all the way.",
        "Ron Paul is in these top group of four, and Newt Gingrich.",
        "Well, you know something?",
        "I mean, you know, here's the problem about having such a long pre-presidential campaign season and that is before the voters even get a chance to do it, but we smarty-pants analysts all wrote off Newt Gingrich early in the year when, basically, his entire staff quit en mass.",
        "His fundraising numbers were really, really down.",
        "He was basically an asterisk in the poll and, actually, a similar thing happened to John McCain in 2007 when his staff quit and we said he was finished, too.",
        "And, of course, that showed how much we knew."

        "Now, some people think it's a little condescending.",
        "Some people think it's a little mean the way he'll attack the moderators like, what a stupid you asked, or he'll roll his eyes at the absurdity.",
        "How dare you ask me such a question like that?",
        "But for the most part, his answers have been solid.",

        "Right.",
        "That's a report from Bloomberg News that came out that between $1.6 million and $1.8 million he's taken from Freddie Mac since he left the speakership after the 1998 disastrous - even though the Republicans kept control of the House, but it was a disaster for the Republicans and Newt Gingrich.",
        "So he took a $1.5 million from Freddie Mac and, again, this is somebody who hates the ways of Washington and hates the lobbyists of Washington.",
        "Of course, he says he wasn't a lobbyist.",

        "But we didn't talk about it because he was inconsequential.",
