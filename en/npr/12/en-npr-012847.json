        "When you have a lot of candidates on the stage and multiple people from our end at CNBC poised to ask questions, the management of the microphone is kind of difficult and when the moment, as you could hear in that clip, sort of drifted into humor and there was laughter and Perry was smiling and Mitt Romney said, EPA, and it was unclear at that moment whether, in fact, that was the agency."

        "And Maria Bartiromo, my colleague, was about to go to another question and then a producer in our production truck - you know, these people never get seen by the public, but they play a huge role in having a successful production - yelled in my ear, don't stop, because he was aware that Perry had not answered the question.",
        "And so that's when I said, seriously?",
        "Is the EPA the one?",
        "And when he acknowledged, no, the natural follow-up was, OK.",

        "And he couldn't.",
        "Then it, you know, produced that remarkable moment.",
        "And, for good or ill, his campaign was in trouble before that, but that moment may be remembered as the death of the 2012 Perry campaign.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I don't know if it's the death or, you know, one more blow to a campaign that was struggling, but the relevant point, though, Neal, is that one of the reasons his campaign was struggling was because of prior debate performances.",
        "So it is, without a doubt, correct that the debate season this fall has shaped the campaign in a way that exceeds any campaign in my memory and I think that's partly because many of the Republicans running are running kind of one-man-band campaigns.",
        "They don't have big organizations, so they're not contesting on the ground in Iowa and New Hampshire the way past traditional kind of leading candidates have done.",
        "These are people whose campaigns have largely existed on the debates and that's where they rise or fall.",
        "And debates - another way to think of them is free air time.",

        "Because I asked him about the $300,000 he got from Freddie Mac as a consultant.",
        "And now it's come out today that he, in fact, got a lot more than $300,000.",
        "And so, in yet another way, that debate is having a life beyond the two hours last Wednesday night.",
        "Ken?",
        "John, you know, it's not that you asked a gotcha question.",
        "I mean, Hal Bruno, my former boss at ABC who just passed away last week - and he's the one who asked, you know, Admiral Stockdale, your opening statement, sir?",
        "And he said, who am I and why am I here?",
        "And that, you know, caused another kerfuffle back in 1992.",

        "And also how much time to spend on the people who appear to be most likely to win the nomination, as compared to those who are benefiting from the free air time, but don't really have much of a chance.",

        "How much is it about Romney and Perry?",
        "How much it's about Cain, since he's been rising in the polls and dogged by a controversy, the sexual harassment issue that had nothing to do with the subject of our debate.",

        "We got booed at that point.",

        "We've seen audience reactions at earlier debates on issues like the death penalty and gay rights make themselves part of the story, too.",
        "John Harwood is with us, CNBC's chief Washington correspondent, and among those who moderated a presidential debate this year.",
        "Of course, it seems like everybody has.",

        "There are moments we all remember, but there is more debates than ever.",
        "What is the cumulative effect, do you think?",
        "Well, I think the cumulative effect, as John just mentioned, is that it really has kind of jump-started this campaign a little bit early.",
        "It's also created space for people who are nontraditional politicians to become part of the process.",
        "But I do want to take issue with one thing you just said - is the number of debates is excessive?",
        "I went back and looked at the roster for 2004...",
        "Well, can I just jump in for one thing?",
        "Alan, while I'm thinking about that, in 2008, there were 19 Republican debates.",
        "There have been 11 so far this year and there are 14 more scheduled, so that's like 25, 26 debates, so all told, 2012 will break all the records.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It will if they all go through.",
        "Of course, that's the other thing.",
        "A lot of times, debates get scheduled and planned and then don't actually come to fruition.",
        "And as we've seen the moment, the campaign seems to - as John mentioned earlier, is being defined by these debates.",
        "Well, absolutely.",
        "And I think that's not such a bad thing.",
        "I mean, I would argue that these debates are doing what debates are supposed to do, which is give us a glimpse into both the personalities and the positions of the candidates and in a way that allows for kind of an extensive consideration because it's happening over a long period of time, and it's involving a lot of people.",
        "So it's a winnowing process.",
        "It hasn't winnowed much yet, but it will soon.",
        "And I think the debates have been extremely valuable in that regard.",
        "Ask Tim Pawlenty.",
        "But Ken, one of the things, the constant criticisms of American campaigns, especially for higher office, is that you can't do it unless you've got a lot of money and an established organization.",
        "That seems to be turning on its head.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "I mean, in the old - I was just saying the same thing, in the old days, if you have the boots on the ground, the organization in states like Iowa, New Hampshire, that was the key.",
        "But if you're a great debater, if you're a Newt Gingrich, as I said, the smartest guy in the room, you could just stand up there and just, you know, woo the audiences.",
        "And there's something very interesting, Alan, about this particularly - particular cycle, and that it seems like a soap opera, like, remember, friends, last week we heard Herman say this, and Rick Perry said this.",
        "What will he do this week?",
