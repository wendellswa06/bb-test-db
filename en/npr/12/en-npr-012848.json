        "Yeah.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think that's exactly right.",
        "It is the miniseries effect, and it is the reality television effect, and it gets very addictive.",
        "And I think these audiences of four, five million people doesn't seem like a lot, but for a cable news timeslot, that's a huge audience.",
        "And I think the reason is that people are getting sort of suckered into the - not suckered into, sucked into the whole thing as, you know, just a cumulative effect of a lot of debates.",

        "Hi.",
        "Two quick comments.",
        "One, I actually have a very - I'm from a liberal left progressive perspective, I have a very positive impression of the structure of the Republican primary debates because I think that there's a significant democratization effect of precisely those types of candidates that wouldn't be covered by the, you know, corporate interests behind the major media outlets and also who don't have the same level - equal level of funding.",
        "So I think that's important.",
        "I think the number actually gives them, the public, ample time to look at these ways that each candidate is responding to the issues in text format after the debates, so the kind of archived effect presents a lot more raw material for analysis than a very limited controlled process.",
        "And the second comment I want to make is that I don't know who your masters at the Brookings Institute are, whoever is putting this gag order, but I think the lack of coverage of Ron Paul's candidacy, who I differ from in many, many respects...",
        "And did you hear him on Political Junkie about a month ago?"

        "...you need to address the Ron Paul show in the polls.",

        "I don't support him for many reasons, but I do support some of his perspective.",
        "And it's just a - it's an obvious bias, some kind of gag order maybe originates - I don't know the politics of it, but maybe you could expound on the obscene lack of coverage of his presence and performance in the polls...",
        "Caleb, again, I will just refer you to the broadcast interview with Ron Paul that we had on this program – what, about five, six weeks ago, within the last month and a half, in any case.",
        "But thanks very much for the comment.",
        "You're listening to Political Junkie on TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",

        "Neal, I'm sorry.",
        "When we're sitting not across from each other, it's difficult.",
        "Can I just address the first two callers because there's something that they have in common.",
        "The first guy said that we focus too much on gaffes and not about substance, and the second guy talks about, you know, the Brookings Institute, our masters, keep us from talking about Ron Paul.",
        "And then I have this question for John Harwood.",
        "John, on - there was another debate on Saturday night that not many people watched because it was Saturday night.",
        "But it was pretty instructive to me, interesting to me that it was about foreign policy, and basically they're talking about - the candidates were talking about, well, you know, let's wipe out Iran, let's attack Iran if they build a nuclear weapon or let's, you know, let's approve waterboarding.",
        "And that was pretty instructive.",
        "And I think that didn't get much attention.",
        "That's true.",
        "And Ron Paul got very little airtime in that debate and was complaining about it afterwards.",
        "On both – on both the military attack and on waterboarding.",
        "Yes.",
        "And took different positions on both.",
        "Yeah.",

        "But about 10 minutes later, he invited some kids in the audience up on stage.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "Exactly.",
        "And I think one of the reasons for that is I'm imagining from the perspective of my colleagues at CBS and National Journal, is that Ron Paul, for all intents and purposes, is not a Republican, especially on those issues, and for that reason I think people accurately see him - this is one way of being responsive to the caller's question, why doesn't Ron Paul get covered more, is because in the estimation of most people who follow this process, his chances of winning the Republican nomination are essentially nil.",
        "And if that's the case, then you've got to wonder, like, is your debate most usefully spent by voters on candidates with a greater chance to win.",
        "We have - during our debate, we had people, a team of people in our production truck tracking the amount of airtime that each candidate got and using that to guide us to make sure that we didn't leave anybody too short.",
        "Rick Santorum got the least at five and a half minutes.",
        "Mitt Romney got almost 10 minutes.",
        "And that to some degree reflects their prospects in the race.",
        "You focus on the people with a greater chance.",
        "Ron Paul has run as a libertarian for president.",
        "He has said he might not support the Republican nominee.",
        "Yes, he has a respectable chunk in the polls, but I think his chances of building on that are quite small and that influences how reporters view him.",
        "One other question about debate preparation - we have seen in other debates, including this year and in other years, of course, some questions that are really fluff.",
        "It's the equivalent of the boxers-or-briefs question.",
        "Do those come up in your production meeting, and did you think about that at all?",
        "Yes.",
        "We had a - depending on how the time worked out for the earlier questions, we had a round of short-answer questions designed to be different.",
        "One of the reasons people do those is A) to be honest, some of the political stuff that you and me and Ken spend our days talking about are boring to many average viewers, and so we're trying to find something relatable; B) we're trying to get something that they might not have scripted, so that we see how they react in the moment, even if something is not a serious public policy issue.",
        "But in fact, in our debate we had so much conversation that seemed to go to the core of the economic issue that we were exploring that we ended up consuming the time without going to those fluffier questions.",
        "John Harwood, thanks very much and congratulations.",
        "My pleasure.",
        "Thanks so much.",
