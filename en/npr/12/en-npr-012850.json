        "So when you asked earlier about the impact of this, it really these hidden costs are very real.",
        "They're getting higher every day.",
        "We have, as I say, tremendous support from the business community, from the philanthropic community in helping to fill that gap.",
        "But failing that, many of these youngsters, frankly, just will begin the kind of recede into the background a little bit and it's not until someone begins to help them kind of catch up both financially and, unfortunately, academically as well that they begin to kind of flower.",
        "So Genea and Janelle, can you give us some advice about what to do, whether you're a parent, a teacher, someone who cares about schools, in terms of dealing with these financial costs but also with the way that kids expect certain things or want certain things or feel the pressures themselves to fit in?",
        "Genea, what about you?",
        "My advice is to always keep a line of communication with your children.",
        "You let them know, okay, these are the things that we need to get, one necessity that you need for school right now and what are our luxury?",
        "You have to sit down and explain to your children.",
        "Certain things are luxury, certain things are necessities.",
        "Necessity is what you must have.",
        "And you sit down because this is what our budget is.",
        "That's something my mother did with us, I mean, my brother and sisters.",
        "So, and I do it with my son.",
        "Janelle, what about you?",
        "Well, I would say for someone before they even go into the teaching profession is to their homework and to try to talk to other teachers and other educators to find out what are some of the costs and on average, how much will it cost and then to really say is this the career for me.",
        "And so, you are prepared once you get into the classroom, especially for the first couple of years when you are building your classroom.",
        "You are going to have to spend a good amount of money.",
        "But I think after that, one of the things is for us to try to keep and teachers are known as, you know, pack rats, just forward everything and just make sure that you make good use of whatever materials that you have.",
        "Try to hold on to things.",
        "And then, also, learn to be resourceful.",
        "I mean, there are organizations, such as DonorsChoose, that are willing to help teachers with supplies, - and we have to be resourceful in terms of going into our communities looking for businesses or individuals who are willing to donate.",
        "There are a lot of grants out there.",
        "So I think it's about making sure that we are also resourceful and soliciting for some of those materials that we do need.",
        "So we're going to have to end it right there.",
        "And I want to thank all of you for joining us.",
        "Thank you."

        "Well, we may have come one step closer because this week, a team of researchers revealed a translucent, flexible circuit, a sort of electronic skin that you can apply to your own skin just like a temporary tattoo.",
        "And once the device is activated, it can monitor your heartbeat, the flexing of your muscles, your brainwaves.",
        "It can even detect speech.",
        "And outfitted with a wireless transmitter, it could send all that data straight to your computer or maybe even to your doctor, or who knows, the limits of the imagination of things we might be able to do with this.",

        "Did I describe it correctly?",
        "Pretty close, yeah.",
        "What we've tried to do here is to create a form of electronics that has its physical properties, in particular its elastic module, its bending, rigidity and thickness, matched to the upper layer of the skin, the epidermis.",
        "And in that form, it can integrate in a very natural way, you know, both mechanically and electrically to, you know, allow monitoring of physiological status and even do forms of stimulation.",
        "How did you make this?",
        "How did you pack all that electronics into something so thin it feels like you're wearing just a tattoo?",
        "Well, it's a good question.",
        "I mean, if you look at conventional silicon integrated circuits, they're built on the surfaces of silicon wafers.",
        "They're about a half a millimeter thick.",
        "And they have the properties of a plate of glass.",
        "It's flat, it's rigid, brittle.",
        "You drop it, it breaks.",
        "And so that's not a very good starting point, you know, if you want to build a class of electronics that looks like the body, you know, soft and curvilinear and elastic.",
        "But it - you know, and so initially that looks like a gigantic gap, a chasm you'd have to cross, but it turns out it's not all that hard, you know, at least intuitively.",
        "You make silicon extremely thin.",
        "And elementary bending mechanics dictates that as things get thinner, they become more flexible because their bending rigidity goes down.",
        "And then we structure those thin sheets of silicon into filamentary serpentine shapes, build devices in that kind of geometry, interconnect them with wires that have the same shape into almost a spider web type of open-mesh format in the electronics.",
        "And if you take that kind of system, and you bond it to a thin sheet of a rubber like silicone, then you can make an overall circuit system that mimics the skin in terms of its mechanical properties.",
        "And so it can feel anything or react to anything that goes through the skin, like a muscle reaction or anything.",
        "Well, almost anything.",
        "I mean, we demonstrated a set of building blocks for, you know, a variety kind of circuits and sensors.",
        "So we did, you know, transistors is a sort of obvious one, LEDs.",
        "We also did diodes, resistors, inductors, antennas, and we also demonstrated some sensor functionality.",
        "So we have electrophysiological sensors, basically electrode pads that can sense electrical activity in the body.",
        "You can also stimulate through the skin with those same pads.",
        "We have temperature sensors, strain sensors so we can measure motion of the skin, as well."

        "And we took some of those building blocks and put them together to make functional devices for measuring activity of the heart, the brain and the skeletal muscles.",
        "So why is this better than the current technologies we have for measuring vital signs?",
        "Well, I think in a variety of ways.",
        "I mean, if you look at the standard technologies, you're probably familiar with them.",
        "You see them in the hospital.",
        "They involve rigid point-contact electrodes you tape onto the skin, or you affix them there with a mechanical strap.",
        "Then a bulk wire goes to a separately located box of rigid electronics, you know, and that's kind of the way it's done.",
        "And that's great for lots of applications clinically.",
        "It can be used for a research setting, as well.",
        "But it's not that comfortable.",
        "It's irritating to the skin.",
        "It constrains the motion.",
        "The number of electrode interfaces that you can add, just from a practical standpoint, is limited by the bulk wiring.",
        "And so I think, you know, our approach maybe represents an advance over that more traditional interface in the sense that it brings all of the electronics and a multitude of electrodes into contact with the skin in a very non-invasive natural way that's mechanically invisible to the person who's wearing the device because it's not constraining the motion of the skin at all.",
        "So you might envision a consumer use and a medical use, for example.",
        "Potentially.",

        "Our main focus from a research standpoint is on healthcare related applications because I think that's the most impactful, you know, class of use of this kind of device.",
        "So we're spending our time mostly in that arena, physiological status monitoring, human-machine interfaces, devices to assist with physical rehabilitation, these kinds of things.",
        "But there's no reason why you couldn't monitor your own heart rate if you're a runner or a pulse if, you know, if you have problems or how much you're doing of anything.",
        "I - you know, there's - a lot of this book is also a critique of sort of commodified feminism.",
        "And that's something - you know, the sort of feminism of conferences that people pay $500 to attend and listen to talks about feminism - you know, like all these products that are marketed as empowering.",
        "But yet I would not have a career if not for the fact that feminism has been marketable.",
        "And I am lucky that it has been.",
        "So I read that chapter about optimization as, like, you lambasting it.",
