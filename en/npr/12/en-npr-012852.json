        "Well, I think there's a lot of things.",
        "You know, this is a first step.",

        "So, you know, on the engineering side, I think power and communications, those are the two big, you know, functions that you would want to have embedded directly in this system.",
        "We demonstrated a couple of ideas on power, inductive wireless powering coil that works pretty well.",

        "They're very tiny.",
        "They're not generating that much power.",
        "So in both cases, I think we'd like to be able to couple to a storage device, either storage capacitor or battery.",
        "We don't have those yet.",
        "So that represents one topic that we're focusing on now.",
        "On the communications side, we demonstrated a lot of building blocks that have radio frequency operation capabilities, but we haven't wired them together to make a full radio.",
        "So I think that's something we'd like to do, as well.",
        "That's on the engineering side.",
        "On the application side, we're just moving forward with devices that are wired up with very thin, lightweight ribbon cables so that we can evaluate different modes of use and physical rehabilitation, status monitoring which we mentioned before, this human-machine interface stuff.",
        "So kind of two thrusts to what we're doing.",
        "All right, Dr. Rogers, thank you for taking time to talk to us.",
        "Sure, my pleasure.",

        "John Rogers is a professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and is studying this electronic skin, and that study appears in the journal Science.",
        "And you can go to our website, you can see the electronic skin in action and that cute pirate tattoo, how it's applied and how the electronic skin stays there."
