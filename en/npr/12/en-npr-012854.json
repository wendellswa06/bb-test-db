        "He's trying to set up a firewall and demonstrate that you can spill the beans, you can cooperate with the special prosecutor, perhaps be convicted - if you're convicted of lying, perjury, obstruction of justice, or otherwise - and you will still get a pardon in the end.",

        "All of this reinforces the notion that this was a very carefully planned operation conducted by a group that has a global dimension and that's willing to spend time planning this kind of attack.",
        "And there's another thing going on here.",
        "There's a degree of puzzlement in India as what's actually happening, because there are two Indians who are already being tried in Mumbai, and the authorities have also charged them with scouting out targets for the attacks, a role that Headley's supposed to have carried out.",
        "So it's not clear how all this fits together.",

        "Yes.",
        "I mean, after the Mumbai attacks there was a lot of political rhetoric, you know, about the need for international cooperation, just as there was after 9/11.",
        "Now, it does seem, though, that this time the FBI and the Indian security agencies, notably the National Investigation Agency, which was set up after the Mumbai attacks by India, they've been working pretty closely on this one.",
        "Indian detectives, for example, reportedly retraced Headley's movements in India and I'm sure they'll have passed that information on to the FBI.",

        "Yes.",

        "His trial began in May and it's still going on.",
        "A few days ago the court sacked his lawyer, accusing the lawyer of being obstructive, and he's had another lawyer appointed by the court now.",
        "Now, the anniversary of the Mumbai attacks was just a few weeks ago and when that came around and there was a lot of media attention obviously to what had happened, there were renewed calls from some elements, some quarters in India, for Kasab to be hanged immediately on the grounds that he was caught red-handed and that keeping him in a top security prison and putting him on trial is extremely expensive.",
        "It's likely, though, that the Indians will have been interrogating him now about all these new developments surrounding Headley and that if they extracted any information from Kasab, they'll have passed that along to the U.S., something that of course couldn't have happened if he had been executed.",
