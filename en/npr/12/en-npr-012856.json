        "For the millions of people still struggling with long-term unemployment, the outlook has not improved very much.",
        "As NPR's Ailsa Chang reports, getting these workers back into the workforce is going to take a lot longer.",
        "When you're the first person in your family to finish college after growing up in one of the roughest sections of Brooklyn, you kind of expect things to happen for you.",
        "But Alecia Warthen has spent the last eight months learning to swallow her pride.",
        "She had earned an accounting degree and worked as a bookkeeper the last decade.",
        "Then she lost her job with the City of New York last April.",
        "And now she's telling local grocery stores she'll do anything - mop floors, stock shelves, bag groceries - anything, for a job.",
        "This morning, we're at FoodTown in the Bronx.",
        "Hey, I just came because I put in an application a few weeks back, to see what type of jobs that you had open 'cause I'm looking for work.",
        "They just closed one of my other FoodTown stores, and we're absorbing their help right now.",
        "So, I have nothing open right now.",
        "Oh.",
        "OK, then.",

        "Warthen says she's applied for more than a hundred jobs since her lay-off and gotten only four interviews so far.",
        "She's tried making clothes to sell and even peddled homemade body lotions.",
        "But nothing's helped.",
        "It wasn't supposed to be this way.",
        "Warthen, who's 43, is used to taking care of her own problems.",
        "She raised six kids as a single mom and always had a job.",
        "Now, she and the three children who are still in the house are living on food stamps and $400 a week in unemployment insurance.",
        "I've always tried to aim high for myself, instill the same values in my kids and stuff.",
        "And just to think that everything has come down to this, it's like, make you feel like you just went to school for nothing, for nothing.",
        "Warthen is one of roughly five million people who are what they call the long-term unemployed - people who've been out of work for at least a half year.",
        "So many jobless workers fall into this category, it's skewed the numbers.",
        "Now, the average period a person in the U.S.",
        "stays unemployed is about 40 weeks.",
        "And it's been that way for a year and a half.",

        "Remember, prior to 2007, this average duration was more like 20 weeks, not 40 weeks.",

        "Silvia says there are expanding sectors in this new labor market, like health care and education.",
        "But he says the main reason people are staying unemployed is a skill set gap.",
        "Those growing sectors need skills many long-term unemployed people just don't have, especially those in their 40s and 50s.",
        "And the longer someone remains unemployed, the more she'll be perceived as a person without the right skill set.",

        "So, they'd rather spend the time with someone who's just coming off an assignment because they're looking as though they're job-ready versus someone who may have been a bit stale being out of work for some time.",
        "So, Williams says even though he is placing more workers these days, the people first in line to get the new jobs are the ones who've been out of work the shortest time.",
        "That means prospects continue to be dim for people like Alecia Warthen.",

        "It talks about redundant programming and states the museums have seldom lived up to the superior quality and leadership that their national designation implies.",
        "But the review also points out that within the overall institution, the arts received far less funding than history or science.",
        "Ned Rifkin says this has lead to deferred maintenance.",
        "The report cites leaks in some of the museums that threatened the collections themselves.",
        "The Smithsonian is over 160 years old, and over those decades, you have things sometimes in real serious disrepair, but at other times just needing maintenance.",
        "Long story short, we are vigilant about this and have been advocating to Congress for, you know, significant sums of money that would enable us to address the physical infrastructure of the Smithsonian.",

        "The audit found that in addition to his salary, Lawrence Small racked up $90,000 in unauthorized expenses.",
        "And that since becoming secretary in 2000, he's charged the Smithsonian more than $1 million for the use of his home for official functions.",
        "Senator Grassley proposed freezing the budget increase until certain conditions are met.",
        "Number one, that no one at the Smithsonian is getting paid more than the president in the United States, as was proposed by the House Appropriations Committee last year.",
        "The second condition, that Smithsonian must follow the travel expenditure guidelines of the federal government.",
        "No more first class flights to Hawaii to enjoy Thanksgiving.",
        "Grassley also recommended a tightening of ethics rules for Smithsonian employees.",
        "This has not been a great year for the institution, but Smithsonian officials are hopeful that the panel's review of its art museums and the attention that it's getting on Capitol Hill will help them fulfill their mission, laid out by founder James Smithson in 1826, to be an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.",
