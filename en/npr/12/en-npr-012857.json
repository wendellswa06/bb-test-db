        "Thanks, Neal.",
        "Good to be with you.",
        "And you're in Dubai, on the opposite shore of the Persian Gulf because?",
        "Yes, I'm about as close as you can get to Iran without actually being in Iran, and of course, the mood, at least the government's mood, toward foreign correspondents hasn't been good since last June.",
        "And I wonder, is there any way to anticipate what might happen on Thursday, when people mark the revolution's anniversary?",
        "Well, I think that there is a way of anticipating.",
        "We won't know for sure, but since last June 12, when the election brought a second term for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took place, there have been so many demonstrations, and they've been on politically and religiously sensitive dates.",
        "And the opposition has continued to bring out large numbers of people in the streets, and in late December, for instance, there was a demonstration that actually turned quite violent, and there were eight or nine people killed by gunshots coming from the security forces.",
        "So we can - it looks like both the government and the opposition is anticipating something like that only bigger.",
        "The leaders of the opposition have repeatedly called on protestors to come out into the streets, and the government has constantly been warning protestors that there could be very serious violence if they do come out in the streets.",
        "That's a recipe for confrontation.",
        "There's also been the - well, sober lesson, if you will, some protestors, some people involved in previous protests, have been executed.",
        "Yes, there were two a couple of weeks ago who were hanged, and the government threatened, before Thursday, to hang several more.",
        "There are a lot of people who have been arrested and freshly put in jail, including some journalists.",
        "The government, so far, hasn't carried out the threat to execute more associated with the protests, but we still have a couple of days to go before Thursday.",
        "It clearly was a signal to the opposition that they face violence and potential death if protestors continue to go out into the streets, but I've been amazed constantly at the bravery and determination of those in the opposition to go out in the streets and largely protest nonviolently.",
        "The supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said the anniversary punch, quote-unquote, at least that's the translation we got, will stun the West.",
        "Any idea what that punch might be?"

        "No, I think that's a threat.",
        "He's talked about that before.",
        "Other key leaders, particularly of the revolutionary guards and the police, have made similar statements.",
        "Clearly they don't want demonstrators to come out into the streets, and I think that's especially true on February 11 because February 11th was the anniversary of the triumph of the Islamic revolution 31 years ago.",
        "It's like the - July 4 for Americans, and this is a time when the opposition is calling on tens of thousands of people to come out into the streets and effectively, not overtly, but effectively pose a challenge to the government on its most emotive political holiday.",
        "So it makes sense that the government - from their point of view, the government leaders want to prevent that from occurring.",
        "And how profound is this challenge?",
        "Is there any idea, at this moment, how many people the opposition can count on?",
        "No, I don't think we can really know.",
        "The largest demonstration that took place after the election last June was on June 15th, three days after the election, and there were millions of people in the streets then.",
        "The opposition has not been able to recapitulate that at any time since, but thousands of people have certainly come out into the streets for demonstrations since that time and probably tens of thousands at the end of December.",
        "So we know that under the best of circumstances for protestors, if they weren't facing the guns and the truncheons of the security forces that there would be many, many people who go out into the streets.",
        "What's amazing to me is that in the face of violence, so many people continue to do that.",
        "Then there is the other set of developments, and that revolves around a nuclear program of Iran.",
        "Last week, briefly, there was excitement after President Ahmadinejad told a television interview that Iran was ready to accept the U.N.",
        "deal and send its low-enriched uranium out of the country to be reprocessed up to 20 percent for use in a medical reactor to provide isotopes for medicines, and then apparently, that was all described as a misunderstanding.",
        "It's very hard to understand the Iranian strategy on this because they've been back and forth on this for quite some time.",
        "Just a couple of weeks ago, it seemed that that deal, which was originally proposed by the United States to Iran last fall, it seemed that that deal was dead.",
        "The Obama administration had given Iran, you'll remember, a loose deadline of the end of 2009.",
        "That carried over into January, but finally in late January, it seemed to be clear from statements by the Iranian government that there was no deal, no swap, it wasn't going to take place.",
        "And then just a few days ago, you get President Ahmadinejad saying oh no, we'll take that deal, and then that was withdrawn on Sunday, in effect when Ahmadinejad said he had given instructions to Iran's atomic energy organization to go ahead and start increasing the grade of enriched uranium on their own, and that's what they claim they started to do today.",
        "So it's been a very confusing time, and the world has been really watching this quite closely.",
        "I mean, one thing the Iranians did do is up the interest all over the world, in what, precisely, they are actually doing with their uranium.",
        "It feels to me like it's impossible at this point to keep whatever they're going to do a secret."

        "Bush administration, now a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School.",
        "And Ambassador Burns, good to have you with us today.",
        "The secretary of defense and the president of the United States continue to talk about the prospects of, well, given their unwillingness to take the deal, now is the time for sanctions, and this latest announcement that they're going to go reprocess this uranium up to 20 percent on their own, the Russians, who've been reluctant to go along with the prospect of sanctions, describe this is a blatant violence of U.N.",
        "Security Council resolutions.",
        "Well, it does seem that the Russians, for the first time, have really taken note of this and are somewhat alarmed at the Iranian steps.",
        "The Russians, to some degree, have been a buffer between the United States and the Europeans on the one hand and the Iranians on the other, and the Russians have said well, up until today, the Russians have said no need for new sanctions, this can be worked out.",
        "That's the Chinese position, as well.",
        "But this action that Iran took today or at least announced it was going to take seems to have gotten the attention quite robustly of the Russians, and yeah, we're hearing much tougher comments come out from members of the Obama administration, especially Secretary of Defense Gates, who is on a tour in Europe and who had some tough things to say about sanctions in Iran in both Italy and France.",
        "And you know, Neal, I think that that probably is the reason why there were demonstrations today at the Italian embassy and the French embassy in Tehran.",
        "There were small groups of pro-government demonstrators that marched to both embassies and threw rocks and eggs at the embassies.",
        "And I'm guessing that the reason is because the leaders of both Italy and France appeared with Gates over the last couple of days and appeared to be with him in calling for additional sanctions against Iran.",
        "The security council could not impose sanctions without the vote of or at least the...",
        "At least the acquiescence...",
        "Acquiescence of China, yes, exactly.",
        "Has there been shift thus far or any statement from Beijing?",
        "A couple of days ago, a Chinese diplomat did say, I think at the foreign ministry in Beijing, that this wasn't the time for sanctions, it wasn't necessary at this point.",
        "The Chinese tend to follow the lead of the Russians in this.",
        "The Russians to some degree provide cover for China in some of these issues.",
        "But we'll have to see, once it actually gets into the Security Council for further discussions, because the truth is that Iran going ahead and doing this raises a number of red flags, but it also, it can be argued that as a result of further enrichment of uranium, Iran may be violating U.N.",
        "Security Council resolutions that are already in the books and they have already imposed three rounds of sanctions on them.",
        "So this is a serious - it'll become a serious matter for the Security Council whatever the different nations of the - whatever position they take."

        "And what of Iran's neighbors?",

        "They see Iran growing as a regional power.",
        "I think that that's acknowledged that Iran is a regional power.",
        "But they always get nervous when there seems to be moments when there's a greater tension between Iran and the United States because they fear that they could be caught in the middle of any kind of shooting war if it were to break out.",
        "And so the Saudis tend to take a firm stance against Iran, and the smaller Gulf states, because there's a lot of banking that's done through here, Dubai for instance, and a lot of trade that's done with Iran through Dubai, they don't want to see anything like a serious conflict break out.",
        "And the neighbors, of course, are concerned not just about developments inside Iran, but what's going inside Iraq as that plays out, vis-Ã -vis Iran; and what plays out in Afghanistan, as that goes, vis-Ã -vis Iran.",
        "The United States is so heavily involved in this part of the world.",
        "Well, that just underscores how much of a regional player Iran is.",
        "Iran has a significant role to play in Iraq, and it has close relations with a number of Shiite parties and politicians in Iraq, and Iran has had much to do with the conflict in Afghanistan over a long period of time.",
        "And in fact, the Iranians have overtly said that were the United States so take any kind of serious military action against Iran that it could retaliate against the United States in both those countries, in Iraq and Iran.",
        "So there's a real feeling not that conflict necessarily will break out anytime soon, but if there were to be some kind of conflict, it would quickly spread in the region.",

        "But what's clear is, is that they have not said yes to an agreement that Russia, China, Germany, France, Great Britain and the United States all said was a good deal and that the director of the IAEA said was the right thing to do and that Iran should accept.",

        "It's a very chaotic time in Iran.",
        "The opposition is stronger in Iran.",
