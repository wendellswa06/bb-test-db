        "So I think that President Obama's strategy is - I think he's positioned the United States well to be effective in a very complex and even dangerous game that's going to be played out over the next six to 12 months.",
        "Did he - I know this statement just came out, but did the president, to your ears, seem to be speaking to the rather mercurial president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and also to the supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Khamenei?",
        "Well, I suspect, but I don't know for sure, that in essence, it's probably not going to be possible to influence the Iranian leadership at this point.",
        "If they ever wanted to have an opportunity to negotiate with the United States - it has been 30 years, Neal, since there have been serious, substantive, continued talks between our two countries, 30 years - they had that chance over the last 12 months with President Obama.",
        "He offered them, time and again, an avenue towards negotiations.",
        "There was this compromise that Mike Shuster talked about by the U.S., Europe, China and Russia to try to take enriched uranium out of the country, return it for medical isotopes for their medical reactors, and the Iranians have turned that down.",
        "And they've now basically said over the last 24 hours, we're going our own way, we're going to ramp up and increase our enrichment program, and I think that President Obama now has no alternative but to do what he said today he would do, and that's to put together a coalition of countries that would do a couple of things.",
        "One is to pass, at the U.N.",
        "Security Council, very tough, targeted sanctions, economic sanctions, against Iran; second, to continue in effect to contain Iran's power, because the United States military, of course, our Navy is in the Gulf, and our military is in Iraq and Afghanistan, we're in a position to, in effect, prevent the Iranians from using their new-found power in the region.",
        "Continue to offer negotiations because it may be that these sanctions, the real impact of the sanctions will be to bring Iran back to negotiations.",
        "And finally, I think what the Obama administration needs to do is to be much more clear about our support for the opposition, for the people in the streets who want a better life and who want freedom.",
        "I think if I had to recommend anything, and I admire what President Obama has done so far, I would say the U.S.",
        "should be more vocal in supporting the people who want democracy and freedom in Iran.",
        "One more question for you from me, then we'll get to the listeners who are anxious to discuss the options ahead in Iran, and that is the idea of sanctions.",
        "Well, if sanctions are to be effectives, we've learned over the years, two things need to apply.",
        "One, they need to be very unanimous.",
        "The world, the entire world, has to apply them.",
        "And the other is they take time.",
        "The problem with the first one is that Iran has something a lot of people want, and that's oil; and the other one is Iran is - what, two, three years away from a nuclear weapon.",
        "And you're right, Neal.",
        "These are very, very short timelines that we're talking about.",
        "I think the issue of sanctions is a very tough one.",
        "Sanctions, as you suggest, are nearly always an imperfect instrument, and they do not usually succeed in international politics because you need to get nearly universal application of the sanctions."

        "In this case, I think the United States can rely upon the European powers, particularly France and Britain, who have been very stalwart.",
        "I agree with Mike Shuster that it seems that the Russians are now tacking towards the United States and the West Europeans because they're so frustrated with the inconsistencies and unreliability of the Iranian government.",
        "The key country will be China.",
        "China has become the largest trade partner of Iran.",
        "China is a major purchaser of Iranian oil and gas.",
        "China tends to have a foreign policy that's - that is more mercantile, more mercantilistic than anything else.",
        "It focuses on its commercial base.",
        "China needs to reflect seriously, if it wants to be a global leader, about how to be a responsible global leader and to be in the middle of this effort toward - on sanctions not at the edge of it or not even blocking the sanctions, which I suspect the Chinese may be planning to do.",

        "I wrote that down and thought about it a lot.",
        "The people of the world will have peace when they learn to take each other seriously.",
        "And I was just wondering how we can possibly offer, as an international community, Iran more of what it needs vis-Ã -vis security and recognition and respect, whatever it is, participation maybe in - I don't know, a global televised dialogue would be one idea - but offer it in such a way that we can get the concessions we need from them better rather than both sides, you know, whether posturing or fighting each other and threatening.",
        "Well, Peter, I thank you very much for what you've said, and I think you're right that this is a time when Americans need to think very carefully about the patient application of diplomacy towards a very difficult international problem.",
        "My own view, for what it's worth, is that it would be a major error to think that military force can resolve this by its own.",
        "It cannot, and the prospect of a third war is really forbidding for our country.",
        "We have enough on our hands with Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "I admire what President Obama has done, because I think he's really taken - he's really kind of tried to honor what you've been saying, what you said in your comments.",
        "We do need to talk after an absence of dialogue of 30 years.",
        "We need conversations among religious leaders, among political leaders, and he gave them an opportunity, but they have turned him down."

        "That was great.",
        "You did excellent.",
        "The Iranian government has refused to meet the United States at the negotiating table.",
        "So I think for the time being the president has no alternative but to go for sanctions, but I think that the application of sanctions might actually lead the Iranians back to negotiations if they're sufficiently isolated, if they're sufficiently pressured, and my suspicion, and I don't know this for sure, because I'm not part of this administration, but I'm sure the administration wants to avoid a war.",
        "I'm sure that these steps are designed to lead us towards, at some point, a peaceful resolution of disputes, but the president needs to be tough-minded.",
        "I think his statements today were, and I think we ought to try to support where he's leading us on Iran.",
        "Can I ask you, please, to elaborate a little bit on this 30 years since no substantial discussions, if I'm saying that right.",
        "Well, that goes back, while the shah was in power, weren't we talking with the shah a lot?",

        "Of course we had a hostage crisis right during those years, 1978, which didn't end until January 20, 1981.",
        "Since then, we have not had diplomatic relations with Iran.",
        "We've had episodic contacts at various international meetings, you know, one administration - each administration, but we've never had a time when the two governments sat down for days, weeks, months and said: Look at all the issues that separate us - nuclear weapons, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iranian support for Hezbollah and Hamas - we've never talked about them.",
        "We've never had that opportunity.",
        "I'm not aware of any country in the world where we haven't had a substantial, meaningful conversation over the same time period.",
        "You think of it, we've talked to the North Koreans, we've talked to the Cubans, but we haven't talked to the Iranians.",
        "And it would be foolish indeed for us to be on a war footing with a country that we knew so little about.",
        "And so I am very much for a dialogue and negotiation, but it takes two to tango.",
        "It takes, you know, a negotiating partner.",
        "And in this case, I think President Obama has really tried, but he's been turned down.",
        "And so, again, I'd say I think he has no recourse but to seek these sanctions."

        "But the reason why Iran has been sanctioned three times by the U.N.",

        "You know, when President Obama and President Sarkozy and Prime Minister Brown announced in September at that press conference in New York that Iran had this facility near the holy city of Qom that it hadn't told the rest of the world about it, that exposed an Iranian lie.",
        "And when the Security Council found out many years ago - several years ago that Iran had been enriching uranium, that exposed an Iranian lie to the international community.",

        "We have a commitment to Israel.",
