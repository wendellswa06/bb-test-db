        "And so, basically - and I don't see that any three of - any one of those institutions actually has absolute control over what happens in Iran.",
        "Furthermore, if they did get a nuclear weapon, the really alarming thing about that would be is who would have absolutely control over it?",
        "Would it be the Revolutionary Guard, or would it be the secular government, you know?",
        "Who knows?",
        "Scott, that's a very good comment.",
        "And I guess I'd agree with you that part of the problem - and President Obama mentioned this in his press conference today - is who are we dealing with?",
        "Who's making decisions in Tehran since the June 12th elections, the elections that were so blatantly unfair?",
        "The Iranian government seems to be more militarized, more dominated not just by the mullahs, but by the Revolutionary Guard.",
        "And that's very disturbing, because the Revolutionary Guard is a hard-line, far-right, intolerant group of people who want to impose not only their own brand of Islam on the Iranian people, but want to impose an autocratic government on them.",
        "That element in Iran has not - does not want to reach out to the United States, does not want negotiations, and I think wants to build towards confrontation.",
        "So dealing with them, I think, has to be done not just by the U.S., but by the international community.",
        "And that's why it's going to be so important that Russia and particularly China become much more tough-minded and realistic about Iran and join us in the sanctions and put the kind of pressure on Iran that might lead us away from a confrontation and back towards some ground, common ground where we can have a diplomatic settlement, a negotiated settlement...",

        "And the consensus is what?",
        "The consensus is that toxic algae pose a big problem, that they're spreading around the globe, that they are showing up in new places and intensifying - and that they're spread seems to be related globally to various human activities.",
