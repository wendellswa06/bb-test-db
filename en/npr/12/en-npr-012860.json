        "And I'm wondering - as an environmental reporter - do you feel freed up to no longer focus on the debate about global warming and human activity causing harmful effects on the environment, but do you feel free to just report on the effects and not worry so much about the political debate?",
        "No, I think it's important to report on the debate, but I spend a lot of time with scientists, and they express their frustration to me at how the media portray differences of opinions.",
        "And in our attempt to be fair and balanced, we often look for contrarians and quote them prominently - and as scientists point out, rightly so - that not all opinions are equal.",
        "And when you dig deeper into a subject, you realize which scientist had broad credibility and which ones our outliers are paid contrarians or clinging to outdated ideas that have proven wrong.",
        "I think it's important for us in the news media to distill and translate science and treat these various viewpoints appropriately.",

        "We manufacture stainless steel beer kegs.",

        "But we're seeing kegs come in from particularly China and some other areas that are taking advantage of low-cost steel, and they're bringing those kegs into the U.S.",
        "at a very, very low price.",
        "But as I understand it - and we don't have all the details yet, but the tariff the president proposes would apply to the raw material coming in, not the finished product.",
        "In theory, couldn't this make steel more expensive?",
        "And wouldn't this drive up your costs?",
        "Yes, that's correct.",
        "And we are very worried about that.",

        "Now we called you because the congressman said that you were very excited about this, but it does seem to me that you're a little hesitant.",
        "Or are you sure that this proposal would help you?",
        "No, we're not 100 percent sure.",
        "We're excited - the fact that the administration is looking at, you know, how do we become more productive in the U.S.? How do we bring jobs back to the U.S.? How do we restart manufacturing in the U.S.? So we think it's some of the right steps forward, but we are very concerned that in the short term, it could drive up steel prices.",

        "Where we have tried to protect the ridge lines of the mountains from gaudy, ugly and defiling developments where the occupant of the home would have a 360-degree view, but that the rest of the world would have to look at that gaudy building.",
        "That's because Prop 90 requires governments, thus taxpayers, to compensate property owners for substantial economic loss from new laws and rules, including changes in zoning even if the government doesn't actually buy the property.",
