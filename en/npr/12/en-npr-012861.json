        "Because the same day the Uruguayans came - and you're right, everyone was doing the cannibal stories.",

        "Which, of course, they'd said no such thing, but she was under strict orders to go get some cannibal quotes - which she eventually did, oddly enough.",

        "Correct.",
        "On average, a Chilean miner dies every 10 days, and most of them die in these independent mines.",
        "There are 317 other men who work in that mine.",
        "And they work there because what was so maddening about it, the San Jose mine was so notorious that it had to pay men extra to work there.",

        "Absolutely, yes.",
        "And some regulations that are, well, very, very cautious about where you can dig and how you can set dynamite and that sort of thing.",
        "Of course.",
        "Yeah, and their state mining company is world renowned.",
        "And the technology to get these men out is really quite astonishing when you think about it, you know, drilling down through a half-mile of solid rock to lift these guys out.",
        "It's the smaller, independent mines there - you know, the best estimate is just in the state of Atacama, there are 1,300 mines.",
        "And there are four mine inspectors.",
        "You know, there's one - he's a union organizer, but the labor movement there is very embryonic.",
        "As he put it, the typical inspection, in addition to being extremely rare, is much like asking a man if he's a good husband, but not asking his wife."

        "Yes.",
        "And, you know, mining is a dangerous job, and it's a pretty dirty job.",
        "But, you know, as you said, engineers can figure out a way to do things, not 100 percent safely, but very, very safely.",
        "This particular mine -as it was described to us by a number of miners and a couple of mining engineers - because of the type of rock that they were going through, because of the area where it was located, which is their fault zone, to be safe, up until the late 1990s, they would carve out seams of ore that were roughly four meters high by four meters wide.",
        "And then, after they finished one seam, they would descend 30 meters and start another seam.",
        "So that way, you had 30 meters of solid rock between these two seams."

        "In 2000, they reduced that distance to 10 meters, which gave them an extra 20 meters of rock that they could haul out for the gold and the copper.",
        "But then, even as you had those 20 meters between them, we had a number of miners tell us that it was very typical that once they carved out their four-meter high seam, they would work backwards and take out another four meters, and then go forward and take out another four meters.",
        "And eventually, you'd end up with all these different seams merging into one giant cavern.",
        "We were told that caverns of 40 meters high were not at all uncommon down there.",
        "That's pretty quick.",
        "And have you been playing this puzzle for a long time?",
        "Yes, probably about 20 years.",
        "And this is the kind of mining where the main shaft which spirals down slowly into the Earth - well, half a mile deep, in the case of where these miners are now that's large enough for large trucks to operate in.",
        "They haul out the ore.",
        "Right.",
        "And...",
        "Absolutely.",
        "...the product it was interesting.",
        "The product is copper, but there are significant other ores that are delivered out of that mine too.",
        "You know, gold the amount of the gold coming out of there at least, you know, it's - I certainly had to take my crash course in Atacamian mining.",
        "But we were told repeatedly that an average of 50 kilograms of gold was coming out of that mine, and that the rock there, the ore there contained between three and we heard varying estimates but between three and 18 kilograms or grams per ton of ore, which is, you know, most mines in that area, in the state, you're talking maybe a third of a gram.",
        "So it was a tremendous amount of gold.",
