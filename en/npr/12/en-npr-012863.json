        "And given the colonial history, they may not be welcome.",
        "No, that's not the real reason.",
        "The reason is that after the Yugoslavia and Somalia, essentially, the developed countries pulled out of peacekeeping because they, I mean, they were not comfortable with the U.N.",
        "and they left.",
        "There were too many risks and they left it to developing countries to do the peacekeeping.",

        "I think, actually, that the experience both of Iraq and Afghanistan is beginning to bring developed countries to the understanding that military force, in complex situation, needs to driven by a political strategy.",
        "So maybe that will bring them back to peacekeeping someday."

        "Exactly.",

        "The U.N., when there's a crisis, has to call on the member states to give some troops.",
        "And is it also not the case that, generally speaking, peacekeeping works best if all sides are interested in peace?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "The problem today is that most of the time you are in a gray area where there is no more full war, but there is no peace.",
        "So you are in that sort of intermediate space where you need to be strong enough to discourage spoilers from derailing the peace.",
        "But at the same time you're not engaged in full-fledged fighting.",
        "So in a situation like Cyprus - and people may not be familiar with the situation in Cyprus - but that may be because both sides are generally interested in keeping the peace.",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "In Cyprus, when the peacekeeping force plays a useful role - because there is a real agreement.",
        "I would say in - on the Golan Heights, between Syria and Israel and - I mean, certainly these are not - these are countries that have no diplomatic relations, that are certainly enemies, but the front between Syria and Israel is quiet because both countries have an interest in supporting the peacekeeping mission there.",
        "And both countries also are very good at making sure that the only armed forces in those countries are forces of the state.",
        "And as we...",
        "Absolutely.",
        "No non-state actors there."
