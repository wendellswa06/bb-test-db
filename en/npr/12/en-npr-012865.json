        "Absolutely.",

        "The administration says, North Korea's government officially sanctions criminal activities.",
        "Those activities include counterfeiting American currency, the production of narcotics and other drugs and the counterfeiting of American and other cigarette brands.",

        "The United States has known about them for many years.",
        "But what the Bush Administration's investigation found is that profits from crime are now generating more than half a billion dollars a year for the government in Pyongyang.",
        "The investigation, begun in 2001, found that the North Koreans are counterfeiting U.S.",
        "$100 bills as well as Japanese currency.",
        "They are producing heroin, methamphetamines, and fake pharmaceuticals, such as Viagra, and they are manufacturing fake Marlboro and other brands of cigarettes, along with the American tax stamps applied to each pack.",
        "You name it, they're pretty much in it, and their product mix more or less shifts in line with law enforcement against it, and frankly, client demand.",

        "He is now out of government.",
        "He says that after the collapse of the Soviet Union, North Korea's economy went into a steep decline in the 1900s, and it was then that Pyongyang took to crime in a big way.",
        "And he says there is plenty of evidence that these activities are under the control of the top leaders in North Korea including Kim Jong-Il.",

        "The scale and the scope of the multiple investigations and the multiple nefarious activities of North Korea did surprise me, and did surprise my colleagues at State.",
        "We had underestimated the vigor and the skill with which the North Koreans had engaged in these multiple activities.",
        "Within the past six months, the United States government has begun to act to stop these activities.",

        "At the same time, the Bush Administration is divided over what it sees as the goal of the investigation.",

        "Others, like Mitchell Reiss, who is now Provost for International Affairs at the College of William and Mary, do not believe the pressure can ring about regime change.",
        "But, Reiss argues, it can cause a significant change in North Korea's behavior.",
        "The illicit activities and the crackdown on these activities is part of a larger effort to try to redirect and re-channel North Korea's activities away from being a rogue state, or a member of the axis of evil, and to a more normal state, a more normal member of the International community of countries.",
        "And it's really up to the North Koreans to hopefully make the right decision.",
        "The Bush Administration has sought the help of many other governments in this investigation, especially that of China.",
        "To a large extent, North Korea exports its illicit products through Chinese ports, but to maintain Chinese cooperation, the Bush Administration has to be clear on what it wants from North Korea, says Robert Einhorn.",
        "If the Chinese believe that we're pursuing these measures for regime change, than we can't expect Chinese cooperation, because they don't favor a sudden collapse of the North Korean regime.",
        "David Asher, who spearheaded the investigation, also believes the goal should be to end North Korea's nuclear program and encourage it to become a normal state.",
        "If the North Korean leadership were to embrace the opportunities that are being put forward, I think it would be surprised by what it would get.",
        "At the same time, if it continues to act as a international pariah state, a Soprano State, as I call it, I think the implications of this behavior for its ability to operate in the International system could become painfully clear.",
        "That means in all likelihood more revelations and more pressure on North Korea's criminal activities in the coming months.",
