        "economy, overall, is around 13 trillion a year.",

        "We know that home prices are falling and will probably fall more, so, let's say, that goes down to four trillion dollars in debt, that's still only a trillion dollars extra but a trillion dollars is real money.",

        "And one of the reasons we called you is you are quoted in the New York Times this morning as raising an interesting question, which is, if the United States is taking over these big companies, nationalizing companies, do we have a market economy anymore?",
        "Well, first, let me say I think that it's a little bit dramatic to call it a nationalization.",
        "After all, they did not take ownership of them, at least not yet.",
        "But I think the question, more generally is, are we letting - are we at a state now where risk is all backed up by the federal government so that you get to keep the profits if things go well and the feds bail you out if things go poorly.",
        "And the name Bear Stearns comes up immediately, and there're rumblings today about Lehman Brothers.",
        "Right, and a step back as an order.",
        "I think that question about the - sort of, the appropriateness of a \"\"too big to fail\"\" policy is more accurately attached to Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers than Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac because those two companies do have a unique relationship with the government and that has been, since their inception, as Adam mentioned.",
        "So, it's not just a matter of scale that prompts the federal government to intervene here, there are other reasons as well."

        "So, yes, they said, no, no, we're not there, they're on their own.",
        "But at the same time, they were heavily- they were regulated by the federal government, they have access to certain privileges, exemption from certain taxes, all things that lead to the reasonable interpretation by the market that when things go badly, the government would step in.",
        "And if the government had let Fannie and Freddie default on their debt, it not only would have precipitated an economic crisis it would have been an international political crisis, since much of the debt that is sold by Fannie and Freddie is held by governments around the world.",

        "It would have made people unhappy.",
        "Why didn't we just tell them to read the fine print?",
        "Because the ambiguity of the relationship between Fannie and Freddie was part of the model, and I know that sounds horrific, but it's true.",

        "About the history, it's true that currently, we think of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as reducing costs so that loans are more affordable to the poor.",
        "But historically, their origins are a little bit different - and I'm coming back to Armando's question, don't worry.",
        "The history is that they were created, as Adam said, in the years of depression to purchase loans, but it wasn't just loans to the poor and it wasn't to reduce costs.",
        "It was to create liquidity in the mortgage market.",
        "That means so that there would be more money available for people to buy loans.",
        "The idea being, if a bank has a bunch of money - and those who have seen \"\"It's A Wonderful Life,\"\" this should make sense to you.",
        "If a bank has a lot of money, they can give loans to people to buy homes but what happens eventually is, they run out of money.",
        "And so they can't make any more loans and so people can't buy houses because the banks don't have loans.",
        "And so the idea was postulated that well, if somebody could buy those loans, that is to say buy the streams of payments that people will be making over next 30 years.",
        "If somebody could buy those loans, then the banks would have more money to make more loans.",
        "And so the only problem is we have to connect the people who have money to the people who want to borrow money to buy a house.",
        "And Fannie Mae was created to provide that bridge.",
        "Interestingly, the history is that the expectation was that the private sector would be that bridge and private mortgage associations were expected to, sort of, arise and buy loans guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration.",
        "That never happened.",
        "And so, the government said, look, we need to have this secondary market in order to get more liquidity, more people buying homes.",
        "And so, they created the Federal National Mortgage Association Fannie Mae.",
        "And by the way, Freddie Mac is the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.",
        "It doesn't make as much sense.",
        "No. But it's nice and silly.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So, you get the names.",
        "So, the answer to the question then is, should Armando be worried that it's going to be harder to get a mortgage in a, sort of, post-Fannie Mae Freddie Mac bailout?",
        "And that's going to be the question that Congress is going to grapple with because as people cry for full privatization, those who resist will make the argument that they're still in need for Fannie and Freddie to provide liquidity, in particular, to provide liquidity so that lower income borrowers have access, as Adam suggested.",
        "And the debate will be whether the private markets can now assume the role that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been playing without the government, sort of, backing them.",
        "And that's, you know, that's an open question, there's no right or wrong answer to that.",
        "It is worth noting that in the current environment, because of the credit crunch and the distress that many of the largest financial institutions are under, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are now, at present, purchasing 70 percent of the loans originated.",
        "So, in some sense, they are performing a function today which is as close to the function that was envisioned for them when they were created as has been true in a long time.",
        "Armando, I take from that answer, stay tuned.",
        "Neal, if I could just add something quickly, which is, this is not just a housing market story and it's certainly not just a U.S.",

        "investments, then interest rates everywhere are going to go up.",
        "What Henry Paulson did on Sunday, in the short term, is eliminate some uncertainty, so you would think interest rates would go down.",
        "But he also sort of signaled to the world, boy, things are pretty serious if the U.S.",
        "government is going to take this extraordinary step.",
        "So, I just want to make clear that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are so intertwined and, like I said, so huge, they affect every kind of loan, every kind of investment.",
        "Absolutely nothing - even ones that have absolutely nothing to do with the housing industry.",
        "Armando, thanks very much for the call.",
        "And let me follow up by asking, what else is too big to fail?",
        "We're in an election year, the auto industry and the key swing state of Michigan is asking for 25 billion dollars from the - federal loans to underwrite the manufacturing of more fuel-efficient cars in the future.",
        "And, well, they want it - as we just heard mentioned earlier, Lehman brothers is suffering some shaky times, a question about that.",
        "Is Exxon too big to fail?",
        "Is Boeing too big to fail?",
        "Can all of these places expect bailouts?",
        "No.",

        "When any industry sees other industries, basically, getting money from the U.S.",
        "government, you know, they pay a lot of money to their lobbyists and the lobbyists better be thinking up ways that they can get money.",
        "But you know what?",
        "The thing about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - badly run, huge organizations - but the thing about them is the two things, that they're so big that they're intertwined in the very foundation of our financial system, and then, it's everything Jonathan said, that they've had - they are closely linked to the reputation of the U.S.",
