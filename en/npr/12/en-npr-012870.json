        "Well, I do.",
        "And it's one of the odd legacies of the old Catholic Church, which was that one had an access to formality, one had an access to a larger culture.",
        "The old Latin math did have a real aura of formal and rather ancient beauty that people like my mother had access to every day of their lives.",
        "And, you know, my mother knew the great Madonnas of European art history.",
        "She couldn't say that's Fra Lippo Lippi, that's Bellini.",
        "But she would have holy pictures of them, which she would have in her prayer book.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "And so the connection to the Roman Catholic Church, which was very important to my mother's understanding of herself, was a way in which she could pass those aesthetic standards on to me in a very natural way.",
        "There was nothing pretentious about it.",
        "What do you think you have given her memory with this book?",
        "I wanted to pay tribute to her liveliness and I wanted to find the woman behind the afflictions.",
        "And I wanted to recover a way of being a woman that really is finished in the world.",
        "The scarcity of options that confronted my mother are fortunately no longer quite so dominant for women.",
        "And I hope that even for myself, I could get back to the vital charming mother because for 11 years, she was almost living a living death.",
        "And I was living with a corpse.",
        "And it was hard to take any pleasure or join that corpse.",

        "In the latest transcript, they have one or two but there's no follow-up.",
        "It's a lack of curiosity that sort of baffles me, really.",
        "Wells Dixon, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights, which represents hundreds of Guantanamo detainees, says the breadth and the seeming ease with which the confessions are made is disturbing.",
        "I think the only question that remains to be asked is whether these confessions were coerced, whether they were the product of torture or coercion, particularly torture that occurred while these men were detained in CIA secret prisons.",
        "David Rivkin, a Washington lawyer who worked in the Justice Department under President Reagan and the first President Bush, says it could be argued that the detainees have been in prison so long that they don't know what they're doing, but he doubts it.",
        "Let's take people and what they're saying at face value, provided it's corroborated by the facts.",
        "There could be a little bit of puffery involved, but fundamentally these people are telling the truth.",
        "And the reason they're telling the truth is because they're proud of what they've done.",
        "It fits into the ideological narratives.",
        "They think they're doing the right thing.",
        "But the CCR's Dixon says the validity of the confessions needs to be tested.",
        "And the only way that you can tell whether they've made a knowing and voluntary confession is to test those confessions in open court, that is with an attorney present, with the evidence presented, with the ability to cross-examine.",

        "As NPR's Rob Gifford reports from London, a senior Kremlin spokesman has dismissed allegations that the Russian government was involved in his poisoning.",

        "Now he is an outspoken critic of the Kremlin and had been looking into the killing of Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya, also a fierce critic of Russian president Vladimir Putin.",
        "Last week, Litvinenko told the BBC that on November 1, a former KGB man he knew from Moscow suggested meeting for a drink in London.",
        "Yes.",
        "But they - the French have been doing some very interesting research on their skull",
        "Really",
        "My argument, though, is that the base is already pretty ginned up and that George Bush wakes up every day and gives the base more reason to be ginned up, so that Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders, as they're putting their strategy together, they need to appeal to those voters who aren't already ginned up about investigations and really taking to the Bush administration.",
        "They need to provide some kind of a vision about what Democratic leadership would be like.",
        "Voters are telling pollsters that they don't like Congress, they don't like Republicans, but they don't particularly like the Democrats either.",
        "And my view is that they hold that opinion, because they know Democrats don't like George Bush.",
        "What they don't know is what Democrats stand for and what they'll do once they come into power.",
        "By talking about a positive agenda, that goes to those voters; but by talking about investigations, it continues to raise doubts in the mind of those voters who haven't yet signed up with Democrats.",
        "The subject of The New York Times story that I mentioned earlier is exactly that.",
        "How do Democrats formulate a vision, and according to the people that The Times is talking to, the idea of consultants is out and Democrats should find a voice and speak to the common good - I think a phrase from former Democratic leader John Podesta.",
        "The idea that authenticity is important is not terribly new in politics, but in the Democratic base there is this feeling - and, again, this is what, perhaps, Pelosi was appealing to when she talked about investigations and when other Democratic leaders do, which is let's stop all the mamby pamby mincing around and let's say what we believe in - and one of the things we believe in is that the president has abused his power and we're going hold him to account, and that that position, as a kind of sign of authenticity, may have power, some Democrats believe, outside of those who may actually even want that particular investigation to take place.",
        "The people will give Democrats credit for just speaking their mind, even if they don't believe in the particular proposals they're putting forward."

        "Well, if the Democrats need a vision or a package or a statement, what should they put in it?",
        "What should be in there?",

        "She's also put in some provisions that would promote tighter homeland security and that would follow Democrat's priorities on those security issues; but they are proposals that meet people in their daily lives in the way in which they look to government for solutions, and those kinds of programs are ones that people can connect with more than retribution that might come out of investigations.",

        "Well, I think it demonstrates recognition by the White House that they've got to improve their press relations and that they've got to become a little bit more candid.",
        "By picking Tony Snow, they've picked a journalist who has at least some understanding of the commerce between journalists, although he was an opinion journalist most recently.",
        "And it recognizes on the part of the White House that they can't sort of keep giving the same old line.",
        "We shouldn't expect Tony Snow to come out with those same kind of frank assessments from the podium, but it is an effort from the White House to show that they might be getting a little more candid."

        "And there's something noble in sort of rushing into a burning building.",
        "And I think Tony Snow could easily have seen this as a chance to sort of try to rescue the White House, and was undoubtedly given promises that things were going to change.",
        "That he was going to have access that previous press secretary's did not have, and that he would be able to use that access as power in that position.",
        "And so, perhaps with those new tools he could make something of that job that the previous two press secretary's were not able to do.",

        "He's a, he's a, he's a commentator on the right.",
        "It's a little silly to attack Snow for being a partisan on the right.",
        "The White House is going to have partisans in those jobs.",
        "Snow, however, at least knows about the commerce between journalists and sources, which means when he talks to journalists covering the White House, he won't be able to give them the sort of same old line, because they will be able to say well, you know, remember what you thought of that line coming out of this White House before you got this job.",

        "When you look at a surprise visit to Afghanistan, standing toe-to-toe, shoulder-to-shoulder with President Karzai, and the idea of saying, we're going to get bin Laden, one has to believe this is an attempt at boosting those numbers.",
        "I would say so.",
        "Exactly.",
        "The particular poll--there is some question on methodology and things like that--but the fact is the President has been taking a hit, partly because of a feeling that Iraq is going close to civil war possibly, and frankly I think...",
