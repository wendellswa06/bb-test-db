        "And so I think, by using this, by using the foreign policy, which is a tried and true method--well, I should say a foreign trip--which is a tried and true method for many presidents, he gets to go in Afghanistan.",
        "Even though there are some bits of violence there still, it's still perceived as being on a more successful direction than Iraq.",
        "Laura Washington, I have said this almost since the outset of the show: A foreign administration who really, particularly in the first term, seemed to have all the i's dotted and the t's crossed, particularly when it came to PR and press presentation--they have, over the course of the last 15 months or so, really spiraled out of control.",
        "You're right, and you noted the first term.",
        "Well, this is the second term, and that is part of the problem.",
        "I think, historically, you've seen second-term presidents get themselves into a lot of trouble.",
        "It's sort of the nature of the game, but this president has been hit with a convergence of bad news like no presidents that you've ever seen.",
        "You know, you talk about Harriet Miers.",
        "You talk about the port scandal.",
        "It's been hit after hit.",
        "You know, the Katrina disaster, the Valerie Plame investigation--which is ongoing--the lobbying scandal, Dick Cheney and his problems, and Iraq.",
        "Iraq has been the overarching issue that Bush just can't get off the table, so no wonder he wants to go to Afghanistan and talk about what he's doing there, because he's got a cleaner record there than he has in Iraq.",
        "We're trying to wipe out terrorism.",
        "We're trying to wipe out al-Qaida.",
        "Well, we created dozens more al-Qaidas, and a lot of them are killing people in Iraq.",
        "And that's the issue that he can't get off the table.",
        "And that's one reason, I think, why his job approval is at a all-time low.",
        "He's at 34 percent, lower than it's ever been in his history of his administration.",
        "George Curry, here's an interesting point.",
        "NBC anchor Elizabeth Vargas sat down with the President this week and asked him whether or not he would see his presidency as slightly failed if, in fact, he leaves office without capturing bin Laden.",
        "Of course, I don't know of any president who admits failure, really, but his suggestion was that we're going to find him.",

        "I think Bush definitely wants, still wants him dead or alive, as he said, but he's still Osama been Missing, as one of the senators said, but you know, don't count this guy out because he still bounces back.",
        "I mean, the Katrina thing was down, like, it was just one point or more--he was down by 35 percent.",
        "He went on this, you know, series of speeches, and I think this trip is the first of a series of events.",
        "Once he gets those numbers at rock bottom, they do watch the polls, and they'll come out with trying the offensive, trying to go out and sell his program.",
        "Now, the problem he has now is a lot of the criticism is coming from both sides of the aisle, and so you're talking about an Arab state-owned company operating six U.S.",
        "ports, they're unified, both Democrats and Republicans, and so I think you'll see more and more Republicans trying to distance themselves from him as they get ready for midterm elections.",
        "And you, Ed, you also have to keep in mind, though, that Osama bin Laden is the real killer.",
        "That is the difference between him and O.J., the O.J.",
        "situation.",
        "But George is correct, that you've got a situation where Republicans, members of the House, all of them, obviously, have to run for reelection.",
        "A third of Senate is up for reelection as well, and their political fortunes are now in a different direction than George W.",
        "Bush's.",
        "He's not running for reelection.",
        "They have to--and it is very, very hard to sell the Dubai ports deal to the folks back home.",
        "Even though--I mean, the President said yesterday he's going to stick with it--it's very, very tough for them to accept that, given the line on terror that he himself has drawn.",
        "Laura Washington, in this same poll, 60 percent of Americans said that they think the U.S.",
        "efforts to bring stability and order to Iraq were going badly, that compared to 36 percent who said that things were going well.",
        "George correctly points out that as we get closer to midterm elections, you're going to see people step away from what they see as controversial, but how much do you believe the American public will, in fact, see this as Congress's war as well?",
        "I think, I don't think that this is going to be seen as Congress's war because you have to remember, the vast majority of Congress on both sides of the aisle--based, of course now, on false assumptions--but I think that people still see Bush, and rightly so, see Bush as the leader and the architect of this war.",
        "He set this war up as a war on terrorism.",
        "In fact, we've seen nothing but an increase in terrorism in Iraq since this war started."

        "Well, this--the city cops, specifically the police union, as you say, has gotten their ire up--but it was only a reaction to getting, you know, a question from a newspaper, the Chicago Sun-Times, about this issue.",
        "A city council committee had already approved this.",
        "It was on its way to the full council.",
        "The police are angry, as you say, because they see Fred Hampton as a symbol of violence against the police, and it was indeed true.",
