        "After the election, the high-profile spat between Rush Limbaugh and new RNC Chairman Michael Steele and now the defection of Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter, the Republican Party finds itself in the midst of a debate over its message, its relevance, big-tent appeal or ideological identity - issues that will reverberate through newspaper columns, and blogs, and speeches, interviews and on talk radio, but which will likely be resolve only when Republican voters select the next presidential candidate."

        "But first the future of the GOP, and we begin here in Studio 3A with David Frum, former speechwriter for President Bush, now editor of newmajority.com and a regular contributor to American Public Media's Marketplace.",

        "There are three things that bind me to this party I've been involved with all my adult life.",
        "First and probably most important, I believe in a strong and unashamed American presence in the world, and the willingness of the United States to use force when necessary to defend its interests.",
        "I'm a believer in a free and competitive private economy.",
        "I recognize that government has a role to play in the post-New-Deal, post-Great-Depression era, but we want to keep that role under some constitutional restrictions.",
        "And I believe that we have a real challenge maintaining the unity and cohesiveness of the American nation, and there is a danger of being too casual about the nation's survival as a nation.",
        "We live in a time when national boundaries are getting a little thinner, and when the barriers between the citizens of countries are rising higher.",
        "And the Republican Party, historically, I would say, the Republican Party's the party of the unum in e pluribus Unum.",
        "The Democrats have historically been the party of the pluribus, and this is a moment when we need emphasis on unum.",
        "And as you - do you accept the premise that this debate is going to echo, well, sharply in two years from now, when we have the off-year elections, but most sharply in the presidential campaigns if these definitional issues get resolved by Republican voters in primaries?",
        "I think this debate is going to become more and more intense over the next years - for this reason.",
        "Most Republicans, I think, have a false understanding of what has happened to the party.",
        "We lost the presidency and took bad losses in Congress in 2008, and we had a bad election in 2006."

        "What they don't see is in 2004, George Bush was re-elected by the narrowest margin of any re-elected president in American history, that in 2002, Republicans did well in the aftermath of 9/11.",
        "But go back to 2000 - George Bush won on a technicality, to put it nicely, and in 1998, Republicans did not do well in an off-year election.",
        "And the reason they did so badly in 1998, unexpectedly badly, was because of a collapse of their vote among the people who were historically the most Republican, the best-educated and most-affluent voters.",
        "And when you go through the numbers very carefully, as we try to do at New Majority, you see a secular, long-term, over-the-past-10-year, deterioration in the Republican Party's appeal to its core constituency.",

        "I've been a Republican for all of my adult life, 20, 25 years.",
        "And the reason I'm a Republican is because of the principles which the Republican Party has stood on, at least since about 1980, with the election of Ronald Reagan - which are fiscal responsibility, emphasis on individual freedom, decentralization of power away from the federal government to the states, judges that interpret the Constitution strictly.",
        "These are the things that I think have defined the Republican Party, aside from personality, and these are the things that are going to give us majorities in the future, too, because I think most Americans do stand with those kind of principles.",
        "If we don't (unintelligible) from those, we'll regain our majority.",

        "You know, you asked David at the beginning why is he a Republican, and he gave some very good answers, and I agree with all of them, but ultimately for me, the Republican Party is merely the more conservative of the two teams in electoral politics, and I have no particular pride in being a Republican.",
        "I have particular pride in being a conservative.",
        "And my general skepticism about - not just David's approach, but the approach of lots of people who I'm very good friends with and I respect a lot - is I would much rather see conservatives busy themselves cultivating good ideas for the next generation and worrying about the tactics later.",
        "The tacticians will figure out a way to have the Republican Party seize on good ideas and sell good ideas.",
        "Worrying about positioning the Republican Party first seems to me to put the cart before the horse, and when people say that we've never faced times as dire as this, I'm at least skeptical.",
        "I mean, the Republican Party and the conservative movements in the early 1970s or in the late 1970s or any time in the 1970s - and David knows this, he wrote a book on the 1970s - or in 1964 or in 1960, times for the conservatives were much rougher and much worse.",
        "And you know, one of the things I love when I hear people say, you know, the problems we faced in the 1980s are much different than the problems we face today, well I guess the good news in a sort of dark way, is that those problems look like they're coming back.",
