        "Let's get back to the Republican Party, though.",
        "But we know how to have those arguments.",
        "Well, you know how to have those arguments, but do you do them in the context of a broader tent, which David Frum was talking about, to appeal to different kinds of people, or do you do it in the context of well, it's just us conservatives, and we're right, people will vote for us, and if not, we'll be the minority party, and we'll represent the Old South and not the Northeast and not the West.",
        "Well, I'm all in favor of appealing to as many people as possible.",
        "It depends what you're willing to do to appeal to them.",
        "If you're willing to defenestrate the principles of conservatism in order to win votes, it seems to me that it's not worth the effort.",
        "People who say, you know, are claiming Arlen Specter is this terrible sort of harbinger of the future of the Republican Party.",
        "I think it's a very convoluted - I mean, I know it's the news peg for this, and I understand that, but it's a very convoluted argument insofar as the fact that Arlen Specter was pro-choice his entire public career, and he got the support of Rick Santorum, President Bush, the nomination of the Republican Party.",
        "The backlash against him most recently was the backlash against the fact that he voted for the stimulus bill, which supposedly is the kind of thing that a back-to-basics Republican Party should be against.",
        "And yet the three liberal Republican senators voted for it.",
        "And there's this presumption out there - what my colleague and friend Kate O'Beirne calls the jackalope of American politics - that there's this vast army of socially liberally but fiscally conservative voters out there that are ripe from the picking from the Republican Party, and I'm just not convinced that they exist.",

        "We offered the voters ham and eggs.",
        "They said no. So let's give them double ham and double eggs.",

        "The cycle will be shorter.",
        "So the Republicans - but there is a lot of tendency in the Republican Party to say, right, we are going to give people really the 150-proof stuff because the reason they turned us down before was we only gave them 70-proof stuff, and that just wasn't strong enough.",
        "I don't think that's very wise.",
        "I completely understand what Jonah is saying about the ambivalent relationship that conservatives have with the Republican Party, and I've spent a lot of my life living that experience.",
        "But the fact is there is no hope for American conservatism as an operational force without the Republican Party, and this relationship, where the conservatives say well, when the Republicans do well, we're with them, when not, we were never really all that infatuated with these people anyway, I don't think that's productive.",
        "And we have to understand if the Republicans are going to be a governing party again, they have to be a center-right coalition.",
        "They have to include people in the center.",
        "I agree with Jonah.",
        "It's true.",
        "Social conservatives, economic - sorry - social liberals and economic conservatives are rare inside the Republican Party.",

        "Well, it's a problem with the Democratic Party as the majority party right now, and it's certainly a problem for the Republicans, and it's a problem for conservatives.",
        "I see things a little differently, David.",
        "I would rather go back to the days where we had a more healthily hostile relationship between the conservative movement and the Republican Party, a more transactional relationship.",
        "One of the main reasons we got into so much trouble over the last eight years, I would argue, is that too many conservatives thought - treated George Bush like he was their identity-politics champion and that if Bush was for it, it must be the conservative position.",
        "When in fact, much of George Bush - and not just on the spending - much of George Bush's administration really was a tack towards the center in many ways.",
        "And a lot of conservatives failed to object to a lot of the things that he did, to the detriment of both sides out of a sort of a blind sort of partisan loyalty to Bush, and I don't think that that is a model to replicate.",
        "I agree with Jonah.",
        "George Bush was a tack to the center, for sure.",
        "That's why he got the nomination in 2000, because Republicans saw what happened in 1998.",
        "But there are two ways of conceiving where the center is.",
        "What George Bush and Karl Rove conceived in 2000, and they were very intelligent politicians.",
        "This was a very - this was a plan that had a lot of merit in advance - was they said look, we do very well with non-college, non-poor white voters.",

        "It didn't.",
        "Now we now need to re-conceive what we mean when we go to the center.",
        "We have to say why is it that we have lost the college-educated voters, who used to be the core of the Republican Party as recently as the 1980s - and they are gone.",
        "Barack Obama won people with four-year degrees, the first Democrat to do that since Lyndon Johnson in '64.",
        "Back in '88, George Bush beat Michael Dukakis among people with four years of higher education by 25 points.",
        "Let's get another caller in on the line, and this is Bill, Bill with us from St. Louis.",
        "Hi.",
        "I think you're asking two questions as one, and you gentlemen have actually just pretty much covered this in the last few minutes.",
        "Do you ask we are a Republican and why we stand with the party, and in fact, standing with the party is not the same thing.",
        "I think those who understand conservative principles recognize the first principle, which is the only purpose for a political party, Mr. Frum, is to get people elected.",
        "Therefore, you're not necessarily in opposition with them just because you say they're not standing for our principles.",
        "We can still say more often than not, they will stand for what we want, but we can still have terrible problems with that.",
        "We don't necessarily fall in line or fall in love, as so many people frame our position.",
        "It's a country of 300-million people.",
        "It's got two political parties.",
        "There are going to be messy coalitions inherently.",
        "The surest way to neaten up your coalition, to make it tidier and more coherent, is to make it smaller.",
        "So there's always a tradeoff in politics, between success and ideological purity.",
        "We had a great golden moment in 1980 to 1985, very like the moment the Democrats had in the middle '60s and the middle '30s, where we had a consistently conservative party, or reasonably so, that was aligned with the times, and it was able to achieve a great deal."

        "We are outnumbered, and we, in fact - conservatives need to work more within the Republican Party in order to stop some destructive things from happening.",
        "If we have a narcissistic quarrel, and if we drive out - I mean, Arlen Specter, difficult person, no question about that - but he was that 60th senator.",
        "And if we drive people like that out by ill-considered primary challenges, that's what happened, then there is now no leverage whatsoever in elected Washington for conservatives.",
        "And Barack Obama has a very clear path to a lot of things that conservatives should be very nervous about, his health-care plans for one.",
        "And Jonah Goldberg, some would argue all right, he does that, there will be a recoil, and the people will understand the error of his ways.",
        "That's right.",

        "And I think that, you know, this is - a lot of what David's talking about is perfectly defensible, and I agree with big chunks of it.",
        "It's all fine and dandy, but at the end of the day, he's right.",
        "It's a two-party system.",
        "The Republicans deserved to be thrown out, and in a two-party system, when you throw one set of bums out, you throw another set of bums in.",
        "And Barack Obama has a clear path, right now, and it may be that, you know, whatever tactical or strategic maneuvering the Republican Party can do, it also - it ultimately will depend on how successful Barack Obama and the Democrats are - whether they overreach like Republicans and Democrats have overreached, you know, sewing, fomenting the antibodies that brought about their undoing in the past - and the Republicans will need to be ready with ideas and alternatives, you know, to take advantage of that.",
        "But so much of politics is about personalities.",
        "Barack Obama, if it was a different politician - he was such a left-wing candidate - if it was a different politician - a different man with a different story and all the rest - he would not have been elected in 2008.",
        "If George Bush weren't so personally unpopular, things might not have been as ugly.",
