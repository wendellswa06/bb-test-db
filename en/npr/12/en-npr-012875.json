        "And so I think we have to watch that we don't call every delay or every sort of inaction, procrastination.",
        "Yet, you also go on and cite some other research that suggests, in fact, we find all sorts of reasons to suggest to ourselves that we do need to delay, in fact, and some of them are quite bad for us, like getting drunk."
