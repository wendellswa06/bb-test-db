        "Well, you know, the - well, I've seen this object, and it's made out of different types of quartz that have been fused down in the Earth, and supposedly, the crystal carvers have looked at this, and told Joan on numerous occasions that you can't carve that kind of crystal with modern tools.",

        "Can you give (unintelligible) people an idea of how you can tell if - how old it is, and whether the carving is new or ancient",
        "Well, one of the things I did when I first got interested in the skull, principally when it sort of arrived on our doorstep was, I did a lot of historical research, and I discovered this fact that the same person sold most of the skulls.",
        "So when I contacted the British Museum, I discovered that they were already in the process of doing a series of scientific tests on their skull.",
        "So we formed a partnership, and did a joint study of the British Museum skull, the Smithsonian skull, and we borrowed the only large quartz - carved quartz object from Mexico, that has ever really come out of an archaeological context.",
        "So we wanted to compare the tool marks and the methods of manufacture.",
        "And this was really - initial work was really done by Margaret Sax in free stone, looking at tool marks under a light microscope, and also scanning electron microscope.",
        "And then Andrew Rankin and Nigel Miggs (ph) looked at the inclusions in the quartz, trying to decide perhaps what the source was",

        "Well, if there's been - well, with the historical record, a lot of avid anthropologists - myself, we, you know, a lot of research is based from that record, and I was just kind of curious if it's kind of either - there have been archaeological digs that shouldn't have taken place because of these skulls, if there's been research that shouldn't have been done in a certain way, because of these skulls, if there's been any kind of lingering damage that they've done to the historical record"
