        "Overall, the level of prescribing today - it's enough that every American would be medicated around the clock for three weeks.",
        "So that's a lot of opioid use.",
        "And doctors are actually writing their patients prescriptions that last longer.",
        "The bottom line is that too many are still getting too much for too long, and that is driving our problem with drug overdoses and drug overdose deaths in the country.",
        "Because the longer someone has access to opioids, the greater the chance they'll get hooked.",
        "And the CDC's latest data show that there are huge variations in how doctors prescribe opioids around the country.",
        "There were six times more opioids being prescribed in the highest-prescribing counties compared to the lowest-prescribing counties, and that amount can lead to a much higher risk for opioid addiction, overdose and death.",
        "The counties where the most opioids are being prescribed are scattered all over the country, though they tend to be places with more white, unemployed people with less education.",
        "Andrew Kolodny, an addiction expert at Brandeis, says the new numbers show that the campaign to get doctors to be more careful still has a long way to go.",
        "We're in the midst of the worst drug addiction epidemic in United States' history, but we are still massively overprescribing.",
        "So Kolodny and Schuchat hope that more doctors will start prescribing opioids much more carefully and use safer drugs, physical therapy and other ways to alleviate their patients' pain whenever possible.",

        "Up next, some intriguing and controversial news about research in mice aimed at curing diabetes, type 1 diabetes, which is an incurable form of the disease, which strikes so many people worldwide.",
        "We've been following the research of a scientist taking a novel approach to curing this disease.",
        "Dr. Denise Faustman announced in 2001 that she could cure type 1 diabetes in mice once she was able to stop the immune system from attacking the pancreas, which produces insulin.",
        "Then it appeared that the pancreas could regenerate, and she told us on this program in 2001, that she suspected that adult stem cells in the blood help regenerate the pancreas.",
        "She wasn't sure.",
        "We've certainly published on that, in terms of - we do see students, for example, who use more substances, whether it be alcohol or others, to try to put out of their mind that, hey, they're not doing the work they're supposed to do."

        "Oh, yeah.",
        "It's coming along, but the thing is, too, I can't be far away from my computer.",
        "Like I couldn't procrastinate and actually leave my house.",

        "So I think the way we phrase our tasks is very much part of what it means to break something down.",

        "And the rationale there is that when you don't forgive, there's a lot of negative emotions associated with that, so you want to avoid it.",

        "And any task delay will disappear once the depression goes away.",
        "But then you turned to the notion of perfectionism.",
        "Well, if you consider that a psychological illness - and I'm not sure I want to call it that - I would say it's a psychological dysfunction, per se, especially if it's this socially prescribed, maladaptive perfectionism.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "If what you're doing is trying to live up to other people's standards and that creates this inner conflict that the only way out is procrastination, then the problem, per se, is the perfectionism, and the procrastination is one of the few ways that you're trying to exert control in the world.",
        "So it's many times that irrational thoughts are at the root of our procrastination, and we have to start there.",
