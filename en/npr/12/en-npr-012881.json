        "And then there's people over on the other side that are really clinically depressed and reading my funny, little articles isn't going to do anything for them.",
        "But I'm convinced by the thousands of emails I've gotten that, you know, because I was just writing something funny that I kind of described how I work.",
        "I found out from my son that Robert Benchley, by the way, wrote something very similar 40 years ago.",

        "If you let them pile up, you can just dump them.",

        "That's right.",

        "I often wait to do paperwork till my sister comes to visit because she's very good at dispatching it.",
        "So I tend to feel guilty because the cut pile gets really big, but I know that whenever she comes I'm going to get rid of it.",
        "So it's actually healthy for me to wait because I get it done faster, and I get it done with assistance.",
        "Well, there is this phenomenon that's connected with perfectionism that you were discussing before.",
        "You kind of have an inappropriate perfectionism.",
        "A lot of people are perfectionists who don't know it because they've never done anything remotely perfect.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But that's really a side issue right now.",
        "So you - no, you get a request from someone to write a review of a book or something for a publisher.",
        "And you know, your brain says, I'm going to write the best one of those that's ever been written.",
        "I'm going to write one so good that when the publisher reads this, she's just, you know, she's just speechless.",
        "And that's silly but for some of us, you do that all the time.",
        "And then procrastination is a way of waiting for the last minute and giving yourself permission to do a fairly crappy job.",
        "And you know, it works well.",
        "Yeah, and it also protects your sense of self."
