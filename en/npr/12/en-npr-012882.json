        "What's the difference between structured procrastination and prioritizing?",
        "Well, the difference between structured procrastination and prioritizing may be that structured procrastination is prioritizing as done by a procrastinator.",
        "But for...",
        "In reverse.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But to be really successful you have to have certain self-deceptive skills.",
        "That is, you have to be able to convince yourself to put at the top of your list - that is, put it at the place where you're probably not going to work on it something that can grab you as very important, but ultimately, isn't all that important.",
        "Most procrastinators have good self-deceptive skills, I find.",
        "But maybe Timothy has done some real empirical work and that's not so.",
        "No, I think that's the case.",
        "But I think, really, what you've got there is two things that fuel motivation.",
        "One is avoidance and one is approach.",
        "And so you're taking that avoidance motivation that the procrastinator has in spades and using it to fuel other behaviors.",
        "So I think it's - that what's the difference there is that, you know, someone who is an approach-oriented person would prioritize and say, this is my number one task and I'm going to do it.",
        "But by self-deceiving a bit, you put your number one task up there that's important but doesn't really have a deadline, but you're trying to avoid - well, now I've got all the motivation in the world to do the other task.",
        "So I think that that's why it's such a good strategy for someone who's approached the world as always avoiding.",
        "My procrastination technique at the moment is that online banking is fun!",

        "I was anticipating something different, but no, there's no data that I could speak to that way.",
        "The closest is a paper that was recently published about the flow experience, that Csikszentmihalyi defined, is that artists and musicians, in particular, get so deeply absorbed in what they're doing that time sort of escapes them and they're really in the moment.",
        "And certainly, procrastination and flow experiences are each at opposite ends of the scale, it seems.",
        "So that's what the only other thing that even begins to speak to that.",
        "So I don't know about this avoidance or anxiety of performing.",
        "Well, what interested me was the sort of insecurities that you associated with procrastinating a creative process.",
        "I was wondering if they connect with the insecurities that we performers associate on stage with performance anxiety.",
        "Well, threat of evaluation is certainly highly related to procrastination.",

        "I get a chance to perform again.",
        "And those are just two different ways of looking at something.",
        "And I think it makes all the difference in terms of the emotional response you have to that opportunity and then whether or not, you know, it's going to be related to other ways you act in life, which would include procrastination.",
        "And when you get the performance anxiety, Ian, how does it manifest itself?",
        "Does it prevent you from going on stage?",
        "…stay good all the time.",
        "Impervious.",
        "Well, it more affects you on stage.",
        "You know, you'll have a case of the nerves where your physical function that you've been training so long, for example, with the piano, they tend to shut down.",
        "And then you're not able to do what you've been preparing yourself to do in the heat of the moment.",

        "And if you have to think about it, boy, you're in trouble?",
        "Yeah, exactly."
