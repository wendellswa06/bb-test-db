        "And number two, you know, when there's a plaintiff(ph) behind me, I found enormous value in sort of just ignoring the task that you're doing and recognizing that it's going to be over eventually.",
        "It's amazingly helpful!",
        "I loved both those strategies because once you prime the pump and get going, as you said, you say, I'm going to read two pages, which is a reasonable goal, one you could deal with.",
        "And then you find you read 40 because you started.",
        "Yeah, I think those strategies make a lot of sense, and I think it's right that you - it's hard to tell whether you kind of just grew up or you got rid of some of those irrational thoughts.",
        "And reading those two pages lets you forgive yourself because then you congratulate yourself when you finish the 40."

        "But the whole idea of getting feedback, public feedback, even if it's from an alarm clock that says, come on, get going, and a to-do list that break things down.",
