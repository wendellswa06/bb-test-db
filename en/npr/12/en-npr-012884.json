        "I think it turned out pretty spectacularly.",
        "He got great performances out of his actors, and he's nowhere to be seen.",

        "So, things like clean water, nutrition, vaccines, latrines, bed nets, which we know protect children from deathly malaria.",
        "And the only exception was that one interviewee from the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative talked about the importance of developing a vaccine.",
        "So that would come from, I guess, the cutting edge of modern science like labology(ph) and immunology.",
        "But all the other interventions from the other 29 people that I interviewed were remarkably low-cost and low-tech.",
        "Hmm."

        "And if Gaza is an economic failure or a security failure, this will project itself on any chances of reviving trust between these parties that has been shattered after all these years of an intifada or terror and violence that we've witnessed since the year 2000.",

        "Beyond economic aid and pressuring the two sides to avoid aggravating the situation, Makovsky says the US would do well to hold off on some of the issues that have proven most intractable in the past, including the final status of Jerusalem and the return of refugees.",
        "But we have to be aware of the political seasons, and both of these societies tend to be polarizing.",
        "But, therefore, the US could have a bridge over this period.",
        "And it's clear to do nothing just for six months--you know, in the Middle East, sometimes like riding a bicycle--if you don't keep pedaling, you fall backwards.",
        "According to State Department officials, there's consideration being given to the idea of pedaling just enough to keep the whole process in place without lunging forward.",
        "Speaking on background, one official said a cooling-off period might give the two sides time to deal with their internal politics.",
        "Robert Malley agrees.",
        "We're in a new stage, which is one in which US diplomacy probably will have to play a more modest role and where Israelis and Palestinians are going to work much more along parallel unilateral tracks.",
        "And both of those will be done with American help, but not necessarily with great American intervention or great American pressure."
