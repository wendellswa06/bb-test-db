        "Bryant's story evolved.",
        "On the stand, she claimed the boy manhandled her and bragged he'd had sex with white women before.",
        "The all-white jury took about an hour to find the defendants not guilty.",
        "Five decades later, Carolyn Bryant, now Carolyn Bryant Donham, told the Southern author she admired so much that what she testified to on the stand that day was a lie.",
        "She started muttering, well, they're all dead now, anyway.",
        "She said of the attack - of the assault, of the sexual part - she said that part's not true.",
        "Carolyn Bryant eventually moved from Mississippi to North Carolina, where she lives with her daughter-in-law, Marsha Bryant.",

        "Jim Coleman is a law professor at Duke University.",
        "Coleman says the Justice Department reopened the Till case once before, back in 2004, but a Mississippi grand jury declined to take any further legal action.",
        "After this latest Till book was published, the FBI quietly reopened the case, asking for and receiving Tyson's notes and research this summer.",
        "Coleman is curious about the Justice Department's motives.",
        "I don't see anything that would be accomplished by a federal reopening of the case other than the publicity of the Justice Department having to reopen the case.",
        "The Justice Department declined to comment to NPR about this latest investigation.",

        "It motivated to action an entire generation of black organizers.",

        "And this was the coalition that was being built and that ultimately proved unfortunately very fragile, which is that when he says, what you put in the ground is yours to tend and harvest, and no man should take that away from you.",
        "Well, Sherman issued a thing called Field Order 15 at the end of the war that promised 40 acres and a mule to every freedman and their families in Georgia and the Carolinas.",
        "And this was something that all freedmen were hungry for, needed and demanded because it spoke to self-sufficiency after emancipation.",

        "And really, \"\"Birth Of A Nation\"\" is just a really horrible racist tract that engages in such revisionism that it's almost unwatchable in some ways.",
        "So I was really glad to have the opportunity to set the record straight about the post-war era about Reconstruction, to catch up to the scholarship, which now looks at it in a much more objective and open way.",
        "And this is where the fight for freedom really occurred, this is the beating heart of the Civil War era, happens immediately after the war is over, when those issues of what freedom is going to mean are really enjoined.",
        "Sadly, it ends in defeat in 1876, in the beginning of the Jim Crow era.",

        "Look, that happened, and I could have left everybody with a wonderful feeling as they walked out of the theater.",
        "But it wouldn't have been true because right after that war was over and Andrew Johnson started to repatriate Confederates and give them their land and their power back - and the minute they began to pass onerous forms of legislation that were actually a form of re-enslavement - these issues just continued.",
        "And I wasn't going to tie it up in kind of a pretty Hollywood bow.",
        "So if it's sprawling, if it's big, if it's epic, well, that was intentional, but that was really the product of a lot of rigorous work.",

        "So then, what happened today?",
        "Today, a jury in this investigation found that the 96 victims of Hillsborough were killed unlawfully, that police errors were to blame.",
        "And gross negligence by the top officer in charge of security that day made him responsible for manslaughter.",
        "The jury also found that the behavior of soccer fans themselves did not contribute to the disaster.",

        "And then over the next few days, you had other executives come out and say, well, the good news is, we didn't really need the capital, and now we have it.",

        "So right away, you had the original purpose of the bailout basically detonated.",

        "And there's outrage about the fact that the government was effectively playing God in deciding which banks should get it and which shouldn't and so forth.",
