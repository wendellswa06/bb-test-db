        "Well, the news came while we were in the air on our final descent into Cleveland.",
        "And Jennifer Palmieri, the communications director for the campaign, came back very briefly, delivered a very brief statement essentially saying that they had been saying that this is how it would turn out.",

        "Now, looking back at this whole campaign, Tam, this year has been so much about reaction against the establishment.",
        "Now, that - Hillary Clinton is seen, I think, even by her supporters as an establishment figure.",
        "How has she been navigating that?",
        "And General Chiarelli - yeah.",
        "Let's begin with you, General Chiarelli.",
        "So prior to becoming CEO at One Mind for Research, you'd been vocal about how little we know about brain disorders.",
        "Since joining the organization, what have you learned about the way brain research is conducted?",
        "Well, it's - basically, what has happened to me since I've had the opportunity to fully concentrate on this is I only believe even stronger than I did before that the research on the brain and what we understand about the brain is 30 to 40 to 50 years behind what we know about the other organs of the body.",
        "So it's very, very frustrating.",
        "We just don't have good diagnostics for traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress.",
        "They are not available.",
        "And, in fact, many of the drugs that we prescribe - in fact, all the drugs that we prescribe are off-label prescriptions.",
        "They're drugs that were created 30 to 40 years ago for something other than traumatic brain injury or post-traumatic stress.",
        "And there are no drugs in the pipeline to help people.",
        "So the state of research of the brain is just lagging, and we need to jump-start it.",
        "We need to understand this more, because it's a tremendous bill for our country.",
        "We estimate somewhere in the vicinity of a trillion dollars a year.",
        "Now, of course, as vice chief of staff of the Army, you wanted to see the Army and the rest of the military deal more effectively with the effects of traumatic brain injury, but you were - you've written and said many times how frustrated you were that even in the scientific community that you were dealing with, there was really sense of uncertainty about brain injury, traumatic brain injury, and even the functions of the brain that were affected.",
        "Well, that's true, and I see that still today.",
        "You can go to any so-called expert, and he'll give you his diagnostic tools that he uses for post-traumatic stress.",
        "But if you go to another one, many times you'll get something totally different.",
        "There isn't a lot of agreement, because we just don't know enough.",
        "And I think that's true just about in anything that when you don't know enough, you have a whole bunch of experts, but the experts don't necessarily agree.",
        "And that's really where I believe we are today.",
        "Well, have you learned anything, General Chiarelli, about why there is this problem of disagreement among experts?",
        "Is it - does it reflect a lack of cooperation in the research community?",
        "Or does it simply reflect the lack of knowledge?"

        "Well, I don't think any of the research has been done to a scale that we need it to be done to get us the kind of answers that we need.",
        "And we just don't have good diagnostic tools.",
        "You know, if you go into a room with 100 people and ask who has high blood pressure and no one raises his hand, you can go around with a blood pressure cuff, and you can pretty well ascertain who's at least at risk and who has high blood pressure at that particular moment.",
        "But there are no good diagnostic tools for many of the diseases of the brain.",
        "Now, the brain is a much more difficult organ to understand.",
        "And there is stigma associated with these diseases.",
        "So we haven't invested, I believe, the money that's necessary to get at these problems.",
        "Well, let's raise some of those issues now with Dr. Tom Insel, who joins us by phone from his office, by a smartphone from his office in Bethesda, Maryland, where he directs the National Institute of Mental Health.",
        "Dr. Insel, General Chiarelli just made a really remarkable statement.",
        "He says that from his point of view, research about the brain is lagging decades behind where research stands with respect to other organs of the body.",
        "Is that sort of a widely held view within the community of those who do research on the brain?",
        "Well, I think it's fair to say that for most of us, we see the brain as the next great frontier, and maybe the last great frontier for trying to understand the human body.",
        "It is true that unlike the way we measure blood pressure or the way that we can ascertain infections in other parts of the body, it's just very difficult to assess brain function with the kind of precision that we'd like to have.",
        "And we don't have some of the tools we need.",
        "And particularly when you're talking about the translation of fundamental science into clinical tools and clinical tests, we're lagging way behind.",
        "And that's where the real problem is.",
        "I would say the fundamental science about the brain has really undergone a revolution over the last decade or two, and we are far ahead of where we were, let's say, 20 years ago.",
        "But taking that information and turning that into something that's clinically useful has still been a struggle.",
        "And, of course, General Chiarelli, in the Army, wanted what he said were diagnostic tools so he could find out which soldiers were suffering from particular brain injuries.",
        "And I imagine that the lack of diagnostics is explainable by the lack of understanding of brain functions, Dr. Insel.",
        "You know, it's even inherent in the way we talk about these.",
        "We call these mental disorders or mental illnesses.",
        "But as General Chiarelli said, bottom line here is that these are brain problems.",
        "These are brain disorders.",
        "All of our diagnostic tools at this point are behavioral assessments.",
        "They are subjective, and they depend on what somebody tells us or what we see.",
        "Now, that's not true for the way that we diagnose heart disease, the way we diagnose hypertension, the way we diagnose diabetes or almost any other part of medicine.",
        "We've got to do better - if these are truly brain disorders - to use tools that assess brain function to be able to make a diagnosis and to know when you go into a room of 100 people who has something like PTSD or who's, even more importantly, who's at risk for this after a traumatic event so you can make sure that you prevent the emergence of PTSD two to three months later.",
        "Well, Dr. Insel, what's the state of research on these issues right now?",
        "Has there been any progress?",
        "You say that right now, many brain injuries are diagnosed by behavioral indicators.",
        "Are there any markers, or, you know, what is research leading you to look for in terms of sort of more objective signs of brain dysfunction?",
        "There are a series of different approaches.",
        "Some people have looked for the appropriate blood measurement, a change in a hormone level or the change in some neurotransmitter that might predict which 10 percent of people after a traffic accident or 20 percent of people after a head injury are likely to develop PTSD."

        "None of those thus far have fully played out for us.",

        "Fine.",
        "Here's our problem: All of those approaches - which have shown some benefit and some promise - are based on population differences.",
        "So we can say that somebody's at greater risk based on what you see in the group data.",

        "And we need to do that.",

        "You're somebody who's at such a high risk, you need an intervention.",
        "Now, General Chiarelli, obviously, progress in this field is going to depend on the work of scientists like Dr. Insel.",
        "Tell us a little bit about your organization, One Mind for Research, and what role you can play as an organization in advancing work in this area.",
        "Well, what we're trying to do is basically institute a new kind of paradigm.",
        "We found some very, very promising research that's been supported by the NIH that we think if we had the money to scale it up and scale it up quite quickly, that could lead to some better diagnostic tools, some better patient outcomes in a much shorter time.",
        "The problem is, as I see it today, is that we again have under-invested in this particular area.",
        "There are so claimants, because there are so many diseases of the brain.",
        "And we take the available dollars and we split them and do research in all those things, but we don't necessarily scale up some of the research to a level that's needed.",
        "And I think there's a real need, here.",
        "Soldiers and sailors, airmen and Marines have been the ones that have put focus on traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress.",
        "But the fact of the matter is these are huge problems, with traumatic brain injury being one of the leading causes of death and injury in this country, according to the CDC.",
        "So although they have focused us in this area, quite frankly, if we could start to understand these and understand their connections to other diseases of the brain - such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's - this would be huge.",
        "It would be huge for all of us, not just servicemembers.",
        "Well, General Chiarelli, maybe this field needs a general to sort of crack the whip and herd some of these research communities into greater collaboration."
