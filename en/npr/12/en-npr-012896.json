        "And I think that when you understand that a majority of the research that has been done on post-traumatic stress hasn't really been done on soldiers, it's been on women who have been sexually assaulted.",
        "To say that a woman who reacts to that and has problems dealing with that, that they have a disorder, I think that that's just really a term that we need to get rid of and talk about what it really is.",
        "It's an injury that occurs.",
        "Well, Dr. Insel, I think something that you said earlier really has stuck with me, and that's that you still are relying on behavioral indicators to identify those people who have suffered some kind of brain injury or brain disorder, and as long as you're talking about behavior, as opposed to blood tests or something else, I guess you have to really deal with this problem of stigma being a barrier to diagnosis.",
        "One of the negotiations was, who gets to go last?",
        "And I think the fact that Brett Kavanaugh was the last word could be the difference.",
        "We have an expression around here that science trumps stigma, because when I went to medical school, we had the same stigma for cancer and later the same stigma for HIV.",
        "And I think a lot of what we can focus on going forward is much, much better science that will help people to understand what it is we're dealing with, that these are not behavioral failings or weakness of will, but they are injuries.",
        "And the individual's response to injury, which as General Chiarelli says, doesn't - is not served by yet another form of being victimized or labeled.",
        "And Dr. Insel, I have a question for you from Jodi(ph) in Madison, Wisconsin, who emailed us with this question: My brother was injured at age 16, and his anger, outbursts and behavioral issues seem to be getting worse as he ages.",
        "Is this common, and what are the implications long-term for this, worsening indications?",
        "Well, you know, one of the things that we see more and more often with the response to trauma is whatever it is that is part of the individual's particular constitution that leads to either resilience or risk for greater problems, it gets complicated often by the things they do to themselves over time, whether it's substance abuse or other kinds of behaviors that they begin to embark in.",
        "And this is where, as you see people as the years progress, and as these problems go from being acute to chronic, it really hurts to see the sort of trajectory that could be avoided if we knew how to intervene much more effectively at an early stage.",
        "So often what we call PTSD, and the disorder name still gets assigned to this, occurs years later, sometimes decades after the original event.",
        "And it's the result of a lot of accumulation of everything from depression to substance abuse to secondary issues, sometimes that come about, and an attempt to self-medicate - often, for instance, with alcohol - the original symptoms.",
        "And of course, General Chiarelli, our last caller, Barbara, whose brother was suffering from the anger, outbursts and behavioral issues from his brain disorder, she, as his sister, was dealing with that, and because of these behavioral implications of brain injury, a lot of the burden does fall on family members, does it not?",
        "And I'm sure this is especially acute for veterans who are returning from combat or from some warzone experience with disorders like PTS.",
        "They have to go back to families and communities."

        "How are they best able to deal with those soldiers returning from a warzone?",
        "Well, that's just a huge problem, Tom, because, you know, you see your loved one get off of a plane after a deployment, and they look visually the same as they looked when they left, but you find out weeks, months or even years later that they're not the same, that they are suffering from post-traumatic stress, or the results of traumatic brain injury from some kind of an explosion or concussive event that they had.",
        "And it affects the entire family.",
        "The key here is that when you see those kinds of symptoms appear, that you get that loved one in for help.",
        "And many times it's the entire family that needs that help, and some of the best treatments treat the entire family and help them through this entire process.",
        "And to understand it, this isn't new.",
        "I know you know that John Huston's documentary was just released, it was done after World War II, and it was suppressed, done on behest of the Army.",
        "When people high in the Army saw that this is something that would maybe look down upon the great service of service members in World War II, the decision was made to not show this documentary, and it's just been released now and shows that the problem was just as great in World War II as we're seeing with our returning veterans from these two conflicts.",
        "Of course in these conflicts...",
        "If I can add there...",
        "Yes, please, Dr. Insel.",
        "You know, people may not realize this, but the agency that I work for, the National Institute of Mental Health, is the world's largest funder of research on mental disorders and mental health issues.",
        "We were actually founded in 1948 for one purpose only, and it was Harry Truman charged this agency to address the problems of returning veterans from World War II because of what was then called either combat neurosis or combat stress, which is today what we call either PTSD or PTS.",
        "This is not a new problem and it's one that we have looked at in many ways now for over six decades, and we're still struggling to come up with the best approach.",
        "We used to call soldiers coming out of warzones as shell-shocked in some cases.",

        "You know, there sure was, and there are very good descriptions of this going back certainly to the Civil War and even before that.",
        "So this is - there's nothing new here in the sense of the syndrome that we're dealing with, but in a way that's part of the sadness of this, is that we haven't made the kind of progress that we've made in so many other areas of medicine since 1948.",
        "Well, General Chiarelli...",
        "That is really the sad part of this, is we really haven't come any further, and until we start to share information, until we team science this in a way that's different than what we've been doing for the last 40 or 50 years, we're not going to find a way to help these individuals more than we helped those that returned from World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War.",
        "It's time to stop this and figure out a way - this is emergency science that is needed to try to get at this as quickly as we possibly can.",
        "Well, one thing that is new, Gen.",
        "Chiarelli, is that these past wars have featured the use of improvised explosive devices, IEDs or roadside bombs, and those have really had tremendous implications for brain injury, haven't they?",
        "They have.",
        "But there's always a tendency to say it was the explosion that occurred downrange that caused the problem.",
        "What we're finding in some other studies that were doing the Army was that we had a large number of our soldiers who entered the Army with a number of concussions.",
        "So the concussion that they received in Iraq or Afghanistan was only added to a list of concussions that they had received participating in high-impact sports such as football or in girls' soccer, quite frankly, which is - the leading cause of concussion in this country is girls' soccer in high schools.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And the issue of concussions in sports is one like it is in the military that's getting a lot more attention these days.",

        "Where is that going?",
        "Do I - should I feel at risk?",

        "Well, it depends, Jolie, on the kind of injury.",
        "I don't know of any evidence that narcolepsy is an onramp to developing post-traumatic problems.",
        "On the other hand, the evidence that's accumulating is that any kind of brain injury such as traumatic brain injury, any structural injury from concussive events may put you at a higher risk, and that's something that we're still trying to understand much more about.",
        "But narcolepsy itself or the medications that one would take for narcolepsy, I don't know any evidence that that, in and of itself, would be a risk factor.",
        "OK.",
        "Would you like me to be a subject?",

        "And I happen to have a cousin who is in - is a neurosurgeon, actually, and in asking him what the upcoming possible intervention for - besides medication for - I mean, of any sort for Parkinson's - he said he holds out the greatest hope in the stem cell research area.",

        "these days are not the embryonic stem cells that you may have read about that have been such a political football, but these new kinds of stem cells called induced pluripotent stem cells.",
        "Long name but, basically, it's just the way of talking about stem cells that would come from your father himself - not from any embryo - where you can take his skin cells and cause them to change into a form of stem cell that could then be the - be re-engineered to be able to produce dopamine, which is missing in the Parkinson's brain.",
        "Lots of interest in doing this right now.",
        "It is not yet more than an experimental procedure.",
        "One thing you may want to think about, because it is further along than experimental procedure for someone with Parkinson's, is deep brain stimulation, which has done a lot to help people who have not fully responded to medication.",
        "So there are lots of options, but stem cells right now are still more aspirational than actually in the clinic."
