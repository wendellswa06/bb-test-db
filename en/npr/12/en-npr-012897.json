        "So, having lived inside of this little ecosystem for so many years, I became so accustomed to having those around me push me to become my best self.",
        "So I took a few years off, and I got super unfit, but I needed - my body needed a complete reset.",
        "So I started running again, and this whole thing - like, I hate running.",
