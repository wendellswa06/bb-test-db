        "I think the answer is yes.",
        "The FBI reported that in 2017 and 2018, they arrested more domestic terrorism suspects than those inspired by Islamic extremism.",
        "And Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, a Democrat who's chair of the Homeland Security Committee, wrote to law enforcement to ask him for an account of this domestic terrorism.",

        "There is this issue where you run straight into the First Amendment when you're talking about social media, or even when you're talking about domestic terrorism in general.",

        "Like, we shouldn't surveil mosques, and we shouldn't surveil that we've made various mistakes on these fronts in the past fighting terrorism.",
        "One of the options people have suggested is adding a domestic terrorism federal charge.",
        "But again, the reason people have been hesitant to do that is because it comes with this baggage of, like, what line are we crossing in trying to fight this?",
        "So a lot of your options are countering violent extremism in very soft-power ways, but that's sort of what our liberties require.",
