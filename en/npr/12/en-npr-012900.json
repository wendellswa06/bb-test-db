        "Now, we have all morning been hearing different perspectives and opinions on these developments.",
        "And let's listen to one of those voices.",
        "His name is Matt Lewis.",
        "He's a well-known conservative writer currently at The Daily Beast.",
        "And he's been closely following this story.",
        "So there's a profound divide here.",
        "There was before the testimony.",
        "There seems to have been during the testimony.",
        "Some people finding Christine Blasey Ford credible.",
        "Other people supporting Brett Kavanaugh.",
        "From your writing, it seems that you are leaning on the Kavanaugh side.",
        "You think that he did well enough.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, look.",
        "I found them both credible.",
        "And after Dr. Ford spoke, I wrote a piece at The Daily Beast saying, I don't know how Brett Kavanaugh can match this.",
        "I just - she seemed to be likable.",
        "She seemed to be credible.",
        "And then I think Brett Kavanaugh came out and actually did what he needed to do.",
        "And, you know, keep in mind, he doesn't necessarily need to persuade the majority of Americans.",
        "He needs to persuade Donald Trump to stick by him.",
        "And he needs to persuade a handful of Republican senators who might've been wavering.",
        "And I think he probably did it.",
        "And in fact, the interesting thing is, you know, there are a lot of negotiations leading into to this hearing.",
        "And it was, like, when are they going to do it?",
        "And also, what's the table going to look like?",
        "Will Brett Kavanaugh be in the room?",
        "Yeah.",
        "What does that say about the Republicans?",
        "And yet - let me ask you, Matt Lewis.",
        "You said you found them both credible, which means you found Christine Blasey Ford credible.",
        "Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic senator from California, questioned Blasey Ford at one point about whether she might be mistaken in the identity of her attacker - asked if it could be anybody else.",
        "Let's listen to some of that.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF HEARING)",
        "How are you so sure that it was he?",
        "The same way that I'm sure that I'm talking to you right now.",
        "And so it's just basic memory functions and also just the level of norepinephrine and epinephrine in the brain that sort of, as you know, encodes - that neurotransmitter encodes memories into the hippocampus.",
        "And so the trauma-related experience then is kind of locked there, whereas other details kind of drift.",
        "So what you are telling us is this could not be a case of mistaken identity?"

        "She is found credible by Republican senators.",
        "How do you find her story credible and still support Kavanaugh?",
        "Well, look.",
        "So I think - first of all, I would say, you know, you go into these things.",
        "And it's a he-said-she-said from 36 years ago.",
        "So we're probably not going to have any evidence.",
        "So you try to go in and you listen to those people and discern who's telling the truth.",
        "And if either of them had equivocated or wavered - and there was a point where she said, I'm 100 percent confident that this happened.",
        "Yeah.",
        "If she had opened a shadow of doubt, that would've hurt her.",
        "The same thing, I think, is true of Brett Kavanaugh.",
        "If Brett Kavanaugh had said, you know, maybe some things happened.",
        "I had too many drinks, but I did not, you know...",
        "He actually said the same thing.",
        "I'm 100 percent certain I didn't do this.",
        "Yes, same percentage.",
        "Right.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And so I think - and so I felt that they both came across as believable.",
        "As they were speaking, I was like, wow, OK.",
        "So I think what happened is you end up with basically a draw.",
        "And if the needle doesn't move yesterday, that means we're kind of back where we started from, amazingly, which is there are 51 Republican senators and a Republican president.",
        "And I think that is why...",
        "Yeah.",

        "Let me just ask, though.",
        "Republicans and Kavanaugh himself put a lot of emphasis on Democrats accusing them of a conspiracy.",
        "Kavanaugh accused Democrats of trying to get revenge because he was involved in the investigation of President Clinton in the 1990s.",
        "I think that's what he was driving at.",
        "Lindsey Graham made a very angry statement in which he was wagging his finger and said of Democrats, you just want power.",
        "You're willing to do anything to get power.",
        "You want this seat to be held open until you can fill it.",
        "My question, Matt Lewis, is, isn't that a classic example of projection?",
        "Isn't that literally, exactly, explicitly what Republicans have wanted and done for years and years and years, willing to do anything to get their side with a majority on the Supreme Court?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Look.",
        "I think both sides have done it.",
        "And we can go all the way back to Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas where Democrats tried to stop Republican nominees.",
        "So, you know, there's blame on both sides.",
        "At the end of the day, I think it's totally possible that you could have a situation where Democrats are, in fact, playing politics.",
        "And yet Republicans nominate somebody who has done something horrible.",
        "So I don't think...",

        "And in the minds of conservatives, what's happening to Brett Kavanaugh is actually a continuation of that theme.",
        "One last quick question for you, Matt Lewis.",
        "You said that Kavanaugh didn't need to persuade a majority of Americans, just certain senators and the president himself.",
        "Is that sustainable for the Supreme Court as an institution if he is confirmed, and it turns out that a strong majority of Americans is troubled by his confirmation and has less belief in the court as a result?",
        "Well, it's very dangerous because our institutions in general are in crisis right now.",
        "The Supreme Court is one of the few institutions that still enjoys some modicum of respect.",
        "My guess is that Chief Justice Roberts will go out of his way to try to make sure there aren't a lot of 5-4 decisions.",
        "That's what he did with the Obama - in terms of overturning Obamacare.",
        "I think Roberts sees his legacy as restoring and maintaining the reputation of the court.",
