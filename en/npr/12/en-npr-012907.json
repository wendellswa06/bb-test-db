        "Let's turn our attention to the headlines.",
        "Thank you for that, Mary.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "One of the things we want to talk about is the United States Congress is listening and hearing from hurricane victims of Katrina, and these are--and the fear immediately following Katrina is that we were going, to after the immediate swell of responsibility felt by many in terms of helping--that months later we would see this wane.",
        "There are many, many evacuees still reeling from those days and displacement, obviously, losing everything.",
        "George Curry, what we've heard from many of them this week is that not only do they still feel abandoned, but they talked about the abandonment of the government during the rescue efforts, some suggesting that racial slurs were used against them, that they were left abandoned in scorching heat, etc., etc. And many are suggesting it simply hasn't gotten better.",
        "And worse than that is--even on top of it, some of them, I thought, were abused by a member of Congress when they were in these hearings, basically trying to tell these people they didn't see what they saw, they didn't feel what they felt, and then basically trying to really steer the conversation away from race.",
        "And--but I was really proud of the sisters who were there who really stood up to them, but I thought they were abused there as well.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We should note, in just an example there, one of the community activists who was asked to speak was talking about how they were treated, and she suggested that the conditions were like a concentration camp.",
        "One of the senators--Representative Jeff Miller of Florida, a Republican, asked her to stop using that comparison.",
        "She went on to say, `Look, you know, if I put a dress on a pig, a pig is still a pig, and I'm going to call it what I believe.",
        "He countered by saying not a single person was marched to a gas chamber and killed.",
        "Michael, when you hear that back-and-forth, while the woman may have offended the sensibilities of this particular Republican, one has to look for a bit of restraint, one would believe, and allow for this kind of language, don't you think?",
        "No.",
        "I must tell you I regarded her comments as really over the top.",
        "I believe that we had a moment in American history when people saw neglect.",
        "It was on your TV; they saw abandonment.",
        "It's clear enough.",
        "But why take a national sense of outrage about the governmental lapses in New Orleans and in Mississippi, but particularly New Orleans, and then turn it into racial rhetoric?",
        "Concentration camp charge--accusations, that we intentional bombed levees--this is over-the-top commentary.",
        "It was not credible.",
        "It was racial rhetoric that sounded to me like racial idiocy.",
        "It was like Farrakhanism.",
        "`All the levees in New Orleans in the black areas were intentionally bombed.",
        "There is no evidence for that.",
        "So yeah, it was over the top.",

        "And of course if we counted those hidden costs, the business case would get stronger, but businesses are interested in enhanced revenues, avoided risks and gains in competitive advantage, and our approach to all four sectors is very rich in those things.",
        "Well, the testimony--I thought the testimony--some of the rhetoric was excessive, and I wouldn't compare it to the Holocaust.",
        "I think those are--one shouldn't do that.",
        "But I can understand how those people were so upset because they have suffered so much, and they're still suffering.",
        "And I also think that anyone who compares the response to hurricanes in Florida over the last few years, even Andrew, when the first Bush had some problems, with the response to Katrina has to see and look at what FEMA did and didn't do and what all the people--has to wonder why did this happen?",
        "There was a disparity in treatment.",

        "Well, one of the things that truly amazes me is how the Democratic leadership at the congressional caucus and all of the Democratic leaders are always telling the press about divisions in their party.",
