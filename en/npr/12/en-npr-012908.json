        "They're actually seeing that Howard Dean does not speak for Democrats.",
        "Look, so many of these Democrats are so disingenuous, craven, feckless, pusillanimous, wishy-washy, criminally weak sisters.",

        "I mean, there ought to be a law against this kind of double talk.",
        "Shouldn't there be weak brothers?",
        "There ought to a law against this kind of duplicity and whether or not we should use the word `withdrawal' vs. `redeployment.",
        "We can't use the word `immediate withdrawal.",
        "There ought to be a law against this, and there ought to be a law against congresspeople passing laws they don't read, like the USA Patriot Act.",
        "But if they did have such a law, more than half the Congress would be indicted.",
        "This is just kind of double-talking politicians that people get jaded about and cynical about, and it's just time for clarity and it's time that people said, `Look, let's get out of Iraq.",
        "We were gotten there under false pretenses.",
        "We want to withdraw the troops as soon as possible.",
        "The timetable will be within six months of an orderly transition, and then the Iraqis will take over their own country, period.'",
        "But, George Curry, those are the whispers...",
        "That's the plan.",
        "...from some corners of the Democratic Party that suggest we can't say that because it will be seen in an election year as unpatriotic if we take that hard line."

        "Well, it depends on which voters you're talking about.",
        "We're talking about congressional elections in 2006, and these are going to be fought district by district, and I hope the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee with Rahm Emanuel is figuring out in which districts how to position people and who should be running and what the sentiment is in that particular district because it's changing all over the country.",
        "The polls seem to show that there is great comfort among the American people with the idea that the thing isn't working and that we ought to have some kind of plan to do something, which includes a withdrawal on some basis.",
        "So that's--I think the party will work it out in the next month or so and will come out with, to the extent possible, a united face.",
