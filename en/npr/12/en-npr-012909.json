        "I've noticed a major drop off.",
        "Like people have sort of put this on in the back of their mind and they just want life to go back on as normal, and not realizing we still have whatever, 150,000 troops over there, that we're still losing a lot.",
        "You know, October was a terrible month.",
        "So that declaration of support the troops, you could say it's a platitude.",
        "And, you know, what decent person really wants the troops hurt?",
        "But did you take any comfort in that when you saw all those signs when your son was there fighting?",
        "Yeah, I did.",
        "I took a lot of comfort there.",
        "Everybody was helping support in that.",
        "And so that would be, you know, be very helpful because the troops need all the support they can over there.",

        "Do you do anything about it?",
        "What's the most important thing Americans can do?",

        "But there's a lot of injured soldiers out there that need support.",
        "I just don't think the government is doing enough to help support those soldiers who come back with severe injuries, where they've lost an arm, a leg, an eye, or they got just post-traumatic syndrome.",

        "Okay, thank you.",
        "One of the - one of the scenarios that people envision is that public transportation will be modernized, streamlined, cars will run in tandem on highways, maybe buses and trains too.",
        "But that also means that you may be putting some people out of jobs, are you not, who might be driving those buses or riding – or those trains?",
        "There would actually be more buses and trains.",
        "Our scenario does not depend heavily on transit, although it does count IT-enabled ways to enhance transit car-sharing, ride-sharing, and also ways to make traffic free-flowing, ways to charge for road infrastructure by the mile instead of the gallon, and ways to use lucrative real estate models - smart growth, new urbanism and so on - so people are already more where they want to be.",
        "And by doing those things, you can actually reduce driving by a surprising 46 to 84 percent and get the same or better access, but at the root of our transport suggestions is radical efficiency in vehicles, and not just the usual tripled efficiency cars and trucks that are coming at us, excuse me, trucks and planes, rather, but also a revolution in how we design and build and run automobiles.",
        "Two-thirds of the energy it takes to move an auto is caused by its weight, and every unit of energy you can save at the wheels by taking obesity out of the car - less weight, less drag - saves an additional six units that you don't need to waste getting it to the wheels.",
        "So you actually save seven units of fuel at the tank for each unit of energy reduction in what it takes to move the vehicle.",
        "So we focus on some new manufacturing technologies now offered by eight companies for making cars out of ultra-light but ultra-safe materials, and it turns out when you make carbon-fiber cars properly and design them in a more integrative way, it costs the same as making a regular car - that is, the ultra-lighting is free because the propulsion system gets two or three times smaller, and the manufacturing is so greatly simplified that it needs only a fifth as much capital.",
        "But you're talking about the future, where cars may be cheaper.",
        "I mean, getting from here to there, the cars are still going to be more expensive at this point, will they not?",
        "Well, what the ultra-lighting does right away is make electrification much more affordable, and then you're harnessing three very steep learning curves: one in the carbon fiber, one in the manufacturing, another in the propulsion system itself, cheaper batteries and fuel cells and so on.",
        "But first of all, you use fewer batteries and fuel cells, and indeed BMW has confirmed that in its carbon-fiber electrified car entering mass production in 2013, one of three cars in the next year or two entering mass production that are carbon-fiber electrified, they say the carbon fiber is paid for by needing fewer batteries.",
        "Now, it is true, though, that as you suggest, the electric cars are initially more expensive, even though they have a good value proposition, say, to fleet buyers, and to cope with that we suggest a very effective innovative policy called a feebate.",
        "That means rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on inefficient ones.",
        "And we'd like to do it not just in a revenue-neutral way but separately for each size class so that you're rewarded for buying a more efficient car of the type and size that you want but not a smaller one than you want."

        "Let me see how that would work.",
        "So somebody who drives a gas guzzler would pay some sort of tax, and you would get it to buy a more efficient car.",
        "Well, this only applies to new car purchases, not to what you're driving now.",
        "So when you go to do the dealer to buy a vehicle of your choice, there are more and less efficient offerings.",
        "But the price spread between them is widened according to how efficient or inefficient each one is compared to a norm for that size, and it's trued up every year to keep it revenue-neutral.",
        "So the effect is that you will pay attention not just to the first year or two of fuel savings when you're making your purchasing decision, but to the first 15 years, the full life of the vehicle, and therefore, you'll make a choice that's more efficient for society.",
        "There are actually five programs like this in European countries now, and the biggest one, just in its first two years, tripled the speed of improving auto efficiency.",
        "But that's even before the big effect of it kicks in, and that is that automakers will make very different offerings, so your choice as a customer will expand.",

        "wind power installations in half while Chinese wind installations, nearly half the total in the world, blew past their 2020 target, and they doubled their wind installations for about the fifth year running.",
        "These wounds are self-inflicted.",
        "But one of the interesting things we've found in looking at different electricity systems is that as we rebuild our dirty, insecure, obsolete-in-many-ways electricity system, which we have to do anyway over the next 40 years, it's going to cost about $6 trillion net present value, no matter what we build.",
        "So...",
        "Let me just interrupt to remind everybody that I'm Ira Flatow, and this is SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR.",
        "So we're going to have to rebuild the electricity system, anyway, and we are rebuilding it day by day.",
        "But if we look at what we could rebuild, we could do business as usual.",
        "We could do a new nuclear and so-called clean coal scenario.",
        "We could do centralized renewables, distributed renewables.",
        "And surprisingly, these four scenarios differ only immaterially in cost, but they differ profoundly in risk.",
        "And that is what is often driving investors away from the big thermal plants whose orders are withering and into the renewables, which, excluding big hydro, got worldwide $151 billion of private capital last year, and they added 60 billion watts.",
        "In fact, that's the amount of solar power (technical difficulties) - the wind - the world will be able to make every year by the end of December this year.",

        "But of course, what Congress told the Department of Energy to do was to take risks that the private sector would not take by itself.",
        "In this case, the private sector did invest over twice as much as the taxpayers did.",
        "And the taxpayers will probably get much or most of their money back.",
        "But the reason that this company failed - it's maybe 2 percent of DOE's portfolio - is a success.",
        "The company did everything it was supposed to.",
        "Meanwhile, China dropped the price even faster.",
        "And because of that rapidly declining solar price, which was the objective of the whole exercise, the more commodity Chinese solar panels were able to undercut the price of the more advanced American technology before they could get to scale.",
        "Well, we risk having that happen to us more and more if we don't have a level playing field and fair competition and access to the grid.",
        "But it's interesting that, last year, those commodities, solar panels, got cheap enough that, in recent months, California's private utilities had bought over four billion watts of the stuff, because it beats power from a new gas plant.",
        "And in a dozen states now, four companies will be happy to put solar panels on your roof.",
