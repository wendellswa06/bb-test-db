        "You're welcome.",
        "What is the government's role here, Amory?",
        "Well, there are some temporary subsidies which are generally political pawns to renewables.",
        "What's seldom mentioned is that there are generally bigger permanent subsidies to fossil fuel and nuclear energy.",
        "And I would like, actually, to get rid of all of them, those subsidies, and let always to save or produce energy compete fairly at honest prices, regardless of their type, technology, size, location or ownership.",
        "That's pretty much the opposite of the energy policy we have.",
        "There's a very important government role in allowing free competition and interconnection to the grid, so there's more of a level playing field, and that is done mostly by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.",
        "But utilities tend to be regulated at a state level, and there it's really important, in the 34 states that haven't done this reform yet, to reward our utilities for cutting our bills, not for selling us more energy, which rewards the opposite of what we want.",
        "The - but it turns out...",
        "OK.",
        "So let me just say this...",
        "Yeah.",
        "Stay with us on DAY To DAY from NPR News.",
        "Yes.",
        "And, in fact, in the long run, as the higher volumes manufactured cut the cost further through learning curves, we found that unsubsidized renewables can ultimately compete even with the nonrenewable sources that would continue to get, we assume, all of the subsidies they get now.",
        "The - and also, of course, when you buy renewables or efficiency, you're getting other kinds of risk reduction that save money.",
        "For example, there's less financial risk in building small, fast, granular projects than big, slow, lumpy ones.",
        "And when you buy solar or wind power to replace gas power, you're avoiding the volatility of the gas price, which is worth over two bucks on the gas price.",
        "So you're actually getting more value than you expected by getting a free gas price hedge.",
        "So we also look a bit at what happens if we use this kind of financial economics that takes account of risk, because that's another way of finding the extra value in the renewables."

        "But the real surprising thing we found is that all of the innovative policies needed in each sector to realize this transition from oil and coal to efficiency renewables can be done administratively or at a state level.",
        "So policies are needed to unlock or speed the transition, but they don't require an act of Congress.",
        "So we're end-running Washington gridlock, and we're doing that by using the most effective institutions we have.",
        "Free enterprise, in its co-evolution with civil society and accelerated by military innovation, to end-run the ineffective institutions, notably Congress.",
        "So what is the block in Congress against renewables?",
        "And what - when did green become so political?",
        "I mean, we have states like Texas, you know, producing all this - you can't get a more conservative state.",
        "We listen to the - the governor is running for president, yet they have incredible renewable sources of wind there.",
        "We had the secretary of the Navy come on here to talk about how the Navy is trying to become more - greener and trying to become more energy conservative to save the lives of Marines and other soldiers in Afghanistan.",
        "How does this - there's just sort of a - there's a disconnect here, it seems.",
        "Well, there is actually a lot of bipartisan support in Congress and at the state level.",
        "Many of the states with renewable portfolio standards encouraging renewables are indeed red states.",
        "And I think what you're referring to is probably that some parts of the political establishment on both sides tend to view, say, solar tax credits, wind production tax credit and so on, as a convenient point of political argument and kind of a pawn on a larger political chessboard.",
        "But I think on both sides of the spectrum people are really pretty fed up with gridlock and want to get stuff done, which is, of course, why we work mainly with the private sector.",
        "And it's therefore very good news that in \"\"Reinventing Fire\"\" we don't care whether you care most about jobs and profits and competitive advantage or about national security or about health and environmental stewardship, because whatever most motivates you, let's focus on the outcomes, not the motives.",
        "And we ought to do the same things, anyway, for whatever reason.",
        "And then the stuff we don't agree about tends to become superfluous.",
        "You said we need to level the playing field with - in terms of foreign competitors.",
        "What do you mean by that?",
        "Does that mean tariffs on dumping of solar panels for example?",
        "Well, I think it's too early to tell what the evidence in on that and it's gone into a trade dispute process, and it'll be resolved there.",
        "Many governments, including China's, including our own, support different forms of energy in different ways, and that's a pretty complex, slippery slope to get out to.",
        "What do you mean leveling the playing field?",
        "Oh.",
        "Well, I was referring, for example, to allowing ways to save or produce energy to compete fairly and without undue obstacles.",
        "One of the interesting things in the case of Texas, you mentioned, actually came from Governor George W.",
        "Bush.",
        "His PUC chair, Pat Woods, put in a very nice rule that was kind of plug and play that says if the inverter attaching your solar system to the grid is on the approved list that it meets all of the technical and safety requirements, you can connect it and just start generating and sending power back to the grid without asking or even telling your utility, because you won't hurt the lineman.",
        "You won't burn down your house.",
        "Nothing more should be asked of you.",
        "And that is the kind of competition-promoting rule that I think we need a lot more of.",

        "You know, I'm not a flat Earth guy, so I get this whole idea about renewable energy and electric cars and stuff like that.",
        "But the problem is, is that in my opinion, all that stuff is still a science experiment.",
        "We're no more efficient today than what we were 50, 60 years ago for power and - for wind power and solar.",
        "I personally think nuclear is the only option for a sustainable, different shade of green power source.",
        "And the thing is, what are all these electric cars - we've got 50 million electric cars on the road, what are all these electric cars going to plug into?"

        "Let me get - Amory, how do you react to that?",
        "Well, if you'd be kind enough to look at \"\"Reinventing Fire,\"\" and the technical backup for that will go up on the 27th at reinventingfire.com, you'll find we've documented very carefully from the actual market prices, the very dramatic manifold drops in solar and wind price and increases in effectiveness in recent years.",
        "And that is why the solar business is growing 65 percent a year for the last decade.",
        "It is why wind power contracts are now being written as low as three cents a kilowatt hour, beating the wholesale price.",
        "Yes, it gets more difficult as time goes on.",
        "And finally, you know, how are you?",
        "How is your family doing?",
        "Oh, we're coping.",

        "And it's just not the natural order of things.",
        "I mean, there could be a moment, or it could be a scene that we see or hear about and it just, you know, makes us cry again thinking about everything that we really miss.",
        "We did examine the nuclear option and found, as investors have found, that it simply has no business case.",
        "That's why neither new nuclear nor new coal plants are in the official U.S.",
        "forecast for what's going to be built.",
        "They simply don't pay anymore.",
        "Better technologies have come along that do the job cheaper, more reliably, more resiliently.",
        "And when we looked in particular at a distributed renewable future, we found it could resolve all of the technical, financial, security, climate and other risks of the existing grid a lot better, and not only be equally or more reliable but be much more resilient so that we wouldn't risk in the grid we now have, which I agree is not very secure, we wouldn't risk cascading and potentially nation-shattering blackouts from solar storms or terrorism or a national disaster; rather we would make major failures impossible by design.",
        "So I think if you look at the evidence in reinventing fire, you'll find that the technology and deployment have moved on beyond what you think is out there, but you are absolutely right that we're unlikely to have electric trucks.",
        "Heavy trucks can be tripled efficiency.",
