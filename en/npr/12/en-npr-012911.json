        "I'm fairly restricted in what I can say because I argued all those cases that we were just talking about, including that 11th Circuit case below.",

        "Maybe David might.",
        "But I think in general, the way the Justice Department approaches issues such as this is as an institutional body, what's the best thing for - what's the best thing for the court.",
        "Should they hear something now, or should they wait and let more views unfold?",
        "And I think yesterday's decision just reflects the kind of general view that three different circuit courts have already heard these issues.",

        "It's interesting, David, earlier it was the plaintiffs, the state attorneys general, who were saying why don't we just go straight to the Supreme Court with this, and it was the administration that said to put the brakes on, at least for a little while.",
        "I think both sides - actually, this is the one point that both sides have agreed on is that the Supreme Court was going to have to resolve this issue.",
        "And I think both of them thought sooner the better.",
        "They've moved these cases along in the appeals courts.",
        "It is true that the Justice Department last week had a deadline.",
        "They could have asked the full appeals court in Atlanta to reconsider the case.",
        "It would have slowed things down a month or two, and it would have probably pushed things off until the next term after the election.",
        "But my sense was that they were always confident that they could win.",
        "They thought the Supreme Court was going to resolve it, and they thought, as Neal said, the right thing to do is go up there and do it this year.",

        "In other words, I think that's more of a deduction rather than a penalty.",
        "And if they take that deduction away, how about my marriage contract?",

        "Well, what they're saying is that they call it a penalty, but I look at it as a deduction.",
        "Well, I do think that that is one of the issues before the court right now, which is whether or not Congress's power over taxation permits this statute to be constitutional.",
        "And certainly a judge a couple weeks ago did find precisely that and suggests that the Congress's taxation power makes the statute constitutional because the government does have wide latitude when it comes to taxation.",

        "That is going to be, David Savage, part of the central argument, does the Commerce Clause of the Constitution allow the individual mandate to go ahead?",
        "Is that part of Congress's writ?",
        "Yes, that's the big issue.",
        "For most of the 20th century, most federal laws were passed and enforced under Congress's power to regulate commerce among the state: the minimum wage, all those kinds of laws.",
        "And that's the argument here is that the national Congress stepped in and said we need to regulate the national market in health insurance.",
        "We need to do some things like for example tell insurers that you can't deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.",
        "But as part of that, we're also going to say everybody has to have some minimal coverage.",
        "We can't have a situation where, for example, if I had no insurance, and I walk out of this building and get hit by a bus, I'm taken to a hospital, the hospital has to provide care for me.",

        "So the notion is no freeloaders, everybody's got to participate, and that's part of a regulation of the entire insurance market.",
        "Again, you argued this, Neal Katyal.",
        "What was the best argument you heard against that?",
        "Well, the best argument I heard against it - you know, and again this is just me speaking personally - is that I think that it's not a legal argument as much as kind of a policy one, which is that the Congress hasn't - the argument goes - forced people to engage in purchasing various items before, so that this is something new and novel.",
        "And there is an element of novelty to it, as the briefs for the government I think said, that, you know, that element is not as dramatic as the way the plaintiffs characterize it.",

        "Arizona Governor Jan Brewer filed a cert petition in August.",
        "You remember, Arizona passed this law, it was highly controversial.",
        "It would have essentially got the local police into enforcing immigration laws against - for example arresting and holding illegal immigrants.",

        "The Arizona law was put on hold by judges in Arizona and in the 9th Circuit.",
        "Arizona is appealing.",
        "And now so that - the question is who can enforce the immigration laws.",
        "Is it only the federal government, or can states like Arizona and Alabama pass their own immigration enforcement laws?",
        "It's interesting, here's an email we have from an attorney in Birmingham who asked that we not use his name because he has cases pending before Judge Blackburn, the judge who decided the Alabama immigration case yesterday:",
        "I'm very disheartened by the spin put on yesterday's outcome, including by NPR.",
        "The issue is whether preliminary injunctions would be ordered on the various provisions of Alabama's HB56.",
        "Judge Blackburn, an unabashed conservative, joined the enforcement of several of the more odious provisions of HB56, including notably Section 13, which prohibited persons from shielding, hiding or transporting undocumented aliens."

        "Other sections were shut down by Judge Blackburn, too, and yes, many draconian parts were left untouched.",
        "But this is just the beginning stage of this litigation, and the media spin that this was a big victory for proponents of this law, taking its cue from Governor Bentley's crowing, does a disservice to the truth of the matter.",
        "And, well, Neal Katyal, I was just wondering if you had a comment on that.",
        "I probably couldn't - can't say much about that one, either.",
        "I'm so sorry, but I was involved in the case out of Arizona.",
        "So it's a little better for me, given that this is pending in the Supreme Court, not to react to that.",
        "David?",
        "Well, it is true that the judge upheld some provisions or allowed them to go into effect.",
        "I shouldn't even say upheld, allowed them to go into effect, put some of the others on hold, and in the normal course of events, there would then be a full trial on these as to whether these provisions are constitutional or not.",
        "But I do think the importance of the decision nationally is that it's going to spur the Supreme Court to take up this issue and decide it, that is can Alabama pass some stringent measures of its own to enforce the laws against illegal immigration, or is doing that trampling on the federal turf and something that they can't do.",
