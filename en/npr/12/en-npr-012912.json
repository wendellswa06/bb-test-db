        "There actually was a separate Arizona law about employment last year.",
        "Ah, an earlier one.",
        "Yes, that's right.",
        "The more board one that most people are concerned about is coming up this time.",
        "It's going to be a controversial term for the court, we expect.",
        "We expect decisions on - for the health care law, immigration - again, that Arizona law - and digital privacy.",

        "Our guests are David Savage, Supreme Court reporter for the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune, our regular guide to what happens at the Supreme Court; and Neal Katyal, who served as acting solicitor general of the United States under President Obama, now a partner at the law firm of Hogan and Lovells and a professor of law at Georgetown.",
        "What's happening at the solicitor general's office on the week before the Supreme Court session opens?",
        "Well, the solicitor general is responsible for arguing and handling all cases that the government is involved in before the Supreme Court.",
        "So that translates to about 55 out of the roughly 80 cases or so the court hears each year.",
        "They are also the entity that approves every single federal appeal throughout the 50 states, from the trial court to the Court of Appeals.",
        "So there's an enormous amount of work.",
        "There are only 20 lawyers now in the office handling all of this work.",
        "Now before - in a week like this, before the term, I think what's going on there is a lot of preparation for the oral arguments next week.",
        "They'll all be mooting each other - that is having fake argument sessions where they ask - they pretend to be justices and ask hard questions and the like.",
        "And it's a remarkably fun time in the office but a very intense time."

        "I was going to say, they must have to pick straws to see who gets to play Scalia.",
        "Well, you know, the office doesn't actually - you don't play a particular justice.",
        "You actually just ask what you think the hard questions are.",
        "And most of the - you have clerks, former clerks for almost every one of the justices in the office.",
        "So there's a wide variety of different views that are expressed at any time.",
        "And David Savage, as you're getting ready for the Supreme Court session, we've talked about the two big issues of immigration in the Arizona law and the health care law, but there's obviously a lot of other things that are coming up, too.",
        "On Monday morning, for example, there's a big case in the health care Medicaid issue.",
        "It comes from California.",
        "And the question is: Can hospitals, doctors, pharmacists, go to court and object when the state greatly reduces the payments to Medicaid providers?",
        "California has got real budget problems.",
        "Under Arnold Schwarzenegger and now Jerry Brown, they've been passing these 10 percent cuts in payments.",
        "And doctors went to court, hospitals went to court and said this is below the cost of service, we can't function.",
        "We can't serve the patients if you're going to do that.",
        "The 9th Circuit court has stopped some of those budget cuts.",
        "The administration and 30 states are in the Supreme Court saying throw out all these suits.",
        "And so that's one that is a little bit abstract, it probably won't get a lot of news attention, but it'll have a big impact on health care and the funding because every state wants to cut back how much money they're putting into Medicaid because they're - they've got budget troubles.",
        "And every term, it seems, there's a case involving police powers and technology.",
        "And there's an interesting one coming up on the use of GPS devices.",
        "Yes, this is a big deal about, as you said, the right to privacy, technology, and the case arises from a situation here in Washington where some agents in the police wanted to track a guy, and they put a GPS device on his Jeep, which allowed them to track his movements for a full month.",
        "And he was arrested and convicted of drug - being involved in a drug operation.",
        "The Court of Appeals threw it out and said this was an unreasonable search.",
        "And the question is: Do you have any right to privacy when you're traveling in public, or can the government use some sort of tracking technology that tracks you everywhere you go, and even if they don't have a warrant and don't - theoretically don't have any particular reason to suspect you.",
        "They just want to follow a lot of people.",
        "Can they track people with no warrant, using some tracking technology?",
        "So it's a potentially big issue."

        "Neal Katyal, this is - I'm not sure you can talk about this specific case, you may have been involved in it at some point, but this comes under the principle of, in other cases, the justices have ruled that if you're watching people in public spaces, you don't necessarily need a warrant.",
        "Exactly, so yes, this is another one in which I wrote the cert petition asking the court to hear the case.",
        "So I'll be a little bit more circumspect than on some other topics.",
        "But you're absolutely right.",
        "What the government said here is that the Supreme Court has said explicitly that it is permissible for law enforcement agents to follow people around if they're in public view.",
        "Obviously, the Fourth Amendment precludes kind of them going into a private home or something like that.",
        "Even with their devices.",
        "Exactly.",
        "But here, this is material that is in a public view, and so the question that the case poses is a really hard one for the technology and the law, which is as new technologies develop that allow governments to aggregate data in ways that weren't just technologically possible before, should our meaning of the law change accordingly.",
        "And it's not just, of course, governments.",
        "It's also private entities, as well, that can collect massive amounts of information now in ways that they couldn't before.",
        "So it makes it a really fascinating case.",
        "David?",
        "Well, I was going to say, as Neal said, normally you would think this person wouldn't have much of a claim because he was traveling on a public street.",
        "But suppose some state says from now on, we're going to put a little tracking device in all the new license plates for every car that we issue.",
        "And we want to actually track everybody in our state because we want to see for suspicious movements or patterns.",
        "Would most Americans think that that seems like an unreasonable search, or is that some sort of power that the government should have?",
        "I would say that's one way of thinking about it.",
        "Another way of thinking about it is that those types of policies are constrained by politics and by appropriate good policy and that governments wouldn't do such a thing.",
        "And it may not be as much of a question about the Fourth Amendment as much as a policy question about what governments should be doing in the future.",

        "I just keep patiently waiting.",
        "I keep thinking the California case is going to make it, but it's over here at appeals for the nth time, you know, and so I'm just kind of wondering if you guys know anything about any of those cases coming up or that case coming up.",
        "David Savage?",
        "Those cases are on the way, Tracy, but probably not this term.",
        "There's a case in Boston that's on DOMA.",
        "The DOMA cases right now involve the question of: Suppose a gay couple is legally married in Massachusetts.",
        "Can the federal government deny them the equal benefits that other married couples get?",
        "I think that's a very - that's the kind of argument, when it gets to the Supreme Court, I'll predict that the court would rule for the gay couples and say that kind of discrimination is unconstitutional.",
        "But that case is at least a year away because it hasn't been heard yet in the court in Boston.",
        "Do all states have to authorize same-sex marriage because denying it violates the Equal Protection Clause?",
        "And as you suggested, that case is also another year or two away because it's hung up in appeals in the 9th Circuit.",
        "So they're coming but not this year.",
        "Wow, wow.",
        "It's amazing how long it takes to get that done.",

        "That's true, although I would point out that the court's actual rules are very fast.",
        "So once there's a lower court decision, the party that lost has just a couple months to ask the Supreme Court to hear it, and then the other side only has 30 days to respond to that.",
        "And then the case will be heard and decided all within a period that's at most nine months.",
        "So really start to finish, Supreme Court adjudication is about a year long.",
        "Normally when we talk about delays in the court system, it's not as much at the Supreme Court level as in the district court and in the courts of appeals.",

        "Cindy, excuse me, Cindy.",
        "And indeed, one of the judges in the Court of Appeals raised precisely that concern and said he was concerned that there was a kind of property trespass element to what the government was doing here.",
        "What the government says is that it is a routine thing in law enforcement to have kind of minor intrusions on properties.",
        "The common example that we're all familiar with is the chalking of car tires by people who do the meters and so on.",
        "And if you see, you know, the attachment of a minor device that, you know, a small device that isn't obtrusive in any way is like the chalking on the tire, then it seems like a permissible thing for the government to do.",
        "And, of course, there are arguments on both sides of that question."
