        "Well, that is the argument that Arizona has made and will make, which is we are cooperating with the federal government.",

        "And, Neal Katyal, it's also the question of the Arizona law, as I remember it, says police officers can stop someone in the course of their regular duties.",
        "In other words, they're not going to be going around doing raids, looking for illegal immigrants.",
        "But there is this fear that the - and the government has submitted affidavits from the State Department and the like that Arizona or other states would engage in over-enforcement of the law in ways that could be detrimental to foreign policy, that is immigration is integrally bound up with foreign affairs.",
        "And we generally do not in this country allow states to conduct a foreign policy that is adverse to the United States government more generally.",
        "If I could just say one other thing for your listeners that they might be interested in watching, we've been talking about specific cases.",
        "But one thing to look out is just voting alignments at the court.",
        "Last year, it was pretty striking that Justice Kagan on her first term on the court agreed with Justice Sotomayor 94 percent of the time.",
        "And the only pair that did better than that that agreed more often was the chief justice, Chief Justice Roberts, who agreed with Justice Alito 96 percent of the time.",
        "Those are the four most recent justices, and they're developing - at least if one term is evidence can be any sort of reliable guide - but they seem to be in some sort of lockstep with each other, and they're obviously both pairs that were nominated by the same president.",

        "And he's lucky and - or he benefits from the fact that he's been supporting the surge even before it had that name in, the surge.",
        "And he was a supporter of this notion long before it was popular or showing perhaps that it was doing well.",

        "But they don't want to bruise or damage their image.",
        "You know, they don't want to be disrespectful, and they don't want to seem too shrill, because just as voters may look at them and see them in that moment as presidential, they don't want to hurt that and look like they're a little over the top or might be over the top if they got into the Oval Office.",
        "Well, yesterday, we saw the congressional Democrats really outflanked by the left wing in their party.",
        "You mentioned the Moveon.org ad that appeared in the New York Times, that used the term General Betray Us, and there were, of course, protesters who disrupted yesterday's hearings.",
        "Will this part of the anti-war movement make life difficult for these Democratic presidential candidates?",
        "It makes life difficult if, for no other reason than the anti-war activists are persistent, they keep score, and they punish.",
        "And so each of them has to make sure that they listen to this constituency, make it look like they are doing everything they can to meet their concerns.",

        "And it seems like all these news from Washington has pushed Thompson off the front pages, and he's just another candidate out there shaking hands.",
        "Can he handle that?",
        "I think he can.",
        "You know, he had a pretty good launch, and I think he probably could stand for a little quiet time.",

        "I think his campaign would say we're happy to talk about 9/11.",
        "You're right.",
        "He's gotten attacked on it, both in his response to 9/11 and his preparation before the attack.",

        "One of his rivals, Fred Thompson's campaign, raised this point explicitly with me last week when I was on the trail with them - saying, yes, Rudy Giuliani was a mayor of a big city, and that's fine, but it's not national experience.",
