        "When you have someone who wakes you up in the middle of the night with a knife at your throat and tells you that he can kill you and nobody would care - and then when you go to the police repeatedly, and they laugh at you, this is clearly a situation deserving of protection.",
        "At first, some courts rejected this theory.",
        "In Alvarado's case, immigration judges agreed that her story was brutal, but they ruled that the system of asylum was not intended to protect survivors of domestic violence.",
        "It's a grave, pervasive, chronic international problem, but this is the wrong tool to solve that problem.",
        "Michael Hethmon is a lawyer at the Immigration Reform Law Institute.",

        "I think Karl is someone who has a certain amount of radioactivity in terms of the general electorate.",
        "He's not all that well-known, but he's a polarizing figure certainly for Democrats, many of whom are extremely vituperative in their comments about him.",
        "So Republican campaigns aren't going to want to have him front and center.",
        "But I think they do want to tap his brain, which is considerable; he after all got George Bush elected for president twice.",
