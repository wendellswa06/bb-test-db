        "And this is all state propaganda.",
        "And I've never seen a football match in my life be so politicized because of bad blood between two nations.",
        "And then Mubarak politicized that game.",
        "Now, I've been to football matches all around the world, and there is politics in football, and there are divisions in football matches.",

        "Yeah.",

        "And - but I spent some time with the North Korean team in Switzerland, in a training camp a couple of weeks ago.",
        "I did a story about it for CNN.",
        "And what was interesting about it is you actually saw these North Koreans smiling, having fun, you know, and they were totally devoid of politics.",
        "What's interesting with the North Koreans, as opposed to the Iranian national team in 2006, who qualified for the World Cup and then President Ahmadinejad tried to use the national team to kind of promote national unity back home.",
        "And Kim Jong-Il hasn't tried to use that with the national team.",
        "So they've kind of come to the World Cup purely as kind of the mysterious man with the weight of their politics on their back.",
        "But it hasn't been used politically in any way, but they've certainly added a certain kind of interest and secrecy to the World Cup, which I think is very interesting.",
        "Now, you mentioned Ahmadinejad and the Iranian team of a couple of years ago...",
        "Yeah.",

        "But this team of Shia, Sunni, Kurdish players all came together and won this game against - all - kind of all the odds.",
        "It's almost kind of like a Hollywood film script.",

        "So there can be moments of unity.",
        "But football was mainly a mirror by which to watch the society you find it in.",
        "And mostly, the society is divided.",

        "Our time is up, but I want to ask you one really quick question for one really quick answer, if I may, James.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The United States, does it do this?",
        "Do is use nation building through soccer?",
