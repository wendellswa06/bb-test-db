        "I mean, Mr. Card has held this job much longer than the average chief of staff.",
        "Does he have a mark on the government?",
        "He has a bit of a mark.",
        "The job has changed under Andy Card.",
        "In previous administrations, the chief of staff had a more powerful and central role in the administration.",
        "Some people would say James Baker sort of ran the country at the beginning of the Reagan administration.",
        "Under President Bush, Andy Card has acted as a kind of manager.",
        "There are a lot of powerful personalities and egos in the Bush orbit, and Card manages things more than plays that central powerful role that maybe chief of staffs had in the past.",
        "And so with Vice President Cheney, Karl Rove and others around the president, the chief of staff has to be kind of again a manager more than the person in the room shouting the loudest.",
        "Well, Mr. Cheney's not going anywhere, and Mr. Rove doesn't appear to be going anywhere, so you wonder, sort, of what exactly Joshua Bolten think's his tasks are going to be.",
        "Well, he is an implementer.",
        "And so, to the extent that the president recognizes there needs to be change inside the organization of the White House, if he puts Bolten in charge of making those changes, they will happen.",
        "This all relies on the president recognizing some need for change.",
        "We're not going to hear much about this at the public level.",
        "They're not going to come out and hold a press conference and say here are all the failures we've had, and here are the changes we're going to make, but if the president recognizes there needs to be change and puts Bolten in charge of the task, he does both have the power and the constitutional capability of going to those powerful people and saying, this is what we're going to do.",
        "And if he's got the president behind him, he'll get it done.",
        "Here's an example of a kind of thing that he would have to decide.",

        "I really didn't have that many options.",
        "And I went, and I lived in my sister Rachel's(ph) back bedroom, in her tiny, little bungalow, and she displaced my niece, Raley(ph), who was 5 at the time, and I ended up sleeping in this little kid bed.",

        "I grabbed my second chance the way I saw my own mother do that after my father left, when I was a kid.",
