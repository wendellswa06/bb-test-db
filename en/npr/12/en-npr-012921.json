        "But anyway, I was very fortunate to have family that helped me with the children, but I just have to praise my two youngest - I mean my two oldest girls at the time were 9 and 11 years old, who just took over the household duties of cooking, everything else, and I worked in an insurance office as a claims secretary, for $400 a month.",

        "Listen to how she describes herself as lucky.",
        "And of course, I think about her children, who were so lucky to have her as a mother because she did something very similar to what my mother did, which is she went to work for the first time outside the home, and her kids got to watch her succeed, which is - what a fine example to set.",
        "You write that wonderful description of your mom, who had been, before the divorce, in the house every day, cooking a great dinner every night but got home from work every day, lay down on the bed still in her work clothes, said I need 20 minutes, and then going downstairs to cook the hotdogs.",
        "Right.",
        "I grew up on a dairy farm, and my mother was this really excellent, you know, gardener, and her job was to take care of us, and she had these amazing vegetable gardens.",

        "She had a really amazing career as a college professor after all this, and what a privilege to watch someone in your life do that.",
        "And Juanita, it certainly sounds like - well, Sunday should be a heck of a day.",
        "I can't top all of that, but I did enroll at the university, and I got a one-year - I completed a paralegal program, and then I got a job at the university, and I worked there until I retired.",
