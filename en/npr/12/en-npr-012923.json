        "So tell me about this U.S.",

        "There's sort of the university list and a liberal arts school list, and it uses criteria to weigh the schools.",
        "In fact, it ranks them one through whatever, 60, 70.",
        "What are the criteria that are most weighted by this list?",
        "Well, you're right.",
        "I think it's important that students and families understand what U.S.",
        "News is and what it does.",
        "First of all, let me just say that it provides some very interesting and useful information.",
        "The concern we have about it and what I want people to know about it is that U.S.",
        "News is a business.",
        "It wants to make a profit.",
        "And this edition of their magazine is their most profitable because, I think, because people love rankings.",
        "They're so attractive.",
        "It's so, you know, interesting to think well, what's number one and what's number 10 and what's number 50 and so on and so forth.",
        "But inherently, again, if you think of the concept of match, a ranking isn't going to help you because each individual person would have their own rankings based on the kinds of things they're interested in.",
        "You know, would you want a big school, again, do you want a small school?",
        "Do you want a film studies major or do you want be a chemist?",

        "So what U.S.",
        "News does is compiles rankings that are based on a bunch of factual indices.",
        "And that comes from information that the colleges provide themselves.",
        "Such as SAT scores, the top of the class…",
        "That's right.",
        "…the bottom of the class, these sorts of things that the incoming students are.",
        "What else?",
        "SAT scores, selectivity, student-faculty ratio, something called financial resources, something called faculty resources, graduation rate.",
        "So they use a lot of information that would be useful to students.",
        "And you can sort it on their Web site, which is very handy.",
        "There are other Web sites that do that as well, which I can mention in a minute, but 25 percent of their ranking, and I think the part that makes it the most, you know, sort of, sensational when it comes out on the news stands is 25 percent of a school's ranking comes from a survey that is sent out to all college presidents, all college academic deans, and all college deans of admissions - three people at each institution.",
        "I actually - I didn't because I - my parents were very good about not putting pressure on me in terms of the, you know, U.S.",
        "News & World Report rankings of a school.",
