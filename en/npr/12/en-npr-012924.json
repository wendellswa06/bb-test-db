        "Exactly, and on the way back, we had a seven-hour delay, but that gave me plenty of time to explore the city of Glenwood Springs, and see what they had to offer.",
        "So, I didn't really find it a curse.",
        "I found it a blessing.",
        "And I absolutely loved riding the train.",
        "Great.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Lauren.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And you write about being able to see things you never would have seen from an airplane, for example, just the seemingly prosaic sight of hay being baled in the fields.",
        "Hay being baled, cotton, little small towns, you know, it's always the back yards that trains are going through, and I love that.",
        "It's like this cross-section of life, and it beats looking down on clouds, as pretty as clouds are.",
        "I used to feel when I was flying that I was just up there and that they'd move the world underneath me.",
        "And with a train, you know exactly where you are, and how long it takes to get to, I don't know, Marathon, Texas.",
        "It's different.",
        "It was kind of like being reminded of being American again.",
        "Let's get Neal on the line, Neal with us from Hastings, Florida.",
        "Yes, sir.",
        "My son works for a United States' airline, and he works in South Florida, and I live in North Florida.",
        "And I find it much more enjoyable to get on the train here near Jacksonville, Florida, and take the Orange Blossom Special, is what it is, it's coming in from farther north all the way down to Miami, to visit my sons and grandchildren.",
        "Flying on the airlines is like a torture, you know?",
        "I feel - I'm six foot two, weigh 250, stuck in a cramped little plane.",
        "Even when I look out and look at the Cape as we fly by, I still have an uncomfortable feeling, can't wait to get there.",
        "Whereas on the train, and like your speaker was saying, you get to look out the window and see Florida go by you.",
        "There's three different types of environment you go through.",
        "The orange fields, and the local people, and plenty of leg room.",
        "And you can take a nap and enjoy it.",
        "So, I really like the train.",
        "The leg room, Catherine, that was one thing you noted and a lot of the people you spoke with noted as well that you have as much room as you would in first class on an airplane."

        "So, I don't mind that delay.",
