        "Now, let me ask you both.",
        "From having listened to Abby Wetzel and talked about some of the ways that people choose colleges - let's start with you Ms. Smith - isn't this asking students to be awfully self-aware about what they're going to do in some of the most experimental years of their life?",
        "I wanted to say I really love Abby in her independence, in her college choices, in her approach to college admission.",
        "I also respect what her parents have done and I presume her secondary school counselor.",
        "There is great pressure from peers, from parents, to make the right choice about where you select colleges, and usually it is about the most selective institutions for the wrong reasons.",
        "So, I do so respect that Abby apparently didn't feel pressure, and that's one of the first things I think parents should learn about starting this process with their children.",
        "Admissions is less predictable in terms of where you're going to get into.",
        "There are over 3.2 million high school graduates in the pipeline to apply to colleges, and I think the college process that parents knew when they applied is very different now.",
        "So I think there are tons of tools that students use, including Web sites.",
        "I highly recommend - and Abby said this as well as President Will - visiting the institutions they think they're interested in.",
        "And I caution people about getting caught up in the hype of where they're applying.",
        "But understand why they're applying to certain types of institutions.",
        "That's the most important piece of advice I would offer.",
        "Joyce, give me a sense of some of the questions a student might ask themselves or the parents might ask themselves going into this process.",
        "If they are looking toward - you just said, sort of getting to know themselves and what they want out of a school.",
        "What might they ask themselves?",
        "I think this is where the value of a good college counselor or a counselor in the school and the good connection with parents in talking about some of those choices.",
        "It drives me crazy when all of us end up asking kids, what do you want to major in and why do you want to go to that school, when in fact, most of them may know about colleges based on what's in a book or a Web site.",
        "But they have to visit and get a feel for it.",
        "And I applaud those institutions, many liberal arts colleges that don't put pressure on kids initially to declare a major, and that gives them greater options.",
        "I think that's the best thing most counselors probably recommend for students when they're starting this process.",
        "Give yourself a range of institutions and options.",
        "Visit, read, become familiar, talk to alums, talk to currently enrolled students to get a better feel for the institution.",
        "And let me ask you, Kate Will, the president of Gettysburg College, what are you guys - what is your school recommending that students do as they're thinking about colleges?",
        "Well, I love the advice that's been given and I, too, was impressed by Abby.",
        "She sounds like she made a thoughtful choice and she had really good reasons for, you know, the different combination of factors that worked for her, which was great.",
        "What we do at Gettysburg College is, again, we are a small liberal arts college.",
        "We have about 2,600 students.",
        "And it's very much - each application is looked at personally and individually as a person, and we're even SAT-optional because we believe we can tell better how well a student is going to do from their high school grades because that's a day-after-day performance rather than a one-day test.",
        "So we look at each individual and we even give individual tours for families, so that they can be tailored.",
        "It isn't, you know, whole group of people trailing someone who's walking backwards and talking about the college the way you usually hear about it."

        "I would like for your listeners to appreciate that 75 percent of students graduating from colleges graduate from public institutions.",
        "We tend to focus so much attention on the most selective schools, and parents apply the greatest pressure because they do want environments for their students that are competitive in the name brand and the stickers in the back of the car window.",
        "But when, in fact, some of those factors might end up being more important if the students are considering certain types of professions are graduate schools or professional schools where that undergrad experience might be critical to an admission's decision for graduate study.",
        "I'm a graduate of a public institution in Kansas, and I don't know that I mapped out my path in terms of pursuing this kind of career.",
        "But often, I find that parents may find it's more important for them to be able to say where their kids are going to school then the students valuing that themselves.",

        "It does.",
        "I think, though, that the liberal arts colleges are much less known because they have such small classes.",

        "These elite colleges are so expensive now.",
