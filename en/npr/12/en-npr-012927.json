        "Sorry about that.",

        "And, you know, one of the things that I feel is absolutely necessary is for parents to be, you know, involved with kids from, like, freshman year on and actually figuring out where their gifts and talents are.",
        "You know, the school kind of has a holistic approach.",
        "They educate kids with math, science and everything.",
        "I think it's archival to the parents to figure out where their gifts and talents and abilities are, so they can be a little more focused.",
        "You know, for years we've heard that it doesn't really matter, you don't have to choose a major.",
        "But now, you're paying so much money, and there is so much debt involved, especially at private schools, that to go to school and change your major two or three times is going to cost you so much.",
        "And I think the kids need to spend some time freshman year, working through -and even sophomore year - just thinking carefully about where their gifts and their talents lie and that takes input from teachers.",
        "But it really takes a lot of guidance from parents.",
        "Thanks for your call Jerry.",
        "Let me go to you, Fran Landau.",
        "You said at the beginning of your comments that students should be realistic about what their options are, and I believe you meant that, not just in money, but in terms of what they want to do and are good at.",
        "I agree with that, yes.",
        "I think some students - some parents want to push upon students where they wish they would excel.",
        "I think, probably 25 percent of every incoming college freshman class thinks they're pre-med.",
        "But then, you take your first biology class and you realize maybe that's not an option or your first organic chemistry class.",
        "So I think kids should really look at themselves realistically.",
        "What are their values, what are their goals, what are their academic interests, and I find some kids really choose for their extra-curricular interest.",
        "Is it a place I want to pursue being on the newspaper?",
        "Is it a place I want to play field hockey?",
        "And those interests can also come into play."

        "I've been at Walt Whitman as their college counselor 17 years.",
        "And have you noticed over those 17 years, a change in the pressure level that students are feeling as they're looking at schools?",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "Actually, a student wrote about the stress at Walt Whitman High School in a book.",
        "So - yes.",
        "There's a great deal of stress, but I'm not convinced - and there's a great - and the kids today are really putting more pressure on themselves and taking harder courses than they used to.",
        "So it's a wonderful thing, but I do feel there's a point where kids might burn themselves out.",
        "And it's better for them to really work on trying to develop themselves as a human being.",

        "And very often, I've noticed with my students that if they visit the campus as opposed to using the Web sites or using the videos, they seem to have a little bit less chance of transferring.",
        "They seem to find schools at which they really want to stay.",
        "And I think that helps their parents in that regard in the long run."

        "The point is a college grad stands to earn 75 percent more in salaries than people who just go through high school.",
        "So I know we're not debating about the choice of going to college or not.",
        "But that pressure to be successful, I think the pressure that parents want their children to have a better experience than they have in life, all of that certainly does add up.",
        "And the pressure that Fran was talking about also can apply to the factors that feed into an admission's decision: how competitive the grades are, how competitive the courses are, how rigorous, how many times they take - they've placed in exams or SATs or ACTs.",
        "All of that feeds the frenzy of I got to do better, I got to have more because they're hearing their peers talking about test preparation, taking I.B., International Baccalaureate.",
        "All of these kinds of things add to that frenzy.",
        "So I would agree that if there is some way to stop the madness, parents, as we've heard on this broadcast, stepping in and really getting involved and understanding what their students are taking and why.",
        "Thanks so much for inviting me back.",
        "Counselors, offer all kinds of advice to families, and I wish that more parents would listen to a lot of the places that are fortunate enough to have great counselors like Fran."
