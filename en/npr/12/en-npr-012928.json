        "That's what they're called, encouragements?",
        "That is so gentile.",
        "Well, (unintelligible) diplomatically here.",
        "You don't vote a yes or a no. You encourage or discourage.",
        "It's seen as a little bit more polite, I guess.",
        "It also allows you to change your opinion and also to encourage more than one candidate.",
        "In this hour, we'll look back at what happened yesterday and who won, who lost, and why.",
        "And we want to hear from those of you who participated.",

        "Well, both are obviously very close.",
        "Barack Obama has a lead in both.",
        "We're perhaps may be pretty close to calling Missouri for Barack Obama.",
        "We had called it earlier for Hillary Clinton, but there was an Obama surge late last night, then it went too close to call, and we went to sleep not knowing who would win.",
        "Many networks had already Missouri for Obama.",
        "It looks like Obama may win the state of Missouri, which would be a big pickup for him.",
        "New Mexico - very, very close.",
        "The last I saw with a couple of hundred votes was an Obama lead, too close to call.",
        "But also interesting because Andy Kohut who's here will talk about the demographics and everything and how the Latino vote in California was overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama.",
        "But in heavily Hispanic New Mexico, almost a dead even state at this point.",
        "So it's going to be a complicated analysis.",
        "Again, we'll be talking with pollster Andy Kohut and a couple of minutes.",
        "But have the Democrats finished apportioning their delegates?",
        "No, they're still, you know - well, a lot of the - if you look at a lot of the states - I mean, first of all, it's very interesting.",
        "Hillary Clinton - it's really a draw what happened yesterday.",
        "Obviously I would think that going into Super Tuesday perhaps a month ago, we would have thought that this would be Hillary Clinton country.",
        "We see that a lot of states where you have an opportunity to see the candidates up close, Barack Obama does far better than the national reputation of Hillary Clinton which many thought may help her carry the day in Super Tuesday states.",
        "But it was very, very close yesterday and, you know, Barack Obama may have won 13 states to compare to Hillary Clinton's eight states.",
        "But at the same time, Hillary Clinton won the big ones.",
        "She won California.",
        "She won New York.",
        "She won New Jersey.",
        "And not close; it was pretty, you know, convincingly in not only on the delegate count, but in the popular vote she did very, very well.",
        "So obviously, both candidates on the Democratic side can certainly claim victory.",
        "And maybe for us political junkies, we are happy that the Democratic race goes on.",
        "Some Democratic strategists may not be so happy because they would love a nice, tidy uniting of the Democratic Party, and then they'll face the general election as a united party."

        "We saw that in South Carolina, for example, a lot of people thought that Mitt Romney would've - I'm sorry, that Mike Huckabee would have won, but Fred Thompson and Mitt Romney and others took away conservative votes from him.",
