        "And when you're hearing stories like that, Ken - and those are not the only places where there hitches or not enough envelopes or there were other problems, (unintelligible) but most of them caused by the phenomenal turnout.",
        "From the moment the Iowans participated in the caucuses on January 3rd I guess it was - it's been so long ago although it's only like a month ago.",
        "But the turnout on both parties, but especially on the Democratic side has been record breaking.",
        "It's just phenomenal.",
        "And it's so disappointing to hear that state election officials in subsequent states since Iowa, New Hampshire did not prepare for this onslaught of voters.",
        "You know, you hear the story from Wichita is heartwarming in the sense that enthusiasm was there, but the fact that many votes did not count, many people could not stay long enough until provisional ballots were - they came up with it, that's disappointing.",
        "Let's get Craig(ph) on the line.",
        "Craig calling us from Haley in Idaho.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We're - we've experienced sort of the same things that I'm hearing on the show where, you know, everybody was inundated for our caucus, it's only about 1200 people made it in before basically it would have been a fire hazard to have any more people in our local auditorium.",
        "There was where the traffic was backed up through town and they're trying to get voting slips out to the people waiting outside.",
        "It started snowing.",
        "It was cold.",
        "But it was amazing to see the range of ages.",
        "People commenting on, you know, back in Kennedy - referring to Kennedy and - Robert Kennedy, also high school seniors who just turned 18 signing up to become delegates for the June 12th state…",
        "Convention I think it is, yes.",
        "…convention that's going to happen here in Idaho.",
        "And just the fact that out of the 1200 people in the auditorium that were voting, only about 160 went for Hillary Clinton, and that didn't even give her enough percentage to have a single delegate.",
        "So all of us here in Blaine County looks like will go to Obama, which was pretty much heartfelt in the auditorium that night, last night.",
        "It was amazing.",
        "Well, thanks very much for that report.",
        "Ken?",
        "You know, it was amazing that Don Gonyea had a piece on NPR over the weekend.",
        "He was with the Obama campaign.",
        "And I guess - I think it was Boise, and there were thousands and thousands and thousands.",
        "And you think of, you know, Idaho is - you don't think of it as a Democratic stronghold, shall we say.",
        "Joanne who called earlier from Wichita said that she hopes that Kansas will be a blue state in November.",
        "Now, both Idaho and Kansas have not gone Democratic since Lyndon Johnson in 1964.",
        "But again, there was so much enthusiasm out there on both sides.",
        "But again, we're hearing it more and more from the Democrats, you wonder if there - it doesn't change in November.",
        "Craig, thanks very much for the call."

        "As little as possible I think is the answer on the Republican side and as much as possible on the Democratic side.",
        "And I think a large part of the reason why there's so much energy here is because people have been discontented with President Bush's second term.",

        "Well, one of the surprises was the role of Latinos in California.",
        "They were represented - 30 percent of the Democratic electorate.",
        "A very big number, a little bigger than I think many pollsters expected.",
        "And they decisively went for Hillary Clinton.",

        "But a lot of it wasn't so surprising; it was building on what we'd seen, the patterns that we'd seen - gender, race, age, ideology, social class and political independence - making a difference on the Democratic side.",
        "And yes, there was some variation from state to state, but this really did have the character of a national primary with trends that we saw pretty much in most places.",

        "I mean, if you look at the white evangelical Protestant vote, it's - it was very strong for Huckabee and where it's very large in the southern states, which are largely Baptists.",
        "So this could either be denominational or regional.",
        "But if you get up into - look at the states in the north where the numbers are smaller, Huckabee didn't really do that well among white evangelical Protestants.",
        "He did reasonably well, but didn't win them in many states.",
        "And Ken Rudin, as we mentioned earlier, Mike Huckabee did pretty well yesterday and won in a lot of places nobody expected him necessarily to win.",
        "But as he looks ahead, haven't most of the places where he can expect to do well, already voted?",
        "Well, that's exactly right.",
        "Obviously, the states that - his best states were always considered South Carolina, which he narrowly lost and he won Georgia and Alabama, Tennessee.",
        "As we said, not much left in the south for him to pick and choose at - off.",
        "The next big southern primary, of course, we have next week is Virginia, but that's less, I think, good for the kind of appeal that Huckabee is making.",
        "Texas is March 4th, which is quasi southern - it's more western than anything.",
        "So I think it's very possible that Mike Huckabee's best days may be behind him.",

        "We didn't expect him to win in many of the states he did carry yesterday.",
        "So who knows?",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I would just prefer it to be the popular vote.",
        "I feel that - I realized that we may still have lost, but I would feel that in the big picture if you added up all the votes on both sides, it would be more even.",
        "I just feel that we need to reflect on a national basis what people want.",
        "And if we go state by state, I feel that it's more divisive.",
        "It divides us into us or them rather than looking at the big picture."
