        "And Minnesota went strongly for Romney last night even though it was a straw poll.",
        "But even though our governor is John McCain's campaign chair, the supporters were not energized for McCain in Minnesota, and it might be because our governor should be focusing more attention on Minnesota's deficit instead of concerning himself with becoming a national candidate.",
        "It seemed like all Pawlenty could do on NPR last night on national radio was after he found out McCain lost; he attacked the Republican base for not choosing his candidate.",
        "And they were - you know, do you think McCain can win in November when it's very likely if he pairs up with Pawlenty he'll lose the states he won on New England (unintelligible) last night in California?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "A good question, Ken Rudin.",
        "Well, I suspect that - given the fact that John McCain's weaknesses in the party is among the conservative faction of the party, which is not - is far more than a faction, it's actually the majority of the party.",
        "I think he has to go to the right for a running mate.",
        "I think Tim Pawlenty, while he is a clear McCain supporter - and a lot of people talk about him as a possible vice president, I suspect that McCain needs to go to the right to, you know, win over the conservatives who are hesitant about him.",
        "So I don't think it's Pawlenty.",
        "But also, same thing with Schwarzenegger in California, even though McCain did win the state of California, Schwarzenegger has become more and more unpopular.",
        "His battles with the legislature over the budget have really hurt his approval rating.",
        "So, you know, there's always a two-edged sword with endorsements.",
        "Whatever negative that Pawlenty and, for example, Schwarzenegger may have they could also bring down the candidates they're backing.",
        "Yet, Andy Kohut, if you look at Massachusetts, a popular Democratic governor, Deval Patrick, and both the senior senators from Massachusetts - Ted Kennedy and John Kerry - endorsed Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton won that contest handily.",
        "Voters have a mind of their own.",
        "Right.",
        "And she had a pretty big base of support for a good deal of time, and it didn't wear away.",
        "Now, it did wear away in some places.",
        "It wore away in California and, you know, 52 percent - 48 percent of the people in California, Democrats in California said a Ted Kennedy endorsement was important to them.",
        "And - but not in all places.",
        "Going back quickly to the woman from Minnesota.",
        "Also, it seems like in caucus states on the Republican side, that - the conservatives are more energized in caucus states and that's why one of the reason I suspect that Romney won in Minnesota had it been a primary, maybe McCain might have done better."

        "It has a lot of influence, and that would influence the common person thinking, okay, if this money is coming from this company, maybe I don't want to have anything to do with that candidate.",

        "I am - I also, you know, concerned about why does there's an equal time for the candidates that are doping as well.",

        "And if they got more coverage, there'd be more influence towards them.",

        "And all of a sudden, he started popping up in our polls and has - and he started popping up in news coverage more.",
        "So it's tempting to think that it's only coverage, it's only what the polls show, but there are so many cases where you see a candidate coming from nowhere to say that it's all one way.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And Andy, as the race - particularly on the Democratic side - now looks like a scramble for delegates anywhere in the country, what lessons do you take away?",
        "If a campaign manager calls you today, well, what would you tell him?",
        "I guess what I would tell him is that you've got a long tussle ahead because this is all proportional voting, it's not winner take all.",
        "And, you know, we could see a very, very close race here - from here on in.",
        "and each of these candidates have their strengths to the extent that they are successful it means that they're pushing the female vote, for example, in terms of Hillary Clinton, or the black vote in terms of Obama, or the we-want-change vote in terms of Obama very hard.",
        "I don't think there are any magic solutions to this.",
        "I think it's just going to be a hard-fought campaign almost delegate by delegate because the Democratic system is not winner take all and we're going to have a close race.",
        "And that's why we're going to keep going.",
        "Andy Kohut, thanks very much for your time today.",
