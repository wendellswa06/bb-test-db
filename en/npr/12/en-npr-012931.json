        "Latino voters represented 29 percent of those people who went to the primary in California yesterday and they overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton 2-to-1.",
        "And it made a big chunk of the difference.",
        "But it didn't account for the entire margin of victory.",
        "And it - we also saw that in - where you are, New Mexico, the Latino vote split more or less 50-50.",
        "Well, it - the exit polls indicated 56 percent support for Hillary Clinton.",
        "And New Mexico's an interesting state because it's the most heavily Hispanic state in terms of the percentage of voters.",
        "And it was the subject of a great deal of love by all the - by both candidates and by high-profile surrogates.",
        "And we should, of course, remind listeners we speak of the Latino vote.",
        "The Latino vote is not homogenous; it is very different from state to state.",
        "Certainly in Florida, you have a lot of Cubans, for example.",
        "In New York, Dominicans and Puerto Ricans, different from the Mexicans in places like New Mexico and California.",
        "Well, it - I'm sure in fact that it would be wrong to speak of a Latino voting block.",
        "You can talk about Latino voting group or some tendencies.",
        "But what we saw in terms of results yesterday, the difference between the New York Latino vote strongly, overwhelmingly in favor - 73 percent in favor for Hillary Clinton, and the neighboring state, Connecticut, where Obama won a majority of the Latino vote.",
        "And again, Latinos in those two states are not terribly different from each other.",
        "Keli Goff, let me turn to you.",
        "Record numbers of young people voted yesterday.",
        "Every four years, it seems, we continue to hear - this is going to be the time when, well, the 18-year-old voter's going to make a difference.",
        "That's right.",
        "Well, this at least in the primary season and it does seem to be coming true.",
        "Well, you know, I said this so many times that I'm beginning to sound a bit like a broken record.",
        "But one of the things I said early on before we started seeing this turnout in the contest is that people always say, you know, we hear this every four years and then they never show up.",
        "And, you know, I've always made the distinction that it's not that young don't like voting, they like feeling inspired to vote.",
        "Not simply voting, you know, between the lesser or two evils, which is often how, you know, by the time we get to the general election it tends to be presented to us, right?",
        "Like, well, he's better than the other guy."

        "And a lot of young people don't want to be forced with those options.",

        "And so this election cycle, we have a couple of candidates that seemed to really be inspiring them.",
        "One in particular, as you know Barack Obama, has really done well in large part on the strength of the youth vote.",
        "In fact, in Iowa, there were very instrumental that he's won there.",
        "And a lot of people said if - you could analyze the Democratic vote in a lot of different ways, one way would be to say, well, by class, Hillary Clinton got most of the people who made under 50,000 a year.",
        "Barack Obama got most of the votes who made more than that.",
        "And also, by age.",
        "Hillary Clinton - older voters broke heavily for Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary; younger voters heavily for Barack Obama.",
        "Well, you know, Neal, someone said something really interesting to me the other day, and this is I have to say for the record - I'm not going to say his name on the air because he hasn't given me permission to do so.",
        "But he's a registered independent from New Jersey.",
        "So I often go to him to sort of - he's sort of like my political thermometer because, you know, I figured he's an independent voter from a state that's become increasingly more of a swing state and so he's a great gauge for sort of what he feels about candidates.",
        "And what he said to me is that, you know, he said, I think Barack Obama - and I should add also that he's 47.",
        "He said, I think Barack Obama's interesting, and he goes, but he's going to have to work on finessing that whole change message he keeps mentioning.",
        "Because, you know, older people, like my father-in-law, hear the word change may think, I'm not really sure what that is exactly, but I know I don't like it.",
        "So I'm going to need a little bit more to work with on that.",
        "I thought that was a really interesting analysis of things.",
        "And it really sort of set with some of the other conversations that I have had even in my own family with people who are over the age of 50, over the age of 60, which of the voters and which Hillary Clinton's has tended to do better with.",
        "Here's an e-mail we got from Angie(ph) in Roseville, California.",
        "I live in Placer County, California and in the short time I was at our polling station I noticed something amazing.",
        "For the first time ever, I encountered independents, Republicans and Democrats.",
        "And also, represented were different age groups.",
        "A couple of 20-somethings, a couple of 40-somehtings like myself, and a couple of seniors, it was remarkable and inspiring.",
        "And, again, Ken Rudin, part of the extraordinary turnout yesterday.",
        "Yes.",
        "And actually I was listening to Keli just now talking about something and I was just wondering if I can ask you a question quickly.",
        "We do know, as Neal just said, the exit poll did show that more older voters went - gravitated to Hillary Clinton, the younger voters for Barack Obama.",
        "Hillary Clinton will be 61 years old next year.",
        "She would be the oldest Democratic nominee since Harry Truman in 1948.",
        "John McCain is 71 years old, he would be the oldest president first elected ever.",
        "We talk about all the young people inspired by Barack Obama this time, well, what do you - what are the chances of an inspired, young voter participation in November if it's Hillary Clinton versus John McCain?",
        "Also with us from Atlanta is CNN writer AJ Willingham.",
        "Glad to have you with us, AJ."

        "And the reason I say that is, you know, it's interesting, in August - I don't know if you all will recall this - but there was this moment reported upon by the Associated Press in which Barack Obama was trying to convince an undecided Democratic voter why he should support him.",
        "And I think that the person hesitation was due in part to the fact he's African-American, they didn't know if that was a - would make him a viable candidate.",

        "At that time, that sounded wacky because this was back in August and everyone was basing it on historically, but that hasn't been the case, and then he proved it in Iowa.",
