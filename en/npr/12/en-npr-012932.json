        "Right now, they don't have any delegates at all.",
        "It's hard to imagine that in two crucial states that these delegates ultimately will not be seated, and I think it'll be up to the Democratic nominee, whoever he or she will be, to decide about that.",
        "But it's interesting because right now the way it is, it looks like the needed number of delegates to win the Democratic nomination may not include Florida and Michigan.",
        "Hillary Clinton has made the case that, look, these are - they're real people too, and they should have a say.",
        "And so that could be a very interesting convention fight if the fight for the nomination goes that far.",
        "Luis Clemens, you're ordinarily based - you're joining us today from New Mexico, but ordinarily based in Florida, what do you think is going to happen?",
        "I can't imagine that the Florida Democratic delegates will be seated.",

        "But a number of people have been calling in expressing their frustrations, and despite the fact that we did have record turnout for our polls, we had some of the people in Minnesota who were our last balloters.",
        "We're balloting scraps of paper, and we were struggling to read some handwriting.",
        "Everybody who got to the poll in a timely fashion was able to ballot.",

        "Do you have the total number of Democratic votes by person nationally?",
        "This we do have from the Associated Press, or at least was an approximation a while ago - it may have been updated since then, but Senator Clinton got 7,280,733 votes; Senator Obama 7,201,017 votes.",
        "On the Republican side, John McCain got 3,600,684 votes, Governor Romney 2,945,832 votes, Governor Huckabee 1,788,217 and Ron Paul - Congressman Paul 392,293.",

        "Let's see if we can turn now to Luis Clemens.",
        "And as we saw, the Latino vote was very different in different states, is this something that's going to be a factor, do you think, in the Democratic side, that Senator Obama is going to be able to make inroads in places like Texas, for example, that's coming up?",
        "Well, Texas is the last great stop in terms of the primary race for Latino voters.",
        "Fairly 1-in-4 voters in Texas are Latino.",
        "And it's his last chance to make a huge - to recover some ground with Latino voters.",
        "And I think we're seeing differences between neighboring states of similar Latino populations that I've never seen before.",
        "I really can't explain the difference between the Latino vote in New York, in New Jersey, and the Latino in Connecticut.",
        "Even though it's very similar makeup of the Latino population, I really feel like I should start consulting the National Enquirer astrologers to try and figure out what's going to happen next.",
        "Ken Rudin?",
        "You - Luis, you mentioned earlier that John McCain could be more dangerous to the Democrats than other - certainly other Republicans.",
        "Would it be in John McCain's best interest to make that point?",
        "That given the fact that Latino voters are the biggest, the fastest-growing block in the country, that he would be able to get a better, bigger percentage, or do you suspect that that might anger Republican conservatives who feel that illegal immigration and the word amnesty is a more important issue?",
        "I think the Carl Rove school of arguing that Latino voters aren't important is dead and buried for at least a few years.",
        "And when you consider that the McCain campaign didn't even post its Spanish language radio ad that it ran in Florida on its Web site, has tried to keep talk about its Hispanic outreach director to a minimum, they're really trying to lower all that talk regarding Latino voters.",

        "You've been writing quite a bit about this and I'm wondering, well, first of all, it may sound like a ridiculous question to you, but for people outside of college basketball, how big of a deal is this?",
        "This is the biggest gamble in college sports since SMU football was put on the death penalty in the mid-'80s.",

        "This will impact schools all over the country.",

        "I mean, I think there's always been this smoke, you know, even outside of the sports circles.",

        "To me, it really does underscore the larger issue with the NCAA, which is that the NCAA itself is built on this lie because the smoke that emanates from this story isn't just the smoke of oh, man, look at this money changing hands in this shadow economy.",
        "It's the fact that a school like Ohio State, for instance, just signed last year a 15-year, $250 million-plus endorsement deal with Nike.",
        "So there's all of this money, and so can the NCAA get around amateurism?",
        "Well, they're not just saying they can do that.",
        "They're saying they can get around amateurism while bathing in capitalism.",
        "And so now we're just seeing some of the effects rise to the surface.",
        "AJ, what do you think?",
        "The biggest problem here is that even the most casual of college sports fans knows that this is going on.",
        "This is not, I don't think, a big surprise to anyone.",
        "Maybe the scope of it is, but we all know this is going on.",
        "And we all know it is built on a system that profits from students and from young adults who may not see that level of compensation back to them.",
        "I wanted to ask each of you - let's say these allegations, just for the sake of argument, are true and obviously this all has to be litigated and go through the court process.",
        "But let's just say for the sake of argument that this is true and that this whole thing comes to light as you believe it to be.",
        "What should happen after that, Gregg?",
        "Well, I'm talking to university presidents around my state this week, and I'm already talking to one, President McRobbie at IU, Indiana University, who says that one way to help this is the NCAA needs to come down harder on folks.",
        "When they get caught, crush them, you know, so they will learn their lesson.",

        "But as Jeff Goldblum says, life found a way.",
        "And one of the dinosaurs switched to female, and they started having babies.",
        "And then they had three great movies out of it, and the fourth wasn't so good.",
        "So my point is cheater's find a way.",
        "You know, to ask what can be done, you can't stop it.",
        "And one more thing.",
        "I imagine that there are a lot of folks listening and, AJ, you said that student athletes are being taken advantage of.",
        "And I can hear people rolling their eyes around the country.",
        "First of all, that's rude.",
        "But second of all, it's true in a lot of cases.",
        "For a lot of these kids, you know, their adviser, their friend, their coach, whoever, is nudging them nudging them nudging them to a certain school.",
        "And the kid goes to that school and thinks he chose it himself, has no idea that school or that school's shoe company paid your coach a hundred thousand dollars.",

        "Albert Means, football recruit out of Memphis years ago, got sold to Alabama and had no idea until the news broke.",
        "He didn't know he got sold there.",
        "To your point, Gregg, I think when we're looking at the inevitable question of should we pay these college athletes, I think even if they were compensated and even if they were given a little bit more opportunity and a little bit more agency, as you said, money finds a way, cheaters find a way.",
        "And so to me, when we have these questions in mind, that is the larger question is how can we protect young players?",
        "How can we ensure that whatever does come to pass is in their best interest?",
        "Pablo, what do you think?",
        "I mean, does this loop back then to the question of whether student athletes should get paid?",
        "At least it would be transparent.",
        "Purely on the basis of principle, they're refusing to pay labor.",
        "Like, it's not just that they're saying no one can drink alcohol.",
        "It's that you people who are making the alcohol aren't allowed to profit from it whereas everyone else gets to.",
        "And until you can admit that this is the market and here's the market value and here's who's profiting and here is who's not, you won't be able to address the fact that the people who go to advise these kids and get stakes in these kids - coaches, advisers, agents, all that - those people tend to be of the caliber that is problematic.",
        "Let's turn now to another story about the whole take-a-knee-or-not controversy around the national anthem, which is still going on.",
        "It's still being talked about and tweeted about.",
        "CNN has some new numbers that found that 49 percent of Americans say professional sports leagues should require players to stand during the national anthem, but 47 percent said they should not require it.",
        "And there was, as you might imagine, a deep partisan divide on this between Democrats and Republicans.",
        "And there was also a racial divide between African-Americans and white respondents.",
        "And also there was a bit of a generational divide too.",
        "Now, AJ, you wrote a piece for CNN saying take a knee protest has always been about race - period.",
