        "Well, let me tell you, of all the things that I've ever written for CNN and all of the reactions I've ever gotten, I have never gotten a more emotional, more vitriolic response to a topic than this one.",
        "People just - they don't particularly care if it's about race if they do not think that the method of protest is legitimate.",
        "I thought Eric Reid who originally knelt with Colin Kaepernick when he was on the 49ers last year put it best in The New York Times when he said, I felt like we were representing a flag at half mast.",
        "I felt like we were representing America in a time of tragedy.",
        "I don't know how you could have a patriotic outlook and not identify with that.",
        "But for a lot of people, they just say this isn't the way to do it.",
        "And in their mind, that delegitimizes the protest.",
        "Gregg, you wrote a piece for the Indianapolis Star about this looking at a lot of different vantage points, including your own, and you yourself are from a military family.",
        "You talked to players who knelt, players who stood.",
        "What's your takeaway from all this?",
        "What's going on here is hundreds of almost entirely black athletes are kneeling, and white America doesn't like it.",
        "And they move the goal post and find reasons.",
        "It's about the - it's about the military.",
        "Until about five years ago, the flag meant everything.",
        "It's our country.",
        "It's this, it's that, and the military is part of it, but it wasn't just the military.",
        "But now all of a sudden you're disrespecting the military.",
        "They moved the goal posts.",
        "Like, here's the goal posts.",
        "Oh, you think it's about this.",
        "Let me move the goal posts over here.",
        "It's really about that because I'm going to get mad at you about that.",
        "It's not about race, though.",
        "It's about everything but race.",
        "Pablo, what do you - what's your take on it?",
        "Colin Kaepernick has been extraordinarily clear about what he is addressing here quite clearly from day one and Eric Reid, his teammate, their decision to kneel after a conversation with Nate Boyer and veterans who asked that as a signal to the veteran community could then the military - could they kneel instead of sit?",
        "That's more respectful.",
        "They agreed to do so.",
        "There is an expectation that you have an obligation outside of your own intent to demonstrate a safe space that has been erected because we want to show or signal to our veterans and to our military community that they get this time of day to be free from intrusions.",
        "And so the basic question, the big question, is simple - do you consider these concerns expressed by Colin Kaepernick and those dozens and dozens of teammates and colleagues that Gregg mentioned, do you consider those concerns serious enough to warrant that kind of intrusion into that space?",
        "And that's what people have to ask themselves.",
        "You consider it real or you don't.",
        "So I'll ask each of you, where does this go next?",
        "Or do they start a player pack?",
        "Because, as we know, a number of these NFL owners have contributed to political candidates who these players might not support.",
        "I mean, Pablo, where do you think it goes next?",
        "Well, there are all these commissioners who are signaling - Adam Silver of the NBA signaled that he would prefer that guy stand.",
        "And so we're going to find that it's very problematic to rely upon people whose foremost job is to market and sell black athletes to America to be thought leaders on protest.",
        "It really is at this point on us.",
        "It's on everybody else.",
        "Are you listening to the substance of the protest, or are you getting lost in all of the noise and confusing this controversy over platform for a discussion about the issues?",
        "Gregg.",
        "One thing that can happen is they'll stop letting the teams be on the field or the court during the anthem.",
        "We've already seen some NFL teams just not go out there.",
        "I can see it eventually moving that way.",
        "Last thing I'll say about this - what I can't do is listen to white America tell black America how they can and can't protest if they're not breaking laws."

        "has faced and maybe not such a sort of a public figure taking strong stances.",
        "But on the other hand, there's been a history of the great powers choosing secretary-generals to be like that.",
