        "The irony is of course that since most secretary-generals come from, you know, fairly middle-ranking or, you know, non-threatening nations, it's not so much a mark of a nation's greatness as a mark of a nation's lack of greatness, generally, that has let it's nationals to become a secretary-general.",
