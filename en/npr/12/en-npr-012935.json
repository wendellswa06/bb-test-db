        "And this is the way this is seen as there's goals to increase this in the future, right?",
        "Well, yeah, the demand is so high that they have set goals of more and more pilots, we should say drone pilots, over the next several years.",
        "But right - one of the significant milestones happened the last six months, late last year and then again early this year, with a graduation of pilots who are drone pilots but who have never seen, essentially, the inside of a cockpit ever.",
        "Wow.",
        "And so that, for the Air Force, was a significant thing.",

        "But there were more people there than one would suppose, but they were underground.",
        "They were in their shelters and their cellars and that sort of thing, and they're just emerging after a lot of weeks down there.",
        "But at best, I would say if you take Nabatiyeh as exemplary, there's probably 5,000 people there.",
        "Now there's 25,000 people.",
        "Now there's an estimated probably - according to the U.N., and I think they've done a pretty good job of estimating this - there's about 10,000 homes in south Beirut and south Lebanon that are not habitable.",
        "And for those folks, now it's tough - it's a tough road.",
        "They'll basically go into neighbors' homes, family's homes, but they'll stay in close proximity to their land.",
        "These are - most of these folks down in south Lebanon, except for those on the coast, most of them are farmers and the draw to the land was something that I think the U.N.",
        "and NGOs like Mercy Corps underestimated.",
        "We thought that they would be a little more tentative, a little more cautious in going back home.",
        "Now it's different for the folks in south Beirut.",
        "And as you know, about half the displaced people came from south Beirut.",
        "And they're a little more tentative, they're staying up a couple of hours maximum in the hills to the east and they're sending their heads of household down south.",
        "Now these are mostly apartments.",
        "They're not agricultural folks.",
        "They're small retailers and that sort of stuff.",
        "So we still have displaced, mostly from south Beirut, and those people will go back probably over the next week or two.",
        "But no doubt it's a rush - it's a rush to get home.",
        "And we're real happy, non-governmental organizations like Mercy Corps, because it seems like despite the popular skepticism about the durability of this cease-fire they believe enough in it that they're going home."
