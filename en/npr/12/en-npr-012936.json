        "Well, what do you make of this shift?",
        "What I wanted to point out is that I think the days of the top gun is coming to an end.",
        "Once they developed a fighter aircraft that could be robotically controlled or have inboard computers that can operate, those aircraft can handle more Gs, loiter longer, stay in the combat zone longer than manned aircraft.",
        "It's a simple fact of life.",
        "Computers can operate better than a pilot.",
        "We all know that autopilots worked, fly a plane better than the pilot in the aircraft.",
        "As far as the culture changing, there will always be a need for pilots in the Air Force.",
        "They may not fly the most advanced fighter aircraft any longer.",
        "Even the F-35 has its limitations.",
        "But in time, in not-too-distant-future time, we're going to start developing robotic fighters like we have the drones today, which are simply robots manned from the ground.",
        "They can loiter longer, and they're devastating to the enemy.",
        "And so Roger, what do you see this doing?",
        "You said the top gun attitude will die out.",
        "What do you see this doing to the military culture?",
        "Well, I think the former belief that the fighter pilot, swashbuckling type is probably going to go away, and you're going to have the MIT specialist out there.",
        "And he's going to be wearing the white scarf in the cockpit.",
        "But it just it will change it, but we're our new young people today are used to computers, are used to systems like that.",
        "It's a change for us older guys, but it won't be the change for the young ones.",
        "And that's just the way it is, progress.",
        "Well, thanks for calling.",
        "Gordon Lubold with the Christian Science Monitor, what about that?",
        "I mean, are you seeing, you know, do the younger people coming into the service not have as much a problem with this shift?"

        "Right, I think that you're going to see this change and, you know, for example, the pilot I spoke with in particular during my visit, you know, he admitted that he will do whatever it is he needs to do for his service.",
        "He'll salute smartly, but he really wants to get in that cockpit and fly F-16s.",
        "They're saying online and in kind of quiet conversations by email and blogs that it's going to be very disruptive to take a culture that for 100-years-plus has been male-only and all of a sudden put women into those situations.",
        "And I think people fear that they won't be able to be as free and as casual as they have been with women around.",
        "I wanted to quick put this into a broader context, which is the Air Force still believes, and even its leadership and all kinds of smart people out there, that you still need the capabilities that fighter jets bring to the fight.",
        "And even if they're not they dont appear to be relevant in this fight, and they certainly really have played a smaller role than they have in others, there's still a push for the U.S.",
        "military needs to have a conventional capability to fight near-peer-like enemy I don't want to call it an enemy, but a country like China if we were to ever enter into a conflict with that country or a country like them.",
        "And you're going to need you won't be able to just do it by remote control.",
        "And so some of the kind of budgetary tension that's occurred here at the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill about where the Pentagon should be putting, you know, its dollars when it comes to airplanes, and especially for the Air Force, stems a little bit from this tension about, you know, wither the Air Force, and what is it going to look like in 10 years or 20 years.",
        "All right, Gordon Lubold, Pentagon correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor, you're going to stay with us.",
        "We are going to talk more about changes in military culture in a moment, and we'll go from the air to the sea and look at some changes happening on submarines.",
        "We'd also like more of your calls.",
        "If you serve in uniform or used to, what do these changes mean to you?",

        "We're talking about some of the recent changes for the U.S.",
        "military.",
        "Women officers will be allowed on submarines, but smoking will not be, and the Air Force is more focused on drones now than dogfights.",
        "Changes in rules and operations inevitably change military culture, and some aren't happy about it.",
        "Rear Admiral Barry Bruner headed a task force studying the issue of women on subs and acknowledged as much in a blog last month.",
        "He wrote: I recently spoke with a number of our retired submariners who were vocal in their opposition to the integration of women on submarines.",
        "He said: We've looked hard at the impediments to successful implementation of the plan, and I continue to feel this change of policy is needed to maintain the readiness of the most operationally active submarine service in the world."

        "So Phil, these changes, no smoking but women allowed, that's happening next year or really the beginning of 2012, is that right?",
        "Correct, yeah, the military wants to do away with smoking on submarines by the 31st of this year, and by 2012, I think at the latest, they hope to field the first officers on the first submarines (unintelligible).",
        "Must they do them both at the same time?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "That's right.",
        "For some people, that's going to be stressful, no?",
        "The changes are coming one on top of the other, which for the submarine force, two big changes is causing a lot of quiet consternation in what is the silent service, and so that's why a lot of retirees have been active about this in speaking out.",
        "But a lot of current submariners feel that it's not their place to speak out openly about changes the decision makers are making, and so you hear about it quietly but not as much as you do from former submariners or retired Navy people."

        "I want to ask you about the quiet opposition, but first why?",
        "Why have they decided to allow women on submarines?",
        "Well, the Navy has three big warfare areas: aviation, surface and submarines.",
        "And submarines are the last of those big three areas that have not been integrated with women so far, and historically, there have been a couple of reasons.",
        "Submarines are very small, intimate, confined spaces.",
        "They involve a lot of close-quarters work for long periods of time.",
        "I read one description that said they'll be having to pass in hallways that are not wide you have to brush against each other as you walk down the hall, right?",
        "Correct.",
        "There's a lot of very close, personal contact with your shipmates on a submarine, just in the day-to-day life of walking to and from your duty station or eating in the crew's mess, et cetera.",
        "And so that's one reason historically people have been leery about including women because, you know, you can imagine the kind of challenges that might be associated with that from certain people's perspectives.",
        "So...",
        "And they're deployed, what, three months, right?",
        "Well, it depends on the ship.",
        "There are two and a half kinds of submarines in the Navy, approximately.",
        "There are small, fast, fast-attack submarines, and there are big missile submarines.",
        "And of those, four have been converted into special, custom missile boats that don't carry nuclear missiles but rather conventional attack missiles and special operators.",
        "And those latter two and a half latter bigger boats, the missile boats, are going to be what's carrying the first women.",
        "So there's much more room than there is on fast-attack submarines but still a lot of, like I said, quiet opposition from people who are wondering how well this is going to work.",
        "So who are you hearing that opposition from?",
        "What are they saying?",
        "And then after that, he helped train the Iraqi forces - the police and the soldiers.",
        "Besides that, he also has a Ph.D. from Princeton and is considered an expert on counterinsurgency warfare.",
        "He just co-wrote the army's new manual on how to fight a counterinsurgency."

        "Submariners are very competent, very professional, but they're also very insular and closed in.",
        "They used to call the Air Force the Junior Stealth Service when they first began to field stealth aircraft because they have been the quiet, seldom-seen, seldom-deserved part of the military for so long, and as a part of that, they've developed a very distinctive but inward-focused culture that doesn't get a lot of public attention.",

        "I mean, are there separate quarters?",
        "Are there you know, what about the bathrooms?",
        "How is it going to work logistically?",
        "They'll be able to modify the larger boats much more easily than they will the smaller submarines just in terms of bulkheads you have to move theoretically.",
        "In fact, I don't think you have to make very many physical changes to the boat to be able to create a separate space for women.",
        "So they'll...",
        "So we're not looking at new design of subs in the future necessarily?",
        "Correct.",
        "And that is one reason historically the Navy has resisted this because they've said to modify what are extremely expensive, extremely complicated, nuclear-powered ships, to have men and women crewmembers would just be so expensive that they've questioned whether it's worth it.",
        "But for the big boats, the boomers and the SSGNs, they can kind of close off one of the officer's staterooms and have three or four women just stay in there themselves.",
        "What about bathrooms?",
        "I believe they will have their own custom arrangements on the ship.",
        "And that's one of the friction points because a colleague of mine interviewed some of the first Naval Academy midshipmen who just were selected to do this, and one of them made a joke about how, you know, we're not going to be able to take an hour in the bathroom on the submarine to get ready to go to work.",
        "And she was being less than serious, but it does touch on kind of a core cultural issue between men and women getting ready, you know, how do they behave in close quarters, and that's what makes a lot of current submarine people nervous, I think.",
        "Let's hear from Bob(ph) in Charlotte, North Carolina.",
        "Also, I believe you're a retired Marine.",
        "Is that right, Bob?"
