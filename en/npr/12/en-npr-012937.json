        "I retired in 2002.",
        "Welcome to the show.",
        "Yeah, and I saw a lot of changes beginning early in my career.",
        "You know, I went in in '79, and I didn't serve with a Marine unit that had women in it until 1992.",
        "And so, you know, that was a big culture change for Marines.",
        "There were certainly Marines in the female Marines in the Corps, but we just didn't see them if you were in the combat arms.",
        "Did you go through a transformation yourself?",
        "I mean, did you welcome it at the time, or was it kind of hard and got easier or what?",
        "Well, we had to modify our language rather extensively.",
        "You know, the whole thing about, you know, sexual harassment really came to the fore.",
        "And really I think the bigger change that happened in the '80s was the was technology, and it was the gas chromatography test used to detect drug abusers.",
        "I mean, when that system hit the fleet, I mean, we got rid of drug abusers, and we got rid of them lickety-split.",
        "And I would bet today that there probably is still some drug use in the Marine Corps, but, you know, it's hard to escape detection anymore, and that really did a good thing for the service.",
        "Are you saying there's a connection between getting rid of that and maybe gender relations within the service?",
        "Yeah, yeah, absolutely, absolutely.",
        "I mean, you know, they got rid of the bad old days, you know, the leftovers from Vietnam, you know.",
        "Then Reagan came into office, and man, we got a new military, and we won the Cold War without firing a shot.",
        "Right, well, Bob, thanks for calling.",
        "What do you make of that?",
        "It's a great point, and it sounds like a superficial thing or a silly thing, but just the way men feel like they can speak when women are around or when women aren't around has been a big thing that submariners have kind of talked about among themselves because all of the sudden if you're if you've got a bunch of salty, 20-year Navy veterans on a ship, and there's a new, young, female ensign who's there as a part of the operation, it makes people nervous.",

        "I have no doubt that submariners will eventually get used to it, and these kind of initial speed bumps will probably get smoothed out, but it's going to be a different world for those guys for the next couple of years.",

        "We have a call now from Marcus(ph) in Philadelphia who wants to talk about the smoking ban onboard submarines.",
        "Hi there, Marcus.",
        "Hi, how are you doing?",
        "Good.",
        "I'm an ex-nuclear-submarine officer, served back in the '80s, did my department head tour on fast attack boats, and I actually have opinions on both.",
        "First of all, the smoking thing, I think it's about time.",
        "When you walk around a submarine that has smoking aboard, if you go into the crew's mess, you'll see the overhead is absolutely stained with nicotine and all the byproducts, I guess, from smoking.",
        "I'm not a smoker myself.",
        "Now we're not exactly sure what General Petraeus thinks about sending more troops.",
        "But I understand there is quite a bit of reluctance among much of the brass to do this.",
        "(Foreign language spoken).",
        "And it's kind of silly when you think about we're being in a closed environment with CO2 scrubbers and burners and all kinds of requirements to ventilate every so often if you haven't been up at periscope depth for a while.",
        "It just seemed counterintuitive that we were allowing smoking to go, you know, as a matter of course.",
        "It was kind of surprising to find out this hasn't happened before.",
        "Is it because you can just be out there for so long, essentially it means - it's not like not smoking in restaurants.",
        "It means, you have to give up.",
        "Is that..."

        "That's absolutely true.",
        "And I'm sure the smokers that are - the three-pack-a-day guys are the ones that really have a problem getting used to it.",
        "Now, I do know that even when I was leaving the submarine force back in the early '90s, there were actually volunteer boats, where there were - boats that had a full crew that kind of did an unwritten pledge to say, okay, I'm not going to smoke.",
        "So I don't think it's going to be a cold turkey sort of thing.",
        "When you look at the cost of smoking to not just, you know, the atmosphere on an enclosed environment but just to the health of the guys, it can't be a bad thing.",
        "Well, thanks so much for calling.",
        "Phil Ewing, are you hearing any quiet opposition to the smoking ban or is it being well-received?",
        "Definitely.",
        "I think it's another - and coming on the heels of the adding-women-to-crews change is a big deal for the submarine force today.",
        "And it's kind of an unfair but inescapable fact of life on a submarine that unlike on a surface ship, where you kind of designate a part of the deck topside as the smoking area where everybody who smokes can take a break every once in a while and, you know, relax and have a smoke.",
        "On a sub, you're in an enclosed environment, you're on - and the only place you can get away is a closed-off room some place else.",
        "And so, if you're on a tense patrol, you know, on a deterrence patrol on a missile boat, on a ship full of nuclear submarines and you're in a tense situation, you know, I can imagine a lot of people enjoy unwinding with a cigarette now and again, especially you're heavier smokers.",
        "And so, yeah, I think there are a lot of people who are leery about whether they'll be able to get away from this habit and have the Navy successfully wean them off.",
        "Well, is there any effort to do that ahead of time?",
        "Does the Navy have any, you know, programs, handing out the patch or anything?",
        "There is, and my understanding is that boats are going to appoint a crewmember whose job will be the kind of shepherd people through this process, and that the ships will be providing nicotine gum and patches and quit materials and other things.",
        "And so, by giving the force some time - before the end of the year - to quit smoking, I think there's a little bit of leeway there as well as these other things the Navy is going to provide to help them quit.",
        "But still, if you've been smoking, like our caller said, three packs a day for 10 years of whatever, then it's a difficult obstacle to try to jump over.",
        "And this is - it's not like you're - this is probably going to be one of the more stressful periods of your life.",
        "Absolutely.",

        "We've had gays in military forces for years and there have been no issues with that.",

        "But basically, the issue is that from our level, from the people who are actually going to be doing this it's not -it's a nonissue.",
        "The issue we have is just getting the job done, accomplishing the mission.",
        "That's our focus.",
        "Who you work with is - you know, as long as they're competent, as long as they can do their jobs - and I assure these women who will be joining the submarine force are more than qualified to be submariners.",
        "They...",
        "And I heard - go ahead.",
        "And then they - there's not - as long as they can do their jobs and they're competent and they show the qualities of a good officer, gender doesn't really play an issue of it.",
        "Then, of course, logistically, yeah, you're going to have to figure out separate (unintelligible) and things like that.",
        "But that's - that's just - those are the details that can be ironed out.",
