        "They have been doing a very good job.",
        "But we fail to make this clearly a national issue.",
        "We emphasize where most of the evacuees went.",
        "And so we're here today to announce that clearly HUD is going to take every appropriate step to make sure that no one is discriminated against on race, sex, or disability as it relates to those evacuees who have already suffered a very devastating blow with three hurricanes.",
        "So we wanted to make sure that the country understood that as they spread out around this country, that they must be treated like any other citizens within the United States.",
        "All right.",
        "So what will you do specifically?",
        "Through this campaign, you've partnered with the Ad Council to do what?",
        "To make sure that television stations, radio stations all around the country air these ads.",
        "And they have agreed to do this basically pro bono, because it's very important that people understand that these evacuees have been devastated tremendously, and they should not be subjected to any major discrimination in their effort to find decent, safe and sanitary housing.",
        "And so we have gotten a real commitment not only from the Ad Council, but from New York State's Fair Housing Agency, but from around the country as to where they will work with us.",
        "Now, you have found that, and we should note there have been a number of organizations who have conducted tests to find out about housing discrimination, it's not only for obviously, hurricane evacuees, not only for the South, but all over this country.",
        "We'll get into some of those numbers in just a few moments.",
        "But talk to me specifically about what your organization has found, what your department has found, in relation to minority evacuees and the discrimination that they are facing."

        "In fact, we have the study from Chicago that demonstrated that.",

        "Hamilton Naki died this weekend in Cape Town at the age of 78.",
        "He was not Dr. Naki, but he held an awful lot of heart in his hands.",
        "Mr. Naki was a medical worker with famously skilled hands who assisted Dr. Christiaan Barnard in the world's first heart transplants beginning in 1967.",
        "Dr. Barnard would install the heart, but only after Mr. Naki had carefully removed it from a donor and cleansed each cranny of blood.",
        "Dr. Barnard became rich and famous.",
        "Hamilton Naki was black and hadn't been able to attend school past the age of 14 under apartheid.",
        "But after briefly working as a cattle herder, he hitched a ride into Cape Town and eventually found a job tending animals in the research lab at the Groote Schuur hospital.",
        "He saw dissections there and, as he said, `I learned with my eyes.",
        "Dr. Barnard revered Mr. Naki's surgical skills and insisted he assist him in all heart transplants.",
        "The hospital had to oblige.",
        "But when the world's press first took pictures of the world's first heart transplant surgical team, the hospital identified Hamilton Naki as a gardener.",
        "By the time he retired in 1991, Mr. Naki has assisted in thousands of heart and liver transplants and taught thousands of doctors.",
        "Shortly before he died in 2001, Christiaan Barnard finally revealed Hamilton Naki's true role on his team.",
        "Mr. Naki finally received an honorary medical degree.",
        "In a way, he was gardener whose hands cultivated life.",
        "Let me ask you this, Mr. Secretary, and we'll put that on our website at NPR.org for those who may want to avail themselves of that number.",
        "Most reports that I have seen suggest that African American and Latinos in this country face discrimination about 20 percent of the time when they go looking for housing, particularly rental units.",
        "This has been going on for quite some time, quite frankly.",
        "This didn't all just come about when Katrina opened America's eyes to it.",
        "Many people are going to suggest that while this is a great effort, that it's only window dressing, and it doesn't really address the problem of discrimination and housing that this country faces from New York to Los Angeles.",
        "Ed, I'm sure that's going to be said.",
        "But let me assure you that the last four years since I've been at HUD both as Deputy Secretary and Secretary, first, Secretary Martinez and I, and now myself.",
        "We have made it a priority to address the issue of fair housing and equal opportunity, because we both as Hispanic and Black American, know the problem that many Hispanics and Black Americans have felt.",
        "We have been aggressive.",
        "We have, in many cases, brought to justice more landlords, more systematic matters that have occurred, than at any other time.",
        "Because one of the things that Secretary Martinez and I said, that both of us being minorities, if we don't do anything about it, we really can't stress that anyone else does anything about it.",
        "So we have not only been very aggressive.",
        "The reason we're doing this is not for window dressing, but to add to what we've already said.",
        "Because in many cases, what we've found, in Philadelphia and other areas, is people are afraid of the evacuees.",
        "They've heard all of these great stories about how difficult it is, how they lived in poverty, how they cannot, in essence, really live in a community.",
        "And we want to dispel that myth because these are human beings, with the same sense of worth, and all they want is a decent, safe and sanitary place to live.",
        "And it would be remiss on our part if we did not, if we did not stand by these persons who have already been devastated once...",
        "Let me ask you a question as it relates to that.",
        "You said that you are not going to build traditional public housing when you rebuild housing for those who have been displaced in New Orleans.",
        "What did you mean specifically by that?",
        "Traditionally, we have built public housing where we segregate public housing residents from the rest of the community.",
        "I don't think that should be done.",
        "If you notice, when I was running for housing authority in Dallas, when I rebuild public housing, or when I renovated public housing, I integrated it both socially and economically, and I brought in commercial and economic businesses within that community.",
        "Too often have we set public housing residents aside from the rest of the community.",
        "That is wrong.",
        "That is unacceptable to me.",
        "That is unacceptable to the President."
