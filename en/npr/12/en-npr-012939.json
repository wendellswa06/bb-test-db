        "In Atlanta, it is happening.",
        "Because we should not segregate people because they're Black or Hispanic.",
        "Let me ask you as relates to housing accommodations for this nation's poor in general, not just in the Gulf region, but in general, if you drive around this country, in many large urban areas, I think people would be shocked, perhaps even dismayed if they looked at the conditions that people still live in in 2005.",
        "Katrina did uncover for many who've never been in these regions and these areas the real blight that so many live in.",
        "What can we really look to from HUD, from the government, when we continue to mount a deficit based on the war, in really attempting to eradicate this kind of poverty, this kind of, quite frankly, homelessness when you look at the accommodations many live in, and really suggest that we are servicing these people?",
        "Well, to show you how the President is committed to making sure that we address the needs of those who are less fortunate than we are, there have only been three agencies in the last five years in government that have not been cut.",
        "The first is Defense, the second is Homeland Security, and the third is HUD.",
        "Our budget last year was $33 billion; our budget this year for '06 is $35 billion.",
        "We've added one billion, one hundred million more to Section 8; we've added over $400 million more to capital improvement, to make sure that we address the needs.",
        "But let me assure you this, that HUD can only do so much.",
        "It's really left up to the locale.",

        "We've had a predominantly Black city council.",
        "Nothing has improved in the lower Ninth Ward in 31 years.",
        "So my position is, when we went in there three years ago, just before Mark Morial left as mayor, or four years ago, I said we must change the quality of life.",
        "And if you go into Louisiana today, in New Orleans today, and you see where we have integrated both socially and economic public housing, you will see a stark change in what is occurring.",
        "And for the first time, the residents believe that there is hope for them.",
        "And we will continue that.",
        "But we have to work in conjunction with the mayor, because...",
        "Well, let me ask you this, with less than a minute to go, what do you tell those residents who are now facing demolition of the homes that were still standing, those in the Ninth Ward, that say they don't have a say in continuing to live there and live in the structures they lived in pre-Katrina.",

        "That is a local issue.",
        "And I think the federal courts are addressing that.",
        "And if I remember, the federal judge just permitted the city of New Orleans to begin the demolition only if they notify the resident.",
        "And I think that's proper.",
        "But you would see that in what HUD may have to come in on the back end is possibly problematic though, right?",
