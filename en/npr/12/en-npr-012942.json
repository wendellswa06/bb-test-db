        "That's also true of its recounting of how the war on drugs created imbalances after separate-but-equal was otherwise banned - mandatory sentences identical for one ounce of crack cocaine, used mostly in inner cities, and one hundred ounces of powdered cocaine, the drug of choice in white suburbs.",

        "There was a sense that he was implying North Korea was more ready to give up nuclear weapons than, perhaps, the intelligence analysts think.",
        "And I think now you see the reason for that concern, which is that it turns out that Pompeo wasn't just briefing the president on the intelligence but that he was an active participant in making the policy.",
        "If this gambit works - if this ends in a successful meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong Un, do you think it will have been worth it to have had Pompeo pave the way for that meeting?",
        "Well, I suppose it will end up depending on how we define what a success was.",
