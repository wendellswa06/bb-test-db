        "They needed labor and we mean here labor, in other words, people who will simply do the hard work in industries that eventually will be phased out.",
        "And the linguistic requirements meant that most of the people that went to Belgium came from North Africa because they were speaking French.",

        "But that didn't happen...",
        "It did not happen, so by 1974 essentially, you had the beginnings of communities from North Africa - particularly Morocco - that are still the dominant communities in Belgium today.",
        "And the people in these communities, is it that they don't see themselves or are they not seen as integrated into the rest of Belgium, or is it both?",
        "Well, if you continue to think that these people don't belong there, that sometime or somehow they will simply go back, you do not invest in trying to make them part of the rest of the society, which means that the people in question are not going to invest in their engagement with the majority community.",
        "And, you know, to that end though, you know, obviously that there's an argument and a very loud one going on, both in parts of Europe and in the United States - it has to be said - about whether these kinds of terrorist activities are rooted in ideology, or is it rooted in social problems?",
        "It all depends how deeply you want to go.",
        "This community's essentially self-isolated and, of course, self-isolation leads to marginalization and...",
        "Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on though - you're saying that they self-isolated - is that really true given that if they don't really have any standing in the economy, do they have any other choices?"
