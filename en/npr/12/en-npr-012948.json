        "Difficult not to think of \"\"Lord of the Flies\"\" when reading Jones' brilliant and compelling work of fiction.",
        "It's narrated by an eloquent 13-year-old island native named Matilda Laimo.",
        "As Civil War breaks out, she tells of how an all-powerful mining company arranges for the evacuation of nearly all the white residents, leaving the islanders to the mercy of local rebels and the ravages of soldiers flown in by helicopter.",
        "Matilda, a schoolgirl at the time the story begins, can't help but express amazement and fascination with the one white person who has elected to stay behind.",
        "He's an oddball Australian nicknamed Popeye, husband of a local beauty.",
        "And he's taken it upon himself to further the education of the island children by reading to them each day from Charles Dickens' masterwork \"\"Great Expectations,\"\" featuring the legendary Pip.",
        "As the villagers become trapped between the rebels and the army, the children find themselves captivated by Pip and Dickens' other characters and the English setting and by the motifs of individual destiny and freedom that emerged from their reading of this classic novel.",
        "They're also caught between their fascination with his work of art and the practical wisdom of their island parents, personified by Matilda's own mother.",
        "As the war heats up, Matilda's passion for Dickensian story-telling takes the novel to a brutal and heart-breaking finale, when she learns lessons about heroism and self-sacrifice that no one should ever have to ponder.",
        "But thanks to this novel, \"\"Mister Pip,\"\" ponder them we do, in the reading of an island fable with huge implications for every mainland on Earth.",
        "The novel is \"\"Mister Pip\"\" by Lloyd Jones.",
        "Our reviewer, Alan Cheuse, teaches writing at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia.",
        "His latest work of fiction is called \"\"The Fires.",
        "From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.",
        "I'm Michele Norris.",
        "Gabrielle Giffords from Arizona, a Democrat, and Peter Roskam of Illinois, a Republican.",
        "They both came to Washington, following close high-profile elections.",
        "And with more than a year to go before November 2008, they're both already looking toward tough reelections.",

        "Now, you know there's an adage in congressional politics that the toughest race you're likely to face is your first reelection.",
        "How rough does that road ahead look for both of you?",
        "And I want to begin with Congresswoman Giffords.",
        "Well, it's not just an adage.",

        "You know, Mayor Daley is one of the great legendary figures in the Illinois politics and he had the greatest line of all time.",
        "He said good government is good politics.",
        "And so I've spent a great deal of time and energy back in the district, in particular, in putting together an effective district office operation.",
        "So that when people call in or write in or stop by and they've got a problem, they know that in my office they've got an advocate in trying to solve their problem and come up with a solution to what they're dealing with, particularly, in terms of their case work.",
        "Yeah, that - a real earworm for us all, and not a bad one.",
        "So some controversy - right?",
        "- around best picture?",
        "Yes, very much so.",
        "In fact, there really hadn't been a truly good speaker in the White House since Franklin Roosevelt.",
        "Harry Truman had many good qualities, too, but he was not known as a speaker and Dwight Eisenhower was not either.",
        "But, of course, his last speech did give us a phrase that we remember today, the military industrial complex, probably the only phrase that he is remembered for in terms of being president.",
        "Well, as president in general, he said a few important things, too but as president perhaps you're right.",
        "But even in that little clip we heard, you heard some rhetorical devises that Kennedy used again and again, the assonance, the short phrases.",
        "You point out in the book that he studied the Gettysburg Address.",
        "Yes, yes.",
        "In fact, he thought of that as his rhetorical model, and one of the other things that you see is the scriptural call.",
        "You know, the prophet Isaiah was sort of the official prophet of the New Frontier, and often Kennedy is quoting scripture in a way that is, you know, very reverent and very relevant to his text.",
        "And there is also an assumption on Kennedy's part of whom he is addressing.",
        "These are people who he, his audience he accepts as as educated as he is.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "His invocation of American presidents, of also all sorts of famous literary figures, his assumption is that he's speaking to an educated audience and he's in a sense elevating the conversation, the discussion.",
        "Instead of speaking down to the country, he's speaking up to them.",
        "And also I should point out, Eisenhower was 70 years of age.",
        "At that point, he was the oldest man to have served in the White House, and Kennedy was going to be the youngest ever elected, and so the contrast was really quite striking."

        "(Soundbite of cheers)",

        "I am a citizen of Rome.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, remember, also, he's speaking now to a German audience, and he assumes that the Europeans are better educated in that kind of classical literature and memory than Americans would be.",
        "But, you know, that speech was such a militant statement of anti-Cold War thinking, and that was not his general style, but he caught the spirit of that moment, and of course, that crowd was almost hysterical.",
        "In fact, some of the people on the podium, the Germans with him, wondered whether the hysteria of the crowd signified that they could have another Nazi regime in Germany because there was such a kind of emotionalism to it.",
        "I was in Germany talking about my Kennedy book a few years ago, and there was a display at the German Historical Museum, Berlin Historical Museum, and the crowds have turned out.",
        "To this day, there's a kind of affection for Kennedy, a kind of attraction to him that resonates with this speech that he made in '63.",
        "And, Terry Golway, another of the classic rhetorical devises, a couple of them, repetition.",
        "Some who say, blah-blah-blah, let them come to, and that some who say.",
        "Who are these some he keeps referring?",
        "Exactly, exactly.",

        "It wasn't simply Sorensen who wrote for him.",
        "He had a lot of people who would contribute to his speeches.",
