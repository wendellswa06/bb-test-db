        "Oh, thank you.",
        "I have a quick question, but it's -- would like to chat about it.",
        "And that is, is oratory of value today?",
        "We have presidents in the last few decades that are called the great communicators, like Reagan, or presidents who connect to people emotionally, like Clinton.",
        "But, on the other hand, I wouldn't quite call them, necessarily, the bastions of great oratory.",
        "Is it of value?",
        "Is it -- is the problem -- is there a problem that it is not a value in politics today, or is that the reason why there is not as much, or the speechwriters are not being paid enough?",
        "I think we'll (unintelligible) for that one -- Robert Dallek?",
        "Well, you know, there's a famous anecdote that after Franklin Roosevelt died, somebody stopped Mrs. Roosevelt on the street and said, I miss the way your husband used to speak to me about my government.",
        "And it speaks volumes about the connection FDR made to the mass of the society, with those fireside chats.",
        "People felt as if he had come into their living room, he was pater familias.",
        "He was their uncle, their, a member of their family.",
        "Now, I think this is a political skill that lots of politicians don't seem to have, including the current incumbent.",
        "He's actually alienated so many people.",
        "There are people, of course, who do admire him and like him.",
        "But by and large, I think there are a lot more people who now find him distasteful.",
        "And if he had that talent, if he had that capacity to speak to people in rounded periods in ways that could engage them, could make them feel that he's on their side, see I think that's the key.",
        "People want to feel a connection.",
        "Reagan had that.",
        "Reagan was extraordinarily adept at, and he was called the great communicator.",
        "So I don't think it's a lost skill by any means.",
        "It depends on the individual president.",
        "Yet Ronald Reagan, Terry Golway, did not use that, that more formal rhetoric that John Kennedy, that we hear in John Kennedy.",
        "No, no, he didn't at all.",
        "In fact, you know, the oratory had changed, I think, between the time Kennedy was president and the time Reagan was president.",
        "But certainly, Reagan was capable of giving wonderful speeches.",
        "Several come to mind, the speech at the D-day memorial, 40th anniversary of D-Day, the speech after the Challenger, his final address as president.",
        "These were speeches that, I think, stand the test of time and stand the test of high rhetoric.",
        "Bill Clinton was an articulate president and remains articulate.",
        "But, of course, the only phrase that we remember from his presidency is one that, maybe you can say on an NPR station, but I'm not going to, but one memorable phrase.",
        "He said it on NPR, I think I was there, I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.",
        "All right, well, you said it.",
        "But that, we're certainly not going to see that phrase on his grave, whereas, at least I don't think so."

        "Maybe his political grave, had been in his first term.",

        "You think of the phrase mere rhetoric as dismissing somebody else's high-flown statement, but Churchill spoke rhetoric.",
        "This, the words can be marshaled to the most important aspirations of man.",
        "Dave, what I would say to you is that, having studied so many of these presidents and taught about presidential history for a number of years, if you ask people, what do they remember about a Theodore Roosevelt, a Woodrow Wilson, an FDR?",
        "And do you think that they remember that TR was the architect of the Food and Drug Administration, or that Wilson set up the Federal Reserve, or that even FDR was the architect of the Wages and Hours Bill?",
        "How many people would remember now that Lyndon Johnson put Medicare in place?",
        "See, I don't think they remember the particular acts of a president, the legislation, which of course, is the most important legacy they leave behind.",
        "Well, Marcus, I'm going to hang up on you because your phone is doing tricks on you.",
        "But thank you very much for the call.",
        "What they remember is their rhetoric.",
        "What they remember, whether there was inspirational speech or some kind of phrase that continues to capture the public's imagination.",
        "Interestingly, and one more point on this before we let Dave, our caller, go.",
        "The president of the United States has two functions.",
        "Normally, in most governments, occupied by two people, he's the head of government, the Prime Minister in most governments, and the head of state, constitutional monarch in England, presidents in Israel and various , and Germany and other various countries like that.",
        "And I think to some degree, Robert Dallek, what you're saying is, that people remember the president as chief of state making those grand speeches, rather than his policies as Prime Minister.",
        "Yeah, because they're not so drawn to politics and to the nitty-gritty that goes on in order to get legislation passed and these measures are often remain controversial to some degree or other.",
        "But I think what inspires people is that there was a president who spoke to our better angels, who offered a kind of optimistic view of the country's future.",
        "So I think you can count on the fingers of one hand a TR, you see, an FDR, a Kennedy, a Reagan, people who spoke in ways that the country's -- and a Thomas Jefferson.",
        "A George Washington.",
        "There are phrases from those presidents that still resonate with the public.",
        "And we've gotten an answer from our library.",
        "Dan Anstead tells us, fittingly, Kennedy's famous ask not line did derive indirectly from Cicero.",
        "Oliver Wendell Holmes and Warren Harding had used variations of it as well.",
        "Of course, we all remember Warren Harding's -- what?",
        "We don't remember anything about Warren Harding.",
        "In fact, he never said anything.",
        "So that's the problem: he didn't say it too well.",
        "Dave, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "And let's turn now to Jim(ph).",

        "Yeah, hi.",
        "I have two points.",
        "The first one is I thought that Kennedy kind of -- I don't want to say yell, but he really tried to project his speeches, even on the television, almost like an Ethel Merman before there were microphones on the stage.",
        "And I was curious as to whether he got his, you know, chops, you know, in the Senate where he had to do like stump speeches, you know, at places that didn't have microphones.",
        "But he always seemed to yell.",
        "Yeah, Terry Golway, again, comparison to Reagan, not just the high flung rhetoric, but that pitch of his voice was definitely aimed at the last row of the balcony.",
        "Very forceful, very forceful.",
        "Now, if you remember the inaugural address, which we opened the program with, was given at the Los Angeles Coliseum to an audience of 80,000 people.",
        "It was an outdoor arena.",
        "The Berlin speech, of course, where he's shouting also, but he's shouting because he's angry.",
        "But I suppose that some of the other speeches, he has that very forceful delivery.",
        "But if you listen to the speech he gave after the Bay of Pigs or during the Cuban missile crisis, those speeches he is very somber and the pitch and tone of his voice is very different.",
        "The Civil Rights Speech he gives in June of 1963, one can hear the emotion.",
        "It comes through.",
        "There's sincerity to it, and I think that's what he's trying to convey, this is how I really feel, this is what I mean.",
        "Jim, hang with us for a second.",
        "We're just going to hear a clip from the Civil Rights Speech.",

        "I guess his voice just carried.",
        "And, you know, some people, their voices carry.",
        "But like LBJ, I guess, it was like the end of that type of booming, almost, politician that seemed to be able to, you know, like I say, be on a stage without a microphone.",
        "And, you know, maybe that was part of their success and that's why they got there.",
        "I mean, Ted Kennedy kind of, to me, you know, has a booming voice.",
        "Same kind of a deal, yeah, and you hear him -- I've covered his campaigns and seen a lot of his stump speeches and, indeed, he does have that same form of address.",

        "Okay.",
        "One of the things, Robert Dallek, you point out in the book, though, is John Kennedy started out as a politician.",

        "Yeah, nobody ever thought that he was going to be a glad hander, a fellow who could go into taverns and barbershops and clap you on the back.",

        "Nevertheless, other presidents have made extravagant promises that we don't tend to remember quite so well.",
        "Well, you know, what's interesting about John Kennedy's domestic record, so to speak, is that he put on the agenda a number of things which were not enacted or realized in his lifetime.",
        "And then, of course, Johnson was the one who put across civil rights and voting rights and put across the big tax cut that Kennedy wanted.",
        "Put across Medicare and put across federal aid to elementary, secondary, and higher education.",
