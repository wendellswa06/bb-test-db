        "And when you have to do that you've been thrown into the situation, you know, emotionally and physically so intensely, does that stay with you?",
        "Is that search still on your mind when you have to move on?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "In fact, we've always eventually found the people we were searching for, but sometimes it took as long as six months.",
        "And when that happens then every time you're in that vicinity you just wonder, where is that person and when will we find them?",
        "You had a situation where you were trying to rescue some people who were buried in a series of avalanches on Christmas Day.",
        "How did you get to a point where you determined that further searching was pointless?",
        "We had a large, about a 40-acre search area, actually seven avalanches that came down in a row and three people were buried and lost.",
        "And we found one within a couple days, we found one weeks later.",
        "But at some point we had crisscrossed this whole avalanche multiple times with our nine-foot aluminum probe, shoving them down into the snow.",
        "We had had dogs go everywhere and we had ground-penetrating radar dragging back and forth across mapping the layers of ice and tree branches and everything.",
        "And once we'd covered it so many times there's really nothing more we could do until the snow melted down deeper.",
        "That final one, it took until Easter Sunday and it turns out that one of my students - I was teaching English at the university at the time - had been hiking by and they saw a glove protruding from the snow.",
        "And a friend went over and pulled it up and said, oh look a glove, and lifted it up and then there was a hand.",
        "So they called 911.",
        "Do you have to deal with say the families who might be understanding of course that the search may not make sense but they're going to want it to keep going on, right?",
        "He's, you know, ended up leaving a job.",
        "And we worry about his source of income and are things going to shrivel up.",

        "That's what all emergency services are trained in because otherwise you're not around to save other people in the future.",

        "Do you deal with the emotional side of that in training for this kind of work?",

        "They are key players in this crisis.",

        "It's possible the Ban Ki-moon was waiting for a public endorsement from Tehran, but what happened instead is officials contradicted the foreign minister, including Iran's UN ambassador.",
        "No preconditions, they said.",

        "This language was hammered out last year in a meeting in Geneva by a UN-backed group, and it outlines the agenda for negotiations.",
