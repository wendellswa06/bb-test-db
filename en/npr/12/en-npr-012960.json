        "Yeah, some of your critics even like to point to the fact that we're consuming less high-fructose corn syrup and added sugars today, but we're still getting fat.",
        "How do you respond to that?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Well first of all, we are consuming a little bit less than we were, say, a decade ago.",
        "A decade ago, we were consuming 140 pounds of sugar per year per person.",
        "We are right now at 130 pounds.",
        "So yes, we have cut back slightly.",
        "The problem is that the data suggests that our bodies can only process approximately, I would say, somewhere between 50 and 65 pounds of sugar per year based on calculations that are related to what we do with alcohol, and fructose and alcohol are basically metabolized by the liver pretty much the same.",
        "And that was sort of the thing that got all the attention was the analogy between the two.",
        "So we are still about double over our allotment, and that's the problem.",
        "The problem is that even though we have cut back slightly because diet sodas have increased their appeal.",
        "Currently in America, 42 percent of all beverage - you know, beverages made by the soda companies are now diet, so that has reduced total sugar consumption slightly - it's not nearly enough.",
        "And we are still way over our threshold.",
        "So what's the antidote to this?",
        "Well, the antidote, unfortunately, in so many public health venues, and this is a public health crisis, Medicare will be broke by the year 2024 unless we get a handle on this, and there is no drug target for metabolic syndrome, bottom line, the answer is reduce availability.",
        "And that of course gets everybody's hackles, you know, up.",

        "It's basically a straight-up curve.",
        "And the reason is because beer is both glucose and fat, because alcohol gets metabolized like fat, as fructose does, at the same time.",
        "And so the glucose in the beer will get metabolized to glycogen or liver starch, and the alcohol will get metabolized as fat, thereby overwhelming your liver mitochondria, thereby causing the same level of insulin resistance.",
