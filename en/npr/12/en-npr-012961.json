        "They are what we would call fat and fit, and it's easy to be fat and fit.",
        "You exercise.",
        "The problem is that all the doctors out there tell their patients if you'd only exercise, you'd lose weight, and of course it doesn't work.",
        "So what happens?",
        "They stop exercising because it didn't work.",
        "So as far as I'm concerned, that is the greatest disservice that the medical profession can do to a patient.",
        "You know, understand what exercise is for.",
        "It's for burning that belly fat, for burning that visceral fat, for burning the fat that ultimately contributes to metabolic syndrome.",

        "Absolutely.",

        "That's one of the reasons why everyone needs to, you know, get with the program, and everyone really needs to read this book.",

        "Eat correctly, and that will lower your body weight.",
        "Well, what does eat correctly mean, you know?",
        "That's really what we're talking about here, is what does eat correctly mean?",
        "What I say in the book is that the two things that every successful diet share in common - the Atkins diet, the Ornish diet, the glycemic index diet, the South Beach diet, the paleo diet, you name the diet - there are two things that every single successful diet have in common: low sugar, high fiber.",
        "Those are the two things that every successful diet share.",
        "So what's a low-sugar, high-fiber diet called?",
        "It's called real food.",

        "We did it for cost.",
        "We did it because we now had two-parent working families.",
        "We did it because the fast food industry, you know, went, you know, through the roof.",

        "This is a processed food phenomenon.",
        "We need to get back to what we used to do because there's no drug target, there's no way to fix this other than doing that.",
        "And like I said before, we don't have the money to be able to do otherwise.",
        "So buy food with no labeling on it?",
        "That doesn't have any?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "If it doesn't' have a label, it means it's real food.",
        "As soon as you're buying - when you're reading labels, that means you're buying garbage, it's that simple.",
        "Because real food doesn't need a label."
