        "Oh, well, what we did - we met, and we formed a committee of 20 so we could move forward and get something done for the colored people in that neighborhood because they had not respected our parents.",
        "So we decided that we would go on strike.",
        "And on the 22nd of April, 1951, we had our last secret meeting at our little farmhouse between Hampton City and Farmville.",
        "And we made plans then as to what we were going to do because, you see, we knew that if the schools were closed, there would be some things that we would have to do.",
