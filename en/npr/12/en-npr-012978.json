        "In the last three years, when we look at refineries, 97 percent of the violations that are considered egregious and willful were given to BP.",
        "So, BP had 760.",
        "Exxon had one.",
        "That is a colossal difference.",
        "Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers says the Valdez spill marked a turning point for the company.",
        "It was very clear that we needed to have a safety stand-down.",
        "We took a senior group of managers and supervisors, and their only job for the next several months was analyzing how we did our business and what are the areas where we need to improve.",
        "To illustrate the company's risk management approach, Jeffers offers the story of the Blackbeard well in the Gulf of Mexico.",
        "The year was 2006 and the company had been drilling for more than a year and a half, and had spent nearly $200 million.",
        "But the drilling engineers encountered more difficult drilling conditions than they'd expected.",
        "The drillers came to the management and said: Here's what we found, we've done a risk assessment and we don't think that we can mitigate the risks to an acceptable level.",
        "And so, says Jeffers, the decision was made to discontinue operations and walk away from the project.",
        "BP may be wishing it had done the same with the Deepwater Horizon.",
        "Money, Politics, and Power in the 21st Century.\"\" Exxon, he suggests, strips employees of the ability to make decisions on their own.",

        "It relied much more on people on the spot to prevent things going wrong, but at the same time, didn't have the mechanisms to prevent the accident in the first place, which Exxon has built into its system.",
        "Exxon and some of the other major oil companies are now trying to distance themselves from BP and its Deepwater Horizon operations, telling members of Congress and others that BP was operating outside the mainstream.",
        "It's an effort, Bower says, to keep the focus on BP and minimize the impact of the spill, the scrutiny and the drilling curbs on them.",
        "I think Exxon is delighting in BP's discomfort.",
        "But on the other hand, the focus on the oil industry is really bad for Exxon, too.",
        "While Exxon's safety record is better than most of its peers, the company is not above reproach.",
        "Environmentalists and others are quick to point out that Exxon was slow in making the switch from single to double-hull tankers.",
        "And, as the Sierra Club's Athan Manuel points out, Exxon bitterly fought a $5 billion punitive damage award stemming from the Valdez spill, and successfully got it reduced to about 500 million.",

        "And, Shahar says, Kosovo has some business advantages over its Balkan neighbors, like using the euro as its currency.",
        "Still, he admits there are plenty of risks here.",
        "Not only is Kosovo already in one of the poorest regions in Europe, but ethnic conflict and war in the last two decades have further destroyed its economy."
