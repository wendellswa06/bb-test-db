        "Well it was one of the awkward scenes that you get in Washington from time to time, one of those that I'm sure will come up in highlight clips, where you have the old guy, who's sitting there somewhat awkwardly, the new guy, who still seems a bit shocked to be in his first major press briefing, and the president praised them both.",
        "He said that Gates would offer a fresh perspective, that his CIA experience made him the right man for the job.",
        "He pointed out that he had had experience in Afghanistan under President Reagan and that he's visited Iraq.",
        "He also praised Secretary Rumsfeld, saying he was among the most skilled and capable national security leaders in the country and that America is safer and more secure because of that.",
        "Gates went on to say he didn't seek the job but he was honored to serve, and Rumsfeld looked a bit less, sort of, commanding than you tend to see him in the Pentagon press briefings.",
        "A little humbler and as someone was just saying, like he was trying to restrain his emotion.",
        "There was this awkward scene at the end where President Bush gives him sort of a paternal pat on the back.",
        "A lot of questions of course about timing, especially given that just a week ago President Bush had said Donald Rumsfeld will be my defense secretary until the end of my administration.",
        "That's right.",
        "And Rumsfeld has said, he's offered to resign twice before.",
        "The president did not accept his resignation and as you point out, this last week there was this sort of verbal slight of hand we discovered today in which the president said that he wanted Rumsfeld to stay on, and now we find out the day after the election that not only had he planned for someone to succeed Rumsfeld but that he had that guy ready to step into office right away.",
        "After supporting Rumsfeld steadfastly all this time, the president seems to have finally acquiesced and made Rumsfeld the fall guy for an unpopular war in Iraq and for a policy that most Americans don't support.",
        "Sources say that Rumsfeld has been trying to get out for the past year or so, but that he really wanted to leave on an up note.",

        "Then they stack each of these feaschooly on a giant skewer up to about 10 feet tall.",

        "As far as the resume - whitening of the resume, which is, you know, an interesting topic - I chose, personally, not to do so because - for two reasons.",
        "First, I think that certain things are, you know, a part of my core and a part of my actual appeal; and two because I fear that if you go along the lines of whitening, quote-unquote, your resume, you might end up in a situation where you're around people who do not appreciate your culture or your background or your race and partly because of your own need to separate yourself from that too early on in the discussion.",
        "Is there any way that you can productively introduce this idea during an interview, like pointing out that it's - the unemployment rate for black men with college degrees is twice that of whites?",
