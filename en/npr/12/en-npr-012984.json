        "Right.",
        "My style is I go into an interview, I want to present me as an individual and my background as it is pertinent to the position that I'm applying for and also, you know, the interviewer's interest, because sometimes interviewers are more interested in the fact that I went to Yale, or they're more interested in the fact that I'm from Virginia, etcetera, etcetera.",
        "So for race to come up, it would have to be the interviewer to bring that up.",
        "It wouldn't be me casually mentioning that, because like we talked about in the article, for African-Americans and for other minorities, and also for women of any race, it is a stipulation that you don't want to play one of those sort of, quote-unquote, minority cards.",
        "And you find yourself trying to avoid that topic to make sure, even when you - after you get the job, and you're working somewhere - you want to avoid that sort of minority status at all times because you want to make sure that they understand that you are there to be recognized for your merit and for your hard work and not for something else.",

        "As he mentioned, his story was part of a longer piece by the New York Times reporter Michael Lou, and he joins us in just a moment.",
        "But it's worth repeating his focus in these hard times: Black male college graduates are almost twice as likely to be unemployed as their white counterparts.",

        "It's good to be here, Neal.",
        "And as mentioned, on any individual story, in any individual case, it's easy to find a reason why one guy gets a job and somebody else doesn't, but these overall statistics, you can't argue with that.",
        "And we laughed about that a bit.",
        "I said well, I'm glad that you were fooled, but I want to let you know that I feel I'm the best-qualified person for the job, and I would appreciate the opportunity.",

        "When you say black kinds of achievements, what are you talking about?",
        "Yeah, I mean, the statistics really were striking to me.",
        "I just felt like - I've been writing stories about the recession over the last year, and I just felt like we should be doing more, writing about the African-American unemployment rate because it's so high.",
        "It's always - across educational categories, it's always been higher than whites - significantly higher.",
        "But I was just really struck when I was looking at the numbers, this discovery, and I don't think anyone else has written about it, that in 2009, the same year that we inaugurated an African-American president, the - actually it was worst among those with college degrees.",
        "And that just really struck me.",
        "Is it the same for African-American women?",
        "Is there a gap there, as well?",
        "There is a gap, it's just not as big, and I did interview women in the course of reporting on my story.",
        "I guess the consensus that I got from a lot of people, though, was maybe the stereotypes for African-American men are just a little bit more pernicious, I guess, which is not to say that women, black women, are not dealing with some of the same issues, but the gap is not as pronounced.",
        "And as you come away after talking to various people who've experienced this, that phrase that Terelle Hairston used - neo-racism - do you think that applies?",
        "Well, I mean, I think - there are academic studies that have confirmed that race is a factor in the job market.",
        "There is this study that I mentioned in my story, where they mailed out resumes with black-sounding names like Lakisha(ph) and Jamal(ph) and white-sounding names, and the people with the white-sounding names, even with the same credentials, got 50 percent more callbacks.",
        "So I think it's undeniable that something is going on.",
        "It's just - it's difficult, though, to get into what exactly is it that's going on.",
        "And it is, for the most part, I think - you know, we're not in the 1960s, you know.",
        "It's different.",
        "There's no African-Americans-need-not-apply signs, yeah.",
        "Exactly, exactly.",
        "I mean, one thing I talked about in my Week in Review people, was this notion of covering.",
        "And it's not just now, it's not just African-Americans cannot apply, but there is this aspect of, like, of African-Americans and other minorities feeling a pressure to conform to sort of the mainstream sort of norm.",
        "And so as this professor at NYU put it, it's now not whites and non-whites, it's whites and non-whites who maybe act white.",
        "And they're the ones who are in, and everybody else is on the outside.",
        "At the same time, and you also pointed this out in your Week in Review piece, this comes at a time when there is still persistent perception among whites that African-Americans get a leg up because of Affirmative Action."

        "Yeah, and that was something I was really interested in.",
        "There actually have been studies of people who study, you know - basically Affirmative Action - as the sort of the legal sort of term for it - really receded in the early 1980s with the Reagan administration.",
        "That is the notion of federal contractors being required to take affirmative action to remedy these gaps in - with racism with regard to employment.",
        "And federal contractors still have to do that, but in terms of the pervasiveness in the private sector, it really has receded, replaced by these sort of, quote-unquote, diversity programs, which have been proven to be much less effective.",
        "And they are kind of ubiquitous, these diversity programs, but actually the studies show that, for the most part, most of these programs are not effective in raising the representation of minorities.",
        "There are some that are, but those tend to be the exception.",
        "And briefly - we just have to go to a break in just a few seconds - but is there any reason to believe that this gap gets worse in hard times?",
        "Actually, the - well, I mean, clearly something's happening in 2009, and I think in general, the gap does get worse in recessions.",
        "But for - this thing that's happening with the college-educated group actually is a shift from the past.",
        "In the data I had, I went back to 1992, and it had - in the past, actually it was better - the ratio of black to white unemployment was actually better for those with college degrees.",
        "Again, we're talking about a discrepancy in statistics.",
