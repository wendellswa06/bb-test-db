        "It is somewhat of a mystery, because Mike Luo says, typically blacks with college degrees do much better.",
        "I mean, generally, the more educated you are, the lower your unemployment rate.",
        "Well, let's say the unemployment rate overall is about 10 percent.",
        "If you have a college degree, overall it's about 4.5 percent, and if you are an African-American with a college degree, it's over eight percent.",
        "Right.",
        "So, you know, it's possible - I did a little bit of analysis, a little bit of looking into it, and it seems like blacks working in the finance, insurance and real estate were particularly hard hit during this recession, and those workers tend to be college-educated.",
        "So the financial crisis and the housing crisis with real estate seems to have hit blacks pretty hardly, and we know that foreclosures are disproportionate among blacks, also.",
        "Well, yeah, but foreclosures are, in part, a function of people who've lost their jobs.",
        "Yes, yes, but foreclosures in terms of realtors, in terms of the people doing the lending, selling the homes, etcetera.",
        "So blacks in those industries who may have been serving a predominately black clientele also may - there is some evidence suggesting that they've been hit particularly hard, also.",
        "So that might be a peculiar niche of a particular industry, and that's been an industry disproportionately hit in this situation.",
        "Nevertheless, you look at these numbers, and you say: Is there any plausible reason, other than to say this is racist?",
        "Well, that is certainly the case.",
        "I mean, these disparities that we're talking about are, you know, decades long.",
        "So it's clear that race is one of the factors producing the disparities.",
        "Decades long, but as Michael Luo says, he goes back to 1992.",
        "There was a recession then, too, and it wasn't so bad then.",
        "Right, right.",
        "So again, that may be, too, some of the peculiarities of this particular recession.",
        "As I mentioned, it seems like blacks in the finance, insurance and real estate have been particularly hit hard.",
        "Okay, let's get another caller on the line.",

        "Hi.",
        "You know, I can't directly comment on the black-white disparity in hiring situation, but I do want to say that I've been looking for a job for a year.",
        "I have a master's degree.",
        "I am Caucasian.",
        "What I'm finding is that employers are hiring the person that just barely meets the qualifications and maybe is kind of semi-fresh out of college, and they're not hiring the person with many years of experience.",
        "And I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that they don't want to have to pay as much for somebody doing the job.",
        "That's my experience, and I've�",
        "So perversely, the more experience you've got, no matter what your race, the less desirable you are?",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "Now, I am looking for jobs in, you know, in education, counseling, that sort of position.",
        "I don't have a banking or finance, insurance background, but what I can say is that they're just looking for the barely qualified employee who won't put a lot of demands on them and that will not take as many sick days, etcetera, etcetera.",
        "That's my opinion.",
        "Okay, but that doesn't explain why blacks are more - worse affected than whites, does it?",
        "No, it does not, and that is a real mystery to me, too.",
        "I really have no idea why that's the situation.",
        "All right, Jay, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Okay.",
        "And Michael Luo, as you do the reporting, does what Algernon Austin is talking about - this niche in terms of the banking and finance and real estate industries - does that help explain the disparity, in your view?",
        "That's actually some really interesting data that - I did talk to Algernon a little bit for the story, and I wasn't aware of the industry focus.",
        "I mean, one thing that we have not addressed, and we should, and in some ways was a failing of my story, that it didn't address - but it was a reflection of space - but we do have to look at an achievement gap between blacks and whites, and even - so even among those with college degrees, there - I haven't�",
        "So if an employer looks more closely, not just at the degree but where you graduated in your class and what kind of grades you got, that sort of thing."

        "I'm not completely familiar with the data on it, but I think it's got to be an issue that has to be looked at and addressed.",

        "I was laid off, and now I actually am a freelancer in my own business and have found that that is the way to work.",
        "But I noticed in the article, many of the comments in the comments section - and these were New York Times readers - basically said even if a black person has a degree from Yale or the University of Chicago, you can't count that because they got in, they graduated and passed because totally of Affirmative Action.",
        "So basically, it's not worth as much.",
        "There was sort of a sense that no individual black person, no matter the achievement, could at all be as accomplished as any white person, and it never mentions - and I found this was kind of interesting because they never see if a white person has a degree, well, this person might be a legacy, and they got into Yale as former President Bush has, you know, bragged about being a C student.",
        "And so almost, you have - and I felt it interesting because it was fully maybe about 25 percent of the comments that said this, and you realize that even if you have these accomplishments that you have to prove yourself in a way that you really can't prove yourself.",
        "You can't say, well, yes, I really earned my degree.",
        "And there was assumption that, you know, you not only got in, but you graduated, because people were passing you along.",
        "And I wondered if the reporter who did the story really found this and if he found this was a piece missing in his story?"

        "Yeah, that's really observant of you of the comments.",
        "That is the big elephant in the room, and I was just really struck by how much the affirmative action issue was raised in the comments.",
        "And that actually gets at some of the experiences that people had, like Johnny Williams(ph), the guy who was in the lead of the story, and yeah, you played a little snippet of his comments.",
        "You know, he talked about, you know, you go in into the interview and just being pushed a little bit harder, like, he was in the finance.",
        "And so just binge pushed a little bit harder, did he fully grasp these concepts and was he quantitative enough and just really sort of this - he talked about - and other people talked about sort of being treated with a little bit of a skepticism that he could have the credentials that he had.",
        "And he went to the University of Chicago and earned an MBA from that school.",
        "Algernon Austin, is what we're hearing is black degrees are valued less even if they're from Yale?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, that's part of - that's what we're talking about is sort of prejudice and bias against blacks, and this is - that would just be another manifestation of it.",
        "The important point to remember is that these issues were, you know, the issues about sort of qualifications were put to the test with the studies that Mike Luo talked about before where you send out identical resumes, some of them have the name Emily(ph) and Greg(ph).",
        "Some of the - has the names Lakisha(ph) and Jamaal(ph), and yet the Emily and Gregs received 50 percent more positives.",
        "So that - those studies are designed specifically to test whether, you know, people of equal qualifications would receive equal treatment, and in that study and in other studies of similar design, they all show a strong preference for white applicants.",

        "But upon my hiring, my employer commented my race was a bonus.",

        "The - some of the research that's in that field showed, for example, a diversity training that's so pervasive out there.",
        "And that actually does not tend to increase the minority representation in companies and actually can lead to backlash, especially when it's forced upon employees.",
        "The thing that they found that is effective is when a company puts somebody accountable for increasing the minority representation, like having like a chief diversity officer.",
