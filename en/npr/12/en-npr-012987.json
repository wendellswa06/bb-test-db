        "You know, he was - what I can say about him is he is very smart, very intense.",
        "I can't say too much, obviously, because everything is sort of privileged, but I can say that he loved his kids, and he really very, very strongly, felt identified as their dad.",
        "Well Dahlia, do you think that that may have been Darren Mack's un-doing?",

        "They try as much as possible to sort of split the baby -- make everybody get, sort of, half of what they wanted.",
        "And that can be very, very unsatisfying, and frustrating, if you are the sort of person who really treasures your relationship with your children, above all.",
        "You know Dahlia, there's been a lot written about this, about the perils that judges in these cases face.",
        "And do you think from your prospective, from working in this part of the law that -- that it's a particularly dangerous role for judges to take, the role of deciding intimate questions of family and whose right, and whose wrong?"
