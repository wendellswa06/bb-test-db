        "Williams says the answer turned out to be a simple one.",
        "Orcas were eating otters because the really big whales they used to eat were nearly wiped out by commercial whalers back in the 1950s.",
        "When the big whales got hard to find, Williams says, the orcas switched to big, stellar sea lions and then to medium-sized seals.",
        "Followed lastly by sea otters, which, you know, still give you calories, but it's going to take you a bit to fill up on them.",
        "In the current issue of the journal Ecology, Williams and her colleagues show just how big the killer-whale bite out of the otter population is.",
        "First, Williams determines that the average orca needs to eat the equivalent of five to seven sea otters a day just to get by.",
        "Then she multiplies five to seven by 170, which is the estimated number of mammal-eating orcas living near the Aleutians.",
        "Then she multiplies that number by 365 days.",
        "And you end up with a whopping 300,000 sea otters in a single year potentially eaten by these animals.",

        "DeMaster is director of the federal government's Alaska Fisheries Science Center.",
        "He says the authors of the orca paper greatly overestimate the number of sea otters being eaten by the killer whales, partly because he's sure these killer whales are also eating lots of other things, like fish.",

        "The people who really know killer whales, who spend their lives following them around and studying them--they just don't find any evidence that large whales are an important part of their diet.",
