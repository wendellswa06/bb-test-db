        "Well, in preparation for this event tonight, both candidates have been given giving foreign policy speeches.",
        "And today Donald Trump laid out his 10-point military policy.",
        "You could definitely call this a pivot.",
        "He had a fact sheet.",
        "He sounded a lot more like a generic Republican - lots of numbers.",
        "He wants a bigger Army, more Marine battalions, Navy ships, fighter jets.",
        "His speech today could also be seen as an attempt to win back some of those Republican foreign policy hawks who have abandoned him publicly, many of whom have gone so far as to endorse Hillary Clinton.",
        "And yesterday Trump sat down with retired General Michael Flynn, who was his top military surrogate.",
        "He gave a pre-scripted Q&A designed to make him look more presidential, more like a commander in chief.",
        "And he was asked about cyber security.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "You know, cyber is becoming so big today.",
        "It's becoming something that a number of years ago - a short number of years ago wasn't even a word.",
        "And now the cyber is so big.",
        "And you know, you look at what they're doing with the Internet, how they're taking, recruiting people through the Internet.",
        "And part of it is the psychology because so many people think they're winning.",
        "And you know, there's a whole big thing, even today's psychology where CNN came out with a big poll.",
        "Their big poll came out today that Trump is winning.",
        "It's good psychology.",
        "(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)",
        "It's good psychology.",
        "So it's still a little bit of stream of consciousness.",
        "But when he gave that speech today, he was on script.",
        "He read off the teleprompter.",
        "He's getting better at doing that.",
        "He said when he gets into office, he's going to ask the generals for a plan to defeat ISIS within 30 days - so much for him saying, I know more about ISIS than the generals.",
        "That seems to echo something we heard from Hillary Clinton yesterday at a rally in Tampa.",
        "Let's listen.",

        "He says he has a secret plan to defeat ISIS, but the secret is he has no plan.",
        "Yes, and in addition to saying that he has no plan, Hillary Clinton also dismissed Trump's announcement that he has 88 endorsements from military officers.",
        "She rolled out 95 military endorsements today.",
        "She says his is a drop in the bucket compared to the 500 military officers that came out for Romney.",
        "Trump is now touting his plan for the military, as you say.",
        "The heart of his argument has always been that he's just tougher than Clinton.",
        "So do you think this is ultimately about who has the better plan or about who is tougher?",
        "I think running for commander in chief is always a character test.",
        "It's not really about policy.",
        "That's why Trump called Clinton reckless today.",
        "He said she was trigger happy and very unstable.",
        "That's why when he talks about strength, she attacks him on temperament.",
        "She says someone who can be baited with a tweet shouldn't have the nuclear codes.",
        "And her super PAC has a new ad out today attacking him with his own words, playing statements where he says he loves war and nuclear weapons.",
        "So this is a big debate about character.",
        "Up until now at least, it's been about Donald Trump's character, and a lot of Democrats worry that the bar is simply lower for him than her.",
        "We can have a discussion at another time about whether that's gendered, but in a change election where voters are disgusted with the status quo, the electorate just needs to know that the change candidate - in this case Donald Trump - is acceptable and plausible.",
        "And that's why it helps him when he lays out any plan at all.",
        "And as much as Democrats complain about a double standard, there is just a higher bar for her, as there always is for any incumbent trying to get a third term in office.",

        "Yes, electric power requires water for cooling and most of the power plants in the United States that are thermal electric type plants whether those are coal, natural gas, fuel or nuclear generally use water for cooling.",
        "And in some cases they use a lot of water - they run the water through the power plants to cool the power plants.",
        "Sometimes once-through, where the water comes in and goes out without much consumption of the water, but the water comes out at a little bit higher temperature.",
        "And in many plants recently built around the country, they use what we call evaporative cooling where they bring in water, they use it and cool the power plants and they evaporate the water just like you would with a swamp cooler in your home.",
        "And those plants consume a lot of water.",
        "But most of the plants in the United States still - are once-through cooling plants.",
        "They use a lot of water; they don't consume that much.",
        "But we're moving toward the situation where a number of the plants and most plants in the past 20 years that have been built are evaporative cool plants and the water consumption is going up.",
        ": Mm-hmm.",
        "Mark Shannon, a big problem?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "And there's other moves afoot that - such as in terms of biofuels and refining, there's additional water that's being used.",
        "Again a lot of those are once-through systems, most of it's returned but there's evaporative losses there too.",
        "So, you know, energy is one of those sectors that are really increasing the use of water in various different ways from - even in the mining and the processing and getting out, say, coal and such; there's a fair amount of water consumption.",
        "But agriculture still consumes the most to produce food.",
        "And that's one of the reasons why the United States is such a big water user is because of - we're a big ag country, and we grow a lot of grain and grow a lot of crops.",
        ": Mm-hmm.",
        "If we start using those crops to make fuel, do we move that to a different ledger or does that still come under agriculture?",
        "Well, it would still probably come under agriculture but the overall use would certainly go up because we have to start planting more acres and so, you'll say, well, if it's mostly rainfall, but that once you start planting if it goes - if it gets evaporated and goes into the biological fuel itself, I mean, you have to make water and CO2 to make the fuel.",
        "Water use will go up and can go up considerably.",
        ": Lester Brown, you've written a lot about water shortages, really talking about a food shortage.",
        "Well, I think most of those listening today sense that we're looking at a future of water shortages in many parts of the world.",
        "What not everyone has done yet is sort of connect the dots and realize that because 70 percent of all the water we use in the world is for irrigation, that if we're facing a future of water shortages, we're also facing a future of food shortages."
