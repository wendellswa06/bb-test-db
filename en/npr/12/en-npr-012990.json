        "And we now see a situation where half the world's people live in countries where water tables are falling and that includes the big three grain producers, importantly China and India, which depends still heavily on irrigated agriculture, and also the U.S.",
        "which substantially depends on irrigated agriculture but not nearly as much as China and India.",
        ": Mm-hmm.",
        "And I mentioned before that added to the mix now is global climate change, something you were talking about this week and in terms of glacier melt.",
        "Well, one of the most alarming developments on the climate front is the acceleration in the melting of glaciers in the Himalayas and on the Tibetan plateau.",
        "It is the ice melt from these glaciers that feeds the rivers - the major rivers of Asia during the dry season and keeps them flowing.",
        "And this is a critical time, of course, the first half of the summer before the monsoon comes in India, for example, where this water plays a central role.",
        "What I don't think we've realized yet is that all the scientists have reported the data on how fast the glaciers are going.",
        "Many of those in the Himalayas could be gone by 2035, and the Chinese report that two-thirds of the glaciers on the Tibetan plateau could be gone by 2060.",

        "And with rice, China and India are one and two, and they produce half of the world's rice crop.",
        "So what happens with these rivers that irrigate the wheat and rice crops of Asia is concern not only to those living in India and China, but also of concern to us.",
        "I mean, in a sense, those glaciers are our glaciers, too, because they produce such a large part of the world food supply on which we all depend.",
        ": Mm-hmm.",
        "Casey Brown, what about the arid areas of the world?",
        "Well, I think that the arid areas of the world already face a lot of major water challenges, a lot of major climate challenges, and that this is where rainfall is most variable both within seasons and between years.",
        "And so, really in all these cases, what we've realized is that the way we currently manage the water isn't nearly as efficient as it could be."

        "So a lot of the issue has to do with bringing clean water, clean drinking water to people and finding ways of putting in wells and purifying water in very inexpensive ways that can be technologically simple so that the average person in these places can use it.",

        "Is there a technological fix for this or - Mark Shannon, or is this something that's going to be more than just any simple answer?",
        "Well, I mean, it's definitely more than any simple answer.",
        "Technology has a place, and has a place certainly in particularly what you've - was just being said in terms of how can you disinfect and how can you decontaminate point sources of water so that people throughout the world can get access to it.",
        "I mean, really when people say, well, when they think of water purification for potable water for cities, they're really thinking of sort of the large water plants that are known in the west and that environmental engineers and civil engineers have developed very successfully over the last, you know, 100 years.",
        "But most of those methodologies are not applicable for five out of six people on the face of the earth.",

        "Well, I think Mark Shannon mentioned it earlier, the fact that, I think, water treatment is going to be a big issue in the future.",
        "The question is many of the water-treatment technologies require significant amount of energy.",
        "So if we're trying to apply new technologies to make things like seawater available for use or brackish groundwater available for use or even wastewater available for use in the future, such that we can maximize the use of our total water resources - our total water capital, if you will, that we're going to have to look at, improving technologies that can treat the water to the level that we need but are also energy efficient.",
        "Today, the desalination is five to 10 times more energy intensive than traditional water-treatment processes.",
        "So as we look at using these nontraditional waters in the future, we're going to have to look at the energy associated with that and bring the energy down such that we can use those technologies and create additional water supplies.",

        "And there are breakthroughs coming down the line.",
