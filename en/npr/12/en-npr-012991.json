        "Secondly, if you take all of these areas that flood consistently, we know they're going to flood - every year we see it coming - and start taking that water and pumping it or funneling it or gravity-feed it to the areas that need it.",
        "We have it everywhere.",
        "There's too much water and it just runs away and nobody does anything with it, so that's an awesome source for water right there.",
        "And third, as far as behavior, if ethanol is using agriculture to grow for fuel - just stop.",
        "And like out in the Southwest - I used to live in Phoenix - they're growing corn - no, this doesn't need be done.",
        "Why are we growing crops in places where they just - it takes too much water?",
        "They need to go back - instead of building a lawn out in the middle of the desert then just use their escaping.",
        "And those kind of behavioral challenges, I think, are what we need to address.",
        "But mainly, you know, is there a way that we can use this run-off water from flood areas?",
        ": Yeah.",

        ": People are also - yeah.",
        "Let me see if I can ask - Casey Brown, you want to wade in on that one?",
        "Sure, I think it's an excellent question.",
        "And traditionally, really, we've tried very hard to control our hydrology through infrastructure investments and - that's done a very good job but it's had limitations.",
        "And we've been experiencing these limitations recently with flooding events and with droughts as well.",
        "So I think more and more in the future, we have to realize that since the climate is changing and often in ways that we don't really understand, we need to build in a lot of flexibility in our water systems since - so we need to realize that to extend beyond just the infrastructure and also to the management systems so that we have flexibility to deal with the surprises of drought and to deal with the surprises of floods.",
        "And in the future, I think, with the loss of snowpack that will accompany warming, we're going to lose a lot of natural storage, and so there will be need or there will be perceived need for new storage.",
        "The question is, will we do that in sort of the old-fashioned, the old technology way of dams or can we find some new ways to do that?",
        ": All right.",
        "Okay.",

        "Is it feasible to move the water around that way or any way?",
        "She was talking a bit about the solar energy, we talked about the agriculture, and I guess, which is equaling water as much as, I guess, Einstein calling energy is equal to mass; agriculture is equal to water.",
        "Yeah, Ira, I think if we look at some examples that there are some examples of moving water around like that such as the California Water Bank that's been set up.",
        "And there is not from necessary flood seasons to dry seasons but just from people who value the water very highly, to people who can go without the water and can take money instead.",
        "And so I think there is a need for that sort of system and whether it involves a lot of new pipe work, I'm not so sure.",
        "But there's also - it's important to realize we move a lot of water around as agricultural products as well and this whole trade of virtual water and that this can be manipulated in sort of a strategic way as well, to meet some of our water challenges.",
        ": Mm-hmm.",
        "Ira, this is Paul, if I can take on that one.",
        ": Sure, go ahead.",
        "One of the things that we see with water is that it's drastically underpriced and is often given away at very, very low cost that don't reflect its true value.",
        "So one of the things, I think, is necessary is to get sort of from reverse, at least, into neutral by fixing the water subsidies that we have all over the world.",
        "You know there's the - in the west, the irrigation water that goes to farmers goes for a small share of the cost of providing it, when there are higher value use is in the cities.",
        "In places like India, the water is provided nearly free of charge and so, you know, as Lester is talking about with the irrigation water, the cost of electricity for pumping water for example is a very small share of its true cost.",
        "So one of the things, I think, we need to do, first of all, is to you know, get people to pay what it costs and value water appropriately so that it gets used efficiently.",
        "And if we can do that, that will get us a long way towards helping and to fix some of these problems that we're facing.",
        ": Lester, you agree with that?",
        "I do.",
        "The pricing of water is one of the keys to increasing the efficiency of water use around the world.",
        "One of the interesting things that's happening - I think Casey may have just referred to it - is that water is now beginning to move around the world in the form of agricultural commodities."

        "No question about that.",

        "So water is going to become a major factor in the world food situation, and as water resources are depleting and they are being depleted, the World Bank estimates, for example, that 175 million people in India depend on overpumping, which by definition is a short-term phenomenon.",
        "So when those aquifers are depleted and the wells go dry, there are going to be some tough adjustments coming down the road.",
