        "One of the things that - if people are interested in helping those who are, you know, less fortunate than us, to people in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, one wonderful thing that happened this year was that the Water for the Poor Act in Congress was just passed and the money from the U.S.",
        "government for bilateral aid went from 30 million to $300 million a year.",
        "And that's still a small amount of what's needed but from a political point of view, people could encourage their congressmen or legislators to actually to support funding for water for those billion people who don't have it.",
        ": It's interesting.",
        "It is really a touchy political topic even in the United States.",
        "I'm recalling - just a side comment - that New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson said about, hey, why don't we just pipe some of this water from the Great Lakes down to the Southwest.",
        "And he had to retract that statement; it caused such a concern around the Great Lake area.",
        "Well, there's some good technical - this is Mark Shannon.",

        "I just did a quick estimate of, in terms of the flood versus people who are in parched.",
        "We would have to - just for using in people's homes, we would have to move over seven trillion gallons of water from one area to another, and it would cost over $10 billion in energy cost alone to move that water - not even talking about the size of the pipelines and such.",
        "Up to 15 percent of the energy in California is spent moving water.",
        "So moving water is a really difficult thing.",
        "It's hard on the environment.",
        "It's very expensive to build these carriageways to, you know, from pipes to canals.",
        "So it's - although it's certainly something that people feel and have done lots for the Erie Canal to which was really for moving commerce.",
        "But from the canal and water in California to carry water, it's always a political issue, but it doesn't make a lot of sense technically either because it's going to be really hard on the environment, very expensive and use a lot of energy."

        "But my point, what I wanted to say, and this actually came out of Sandia, out of Michael Hightower's group.",

        "There's some real technical problems that have to be solved.",
        "But it is possible, then you wouldn't have to build big pipelines and you can build it where people are and more people could use this.",
        ": So you might be able to flush your toilets with that water, but not drink it.",
        "Oh, you can, not only flush your water but you might be, if you could desalinate, you could actually drink it, you could use it, so it would be desalinated water - it's brackish water.",
        "But you - and actually we have lots of wells already there, we call them oil wells.",
        "And there's a large amount of water for every barrel of oil that's pumped up.",
        "Currently, there's one to 300 barrels of water that come up that we have to do something with, currently, and we spend money to inject it back down into the ground.",
        "So it's - there are things that one can do and, indeed, there's a lot of research that's yet to be done in desalination that could make it more affordable.",
        ": Interesting.",
        "The second part is what do we do with the highly concentrated saline?",
        "What are the environmental impacts?",
        "Absolutely, that is a huge issue.",
        "And the concentrated saline in the inland areas - we call that residuals - that is an open problem that still has to be resolved.",
        "You know, in the arid Southwest, you could put it out on the land and let the sun evaporate it.",
        "But then that uses up land and it actually concentrates toxins, toxic compounds as well.",
        "So there are things that one can do and we have research that's going on to try to figure out if we could get it all the way to a solid without spending a huge amount of energy and cost to do this; it actually has some economic value, these salts, that are left over.",
        "But that is an open question.",
        "In the sea, you dilute with more seawater.",
        "And the seas are absolutely enormous and huge, and there's plenty of seawater.",

        "When you look at agriculture, we'd probably have to reduce the cost of desalting seawater by a factor of 10 to make it economic to produce grain, for example, so its cost is, as was just mentioned, a big factor here.",
