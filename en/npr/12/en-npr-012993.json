        "Well, we've been doing some research on this.",
        "And certainly in this country, the bottled water industry is an industry that's really played on the fears of people.",
        "And as mayors of many cities have said in the last year or so that tap water is on average, probably cleaner and safer than bottled water.",
        "In fact, a lot of bottled water simply, taken from taps, and put in bottles with fancy labels and sold at a price a thousand times that of tap water.",
        "And it's interesting that people complain about the rising price of gasoline, how much it costs, but the amount we spend on a gallon of bottled water is really rather amazing.",
        "The big thing here, Ira, is not the additional water use but the extraordinary amount of energy use it takes to haul water and trucks around when it could be coming very efficiently through pipes and public water systems.",
        ": Mm-hmm.",
        "And the petroleum products that makes - it takes to make the plastic which gets recycled, I guess, but it's still, usually, a lot of it gets thrown out, I would imagine.",
        "In fact, probably 80 percent do not get recycled, they end up in landfills.",
        "And the amount of oil used each year for manufacturing the bottles and transporting the water, actually, adds up to a very substantial amount, which in this country is all imported, of course, at a very high price from other countries.",
        ": We've been talking about a carbon tax to make people aware of how much carbon there is and to try not to use as much carbon for the CO2 emission.",
        "Should we be talking about - you talked about how low price water is relatively to what it cost to get it out of the ground or move it around?",
        "Should we have a higher water tax or some, sort of, way of rewarding people?",
        "Let's look at it the other way, rewarding people who save water.",
        "Well, a carbon tax would raise the price of water because of bottled water because it is so energy intensive.",
        "Some communities, I think, the city of Chicago may be one, is actually imposing a water tax, as I recall, on bottled water, not on tap water, to discourage it.",
        "But a carbon tax would help raise the price of bottled water to the point were consumption would begin to drop substantially.",
        ": Well, I'm not talking just about bottled water, but water of - all kind of uses for it, you get repaid if you conserve water, somehow, in whatever you do.",
        "Well, you can do if you think about what you're mentioning, Ira, is the tax.",
        "One of the things that is the - a negative of impact of not paying a high enough price for water is that our water infrastructure is degrading.",
        "And our water infrastructure, and not just United States, but all over the world, is actually very leaky.",
        ": Mm-hmm.",
        "And some systems lose as much as 40 percent of the water going through but by the time they leave the plant to clean the water to get to the home, 40 percent of the water might be lost.",
        "So by the fact that we're paying these, you know, low prices for water, there isn't money for operation, maintenance of systems.",
        "The U.S.",
        "is way behind not just for water systems but also for sanitation systems.",
        "And it's true all over the world, with that these low prices are affecting the infrastructures we've already put in place and we can't maintain it so we're experiencing huge loses of what is already in the system, and that's already been cleaned up."

        ": Some of these pipes I know here in New York, we hear stories that some of these pipes, being 150 years old.",
        "Yeah, every American doesn't realize it yet.",
        "Every American owes, currently, $550 on just to keep up with the crumbling infrastructure that we currently have.",
        "And this number is not even including the impact that the population growth is going to have.",
        "I think the - with respect to the carbon footprint, I think we need to start talking about a water footprint that each person has, and what impact it's going to have.",
        "The population growth in the United States alone, if we - every American uses 50 percent less water in their homes, we use 30 percent less energy per capita than we're currently using.",
        "If we use 20 percent less water for agriculture for every person in the United States.",
        "With the current population growth by 2030, we need to grow our entire water supply by 30 percent.",
        "If we don't do this, we have to grow it by 60 percent, and we just simply don't have that.",
        "And we're not even talking about the cost.",
