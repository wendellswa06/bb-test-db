        "Trump and then now being pretty open - openly against a lot of his agenda items, there is definitely a mood in our state and in the nation to find people that will align with the president's agenda so we can really push forward to do what we can to make America great.",
        "And that's - it sounds cliche.",
        "But at the same time, it is truly what the agenda and the vision that our president has.",

        "And he was very motivated to take out Senator Flake at that particular time to the point where he stated clearly - I don't know who actually reported this to Politico.",
        "But the $10 million comment that he would put 10 million of his own money into a PAC to take out Senator Flake - I can tell you verifiably that that's true.",

        "The president's been very clear he's doing this with the real intent of helping the country.",

        "That's when the frustration comes up because, like, comments like - probably, the most famous comment from Senator Flake was when he was asked if he's going to the Republican National Convention, he said, no, he had to mow his lawn.",
        "Those are the kind of comments that aren't productive, OK?",
        "That's where you start to create disjointedness and you start to destroy relationships.",

        "If they get reelected, especially in the Senate - they have six-year terms - what type of obstacles will they create if they don't - if they're not tethered by any fear of retribution or strategic re-alliance or what have you to put pressure on them in their office?",

        "So now about a quarter of Democrats are down the line liberal in their thinking across social issues, economic issues, government foreign-policy and a similar share among the Republican Party.",
