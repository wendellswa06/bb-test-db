        "I think it depends because that is a very common comment that - that some of the comments that I received in response to my work is that this was a blog and you shouldn't take it seriously.",
        "But there is some real journalism going on in the blogging world.",
        "And if you put yourself out there as a writer, you put yourself out there and you make claims of truth and you are convincing, then you, I think, have a responsibility to your audience, to let them know upfront whether or not this is fiction or whether or not - or this is nonfiction.",
        "And you might notice I'm staying away from the word truth here because truth is something that's a little bit more - it's a little more shaky.",
        "You find truth in fiction.",
        "We find truth in poetry.",
        "But when you're claiming to write something that is nonfiction, you're making a claim about fact.",
        "And your readers have a right then to - if you're claiming that you're a nonfiction writer, your readers have I think a right to accept that what you are saying is fact, and they have a right to feel betrayed if it turns out that you're not.",
        "We were trying to draw analogies between people who might - their muscles might ripple in their avatar in second life or they may take on a separate identity in chat rooms and play around with that.",
        "Is the better analogy, though, somebody like James Frey, who made up a memoir in \"\"A Million Little Pieces?",
        "He's a good - I would say he's a good analog, except with James Frey's example, he only had himself at stake.",
        "So he was making up stories about himself.",
        "When it turned out that those stories were exaggerated, he ends up paying the price for it.",
        "In this case, I think a better example, actually, is the story of Margaret Jones Seltzer, who was the - the memoirs who had claimed to be half Native American, who had been - who had grown up in a black household in South Central, Los Angeles, been raised with gangbangers, and then it turned out that she was a middle-class white writer and made all of this stuff up.",
        "It's interesting.",
        "The instance that prompted a lot of investigation of Amina Arraf, \"\"Gay Girl in Damascus,\"\" was her now fictional arrest, that people really got worried about her.",
        "In fact, the writer was saying this was a way - he'd gotten as far as he could.",
        "He couldn't figure a way out so he had to get rid of her some way, the equivalent of saying, and then she got run over by a bus.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And that often happens if you're writing a novel or you're writing a series of short stories or something like that.",
        "Then that's a way to sort of get your character off the stage to end the story.",
        "It becomes a problem, though, if you're creating this character online and people think that they're real.",
        "I have to say he did a good job of making her real because there were people who were actually concerned and were willing to put their necks out, but that then becomes the moral and ethical problem, is you have real people who were facing potential danger.",
        "And also, I would say another part of this is that I believe that the Syrian government is now using this as an example to sort of push back against reforms and to argue that this is a sort of false flag operation by the United States to make Syrians look bad.",
        "We're talking with Brian Spears, poetry editor and Saturday editor of therumpus.net.",
        "And he's joining us from his home in Fort Lauderdale.",

        "Giles is calling us from Denver.",
        "Hi.",
        "I do some writing for a local newspaper and a lot of my writing focuses on creating space for individuals living on the margins to have the ability to communicate their experiences.",
        "And I want to know what you think the difference is between creating space through journalism and fictional accounts through blogging, because I feel both could shed light on a situation.",
        "But what's the greatest difference?",
        "Well, again, for me, I would say the biggest difference is, if you're in a position of privilege like, for instance, I am as a white male and as the editor, poetry editor of a magazine, an online magazine, instead of taking on someone else's persona, you make room for them.",
        "You go out and find people who actually are of these marginalized communities, and you give them space to tell their stories, and you promote them and - in the process.",
        "If you're doing it yourself, at the very least I would say, if you're going to write this fictional things, then make sure that it's clear from the beginning that this is fiction that you're writing and you're exploring these areas.",
        "And that's great."

        "I would just say the real problem comes in when if you're a member of the majority, you take that voice over and make the truth claims or make the factual claims that it is your — that your voice is actually theirs.",
        "To claim to speak for these people as opposed to letting them speak.",
        "Exactly.",
        "How does it change the information that's communicated though?",
        "How do you feel that it would - the context changes the information that's shared with the readers?",

        "Yeah, in terms of if it's a fictional account versus opening up venues for individuals in minority circumstances to share their stories.",
        "You know, I would say this is perhaps one of those key differences between journalism and non-fiction or journalism and fiction is that if you're looking for information, then where we traditionally turn to is journalism and first-person accounts and people telling their own stories and then, to a larger sense, to analysis.",
        "And I don't - I think the two worlds can certainly co-exist.",
        "But I think it's important that if you are a person of the majority - and this is why I addressed it - my comments to white males in general, if you're a member of the majority, you already have an incredible amount of privilege and access to an audience.",
        "There's no need to go in and take the audience that - other groups that doesn't have that access.",

        "It is the first major, major setback for the Bush administration.",
        "The reason it's so complicated is that the court has, in effect, said time after time, once in 2006, again in 2004, you can't strip detainees of their right to go before a neutral judge and challenge their detentions.",
