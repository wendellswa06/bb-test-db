        "This is more like 25 to 30 percent.",
        "So there's clearly something about this bacteria that is particularly virulent in this context.",
        "Now, the German government has come in for a lot of criticism for how they've been handling this outbreak.",
        "People have said it's too slow, that it's being handled on a state-by-state basis, rather than by the federal government.",

        "Well, for one reason or another, it's evident that they're struggling.",

        "But - and it's fine to put out word - don't need such and such a food product - that's often what it's about.",

        "However, short of that, I did - I was able to find some interesting studies.",

        "And both of them really did agree that while there's non-irrefutable evidence, there are plausible arguments that say that, yes, steroids do lead to increase in muscle mass, and an increase in muscles mass leads to increase in strength, which leads to an increase in bat speed, which leads to an increase in the speed of the ball heading into the outfield, which leads to a farther trajectory, trajectory which leads to homerun.",
        "So you know, there are these studies, people can read them.",
        "But as I said, you know, as far as the irrefutable science goes, it's still not there.",
        "It's hard to create that.",
        "I mean, how many scientists could send down an email and say, I need all steroid-using baseball players to report so I can do a study on them.",
        "Not many guys want to admit they did steroids and how many would want to be part of the study?",
        "So we're still, you know, a ways away from this irrefutable proof.",
        "Well, even if his steroid use did not help his performance which -whatever.",
        "Maybe there's no scientific proof, but it certainly would defy logic to think that being stronger doesn't make you a better hitter.",
