        "But with that said, there is a quiet acknowledgement that there is a serious, serious problem, and perhaps even within the military and intelligence services, there is concern about their own ranks, not just because of the bin Laden episode, but because of another episode in recent days in which a naval base was attacked and people are raising questions about whether there was some kind of inside help there.",
