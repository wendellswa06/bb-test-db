        "The best point, I think, was that we look at the events in Iraq through American eyes.",
        "And the soldiers are right that we really need to judge them through Iraqi eyes, because this kind of war depends on the support of the Iraqi people, their acquiescence to the Iraqi government, and whether we succeed or not, whether we patrol or not, whether we get killed or not, is almost irrelevant to success at the end of the day.",
        "And they write that the Americans have failed in one particular arena and failed pretty miserably, and that is developing the economic infrastructure, sort of the non-military side of winning over the hearts and minds."
