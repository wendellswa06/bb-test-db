        "Hi, Madeleine.",

        "The author of \"\"Bright Lights, Big City\"\" is not Bret Easton Ellis, of course.",
        "Jay McInerney wrote the book.",
        "It's a story about an aspiring writer who gets caught up in parties and drugs in 1980s New York.",
        "A collection of McInerney's short stories is now in paperback.",
        "It's called \"\"How It Ended.\"\" McInerney exploded onto the literary scene in the mid-1980s, just before Bret Easton Ellis made it big with \"\"Less Than Zero,\"\" and McInerney says it's what created a bond between them.",
        "In many ways, we have a common enterprise in that we're both, in some sense, I guess, iconoclastic novelists.",
        "We also, you know, we went through kind of a maelstrom together that gives us a common bond.",
        "I mean, there aren't many writers who were thrown into the spotlight the way that we were, that we're sort of processed so vigorously by the great American dream machine.",
        "And, you know, that gives us a kind of common bond of experience.",
        "But it didn't occur to me that we would be so closely identified and so closely yoked together.",
        "If I have to be part of a tag team, I'd just as soon have Bret on the other side.",
        "So there's this 1985 buzz in the air.",
        "I mean, first, obviously with Bret Easton Ellis' new book, and now with news that \"\"Bright Lights, Big City\"\" is being remade by Josh Schwartz, who is a co-creator of the TV show \"\"Gossip Girl.\"\" Do you think it sort of fits in today's world?",
        "Well, at first, my feeling was that it was a book marked by the time, by the '80s, and that it was silly to try to update it.",
        "Then my second thought was that young people still come to New York to make their fortunes.",
        "People are still going out until all hours to nightclubs.",
        "Dare I say, there's a substance called cocaine, which is still widely used by people who go out to nightclubs and stay out all night.",
        "People still have their hearts broken, and they still lose their mothers.",
        "And ultimately, I think \"\"Bright Lights, Big City\"\" is a book that has some pretty universal concerns at its core.",
        "And in fact, I think the new version makes a lot of sense.",
        "We already did the '80s version, you know?",
        "Mmm.",
        "I remember how weird it was because it came out at the same time as \"\"The Secret of My Success,\"\" around the same time.",
        "And Michael J.",
        "Fox was in both of those movies, and it was very weird."

        "And so I stayed up all night, re-reading everything that I had ever written.",
        "And I realized it was all derivative crap, basically, except for one paragraph that I unearthed, that I'd written several months before, after spending the night out in a nightclub.",

        "I found this voice strangely compelling.",
        "I thought, you know, this is the only thing I've ever written that sounds sort of authentic, that sounds different, that sounds like it might be something like my own voice.",
        "And so I sat up all night and wrote this story about a guy in a nightclub who was banging around, sort of lost and forlorn and heartbroken.",
        "And pretty much within 24 hours, I sent it to the Paris Review, and they accepted it shortly thereafter.",
        "And that became my first published story.",
        "And - but after a few months, I realized I wasn't quite done with the voice and that the story really hadn't ended.",
        "I had just paused.",
        "And at that point I sat down and in very short order, wrote what became \"\"Bright Lights, Big City."
