        "Indeed, I hadn't even heard of the author, Dan Clark, who went by the name Nitro on the TV game show \"\"American Gladiators.\"\" Clark's story is as compelling as it is pathetic and uplifting, a tale of someone so desperate to make it big he literally makes himself big.",

        "But the sad irony of steroids is that two of the side effects are the shrinking of some crucial male anatomy and the development of what Clark calls chesticles, both of which he writes about in graphic, wince-inducing detail.",
        "So I chose to experience his misguided life vicariously without adding his mistakes to my own.",
        "But why was I so ashamed to read Clark's book that I wouldn't even buy it, then avoided the librarian by using the self-serve?",

        "A book is an accessory, and there's something inherently unattractive about our appetite for celebrity dish.",
        "And I worry there's something unhealthy in our wanting to know how people with more ambition than talent find success, then taking pleasure in their failures.",
        "Then again, what would a guilty pleasure be without an overdose of guilt?",
        "Marc Acito admits to taking chocolate protein powder before he lifts weights in Portland, Oregon.",

        "Investors saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average drop Friday by 367 points.",
        "That came on the anniversary of the Black Monday crash in 1987.",
        "Friday's loss was nothing like what investors saw 20 years ago when blue chips fell by 23 percent in one day.",

        "And so far, he seems to enjoy the limelight."
