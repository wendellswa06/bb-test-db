        "One is, how do you check up completely rigorously in a country like Iraq or like - I don't know - some country in Africa or in Asia, where it's very difficult to do such rigorous checks, and where, of course, it's easy to get some kind of a fake identification?",
        "And the second problem is, how can you screen what someone believes?",
        "Some people may, of course, have wonderful recommendations and references and be fully qualified.",

        "I think when you rise up through the ranks of the NHS to become a consultant in the upper echelons, it's very well paid.",
        "And of course people supplement it with private medicine and consulting on the side, which they're allowed to do.",
        "But I think certainly there may be a feeling that some of the less desirable medical jobs, the less desirable shifts in less desirable parts of Britain, a lot of those jobs perhaps that the immigrants come and fill first of all, as it is in any area of society.",
