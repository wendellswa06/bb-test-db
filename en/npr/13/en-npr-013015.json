        "David Gergen will join us to talk more about the politics of populism in a bit, but there's also a bellwether battle for a congressional seat in Upstate New York, former Vice President Dick Cheney's charge that we're not as safe as we were, RNC Chairman Michael Steele puts his other foot in his mouth, two unprecedented moves for a sitting president, onto the set with Jay Leno tomorrow night, and a call for volunteers to go door to door this weekend on behalf of the budget.",

        "But isn't he somebody's son?",
        "Andrew Cuomo's actual father was Mario Cuomo, and the question is, who were the last three governors from the East Coast - and what I mean by the East, I mean the New England states and the mid-Atlantic region.",
        "Roughly the Northeast.",
        "This is the most convoluted trivia question in history, but it's worth it because you get a T-shirt.",
        "Who were the last three governors whose sons also ran for governor?",

        "Well yes, it'll be post-World War II.",

        "I mean, the fact is that Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, apparently knew about these bonuses before the rest of the country did, and of course there's a big - it was a big outrage, and I think we've seen some of that, a lot of that, since the election and since the bailouts.",
        "We saw that with Bernie Madoff.",
        "We saw that with the amount of - with the earmarks.",
        "We saw that with Tom Daschle, that the White House was slow to realize that there was a boiling resentment out there that somebody who, for whatever reason, did not fail to pay his taxes, failed to pay his taxes on time.",
        "And made $5 million after leaving Congress.",
        "Right, while the rest of us, except for you and me, are paying our taxes.",

        "Most of Washington, most of official Washington, pooh-poohed it, said it wasn't a big deal, but out there, out in the country, the real country, unlike Washington, there was resentment, and there is resentment now.",
        "Well, we're going to talk more about that with David Gergen in just a moment, but as you say, the White House is trying to get in front of this issue or back in front of this issue, get a hold of agenda again, and it's not going to be easy.",
        "No, it's not, and of course there are a lot of people calling for Tim Geithner's scalp, and Barack Obama, who left today for a trip to California, it was interesting: As he left, he said I'm going to meet the voters, as if there's an election going on, and I guess there are elections going on every day, but before he left, he said that he still has complete confidence in Tim Geithner, that - he didn't mention again that this is a problem we inherited, which he has said about the economy in the past, but a point is, Tim Geithner did not do these contracts, did not write up these contracts.",

        "This is all on behalf of his budget.",
        "We're already hearing the same worn arguments we've heard for years, and we'll surely hear more in the coming days.",

        "But having said that, if you go to the well once too often, it could backfire because there are going to be more bailouts, there is going to be more expenses like in health care and energy costs and things like that, and if there's such a backlash in the country about all this cost and all these bailouts and all this deficit, Republicans may say, look, I'm not getting on board this because it'll clubber me in 2010.",
