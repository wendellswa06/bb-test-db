        "You can find him online at npr.org/junkie, and for the rest of this segment, we're going to focus on the populist backlash against AIG and the dilemma that poses for President Obama.",
        "The president spoke with reporters outside the White House earlier this afternoon.",
        "He said his administration is working with Congress on new ways to oversee companies like AIG.",
        "He also said the AIG bonuses are just part of a bigger problem.",
        "People are rightly outraged about these particular bonuses, but just as outrageous is the culture that these bonuses are a symptom, that have existed for far too long, a situation where excess greed, excess compensation, excess risk-taking have all made us vulnerable and left us holding the bag.",
        "The buck, the president said, stops with me, mixing his metaphors a little bit.",
        "It's an understatement to say that people are outraged, though.",
        "How are the politics of this anger playing out where you live?",
        "Who's playing offense, who's playing defense?",

        "Well, we've seen a lot of sharp disputes in Washington, but I don't think we've ever been engulfed in a crisis as big as the one that we find ourselves in today, and that you have to feel some - whether you agree or disagree with the president, you have to feel some sympathy as he grapples with all this.",
        "The problem this poses for the White House especially - he's still in his first 100 days.",
        "He's still trying to set his agenda, and is being overwhelmed by the story over which he might have had better control, but the fact is, he doesn't have any control of it now.",
        "He does not have much control, and he has a near-term dilemma and a longer term dilemma.",
        "The near term, he has to figure out how to get ahead of this AIG problem.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah, and I echo your first caller there.",
        "It's all our fault for electing these officials that don't take care of business.",
        "I mean, Chuck Grassley is on the Finance and Banking Committee, you know?",
        "Who should've known about this stuff upfront…",
        "So you're suggesting that Senator…",
        "He does not - the options are not very good, but I think that the proposals that the administration has been floating over the last several days, first they said we'll just have to accept it, we have to respect the sanctity of contracts, saying - this being said at the same time when auto workers are having to renegotiate their contracts and accept much less.",
        "It's just not going down well with the country or with the Congress.",
        "And then even today with the latest proposal Secretary Geithner has sort of just added to the bill, or cut the bonuses in half, it's just not going to fly.",
        "It's not sufficient.",
        "So he has to find a way to deal with this, and I think that the longer this goes on, the more it's weakening his hand and the bigger dilemma that's coming.",
        "And that is at some point, as Tom Friedman pointed out in the New York Times today, he does need to go back to Congress and ask for substantially more money for the banks, and indeed he may need more money for AIG.",
        "Given the state of play, that's going to be extremely difficult to get, and there is a growing sense that somehow he inherited the problem, but his administration has not been on top of it.",
        "They've been a little bit asleep at the switch."

        "The public was already, the Congress was already, resistant, but this is only going to strengthen that resistance.",
        "A frequent way to deflect attention is to blame somebody.",
        "The president has twice, in the space of a week, pronounced his complete confidence in his new secretary of the Treasury, Tim Geithner.",
        "Maybe I watch too much sports, but two citations of complete confidence in somebody is usually the kiss of death.",

        "And given his other problems and the lack of a real team over there, he's under growing pressure.",
        "One member of Congress, Connie Mack, who comes from a, you know, major Florida family, Republican, has the first out that I'm aware of who's called for his resignation.",

        "It happened with the war in Iraq.",
        "It happened with respect to the oversight of AIG and all these big banks.",

        "Okay, David.",
        "David Gergen, that kind of outrage is, well, that's pretty mild compared to a lot of things that people are saying.",
        "It is pretty mild, but I think it captures some of the main sentiments, and that is that people, there is a lot of anger about this being after the fact.",
        "There is a lot of anger about the greed, and there's growing, you know, resentment or questioning about Secretary Geithner."
