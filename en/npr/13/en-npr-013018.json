        "Yeah.",
        "And let me - because as you know, I have more than once missed things in the White House that I should've seen were going to be explosive and I didn't quite understand the full nature of it.",

        "You know, this whole thing has been mishandled both at the congressional and the executive level, and it raises all sorts of questions about two things: One, whether the government can capably manage additional bailouts, which the country really doesn't want.",
        "And secondly, it re-raises this question, Neal, as you well know, about whether the president and this White House are trying to do too much, and whether they need to focus with laser-like intensity on the problems of the economy and get these straightened out first, and then get on with the other important reforms, or critical reforms - and healthcare, energy and the environment and the like - but whether for now, they have to put their major, major focus on economic issues.",
