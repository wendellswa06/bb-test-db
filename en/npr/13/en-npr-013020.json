        "So what more can you say about the administration measures here?",
        "Well, I think these measures are going to be seen in China as mean-spirited and very political.",
        "And here's why.",
        "Those tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese exports are aimed at high-tech goods that China does not yet make and does not yet export but wants to.",
        "And the message the Chinese get from that is that you are not allowed to develop high tech because we suspect you of stealing our technology from the U.S.",
        "And another thing was not in the raft of measures that the White House announced but was reported by several media - and that is that the U.S.",
        "is going to make it harder for Chinese students who are studying in sensitive tech fields in the U.S.",
        "And, as you may know, China is pretty used to sending its talented students to the U.S.",
        "to study tech and science at these...",
        "Well, this is really interesting, Anthony...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...Because here in the United States, people are becoming more aware of this Made in China 2025 platform, as I believe it's called.",
        "This is the Chinese listing a bunch of high-tech industries...",
        "Right.",
        "...And saying they want to dominate them within a few years.",
        "So it sounds like this Trump administration remove is a fairly direct response to that, saying we're not going to let you get away with it.",
        "That's right.",
        "But to say that, you know, Chinese students coming to the U.S.",
        "to study tech and science are going to face limits, to Chinese, makes them feel like they're being - you know, suspicion is being cast on them that they're spies, they're going to engage in industrial espionage.",
        "And it's really seen as very political and mean-spirited, I think.",
        "Anthony, what about the timing of this?",
        "The administration is making this move at the very moment, just days before this projected summit between the leaders of the United States and North Korea diplomatic dance in which China, as North Korea's friend, is a major player."

        "That's correct.",

        "But Roseanne Barr has been tweeting racially charged, racist or just conspiratorial things for quite some time.",
        "How can ABC act like they're shocked that she would say something like this?",
        "Yeah, I was at a press conference featuring the cast and producers in January, and people asked about this.",

        "Do you have any insight into ABC's decision to work with Roseanne at all, knowing - I mean, they must have had some sense that there was a potential downside like this.",

        "It was often an advocate for inclusion.",
        "It often talked about racism and talked about opposing homophobia.",
        "And so it was sort of hard to square what was happening on that show, which Roseanne controlled, with the way that she seems to be acting on social media now.",
