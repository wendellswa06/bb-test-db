        "Yeah, we sure do.",

        "Alison, you're describing this new Republican plan as radical.",
        "Yeah, David.",
        "It is - makes the most drastic changes of any of the proposals so far.",
        "It really dismantles major parts of the Affordable Care Act.",
        "The subsidies that help people buy insurance go away.",
        "The Medicaid expansion goes away.",
        "The individual mandate goes away.",
        "And it takes all the money from all these programs, rolls it all up, and it turns it over to the states to use to set up their own systems.",
        "And they can use it to do a lot of things, but there's nothing specifically required in the bill that they have to use it for.",
        "Well, I mean, at least some governors who want flexibility must like this.",
        "But it sounds like there are a good number of governors who are not reacting so well to this plan.",
        "Yeah, it's been a real mixed reaction.",
        "There've been a lot of governors who'd said they'd like more flexibility.",
        "But earlier this week, there was a letter from ten governors, both Republicans and Democrats, to leader - Republican leader Mitch McConnell, and they are really opposed to it and are asking him to allow a separate, bipartisan effort to go forward.",
        "But, you know, then there are governors who've been really supportive, including Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, who is in John McCain's district, and he's considered a swing vote on this issue.",
        "Couple issues that have come up in past debates over different proposals have been what happens to people with pre-existing conditions and also what happens to Medicaid.",
        "How does this bill handle those issues?",
        "Well, first, on Medicaid, which covers, like, 70 million people, this would roll back the expansion, which itself extended coverage to about 10 million people.",
        "And then it just changes the basic program.",
        "Right now, Medicaid pays for whatever health care the people in the program need.",
        "There's really no limit, which Republicans see as a big problem.",
        "This bill caps that spending, and some estimates say that over time, it'll reduce the spending on the program by about 25 percent.",
        "As far as pre-existing conditions go, it allows states to get out of a lot of the rules imposed by Obamacare.",
        "So under this bill, if you're in a state that gets a waiver, your insurance policy may not cover some of the basic things that we expect now - mental health care, prescription drugs or hospitalizations.",
        "OK, talking about the new health care proposal from Republicans - and it is looking like it could be a very close vote count in the Senate at this point."

        "You know, it is new.",
        "We haven't heard that before.",
        "Right now, the Afghan government controls roughly 60 percent of the country.",
        "And that means about one-third of Afghans, or 11 million people, are living under Taliban control or in areas contested with the Taliban, and this is mostly in the south around Kandahar and Helmand.",
        "And, you know, people I talk with say it's going to be very difficult to reach that 80 percent goal in four years.",
        "One person I spoke with said it's overly optimistic.",
        "Another said he'll be struggling to reach that goal.",

        "There's a lot of - there's a lack of leadership in the military.",
        "And there's a very high illiteracy rate in the country as well, which makes it difficult to create pilots, let's say, or high-end commandos and so forth.",
        "So we'll see what happens.",
        "But again, people, you know, are scratching their heads about that 80 percent."
