        "For many Palestinians, this was the first time they'd ever set foot outside the 140-square-mile Gaza Strip, which many residents had described as a giant prison.",
        "But this frontier free-for-all is likely to alarm Israeli officials, who were concerned about the possible cross-border smuggling of weapons to Palestinian militants.",
        "Egypt has said it will shut down the border, possibly starting today.",
        "A Palestinian commander also said troops would soon be deployed along the frontier, but so far, the Palestinian Authority has been unable to prevent the looting of factories and valuable greenhouses on its own territory.",
        "It may be even more difficult to stem the tide of Palestinians who have free access to the outside world for the very first time.",

        "Certainly it's no secret the group has been openly hostile to Mr. Bush's policies.",
        "Perhaps he even recalls the group loudly booing and jeering his father, then Vice President Bush, at the convention back in 1983.",
        "That doesn't mean the current President Bush doesn't speak to African-American organizations, but he tries to find a more welcoming setting such as yesterday when he attended the luncheon meeting of a lesser known group called the Indiana Black Expo made up of African-American entrepreneurs.",

        "All we're asking is for a fair hearing, the chance to make our case, the benefit of the doubt that we're sincere in wanting to restore our historic bonds.",
        "Politically speaking, Mehlman knows that if a Republican can do just a few percentage points better among black voters, then some key swing states could tip toward the GOP.",
        "For instance, in Ohio last year, the president's improved showing among black voters may have been just enough to keep him from losing the state and with it the Electoral College.",

        "At times, his pitch of current White House policies was greeted with disapproving murmurs, even scattered boos, but there was applause when he seemed to apologize for the so-called Southern strategy that Republicans adopted in the mid-1960s to win votes of whites alienated by desegregation.",
