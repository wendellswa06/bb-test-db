        "Today, many companies are tracking blogs to see what people are saying about them.",
        "Indeed, the company that does the Nielsen TV ratings recently bought two firms that analyze buzz and blogs.",

        "If you think about what happened to John Kerry with Swiftvotes and what happened to Trent Lott with his remarks at Strom Thurmond's birthday party, both of those issues were kept alive and stoked by conversations that were happening in the blogosphere.",
        "Companies that embark on word-of-mouth campaigns face challenges that TV advertisers never did.",
        "The television couldn't talk back; consumers can, and do.",
        "Last month, for example, Chevy introduced a website that allowed visitors to create an ad for the Tahoe SUV.",
        "Chevy was hoping that visitors would e-mail their video ads to friends and generate enthusiasm for the brand.",
        "But it didn't work out that way.",
        "The most e-mailed videos were those attacking the SUV's poor mileage.",
        "Again, Peter Kim of Forrester.",
        "Marketers have to understand that they can generate the initial thinking and conversation about a topic or a new product or service, but where it goes beyond there is totally out of their control.",
        "And from the perspective of Andy Sernovitz, that's the exciting part.",
        "You can't lie to consumers anymore.",
        "Sernovitz heads up a trade group called, you guessed it, The Word-of-Mouth Marketing Association.",
        "No amount of advertising, no amount of just sheer tonnage of brand marketing and paid ads or anything else you do can hide a bad product anymore.",
        "But beyond all the examples lies this fundamental question: Does positive word-of-mouth marketing translate into sales?",
        "The truth is, we don't really know; it's hard to measure.",
        "Still, there is anecdotal evidence and a gut feeling among many marketers and academics that word-of-mouth is effective, and is here to stay."
