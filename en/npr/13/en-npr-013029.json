        "Yeah, it's different for different kinds of things.",

        "Some things do and some things don't spread.",
        "And not everything that spreads spreads by the same mechanism.",
        "And different things spread differently.",
        "And so devil is often in the details.",

        "And these kinds of phenomenon, these social phenomenon that might spread, let's say, via social contagion, require a network path so they can reach from person to person and person to person to person and person to person to person.",
        "And I should stress, if I might, that many of the things that we talk about might seem very intuitive, that, you know, for example, what you're - the people you're in direct contact with might affect your behaviors is really not too surprising.",
        "But what I think is surprising about some of the work that we've done is that we're able to show that larger groupings of people, people who don't even know each other, as you alluded to at the opening, might simultaneously show similar behaviors.",
        "Like a - like a herd of buffalo stampeding in one direction or other, for example, groups of humans might begin to show similar behaviors without coordinating those behaviors with each other deliberately.",
        "So it's like how do all these school of fish know how to turn at the same time?",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "That's exactly right.",

        "It's social proximity.",

        "Right.",
        "…which I think really characterizes the state of the world that we've been living in for about the last 10 years or so.",
        "And we make a number of arguments in that chapter, but the basic idea is that everything is different but the same, and I know this sounds a little pithy, but the idea is that -that just for example, we weren't built to have one hundred close friends, and so when someone tells you that they have a hundred friends on Facebook or a thousand friends…",

        "Should you be looking for those folks, James, you know, to try to conquer this obesity epidemic?",
        "Well, absolutely.",

        "It was, like, the most exciting and the most depressing moment of my scientific career, seeing that video for the first time.",
        "But to pick up the other point, though, is that leaving aside for a moment this issue that, okay, obesity is spreading, it's multi-centric, some other investigators have come along and done some computer modeling of the epidemic and evaluated different kinds of strategies that are informed by a deep understanding of network structure about how we might arrest or turn around this or any other health-related epidemic, in like cutting behavior in teens or smoking behavior or whatever you're interested in, and there are various strategies you can use.",
        "Some of them are quite subtle.",
