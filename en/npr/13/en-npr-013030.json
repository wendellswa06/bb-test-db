        "That happiness can spread in different ways than we think it can spread.",
        "Well, absolutely.",
        "I mean, a couple of the main things that we found out in the happiness study is that happiness spreads three degrees of separation, like many of these other things that we've been studying and other researchers have been studying, but also that happiness is an example of why you want to be in the center of the network, because the people in the center tend to be happier then people on the edges.",
        "And along with other evidence that we found in a paper, we think that the reason why this is is because there are competing waves of emotions that run through the network.",
        "There are happy waves and there are unhappy waves, and what we find is that the happy waves actually spread more reliably than the unhappy waves.",
        "When you say they spread…",
        "Yes.",
        "Give us a concrete idea by spreading.",
        "We know disease has a germ, it has a vector, it spreads that way.",
        "How does happiness spread through a third party, not even a second party?",
        "Right, so just for example, you get married, right?",
        "And for most people, that's a happy event, and then you have friends, friends who share in your happiness, right?",
        "And so maybe as a consequence of you getting married, you get to spend more time with your friends, maybe you get to spend time with your friend's spouse, who you really like, and then that also changes your feelings.",
        "And then once you become happier, then the effect might spread even, you know, one more degree of separation."

        "And happiness can spread through a couple of ways.",
        "One is, like, we can share resources with other people, and we talk about this in the book, but another way that it can spread is that there's actually imitation between humans, this emotional contagion we talk quite a bit about in the book.",
        "Just for example, we document a laughter epidemic that happened in Africa in the 1960s.",
        "It's a great story and it still puzzles scientists to this day.",
        "There was a group of girls in a school that started laughing uncontrollably, and it spread to several other villages, and we really don't know what the source was, but we were able to - the scientists were able to document just how far the laughter epidemic spread.",
        "Now are these in production yet?",
        "Nice job, Rob.",
        "So I mean, most people are familiar with the idea of a transient or brief spread of an emotional state from one person to another.",
        "For example, James and I were giving a talk, and we said you know how when you're on the sub - in New York City, and we said, you know how when you're on the subway and one person smiles at you and then you just instinctively smile back?",
        "And people looked at us and said, no, we don't do that in New York.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Everywhere else that's a normal behavior.",
        "It's instinctive.",
        "In fact, Jane Goodall has done work with a play face in chimpanzees.",
        "One chimp will show a play face, then the other will, and there have been experiments as well, economist at Dartmouth Bruce Sakerdote(ph) - actually, no, this was work done by someone else, I think, on depression transmission in roommates.",
        "And a variety of studies have looked at the transient spread of emotions, Elaine Hatfield(ph) and others, the transient spread of emotions from one person to another.",
        "But what James and I were interested in was not just the dyadic or person-to-person spread of emotions but what we call the hyper-dyadic or person-to-person-to-person or person-to-person-to-person spread of emotions, and we were interested in how this might be over a longer period of time, and the mechanism of this spread is multifarious.",
        "There are many.",
        "They are biological, psychological and social, but the key idea from our perspective is that it becomes possible to think about human emotions as having a collective existence and not just an individual existence.",
        "So most people think about how they feel as being something very personal in their bodies, and what we're arguing in essence is that you can begin to think about emotions the way you might think about a buffalo stampede."

        "So if you could fly over a stampeding herd of buffalo and talk to one of the buffalos and say why are you running to the left, the buffalo would say, well, I'm not running to the left, the whole herd is running to the left, and in a way that is sort of what's happening with human emotions.",
        "The whole herd of people in one region of the network comes to evince a particular emotional state at a particular time, and in essence this is the core argument that we're making, that many phenomena, including, surprisingly, emotions, can have a kind of collective existence.",
        "Can they be then mathematically modeled and be predictable?",
        "Yes, I mean, absolutely.",

        "But turn that on its head.",
        "When you tell someone that they have an influence on people who are three degrees removed from them, you're telling them that they have an effect on, you know, 10 friends, their 100 friends of friends, their 1,000 friends of friends of friends, suddenly you're telling them that they're responsible not just for themselves but a whole host of people, some of whom they don't even know, and I think that a lot of people, the way they react to that sense of responsibility, is I'm going to actually try to work harder to exert my own will over my own life.",

        "Wilson's work, and we do make the argument that in some sense it's possible to understand human society as a kind of super-organism and that in many ways these networks are living, breathing entities, which have a memory, which are able to have things flow through them, which survive and transmute, and these networks actually can be seen in some sense as a super-organism.",
        "But just as James said, on the one hand while that would seemingly subvert the notion of free will, that we are just responding to the things that are happening around us, it also increases the importance of free will, makes it even more important that we think about how our actions are affecting others.",
