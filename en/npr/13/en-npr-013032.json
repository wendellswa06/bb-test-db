        "But, like, in many of these cases, he came back to the neighborhood but at the same time, he knew of the threat.",
        "In fact, he slept - there was one indication that he slept with his tennis shoes on in case they came to get him.",
        "And they did come to get him.",
        "The 18-year-old man was beaten, kidnapped and murdered, shot 25 times and dumped in a ravine.",

        "It's filled with stock characters, wooden dialogue and it's too slick by half.",
        "But sticking its protagonist in this looping time warp, a mystery in itself for Hopper to solve, is a terrific concede.",
        "Watching Hopper negotiate familiar terrain over and over in different ways feels more like you're watching an Xbox than ABC, which probably makes me the first critic to compare a production to a video game and intend it as a compliment.",
        "On paper, the hybrid heart of Day Break doesn't make much sense, but a funny thing can happy when one formula is mixed with another formula, you come up with a pretty creative concoction."
