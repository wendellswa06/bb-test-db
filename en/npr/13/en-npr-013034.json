        "An appendage of the Andes, Chiloe's archipelago was formed from the debris of the mountains and lava from the ring of volcanoes that cluster here near the bottom of the world.",

        "Oh, this is fantastic.",
        "So, in theory, you could stop a lot of diseases, everything from viruses to cancer, by shutting down a gene that causes that disease.",
        "And so, the way to do that is take these tiny little RNA molecules called small interfering RNAs and to put them in to the cell, and that causes the cell to destroy whatever gene is causing this disease.",
        "And so it has been done with respiratory syncytial virus and cancers in theory.",
        "But in practice, you need a way to protect this very ephemeral molecule, this very delicate molecule, this small interfering RNA.",
        "And so the tobacco mosaic virus is essentially a biodegradable nanometer size tube that you can pack this stuff into.",
        "And so Bill Bentley at the University of Maryland, who's been working with his graduate students to pack small interfering RNA into this tobacco mosaic virus tubes.",
        "And then, to see whether this can help them get into cells and survive the harsh environment of the body so that they can make it to these diseased parts of the body and have their effect",
        "And do they get there?",
        "Well, what they've done so far is in vitro tests.",
        "So they're planning to move on to animals soon.",
        "But what they've tried to - what they've done is packaged this RNA in these tubes and then they put it into cells, like cancers cells or kidney cells.",
        "And they've shown that they can switch off a gene of their choice, sort of at will.",
        "And so, the other nice thing about this is that the other means of delivering these RNA molecules to cells, are relatively harsh.",
        "So there's a possibility that you could use a virus that can infect humans and then, there's the risk of causing some sort of an immune system failure, or other sort of collateral damage.",
        "And with the tobacco virus, it can't infect humans, and in fact, it needs a little bit of extra nudging to get into the cell.",
        "And so it's a much safer way to do this, it's a much safer way to have this medical effect.",
        "So that's what would be its competitive advantage?",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Absolutely and such worked in cells.",
        "They want to test this on animals and then they're going to test this in people.",
        "And at the same time, there are other companies, like this one called the (unintelligible) Nylon, which is in New England.",
        "And they're testing inhaled RNAs.",
        "So you could actually take an inhaler and shoot a bunch of RNA up your nose into your lungs.",
        "And what this would do is it would stop respiratory syncytial virus has been taking over the cells in the lining of your lungs.",
        "And so, it essentially instructs those cells to stop producing the virus.",
        "The cell viruses are like hijackers, they go into a cell, they take it over, they make that cell produce their genes.",
        "And so what the small interfering RNA does is say stop, don't do that, shred that virus on sight.",
        "And so, they've actually tested that in humans and it has worked quite well in healthy males and hopefully they'll be able to use it on infants and old people who are most likely to get that virus.",
        "It sounds like a general all purposed virus.",
        "I mean, it sounds like a great little carrier for stuff."

        "Yeah, they will, well they worked for respiratory syncytial virus very effectively.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And any other ways they might work and the other delivery methods?",
        "And also, so, there's a chance of delivering them to the liver for liver cancer and so you'd knock down one of the genes that so, cancer is out of controlled division itself.",
        "And you'd switch off one of the genes that causes cells to grow very rapidly.",
        "And hopefully that would sort of calm them down and so you could - in theory, you could switch off one of these signals sending disease causing proteins using small interfering RNA.",
        "But that work - probably could make use of this tobacco mosaic virus.",
        "You need something to get - something to get the RNA to the tumor and into the cancer cells.",
        "And that's the potential application of this tobacco mosaic virus.",
        "Mm hmm.",

        "So these small - they're small, they don't take very many people to build them or test them or design them, and it means they're risking less.",
        "A lot of these missions failed because satellite crashes or the launch fails and so there's a lot of them to get a lot more done for a lot less money with a lot less risk.",

        "So, these gentlemen have come up with a electrochromic material.",
        "It's like a chameleon skin, it changes its color.",
        "I'm sure that the way you want it.",
        "And it can only switch between the light and the dark and so when it's dark it will absorb lots of light and it will warm up the spacecraft so if this is a sort of like a jacket, I mean, outside of the space craft and it's on the dark side of the planet it can sort of warm itself up by darkening and absorbing every last little bit of light that it can find.",
        "When it's on the light side of the planet not in the shadow and its direct sunlight it can light in and sort of reflect away most of that light that won't heat up and it can also do this in the infrared range.",
        "And so the idea is that they have a very compact, very elegant, very simple way of replacing the cooling systems in spacecrafts so they can be smaller and lighter, and more nimble.",
        "Just by - I mean, changing the color on them."
