        "Actually, that's how we're envisioning the process to go.",
        "The process really lends itself quite well to a distributed hydrogen generation, hydrogen productions strategy.",
        "So we can have a catalystic reactor at the gas stations where the hydrogen is produced on site, and the only thing that will need to be delivered is the liquid ethanol and we already have the infrastructure in place for...",

        "There are still several fundamental questions that we're trying to address, but we certainly have made very good progress in that direction.",
        "How do you talk to the people who say, you know, we don't like the idea that we're making all this ethanol because it's driving up the price of food and making food scarce?",
        "Again, that's a very good question.",
        "When people think of bioethanol, they think that the only source of ethanol is corn or soy beans, things that we use either for food or for animal feed.",
        "But that's really doesn't have to be the case.",
        "We can get ethanol from other sources for example, cellulosic ethanol can be obtained from cellulose, we can use switch grass, corn stalks, wood chips, used frying oil, even algae can be used for making ethanol.",
        "So we don't really have to rely on food or feed crops...",
