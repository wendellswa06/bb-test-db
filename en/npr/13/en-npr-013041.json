        "The one that - the company that had the most facilities raided, a company called Peco, which is based in Tuscaloosa, Ala., said that it was facing a potential production disruption, but it was unclear what they really meant by that, whether that was a day or a week or something longer than that.",
        "Or, I mean, the other question, do they get fined, I mean, for employing people who aren't legal to work in the country?",
        "Federal prosecutors and ICE said that they were investigating the companies for potential criminal violations.",

        "So her appointment comes after Puerto Rico's Supreme Court ruled that her predecessor, Pedro Pierluisi, was unconstitutionally sworn in as governor last week.",
        "And this political crisis in Puerto Rico, we should remember, comes after weeks of demonstrations that forced Governor Ricardo Rossello to resign.",

        "So why did she change her mind?",
        "Well, you know, Puerto Rico's Constitution says that the person who replaces a resigning governor is the secretary of state.",
        "But that post was vacant last week, and so the next in line is the justice secretary.",
        "That would be Wanda Vazquez.",
        "And like you said, she didn't want the job, so she asked Governor Rossello to appoint a secretary of state so that that person could take over when he stepped down.",
        "Rossello did that.",
        "He appointed a veteran politician Pedro Pierluisi.",
        "And when he stepped down last Friday, Pierluisi took the oath of office.",
        "But yesterday, the Supreme Court said wait a minute, you were never confirmed as secretary of state by the legislature as the Constitution requires, so you can't be governor.",
        "And so he had to step down, and Wanda Vazquez became governor yesterday.",
        "So, I mean, what are Puerto Ricans making of all this?",
        "I mean, it's been a big - it's been quite a couple of weeks here.",
        "We have people who are - heads just spinning at all of the sort of twists and turns that all this has taken.",
        "You know, it all started a few weeks ago with these massive protests that you mentioned against Governor Ricardo Rossello that were at first about these offensive text messages that he sent but eventually sort of evolved into protests against what a lot of Puerto Ricans view as a corrupt political establishment.",
        "And they view Rossello as part of that establishment, his successor, Pedro Pierluisi, as part of that establishment.",
        "And now, you know, Governor Wanda Vazquez, they also view as part of that establishment.",
        "So yesterday, I spoke with a protester who went to the governor's mansion to demand that Wanda Vazquez resign.",

        "And so they look at people like Wanda Vazquez, who has close ties to Rosello, and they aren't happy, and they want something new.",

        "Well, you know, there are questions about whether she might assume the office and then appoint a secretary of state and resign.",

        "Former referee Tim Donaghy was disgraced after he admitted to betting on games, even some that he officiated, and he's about to be sentenced next month.",
        "Now, he filed a letter in federal court claiming that unnamed league officials plotted with other referees to favor teams that got the biggest TV ratings, of course, the L.A.",
        "Lakers during the Shaq and Kobe days.",
        "Now, one of the examples Donaghy cited was the 2002 playoffs between the Lakers and the Kings, Sacramento Kings, a game in which the Lakers shot 27 free throws in the fourth quarter and went on to win in seven games, a game that still leaves a very bitter taste in the mouths of Kings fans.",
        "So reaction to this latest charge by this referee has been - well, let's start with you.",

        "But it's almost become almost as - not that anybody's angry.",
        "They just - it's kind of an accepted thing.",
        "And the worst thing about this scandal, from the NBA's point of view, because the NBA deals with image and the perception.",
        "And you know, the perception is worse than the reality.",
        "And David Stern, who's the commissioner of the NBA, is - normally, just kind of blows this off and that kind of stuff.",
