        "In fact, what they're doing is they're circling around, they're orienting themselves, and then they're heading right back to their home loft, where their owner scoops them up and takes them to another wedding.",
        "And how do they know how to get back there?",
        "Well, you know, it's interesting.",

        "And no one's exactly sure, and the research does change a lot.",
        "But what they'll tell you is this.",
        "It has - the pigeon has several different senses that it uses, including like internal compasses.",
        "First of all, a pigeon uses its sight, and it could follow roads and other landmarks that it's used to.",
        "It can also, but - and it uses the sun and the placement of the sun in the sky to go back.",
        "But interestingly enough, a blindfolded pigeon will find its way home.",
        "A blindfolded pigeon will find its way home.",
        "And that means it must have another internal compass, so what they're also using is able to sense the Earth's magnetic field through an area on the top of their nose where - and they actually can sense where the bands curve and where they are according to the magnetic field.",
        "Interestingly enough, they also have tremendous ultrasound, and they're able to hear wind coming across the Rockies from about 2,000 miles away.",
        "Boy, how did you learn all this stuff?",
        "I mean, you're not a bird expert.",
        "I mean, you must have - the more you learned about this from research, you must be just as fascinated as we are when we reed your book.",

        "They put these up around the cities, often around the outskirts and inside the parks.",
