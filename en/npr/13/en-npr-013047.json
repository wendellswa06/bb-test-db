        "When you're in the car and you're on the highway, as long as you're going at least 18 miles an hour, you hit a little button on one of the stalks coming off the steering wheel.",
        "And from that point on, the car uses cameras in the front to pick up lane lines, and it uses radars to look for other cars.",
        "And its basic mission is to keep you in the middle of your lane and a safe distance from other cars.",
        "So if the semi in front of it slows down to 55 miles an hour, it will also slow down.",
        "Well, based on what we've heard about this crash, it sounds like there's a blind spot in its capabilities.",
        "There certainly seems to have been some sort of glitch.",
        "Now, Tesla is saying that when the tractor trailer turned in front of this Tesla because the trailer was all white that the car didn't see it against a similarly white sky.",
        "That makes sense or that could make sense for the cameras, but it's harder to understand why the radar wouldn't pick up the tractor trailer because the radar doesn't see color.",
        "It sees objects.",
        "Tesla hasn't given a really clear explanation of that, but they are quick to say, hey, this is a beta system.",

        "There's one video of a guy filming his car driving itself from the backseat.",

        "I mean, is it all user error after that?",

        "And I spoke with one legal expert who told me that while, you know, it's good for Tesla that they did have people sign that agreement, that NHTSA, you know, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration which is investigating this accident, could look and say, well, hey, Tesla, like, you knew people were misusing this.",
        "You knew there was a serious risk that this was a feature that your customers were not using safely.",
        "And if Tesla didn't take adequate steps to remedy that, then maybe they're not quite as absolved as they would hope.",
        "Can Tesla argue that its cars have prevented more accidents than they have caused?",
        "They certainly can argue that, and, in fact, they're already arguing it.",
        "That was the central argument of the blog post they put up yesterday in response to the crash.",
        "And I think it's a worthy argument it's just, you know, it's still hard for safety regulators to say, well, you prevented crashes.",
        "But if they don't deem this safe feature something that owners should have access to, then all of that's pulled into question.",
        "And if I have a member of my family who's trusting in an autopilot mode in a Tesla and dies in a car crash, it's small solace that five other people didn't die in car crashes that week."
