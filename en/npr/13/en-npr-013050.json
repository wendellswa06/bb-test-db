        "More than one hundred and sixty people were injured.",
        "The blast annihilated a middle school and an apartment complex and it caused $100 million in damage.",
        "As NPR's Wade Goodwyn revisited West, Texas, to find out what's changed and what hasn't since the disaster.",
        "When the fire trucks blew through West on that evening of April 17th, sirens screaming, naturally everybody was curious.",
        "So people got in their cars and went to see.",
        "For 10 minutes they watched as the fire at the West Fertilizer plant grew ever bigger.",
        "A few moved as close as they could because they were filming on their smartphones.",

        "Like, he - she wants the conversation between him and her to be around the sexism that he automatically already puts out.",
        "But now he has focused it towards her, so it gives her something that she can actually poke at and peel back at and that - honestly, I feel like he fell into her own trap.",
        "So now he has all week, unlike how he has before been a little bit more apologetic.",
        "He's been more apologetic this time than he really has the last time, or he's been explaining himself more than he has beforehand, usually as a matter fact.",
        "So yeah, it was stupid on his part.",
        "But...",
        "Interesting...",
        "...He fell into her playbook."

        "And they've been pounding this over and over and over again.",
        "And like Wesley mentioned, they immediately turned around and launched a fundraising appeal off of this..."

        "They said look, this is just another example of how the mainstream media is out to get us.",
