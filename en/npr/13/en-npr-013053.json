        "We ask Susan Glasser, editor-in-chief of Foreign Policy magazine, about the somewhat shorter list of the world's worst rulers.",
        "We did a list of the worst of the worst in the summer of 2010, and number one on the list, for many years, really, was Kim Jong Il of North Korea.",
        "Four out of the top 20 on our list have fallen this year.",
        "So it's been a pretty extraordinary year of change.",
        "That being said, as of the summer of 2010, I think it is important to point out that there were still 40 tyrants, give or take, ruling countries around the world, an estimated two billion people living under a dictatorship still.",
        "So that number has changed but there's still a lot of bad guys on the list.",
        "But still, if someone had told you at the start of 2011 that we'd be talking about a world without Kim Jong Il or Moammar Gadhafi, would you have imagined that could come about?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think it's been an astonishing year, very quick change.",
        "Not only that but also on the list, let's not forget, was Hosni Mubarak, who ran Egypt in a very heavy-handed way for more than 30 years.",
        "That's a pretty enormous change.",

        "That's why Hillary Clinton just went there.",
        "So these are not changes that anybody predicted at the beginning of 2011.",
        "Certainly the world's focus shifted to Bashir al-Assad in Syria after the fall of Gadhafi.",
        "Do you think that he is going to, that the demonstrations, the Arab Spring, all of that is going to finally reach him?",
        "If you look at the list of the world's authoritarian leaders, you have to say that Assad is pretty near the top of ones facing a serious existential threat to their rule right now, and not only because of the challenges from within Syrian society, but also because the geopolitics of the region have shifted pretty significantly.",
        "Turkey, which for years has been a partner with Syria, has very dramatically changed sides.",
        "And I think that really weakens the regime from outside as well as from within.",
        "Do you think dictatorships are on their way out or do you think there are so many of them left that we can't possibly say that?",
        "You know, there's a very powerful and engaging new book by Harvard Professor Steven Pinker this year where he's documenting what he calls the end of violence in modern society.",
        "And there's a very compelling case to be made that over the last couple of centuries what you've seen is dramatic cultural and therefore political shift away from both individual violence and also state-sanctioned violence and that the tolerance that once existed for using this kind of violent repression and other heavy-handed state measures is just dramatically on its way out in the grand sweep of history.",
        "But you know, when there are still several dozen tyrannical leaders in the world, you have to be sanguine about that.",
        "Susan Glasser, thank you."

        "Yes, it's certainly closer to 60 than 50 percent in Greece and Spain.",
        "And it's over 30 percent in Italy and it's been growing across southern Europe every month.",
        "The major cause is, of course, three years of recession worsened by German-dictated draconian austerity measures, and rigid labor markets that make it hard to get full-time employment.",
        "And behind that is an outdated southern European welfare model that favors older workers, mostly men, with full-time jobs."

        "The picture has actually been very graphically illustrated by the scenes at the international airport in Ireland's capital, Dublin, in the last few days.",
        "Young people have been pouring in from as far afield as Australia and Canada.",
        "These arrivals are just some of the 150,000 young people who've emigrated from Ireland in the last few years - since the crisis began, really - because of the lack of jobs and opportunities at home."
