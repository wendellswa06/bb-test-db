        "The latest figures from a few months ago in Ireland show that an average of 1,600 people are emigrating every week.",
        "A lot of them are young people and that's an awful lot for country of four and a half million.",
        "It is counterbalanced to some degree by immigration.",
        "But basically this is a return to mass emigration that Ireland experienced during some of the bleakest periods in its history.",
        "And there are real concerns about the long-term damage this is doing to Ireland's economy and its society.",
        "Philip, what does this mean for countries with healthier economies?",
        "For example, Germany, I mean, are they affected by this growing number of unemployed Europeans?",
        "Well, Germany's mighty economy is the engine that powers Europe.",
        "Unemployment there is low, around five and half percent, and just eight percent of the German young are jobless.",

        "And the only hope on the horizon is a revived American economy that would once again be a locomotive to the European and global economy.",
        "Philip?",
        "I think it's also important to remember that at a lot of the austerity measures that were announced by various countries - as they tried to sort out their economic disarray, when the crisis first really hit and to stop their borrowing costs from spiraling further - have yet to kick in and they're going to hurt.",
        "Add to that, the unwillingness of the banks to lend is making it very hard for national governments, but for business and for the public to dig a path out of trouble.",
        "And as for young people, you know, the big worry centers around the effect that long-term unemployment, long periods of unemployment which some of them are now experiencing in very large numbers, as we said, the effect that that's having on their future prospects.",
        "Being out of work for ages doesn't look good to a prospective employer.",
