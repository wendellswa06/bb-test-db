        "There was another recent study; this one was conducted by the Asia Society.",
        "They surveyed 2,000 Asian-Pacific Americans who work for Fortune 500 companies.",
        "And the survey found that they feel great loyalty to their employers but not - and I quote from them - \"\"not a sense of belonging in corporate America.\"\" Does that attitude square with anything that you've seen?",
        "Well, we asked what we call identity questions and belonging questions - and remember, Asians have been in this country for more than 150 years.",
        "They have been targets of official discrimination based on race; there's a lot of other-ness that - have been imposed on Asian-Americans by the host culture themselves.",
        "But it is notable that on questions about identity, the strongest sense of identity that Asian-Americans have is with their country of origin.",
        "They don't think of themselves as - primarily as Asians.",
        "They think of themselves as Filipinos or Vietnamese or Japanese - or what have you - and less so as just Americans.",
        "But when you get into the second generation beginning to age into the workforce, they identify themselves more than their parents' generation do, as typical Americans.",
        "But there's still a lingering sense that we are an other, and we are treated that way.",

        "Well, my theory is that Kurt had a lot of residual pain from his childhood.",
        "And when you pile that on top of his experience in World War II - he was in Dresden when it was bombed and saw a city annihilated.",
        "When you combine those two things, my impression of Kurt Vonnegut at 84 was that he was a very pained and haunted man.",
        "And I was, as you say, surprised when I first started talking to him that he began complaining about his parents.",
        "For all the world, I thought I was talking to a much younger person who still had a real beef with the way he had been raised.",
        "But you know, I think that's probably part of Kurt's appeal to young people is that when they open one of his novels, they get the sense that an older person is leveling with them, that someone appreciates the dilemmas that they are feeling.",
        "Slaughterhouse Five,\"\" of course, was his greatest work.",
        "And - well, I guess that's debatable, but it's his most famous work - and he really struggled to write it.",
        "I mean, it took him 20 years.",
        "He started and stopped and started again.",
        "And it seems like the biggest problem he had was this idea that he wasn't - he didn't actually see the bombing of Dresden, that he was just in the basement - he saw the before and the after.",
