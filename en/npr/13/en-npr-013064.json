        "Yeah, it's a tricky business.",
        "Just walking out in places where there's archeology on the ground is tricky because when you find something, when you lean over and pick up an arrowhead or a potsherd, or you see the rim of an ancient bowl sticking out of the ground, you kind of have to decide what are you going to do next and what do other people do next once they find those things.",

        "Just recently, I was up in the Bering Sea, an island just off the coast of Siberia, St. Lawrence Island, where the island is natively owned, and Yupik Eskimos living there are going out and digging up sites and selling artifacts from their sites.",
        "And these artifacts are legal because they come from a privately owned island.",
        "But at the same time, you're saying if someone else was there plucking it, you might look at it a completely different way."

        "It's totally inconsistent with what we have been promised throughout this campaign process.",
        "Now, this is exactly consistent with what Republicans did to Democrats during the last 12 years - barring their amendments, not letting them see bills until they were to be voted on, giving them little input in committees.",
        "So a reporter asked Florida Republican Adam Putnam wasn't all this criticism a little, well, hypocritical?",
