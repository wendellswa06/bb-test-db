        "I sing, I dance and I tell terrible jokes, and I try to do something that's very human scale.",

        "Well, around where I live, especially over in Utah and the Four Corners area, the artifacts are often so close to the surface that people helicopter in.",
        "And there have been cases where the helicopter has lowered its tail rotor toward the ground and actually blown off the surface where they can actually see objects starting to appear.",

        "So how do legal sales affect the black market?",
        "Well, the more artifacts that are sold, the more artifacts are needed, and artifacts then get laundered.",
        "They lose their context until they can join a collection and appear to be legal.",
        "So in many ways, there's no such thing as a black market because eventually, these artifacts do rise up, and even ones that are illicitly acquired, they look like they're legal.",
        "They look like they're completely legit.",
        "So then give us an example of an artifact that's - I guess maybe made it to a museum, where that journey might have been a little bit dubious.",
        "Well, if you follow the Euphronios vase that went to the Met...",
        "And what did this look like?",
        "A beautiful, large, ceramic, almost like a little bathtub that you would mix water and wine in.",
        "You'd go into the Met and there it was in its own display case, just beautiful paintings of warriors and gods all around it, just one of the finest Greek vessels ever found.",
        "And it was sold with paperwork that said, you know, this thing is legal.",
        "But a lot of people questioned it, and after a while, it was finally figured out, through raids and photographs and notebooks that it was indeed smuggled."

        "You know, did this pot come from a kitchen site, a living room, a burial?",
        "And you can date objects around it, and you keep this context.",
        "And so there's that balance between what we want, the general public, in terms of learning about history, our own or of other cultures, and I guess disturbing these worlds that are out there.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "It's a tough balance because I've worked on quite a few archaeological excavations where you're down in a trench digging with a trowel and wondering, what on earth am I doing, digging through some dead person's belongings?",
        "It definitely is eerie, and I know many archeologists who feel the same way.",

        "It's got a certain kind of edge to it that I kind of trace back to the emotional edge.",
        "There's such an attachment to what is the right and wrong thing to do with these objects and what is legal, what is illegal.",
        "And it really rises to the surface where I know some archeologists who want pot hunters dead, and I know pot hunters who want archeologists dead.",
        "There are some bad rivalries going on here.",
        "What does this mean for how you think about what is right when it comes to antiquities?",
        "Well, seeing things on the ground, seeing things where they are, I've come to believe that artifacts need to stay in their place.",
        "And that's after having gone through museum collections and seeing just the vast amounts of material that we've gathered already and going through private collections and just realizing how much we have swept up from the ground."
