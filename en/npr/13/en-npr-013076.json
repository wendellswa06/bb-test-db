        "Well, what Yamanaka showed was that that process of essentially rewinding the history of a cell was something that could be reduced to a fairly straightforward practice.",
        "And by that I mean we can actually grow a cell from any one of us, that you can put on a plate.",
        "It grows in a petri dish.",
        "And you can actually buy a kit that you add these components, and suddenly the cell will reverse its state, and it'll turn back into something that could be anything.",
        "So, you know, in its most optimistic way of thinking about this, you can envision that this then would become a tool kit for any one of us to have cells in the freezer that our immune system would recognize as our own and could be, potentially, used to replenish cells that got damaged in disease or just by age.",
        "Yeah, interesting.",
        "One last question for you.",
        "If cloning a mammal was such a huge breakthrough, was Ian Wilmut, who cloned Dolly, you think, passed over for a Nobel?",
        "Well, you know, Ian Wilmut's contribution was huge, but in reality, I think that his was an extension of Gurdon's early work.",
        "And Yamanaka really carried that forward to a much more practical dimension.",
        "So, you know, it was almost impossible to do much more with the nuclear transfer.",
        "And certainly what Wilmut had done could not be done, to date at least, in a human.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "But what it could be done with Yamanaka is that we could do this for anybody, and we could do it now and create disease models.",
        "It's been a huge explosion, from Yamanaka's first experience to what we do in a laboratory today.",
        "Well, congratulations to them.",
        "To them.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "To all of us, we hope.",
        "All of you, yes.",
        "You know, on the shoulders of giants, as they say.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And hopefully to the benefit of all mankind."

        "The Nobel winners deciphered how certain cell receptors react to outside signals.",

        "You know, what this was was a sensor.",
        "So we knew before that there were proteins in the body that tell cells what to do, but we didn't know how it worked.",
        "So Lefkowitz and his team did something very clever.",
        "They took these proteins, and they attached radiation to it, iodine radiation.",
        "And they traced them to the cells, and they pulled back, and they got the receptors, which are these sensors."

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR, talking with David Agus.",
        "How long ago was this done?",
        "This was done about 25 years ago.",
        "And, you know, because that's all we talk about today, you know?",
        "It's such a basic discovery that - as you say, that's what we talk about all the time as if we knew about it forever.",
        "Yeah, we knew they existed.",
        "But actually pulling them down and showing what they were and then, most importantly, showing their structure and that they were druggable, we can make something that could turn them on or turn them off.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And the receptors, are they located right on the cell itself?",
        "Yeah.",
        "They're right on the cell, and then these proteins bind them.",
        "They change the shape of those receptors, and that change in shape sends a signal down to the nucleus, telling the cell what to do.",
        "And what made them - what was the light bulb that went off in their head to be able to actually make, you know, to make this discovery?",
        "I think it was the fact that we had used - or science had used radiation, iodine, attached to other things before.",
        "And so it was taking a methodology from one field and attaching it to this new one.",
        "We all knew these proteins were there.",
        "Then somebody looked inside the cell and couldn't find them, so that implied that there had to be something on the cell's surface.",
        "So they went about with very clever methodology and showed that it existed.",
        "Is this something like knowing that there is a DNA molecule structure, but you don't know what it looks like until you discover it, but this happens with receptors in this case?"

        "Back in the '50s, there were all these clues about DNA and about its periodicity, all kinds of things.",

        "They're drugs for motion sickness, drugs for blood pressure and heart rate.",
        "And what happens is, is that molecules in the body, these signaling molecules, they - these receptors sense something.",
        "So these (unintelligible) bind there, and these drugs, they block it, and so they cover the receptors.",
        "So you can't get in there to turn it off, or they act like they're the molecule and get into that key - in a sense, like a lock and key - and turn it on.",
