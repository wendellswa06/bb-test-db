        "As Chante will tell you the church is in her blood, and that's the first thing that I asked her, how does she straddle the religious and the secular?",
        "Well, growing up in a Christian family, you would have thought what happened to me would never happen because my mother loved me and she was very much aware of who I am, but I was a very mature little girl.",
        "And at 14, I was allowed to have a crush on a man who was 21.",

        "It's funny.",
        "But in this season of the political spoof, NPR's Allison Keyes wonders if something is being lost in all that laughter.",
        "There's a whole flurry of funny stuff floating around out there, including elaborate flights of fancy by talented amateurs with a lot of time on their hands, like the Obama Bollywood video with images of the Democrat seeming to lip-sync to a love song.",

        "Jody Baumgartner is an assistant professor of political science at East Carolina University.",

        "They were actually around since colonial times, although they didn't become really popularized until the advent of the penny press in the mid to later 19th century.",
        "Older political satire was sharp, like Mark Twain's 1906 saying that fleas can be taught nearly anything that a congressman can.",
        "Whether or not today's humor is any more vicious, it's often more salacious, like this primary season video from Mad TV, which implies, shall we say, an intimate relationship between Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama and his former rival, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.",

        "In the mid-20th century, Gardner says, the leading practitioners of political humor were people like newspaper columnist Art Buchwald and TV comedian Johnny Carson.",
        "Political humor was rather a benign art form at that time, perhaps because Buchwald knew he would lose newspapers, and Carson knew he would lose affiliates.",
        "I don't know that there are any affiliates working on the Internet, so there are fewer censors and fewer monitors that work.",
        "Gardner says that is likely the same reason that political cartoons in newspapers and magazines are fairly tame.",
