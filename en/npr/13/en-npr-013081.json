        "You know, the trousers are cropped at the ankle.",
        "The jackets look like they were made for a 12-year-old.",

        "And, you know, we live in a valley where there's lots of farmers and stuff like that, and it's not that big a deal.",
        "We've had a couple of stores try in town to sell, you know, the really high-priced stuff where, you know, jeans are a couple hundred dollars and sweaters are $300, and I recently got some fantastic deals there when they went out of business.",

        "Now is really the time for us to make the big, bold bets that we can uniquely afford to make.",
        "To some degree, it is.",
        "Most designers who consider themselves to be creating fashion with a capital F and are putting their clothes on a runway would say that the vast majority of their customers are on either coast, and that is sort of in that corridor between, say, Boston and Washington and maybe some down in Miami - and then in California, particularly in Los Angeles.",
        "And does anybody market to Medford, Oregon?",
        "I would say that, no, they don't.",
        "And I think that's probably one of the great flaws of the fashion industry, that there is a tendency to see customers who appreciate beautiful clothing and interesting clothing that speaks to their lives as being situated in either California or New York, and they do tend to ignore, I think, the vast middle section of the country and the far corners of the country.",

        "I'm a jewelry designer in Houston, so I'd have to say that there is some pretty high-end designers in Houston, and they market some nice lines of clothing there - Dolce&Gabbana, Gucci, people like that all have stores in Houston.",
        "But as a jewelry designer, I have to look to what is on the runway for colors, for what will - what my designs will go with what's in fashion now, because people want something similar even if they can't afford something that they've seen in a magazine for $10,000, so…",
        "Hmm, Robin Givhan, I think that's an important point.",
        "This has repercussions throughout the entire garment industry, if you were going to use a bigger term than fashion.",
        "Yeah, absolutely, and by the way, I did not mean to malign Houston - or Dallas, for that matter.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Lots of fashion in both places."

        "So, I mean, they really understand that for most people, the idea of spending thousands of dollars on a dress that might only have a lifespan of one season is beyond reason, and it's something they would just never even consider doing.",
        "But they will go out and spend, say, $400 on a pair of shoes.",
