        "We're going to take a short break.",
        "We're talking with Robin Givhan - the fashion editor for The Washington Post - on the subject of does fashion matter?",
        "If so, why?",
        "If not, why not?",

        "I'm Neal Conan.",

        "This is TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "I'm Neal Conan from NPR News.",
        "It's Fashion Week in London.",
        "And as models strut down the runway in everything from tweed to trash bags, we're asking the question: Does fashion matter?",
        "Our guest is Robin Givhan, fashion editor for The Washington Post.",
        "If you'd like to join us, our number is 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK.",
        "E-mail is talk@npr.org.",
        "And joining us now is Valerie Steele, director and curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology.",
        "She joins us from her office in Manhattan.",
        "Nice to have you on the program today.",
        "Nice to be here.",
        "Now you have clothes at the museum that are considered art pieces.",
        "So where is the line between what's considered imaginative or artsy and wearable clothes?",
        "Well, I don't think that you could say that our clothes are considered art pieces.",
        "It would really depend on who you were asking.",
        "There's a big debate about whether fashion is art.",
        "Certainly, some kinds of fashion are very artfully made or very innovative, but I think that whole idea - in the past, people thought art was something timelessly beautiful and fashion was just something that changed constantly.",
        "That's kind of an old-fashioned idea after you have Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes.",
        "The whole idea what is art is more complicated than we think.",
        "Well, we have things which are wearable clothes.",
        "Let me say, different fashion museums have different approaches.",
        "The Costume Institute chooses things which they see as being art - often haute couture, runway pieces.",
        "Museum of the City of the New York chooses things made or worn in New York.",
        "Museum at FIT chooses things which we see as being on the cutting edge of fashion - not necessarily haute couture.",
        "It could be street style.",
        "It could be hip-hop style, Goth or punk style, but something that we see as being influential for what makes other fashion designers sit up and take notice.",
        "Mm-hmm, for example - and I know you're especially familiar with the history of high-heeled shoes - these are devices much admired by men and much described by many of the women I know as devices invented by Torquemada."

        "High-heeled shoes are one of the prime kind of erotic images of femininity.",
        "And although a lot of women find them uncomfortable - I'm looking down, I'm wearing what's just like sort of lace-up shoes which are one-and-a-half inches, so they look like men's shoe - a lot of women really love high heels.",
        "I remember we did a show called Shoes, A Lexicon of Style.",
        "And we had a whole section specifically on heels, and then others on boots and sandals, including comfortable Birkenstock sandals.",
        "And we had one Brazilian TV reporter who came running in with her crew, ran straight to the Birkenstocks and screamed, no Latin woman would wear horrible shoes like these.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "You know, if she wanted - she used that word.",
        "She thought of being sexy and feminine, and high heels fit the ticket.",
        "So it's a choice.",
        "In the past, maybe you had to wear certain styles that went in or out.",
        "But nowadays, there's a wide range of styles that you can choose from, and a lot of women vote with their feet, and they choose the high heels.",
        "Hmm, all right.",
        "Let's see if we get some listeners back on the line.",
        "And let's go to - this is Jim.",

        "I grew up in the industry, and most of the people that I knew back then - actors, some very, very famous people, I'm not going to go into names now - were perfectly happy, even though they had access to studio clothing and everything else, perfectly happy running around in their cowboy boots, jeans, and an old shirt."

        "And it seems like anything else, people are very driven by what they're kind of told to do - most people being followers.",
        "And I think a lot of the fashion industry is a self-perpetuating industry because you come out with a line of clothing, and people go out and spend 2 or $3,000 one year, and then some fashion designer or whomever you happen to be following the following year says, no, this is out.",
        "We want you to spend 2 or $3,000 more on clothing.",
        "And I really don't see the practicality of that when, you know, a good pair of clothing is going to last you a long time.",
        "Why do this, you know?",
        "You can probably best spend your money in other devices.",
        "Well…",

        "All right, and I'll just note that it's interesting that he described his business, the movie business, as the industry.",

        "They may - yes, they do.",
        "I figured they did.",
        "But, you know, I think it's interesting that fashion always sort of seems to get this bum rap, especially when you start talking about very high-end, expensive fashion, because people tend to say, well, why do you - why would anyone ever need to spend $2,000 on a jacket when one that costs $100 is just fine and is just as nice?",
        "And there are a lot of people who feel that way, and they spend $100 on a jacket, and life goes on.",
        "But I would also argue that there are a lot of people who - again, to use the auto industry - look at people who spend $80,000 on a car and say, what are you, mad?",
        "You could spend $20,000 and still get from point A to point B.",

        "What's the sense of paying that much if the materials and craftsmanship are the same as significantly cheaper ones?",
        "Well, very often, the materials and craftsmanship are not the same.",
        "I went to a shoe factory once in Italy, and you could see how the $500 pair of shoes was a combination of really high technology - with lasers and so on - and hand workmanship, with stitching and using leather instead of using cheaper materials to make it.",
        "So some of it's the fact that the shoes are going to be high fashion in terms of trendy, but some of it is that they're much better quality.",
        "I think it's like the - what Robin said.",
        "Do you want a car or do you want a Porsche?",
        "Do you know - do you want a cheap pair of shoes, or do you want a really well-made pair of shoes?",

        "And, you know, Neal, on that same topic, I would also add that part of what the fashion industry is selling is not merely a dress.",
        "It is - it's a designer dress, and it's all the fantasy and all of the image-making and all of the glamour that's sort of rolled into that.",
        "I mean, there's a reason why fashion advertising is so otherworldly sometimes, because they're really tapping into fantasy and the idea of the way that we would like to be, perhaps, and not necessarily the way that we are.",
        "And I think it's important to realize that people are not just being suckered by advertising, though.",
        "It's not the idea of a cabal of designers…",
        "Right.",
        "Things like names are also ruled by fashion.",

        "There's no industry that tries to bribe you to name your child Christopher.",
        "You decide it, but fashions plays an influence in that.",
        "To be fair, though, Robin, you did write in your series of articles about the week - this past week in New York that, in fact, the fashion industry - or the industry, to use your terminology - could probably use a little bit more skepticism as people walk down the runways in utterly outrageous costumes.",
        "Nobody laughed, nobody snickered, nobody said anything.",
        "It's true.",
        "I think that, you know, there should be, you know, a great - a nice balance there, because there are certainly times when things appear on the runway, and the idea of this, you know, sort of wonderful fantasy has truly been left behind and you've got practically a nightmare on the runway.",
        "And there is an incredibly high tolerance for any idea, and I often think that the industry would be better served if there was a bit more self-criticism rather than having to get it all from customers who feel like they've been completely either deserted or insulted.",
        "Yeah, you say the industry, in fact, needs to learn how to boo.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I mean, I don't want, you know, the audience to suddenly start throwing rotten tomatoes on the runway.",
        "But I do think that sometimes the industry needs to hear from within its own group that, hey, that's a bad idea.",
        "That's awful, or that's insulting.",
        "I mean, things sometimes come down the runway - for instance, dresses that the models can barely even walk in because the hem is so narrow - someone should say don't send that down the runway.",
        "That's not only just unattractive, that's really insulting to adult women.",
