        "Just as American women look at covered Muslim women with pity, so do Muslim women view Western society and its obsession with fashion.",
        "We consider the fashion industry to be a form of oppression, sucking millions of dollars from women, making them feel inadequate if they're not able to match the fashions, and depressing regular women who can't achieve the current ideal weight or hair type, all in an effort to please men.",

        "The whole French couture industry would have collapsed without all the fashion they're buying.",
        "But they buy it to wear indoors with other women.",
        "So I think that Western women as well buy and wear sometimes sexier fashion for a variety of reasons and not just because they're out to please men or please some kind of fantasy image of men.",
        "I think the view's too oversimplified.",
        "Let's get another caller on the line.",

        "Hi.",
        "How are you?",
        "I'm good, thanks.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I have a lot of cognitive dissonance about the fashion industry, because when you look at the statistics that indicate that over 60 percent of Americans are overweight or obese - I'm really curious, how does the fashion industry cater to the wants and desires of those women who wish they could wear those items on the runway, but yet are compelled to buy things that are less fashionable?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Robin Givhan?",
        "Well, I think that there's definitely a disconnect between the designers who are creating the very expensive, more leading-edge collections and a more mass market company.",
        "Because when you look at those, oftentimes you'll see that a mass market company has extended its sizing up to say, a 16 -not going, you know, into plus sizes.",
        "Whereas, you look at the designers, and they usually end their sizing at about a 12, but they also include sizes zero and two on the other end."

        "And part of that is - I believe - truly just designers', sort of, snobbery.",
        "They want to dress what they believe is sort of the ideal figure.",
        "And for them, as they expend beyond sizes 12s and 14s, it then becomes a different kind of design challenge for them.",
        "The same dress that's cut as a two, you have to make changes in order to make that same silhouette flattering on a much larger size.",
        "I think that it's certainly a problem, because there's a huge market out there of people who are not being served.",
        "Oh, I think it'd be, yeah, a wonderful, lucrative business for designers to - you look at larger size women like Queen Latifah or Delta Burke who have - obviously, very lovely women of larger size.",
        "And I think it would be wonderful if the fashion industry would try and focus on people who are actually the majority, as opposed to the minority like the runway models.",
        "And I think this would also help to minimize the incidents of eating disorders among women who try to aspire to a figure that can't fit in those size zero and size two outfits.",

        "(As Amelia) Where'd you get this?",
        "Well, you know, one of the issues, though, is that for a very long time, the fashion industry believed that women who were larger would not spend the money on designer clothes.",
        "And after having spoken with some designers, one of the other things that I learned is that it's not that they are being -they're not getting this great demand from the size 16s and 18s to make the clothes in their size, or they're not the ones coming in looking for their size.",
        "What they're finding is that smaller and smaller women are coming in - and I'm talking sizes zeroes and size twos - saying, you know, we want those clothes.",
        "I mean, there's a much greater demand at the small end than at the larger end.",
        "Or at least that's what some designers are saying.",
        "Victoria, thank you."

        "And that, you know, the direct consumers of fine art are a very small minority of those who ultimately are influenced by the trends that are shown.",
        "Hmm.",
        "So it has repercussions not only throughout the rest of the clothing industry, but through the rest of society, you think, Steve?",
        "That's exactly what I'm saying.",

        "They're aware of them.",
        "And there's this kind of floating conversation between visual people, some of the same kind of imagery will occur in an ad or a movie that had nothing to do with the original fashion runway."
