        "This sounds very important.",
        "So there was an independent body that would investigate complaints, ethics complaints, against lawmakers.",
        "Now, a House committee run by actual lawmakers, Republican lawmakers themselves.",

        "Oh, OK, so a bipartisan committee (unintelligible).",
        "It is a bipartisan committee.",

        "So that is the Republicans' argument.",
        "Well, they say, look, it's gives the House Ethics Committee more power over this committee, but that's the way it should be, that this is a bipartisan committee.",
        "In some ways, their work has been redundant.",
        "The outside - this outside group cannot independently punish members.",

        "What is the argument for this?",

        "Yes.",
        "It does not look good, particularly when you have Donald Trump, who had campaigned on this drain the swamp message and changing the way Washington works.",

        "And there was just this era where the public was really frustrated with Washington.",
        "And then President Obama and House - then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi helped pass this law which created the OCE, which was to say to the public, you know, it wasn't that the Ethics Committee inside Congress wasn't working, but sometimes the problem when you have equally divided bipartisan committees is there's almost a truce.",
        "Nobody wants to be the party that actually turns on the other.",
        "So the House Ethics Committee, the criticism against it was that it was just sort of feckless and maybe an outside group was needed to sort of give it a nudge to make sure it did these investigations.",
        "OK, so it doesn't look good in some ways to get rid of this independent body.",
        "What is the argument for getting rid of it?",
        "I mean, it sounds like this congressman who proposed it is saying that it would be more transparent if they get rid of this body.",
        "How would that work?",
        "Yeah, and that was Goodlatte's argument, and a lot of the Republicans that supported this had been subject to investigations by the OCE and were very frustrated by that process.",
        "One of their points is that, you know, in any other proceeding, if you are accused of something, you have a right to challenge your accuser.",
        "And if you - but if someone can anonymously file complaints against you, that forces you to hire counsel, to spend money, to defend yourself but you don't even know who's making the accusation against you.",
        "And we should say that overt - since 2008, when this was created, there have been Democrats that have also criticized this process who have said it is not fair that people can accuse us of wrongdoing, and we don't have the same due process rights we would have in other courts or other proceedings."
