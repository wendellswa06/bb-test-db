        "That's right.",

        "I kind of saw it through this lens of oppression, and only through oppression.",
        "But I think all of us were struck who were there by how the invasion in a way had unleashed this incredible complexity in the country: religion, nationalism, community groups of the brutalization that Iraq had gone through for 20 or 30 years.",
        "You, in fact, suggest that the rule of Saddam was so brutal it destroyed something in the Iraqi soul and spirit that makes recovery difficult now.",

        "In fact, if somebody asked me what I thought had shaped Iraq the most at the present day, you know, I'd point back to the war with Iran.",
        "I mean, here was a conflict that lasted for eight years--1980 to 1988--you know, a million dead and wounded on both sides, one in five or one in six Iraqi men were under arms--and introduced this kind of culture of violence or this culture of the gun that I think Iraq is still grappling with to this day.",
        "It's kind of remarkable when you look back over a generation of what that country went through in war, tyranny, UN sanctions that basically wiped out the middle class in the 1990s.",
        "And then the present day, which we're talking about, an invasion and occupation and the beginnings of a civil war, it's--you know, I kind of marvel when I talk to Iraqis is how they endure this.",

        "I think--I got back from Iraq a few weeks ago, and my sense there is when you look at the forces aligned, the competing agendas, the level of violence, it does feel like a civil war to a certain degree.",
        "I don't think it's a full-fledged conflict at this point, but it's definitely there on the ground, and I think the Iraqis are more and more, you know, confronting the fact that that is the case.",
        "What strikes me, though, is I think we often see Iraq as this--as a constellation of Kurds, Sunnis and Shiites, and I think it is that at one level.",
        "But perhaps more pitched are the rivalries within the communities.",
        "When you look at southern Iraq, you're talking about rival militias that are competing for influence and power in places like Basra.",
