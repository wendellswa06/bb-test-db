        "But along the lines of issues that are specific to people because of their gender, you talk about the case of the advertising executive Charlotte Beers who talks about being physically assaulted by a client that she had just nabbed for her advertising agency.",
        "And in that story, he gets her into a darkened room and literally kind of jumps on her.",
        "She's able to fight him off.",
        "In addressing this, what she does is she works out a deal to get the assaulter off the project, and she keeps the deal for her company through her tough bargaining.",
        "By assigning the client to a guy.",
        "By assigning the client to a guy.",
        "I talked about this with a number of women in my office and many of them felt is that really the right solution in this day and age?",
        "I mean, shouldn't she have pressed charges or why should she have assigned that deal to a guy?",
        "I mean, that sort of thing.",
        "I guess what the question is does this advice still hold up?",
        "I think this advice holds up very loud and clear in 2016.",
        "In her case, this was a relatively small ad agency.",
        "This company represented one of their biggest clients.",
        "There is a much more recent example in the book in which one of the female CEOs a couple of years ago is approached by one of her young female staffers who says that basically she's being stalked - you know, not physically, but by email and text and whatnot - by one of their major clients who's demanding that she go out with him.",
        "And she doesn't want to go out with him.",
        "But yet, she doesn't want to jeopardize this client because this is a startup.",
        "They need every major corporate client that they can get.",
        "And what her counsel was to this 20-something staffer was aren't you already involved romantically with someone else?",
        "And she said yes.",
        "She said just go back to this client and say I'm sorry but I'm already involved with someone else, and if that doesn't work, I will personally get involved.",
        "Well, it did work.",
        "OK.",
        "But the point here I think for other people would be that, first of all, what if this person who physically assaulted Charlotte Beers goes on to assault someone else?",
        "And why is it that this woman's desire not to be involved with this client is contingent upon her being involved with someone else?",
        "There was a very recent case of this, I will say, at Fox News where if the allegations are to be believed then, evidently, there was enough credibility to warrant a very large monetary settlement to one complaint and in particular this was standard operating practice for some of the young professionals there.",
        "And a lot of people would say why should their relationships be relevant to whether they are pressed into unwanted relationships or not?",
        "And I think the larger question from that situation is why did so many women at Fox tolerate this horrible behavior if true for so many years without saying anything, without speaking up, without pressing charges, without filing a lawsuit?",
        "It's for the same reason that, you know, many women do not do so.",
        "They fear being branded a complainer, a whistleblower, and they worry about the employment consequences.",
        "And the larger question is, you know, when does this become the responsibility of men and women alike and the onus isn't entirely on women?",
        "And so what - I think what you're saying is that for now maybe it's not fair, but that's common sense.",
        "And this is what you have to do.",
        "I say that because we're not yet at that ideal world.",
        "I think we're going to get there in your and my lifetimes, at least in this country.",
        "I'm not sure women in certain other countries and certain other cultures will see that era come when the onus is not entirely on women."

        "But what was interesting to me is there was so much talk about these quarterbacks leading up to this game.",
        "But this was really a story of defense.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Thanks so much.",

        "She takes on Hurricane Katrina, the Black Lives Matter movement.",
        "Were you surprised that she sings a song like that at the Super Bowl?",

        "Even when you're wearing designer clothes and, you know, you're a musical star, you still got that bottle of hot sauce in your bag, like she says in one of the lyrics.",
        "And she sang that song at the halftime show, but it had a little different tinge to it because it was in such a celebratory situation.",
        "So it was a powerful message sort of couched in this sort of party vibe, which was an interesting thing to see.",
        "Favorite commercial?",

        "But there are clashes reported to be ongoing somewhat to the west of the city center towards other areas that are controlled by the Taliban outside of the main city.",

        "I think you can chalk it up to at least two reasons.",
        "One is Afghan concern about maintaining continued international support.",
        "So they don't want to take advantage of this and risk long-term support.",
        "Secondly is it just speaks to the fear that is ongoing in Kunduz and other parts of the north, that if they do criticize them that these strikes might not occur in the future in other places, and you'll see a further deterioration of security.",
