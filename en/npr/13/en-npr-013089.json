        "But then I realized that I liked the fringe because the fringe gave me the flexibility to appear or disappear, which I found to be very helpful.",
        "And painful or, at least, vexing as it can be to be a fringy kid.",

        "And so I took a chance, sort of put my morals, values and ethics in a lockbox and went sailing to New York City, got the cargo there and was promptly arrested and given six years in prison, of which I did a year and a half.",

        "Does it wind up in your books?",
        "In a book like this, it's difficult to take a 12-year-old character and maybe work this kind of material into a book like this, but one of the things that connects \"\"From Norvelt to Nowhere\"\" or the Norvelt books with \"\"Hole in My Life,\"\" which was the memoir about my time in prison, is the bookishness.",
        "And I think that if I have to find a way to parse those volumes, it would be through the referencing of the literature.",

        "Meaning what, there's a long fight ahead?",
