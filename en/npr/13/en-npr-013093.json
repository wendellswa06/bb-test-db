        "So it didn't necessarily feel like I was being a leftie.",
        "It just felt like I was being a human being who was relating to other human beings.",

        "We had Roseanne, Naomi Klein.",

        "But it was also, you know, a platform, a stage.",
        "The park became a very, very large stage where a lot of people came and used that to be seen.",
        "But a lot of celebrities also were amazing in providing resources and not necessarily taking up a lot of space with their voices, which are normally heard, but really finding a way to allow other voices to be heard.",
        "So it was an interesting experience.",
        "Were you there when it was shut down by the police?",
        "The night that it was shut down by the police, it was actually the only night I had went home before 1:00 in the morning and turned right back around and got back on the train and got out of the subway station with some of my close friends having been pepper-sprayed in the face and not being able to reach the park because it had already been blocked off.",
        "So it was a really sad day.",
        "It was a very violent day, where we couldn't see each other, and we couldn't help each other out.",
        "And where does it go next?",
        "Well, I mean that remains to be seen.",

        "Otherwise we would literally be getting frostbit and dying.",
        "At 50 below, you're continuing - even a tent with a wood stove, that's going to get pretty cold.",
        "Yeah, it gets a lot warmer at the top of the tent than at the bottom, and you have to rotate a lot to make sure that, you know, the side on the wall doesn't get cold.",
        "But, you know, you can do it.",
        "And we've had people donate winter gear, and, you know, I make sure to wear layers."

        "I attended that meeting really just to see who was there and what it felt like, and it was the craziest thing.",
        "I remember, I think it was the Tuesday afternoon in a park that is usually pretty deserted at that time, and people kept coming and coming, and before the end we had 100 people just for a planning meeting in the middle of a Tuesday afternoon."

        "It has.",

        "It does appear that way from the outside.",
        "But, you know, even at that first planning meeting, we were talking about the police as part of the 99 percent, certainly as individuals, but, as institutionally in service to the 1 percent.",
        "So it's really about a confrontation with the violence of the status quo.",
        "You know, we - the media likes to make much of somebody throwing a tear gas canister back at a police officer, but we don't talk much about the toxins that corporations are leaking into our groundwater, for example, as a form of violence, or of the manufacture of nuclear weapons that people are profiting from immensely as a form of violence.",
        "So I think the conflict with the police brings that conflict with violence into stark relief, and that's happened here.",
        "There was also outreach to labor unions, and in some respects, they supported the movement.",
        "In others, when, for example, some marched down to the port to try to close that down at various points, there was, well, at best, mixed success.",
        "You know, I think that we mostly had the rank-and-file members of the union with us.",
        "There was some distancing from that move by leaders of the ILWU, which is the union that - it's for the dock workers - at the port because they, in their contract, are forbidden from striking.",
        "So they weren't able to say they were in solidarity with the general strike.",
        "But for the most part, we had many dock workers who were right out there with us, thanking us for being there.",
        "And what particular - the Seminary of the Streets.",
        "What's the interfaith group's role?",
        "So I - my own organization is called Seminary of the Street, but I'm part of a larger coalition called the Interfaith Tent at Oakland.",
        "And we got really involved, I would say, after that first outbreak of police violence on October 25th at that point, and leading up to the general strike.",
        "We put up a tent.",
