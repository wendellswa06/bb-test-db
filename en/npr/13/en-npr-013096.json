        "So it provides a hint that GBV-C could be helping people fight off Ebola.",
        "Or it could simply be that 20- to 40-year-olds are more likely to have GBV-C infections and more likely to survive Ebola, as he says in a study published in the Journal of Virology.",

        "But I would say that overall, the scientific community would say this is not a bad virus.",
        "Do you have a sense of how many other viruses are out there like this one that are lurking in our bodies and not doing anything harmful but we are just completely oblivious of them?",
        "You know, I actually think it's not that many.",
        "And I wouldn't have said that 10 years ago.",
        "That's because technology is getting so good at detecting genetic material from viruses that Stapleton suggests there may not be many more new ones to discover, at least floating around in human blood.",
