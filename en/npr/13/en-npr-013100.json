        "Is President Bush getting a raw deal here, Marcelo?",
        "There has been a very uneven distribution, in terms of the economic growth.",
        "There is a growing, increasing pattern of inequality.",
        "There's been a massive transfer of wealth to the upper fifth percentile of the income distribution.",
        "And the average American worker has, in fact, lost ground in terms of hourly wages over the last five years.",
        "So it's going to be a difficult case to make to suggest that the average worker in the US today is, if we ask the eternal question Ronald Reagan once asked, `Are you better off today than you were four years ago?",
        "The answer, for most American workers today, is no, we're not better off today.",
        "Julianne, can you expand on that?",
        "Especially because America is a consumer economy, how much we spend really has a lot of influence on how well the economy is doing.",
        "Are people going to keep spending money when they feel so uneasy?",
        "Well, unfortunately, people are spending money, and a bit more than they should be, but the term I use, Farai, to describe our situation is macroeconomic ecstasy and microeconomic angst.",
        "If you look at the indicators--4.3 percent growth, 215,000 jobs created, which, incidentally, is not enough jobs to sustain a recovery.",
        "You need to be generating 300,000 jobs a month plus--and we aren't.",
        "We've got all these layoff headlines.",
        "But you look at the indicators, in general, and they look OK.",
        "The day after Thanksgiving was a positive day.",
        "But then you look, as Marcelo has just said, at the individual, at how people are faring; the people who are doing well are the people at the top.",
        "If you're a stockholder, if you're a homeowner, you are basically doing very well.",
        "And not all homeowners--but especially stockholders.",
        "Corporate profits are way up.",
        "But wages are stagnant.",
        "Why do Americans continue to spend?",
        "Because we live in a spending culture, but I think that when the dust clears, after this holiday season, which, incidentally, retailers are counting on in some sectors for 40 percent, you know, of their spending, of their sales, rather.",
        "In jewelry--almost half of all jewelry is sold during this period.",
        "I think when the dust clears, it's not gonna look as good as we think it will.",
        "This economy is not booming.",
        "It's booming for a few people and by and large it's failing.",
        "There are a whole bunch of words the president didn't use when he talked about all the things that have happened in the economy, and he's avoided his own complicity in the corporate scandals, in the high energy costs and in the so-called tax cuts that leave us with a crippling deficit.",
        "George, let me bring you in on a slightly different tack.",
        "What about reporting on the economy?",
        "When the average person reads about 215,000 created in November, and somebody like Dr. Malveaux says, well, that's not enough, how are we supposed to know that?",
        "How can the media do a better job of helping people sort through these economic issues?",
        "Well, George, let's look at Condoleezza Rice as a black woman.",
        "A lot of times during other tense moments in US history, black folks could go abroad, for example, and people would say, `Oh, yeah, you've been mistreated by your government.",
        "Come here, brother.",
        "Now you've got Condoleezza Rice, and before that Colin Powell, representing the face of American foreign policy.",
        "Has that eroded black Americans' ability to sort of go under the radar when America is in controversy?",
        "Thank you, Andy Bowers, Slate senior editor.",
        "That Explainer was compiled by Daniel Engber.",
        "Well, you just say all of you--you have to say that--there's been a job increase of 215,000, there've been 10 quarters of steady economic growth.",
        "You need to say that.",
        "But you also got to say that even the person who was a member of Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers say the misery index, the combination of unemployment-inflation, has gotten worse.",
        "In fact, it was at a 12-year high in September.",
        "So it's above what it's been the last two decades.",
        "It's above what it was when Bush came to office.",
        "So you have to say the message is mixed, and I agree with her that--you know, certainly these gains are certainly tilted toward the people who are most affluent, but you got to say it's mixed, at best.",
        "Let me just ask about another specific issue.",
        "Pensions--it seems that every week brings new news that some company is changing its pension benefits, or eliminating it.",
        "It seems patently unfair to bring people into a work environment, promise them a certain amount of retirement money and then say, `Uh-oh, we don't have any money so you don't either.'"

        "Julianne, how is that playing into the instability?",
        "Well, I think, first of all, it's playing into the malaise.",
        "You have people who, as you say, counted on getting a certain number of dollars per month and now they're being told that they're going to be tested on their acumen as an investor.",
        "That's exactly why lots of people are--avoid the stock market.",
        "They don't want the risks in their companies.",
        "And these are really smokestack foundational companies in our country are saying, `Oh, well, forget about'--Verizon, the most recent.",
        "And Verizon is posting profits.",
        "It's absurd to have this kind of a switch, but what it really does is leaves working people, people who do not follow the stock market every day, far more vulnerable.",
        "In the airline industry, we've seen, you know, tens of thousands of people find their pensions really cut by a third by changes.",
        "And, George, again, around the issue of reporting on this, when you look at the picture of how people feel, has your association, the National Newspaper Publishers Association News Service, really been going out and trying to tap into the black community's sense of how the economy is treating black folks?",
        "And what are you finding out?",
        "Oh, certainly, we have, and we have run, actually, a lot of stories of people who have an almost six-figures income, then suddenly they're waiting tables.",
        "I mean, that is a reality, and unemployment is always at least two to three times higher among African-Americans, and that has not changed under George Bush, so those pains are all still real.",
        "Marcelo, I want to direct you to another topic.",
        "We're looking at the visit of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to Europe.",
        "She landed in Berlin, ended up getting a bit upbraided by a German official, who told a joint news conference with Rice that the United States had acknowledged that it essentially kidnapped the wrong person, Khaled al-Masri, a German national of--you know, who's also Muslim, who was--spent, he alleges, five months in, you know, detainment for being a member of a terrorist cell when he was, in fact, nothing of the sort.",
        "The Washington Post has been following this story, found a lot of evidence that his story is true.",
        "Now, one, how bad is this for the administration?",
        "The policy of rendition, that shuttling of prisoners to secret prison sites in Europe, is further eroding US legitimacy, and really its ability to command a higher ground in pursuing what is now an open-ended, ongoing war on terror.",
        "Just returned from a series of lectures in Rome, in Antwerp, in Brussels, and you can feel in the air the ethos of distrust and hostility to this administration, precisely around these issues of the role of Europe in the shuttling of--and possibly torture of prisoners in Europe, in settings.",
        "But let me just frame another part of this, which is that Germany, apparently, allowed its airspace to be used for these renditions.",
        "Should Germany and other European countries who are allowing the US to use their airspace, to use their resources, also be brought to task?",
        "Of course they should be brought to task.",
        "The use of airspace is an independent issue from the rendition of prisoners through secret detention camps.",
        "And, Julianne, Marcelo, who is the co-director of immigration studies at New York University, was talking about going overseas, feeling as if there is a pall over the respect for the US government.",
        "Is that going to affect our ability to operate economically, socially in the world?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think that some of the respect that we had commandeered in the past--in addition to the fact that we were a 700-pound gorilla, in addition to the fact that we supposedly stood for democracy, all led to some kowtowing to America, or at least some deference.",
        "The deference is gone.",
        "China takes us on, Germany takes us on.",
        "Tiny little countries take us on.",
        "It's changed the tone and tenor of relations at the United Nations.",
        "Though, literally, we have squandered our moral authority, not only on this war in Iraq, but also on these practices--Abu Ghraib, it would be an example; this rendition policy would be another.",
        "And I think that Secretary Rice is way off base by attempting to create some equivalency.",
        "Using your airspace is not the same as torturing people.",
        "There's just no equivalent."

        "We're not taking people to these other countries and secret camps,' but does not say the United States has not instructed other countries to do that, that they're doing it in a more subtle way.",
        "I mean, you got to watch the language because when you get beyond the language, the reality is still there.",
        "Well, it expressed grave concern that the Holy See has not acknowledged the extent of the crimes committed by priests, and has not taken the necessary steps to address cases of child sex abuse.",
        "The report came out just a few weeks after Vatican officials were grilled for an entire day in Geneva on the Holy See's implementation of the International Treaty on the Rights of the Child.",

        "I mean, we spent a lot of Christmas following him doing that.",
        "He went there because he had the credibility of the civil rights movement behind him.",

        "He got the black pass.",
        "She doesn't get the black pass, and she doesn't basically trump anything that anyone else is doing from the African-American community.",

        "Historians polled by the History News Network are giving Bush failing grades, not just for, you know, contemporary events, but in history.",

        "Having said that, I do think that there's an emerging consensus, not only in the field of history, but in the field of diplomacy, in a number of other fields, that the mistakes, the grave mistakes of this administration, will have a very, very special place in our historical recollection of this era, when the book is finally written.",
