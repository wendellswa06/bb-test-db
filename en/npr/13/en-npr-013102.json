        "Well, what I'm looking at here is something that looks like the map that you see in the back of an airline magazine that shows all the routes going from the various hubs across the country, around the world, and a bunch of lines drawn between cities.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So these are airline connections, looking at all the hubs that are connected to one another.",
        "And what Wellman has found in Toronto is that the airline connections between your city and the rest of the world predict where your Twitter followers are going to be.",

        "So if you are living in New York, you're much more likely to have followers in London than you are likely to have followers in a small town in the United States.",
        "Because New York and London are already connected in many powerful ways.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So airline connections in many ways are predicting that these two cities have common interests, that there's a lot of trade maybe between them.",
        "There's a lot of people who have similar kinds of professions or similar interests who live in those kinds of cities.",
        "But this really calls into question the notion that Twitter is a truly democratic medium.",
        "Granting that Twitter in some ways is following our real-world connections, does it in some way intensify them and make connections possible in ways it wouldn't have been before?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It is the case that you really can follow people anywhere in the world.",
        "But what isn't true is this vision that Twitter is a truly flat medium.",
        "You know, Tom Freedman wrote this book saying the world is flat, and what Wellman is basically finding is that, no, the world isn't flat.",
        "The world is actually very lumpy.",
        "And if you're living in one of those big lumps, you're much more likely to be connected to people in one of the other lumps than if you're living in the flat part of the world.",

        "The union, in exchange, agreed not to boycott, strike, or use other outside pressure tactics.",
        "It agreed not to coerce employees; and it said it would support an initiative that would allow casinos to have slot machines.",
        "After the initiative passed, the casino reneged on the agreement, and backed a lawsuit brought by the National Right to Work Committee and one of the casino employees, Martin Mulhall, who explained his objection this way.",
        "Someone can't just come in and bargain for me without me even being recognized or have a say.",
