        "They've said, we'll provide it, you know, it's going to be up to 3000 jobs in Mobile, Alabama, but by transferring the assembly of the tanker and the commercial version of that plane to the U.S., EADS is also serving its own interest because as you know, right now the powerful Euro is really hurting Airbus because planes are sold in dollars.",
