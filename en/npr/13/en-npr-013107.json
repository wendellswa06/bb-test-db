        "So, the Saudi military really was - the soldiers were really reluctant to even point the weapons towards troubles unless there was an authorization, a fatwa, from the leading Muslim clerics.",
        "And it took a while for the Saudi royal family to secure that.",
        "How had the gunmen gotten their weapons in there?",
        "Some of them smuggled them in coffins, because it's a practice to bring in your dead relatives to receive a blessing in the Grand Mosque before the burial.",
        "Others were able to bribe the guards of the mosque and to drive a few pickup trucks into the basement of the mosque, taking advantage of the fact that there was construction work there at the time, carried out by no one else by the bin Laden construction company, which built…",
        "Excuse me, did you say the bin Laden construction company?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "The construction company of Osama bin Laden's father.",
        "And, in fact, when the Saudi government had to storm the compound later, they had to rely on the blueprints and the maps provided by the bin Laden family.",
        "You said they stormed the compound.",
        "How did this end?",
        "It took about two weeks for the Saudi Interior Ministry and special forces and the regular army and the national guard to seize both the above-ground structures of the Grand Mosque and the labyrinth that is underneath.",
        "There were about a thousand rooms connected with corridors in the basement, called the kabu(ph).",
        "And there were hundreds, maybe more than a thousand casualties.",
        "A large part of the structure was severely damaged.",
        "Saudi government had to use tanks, artillery.",
        "At the very end, they had to bring in the help of the French special forces.",
        "And the French special forces brought this poison gas that was pumped in the basement of the Grand Mosque, flushing out the last rebels.",
        "You know, I want to mention: I wasn't very old at all then in 1979, but I remember some of the events we've been talking about.",
        "I remember the invasion of Afghanistan.",
        "I remember the Iranian Revolution.",
        "Why do you suppose it would be that I, as an ordinary American, don't have very much memory - any memory, really, at all - of this dramatic seizure of 100,000 hostages at a pilgrimage site that affects Muslims around the world?",
        "Well, first of all, this was the age before Al-Jazeera, before cable television, before satellite films, and non-Muslims are forbidden from even visiting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.",
        "So the outside world didn't really know what was going on for well over a day after this started."

        "Saudi Arabia instantly cut international phone communications, closed the borders.",
        "And the first news of something going wrong in Mecca came out in a press statement at the State Department in Washington, infuriating the Saudis who had hoped that the blackout of this news would last long enough for them to take control of the mosque again.",
        "Now, at the time, nobody knew about the existence of this Sunni jihadi fundamentalist ideology that later evolved into what is known today as al-Qaida.",
        "In fact, the assumption in Washington at the time was that the Shiites, the Iranian Shiites, had taken over the mosque and is also part of the Iranian revolutionary expansion to the rest of the Muslim world.",

        "Well, then, just in case that wasn't understood, it was restated and put in cement in the 10th Amendment.",
        "So initially, we shouldn't even have the federal government involved in education.",
        "But secondly, when the state of Utah was applying for statehood in the late 1890s, they had to meet certain requirements that all other states had had to meet when they came into the union, including having a proposed constitution.",
        "Now Utah had to have, like the other states did, several things in that proposed constitution that they all had in common, and one of those things was a plan for educating the citizens of their own state.",
        "There was this fear with the federal government that the new states would come into the union and expect the federal government to take care of their needs, including their education.",
        "So Utah had to have a plan for educating their own citizens in their proposed constitution, which it had.",
        "And then when it met all of the requirements for statehood, Congress issued what was called the Statehood Enabling Act, or a law creating the state of Utah.",
        "And part of that Enabling Act addresses schools and colleges and says--and I'm quoting here--\"\"The schools and colleges provided for in this act shall forever remain under the exclusive control of the said state of Utah.",

        "And so like a strict constructionalist, you look at that law and you say the federal government has no business involving itself in Utah.",

        "Well, I need to go a little further than that.",
        "You know, in the",
        "1980s, when the Congress created the Department of Education, that was created under Public Law 96 def.",
        "88.",
        "And that law says that the establishment of the Department of Education shall not increase the authority of the federal government over education or diminish the responsibility for education, which is reserved to the states.",
        "And that was in the 1980s when, you know, the Department of Education was created.",
        "So we have quite a standard here, starting with the United States Constitution, with the Utah Constitution, with the Utah Enabling Act and with the congressional language that created the Department of Education that restates over and over and over again that education is a states' rights issue.",
        "And again, are you ready to send the check back to Washington?",
        "The bill is not written for that.",
        "You're probably remembering that two years ago, Utah had a bill, and it was the No Child Left Behind opt-out bill.",
        "Right.",
        "And I started with that issue, and I thought it was a good idea then, and we weren't sure exactly what the consequences of it would be.",
        "There were a number of officials from Washington, DC, that came to let us know that not only would we lose the money, the Title I money directed under No Child Left Behind, but they had a whole list of other monies that would be withheld from Utah.",
        "Keep in mind that the monies that came to the state from the federal government are monies that are taxed away from the state and then returned with strings attached.",
        "And the bill this year is not as strong as the opt-out bill.",
        "It's written in such a way so we do not jeopardize any of that funding.",
        "And, in fact, the law that Governor Huntsman signed yesterday even quotes passages from No Child Left Behind to explain and justify everything we're doing and to assure that we do not lose what little funding we do get from the federal government.",
        "Well, again, if your problem is with federal interference with education, surely federal money is the poison pill.",
        "Why don't you just send it back?",
        "That would be my preference.",
        "I'm also working under the reality of needing to have the support of 103 other members of the Utah Legislature.",
        "And, frankly, I have the support of over 100 of them.",
        "Well, we unanimously passed this bill during the session, and this year in the special session, when it--it unanimously passed the House and it unanimously passed the Senate in the first vote.",
        "Before the final vote was taken, it was put on hold for special session.",
        "And when it passed in the special session last month, there were only 10 negative votes.",
        "So basically what we're saying in the bill is `We are going to focus our resources and our efforts towards Utah goals, and we will accommodate the federal law as needed to get back whatever monies we can.'"
