        "Early last week, news outlets went into overdrive when they learned that Rolling Stone magazine was about to publish an explosive article about General Stanley McChrystal's exceedingly candid comments about the Obama administration's national security team.",
        "That story, of course, led to General McChrystal's resignation.",
        "However, for several hours, readers had a very hard time finding the actual article that sparked all the ruckus.",
        "Rolling Stone had yet to put the story online when the news broke.",
        "So at least two news organizations took it upon themselves to post a full pdf file of the piece called \"\"The Runaway General\"\" without Rolling Stone's permission.",
        "Was that a necessary act in the name of news gathering?",
        "Or was it copyright infringement, plain and simple?",
        "For answers we turned to Bill Grueskin.",
        "He's the dean of academic affairs at Columbia Journalism school, and he's the former managing editor of the Wall Street Journal online.",
        "Welcome to the program, Mr. Grueskin.",
        "Hi, thank you.",
        "Now, the republishing of the McChrystal article is a very high profile example of something that seems to happen every day.",
        "Internet sites regularly aggregate or curate content that's been published by others.",
        "But in this case, the content had not been officially published yet.",
        "So, did the sites that posted the pdf of that article, Time and Politico, those sites, did they cross a line by making it available?",
        "I think they crossed the line in the same way that a bank robber who goes into a bank and takes money out of the cashier's drawer crosses a line.",
        "Now, you know, there are some people who fall on a different side of the table in this debate.",
        "There are some that basically celebrate if someone picks up or, in this case, steals some of their content, if indeed they link back to them, because that's a way to drive traffic back to their site.",
        "If these two organizations had pulled the pdf and had provided some sort of link, would that have made this the kind of thing that would pass muster?",
        "Yes.",
        "I think you're exactly on point there.",
        "I mean, that's the kind of the thing that happens a million times a day all over the Web.",
        "And I would imagine in retrospect Rolling Stone might've wished that theyd had an online version ready to go and already published at the time they sent advanced versions of this out to the Associated Press, which is how the story first got out."

        "Importantly, all participants used the exact same putter.",
        "And, you know, interestingly, our results showed that those who thought that it was a Nike putter on average needed significantly fewer putts to sink the golf ball.",
        "They just felt empowered with that Nike putter in hand, right?",
        "(Laughter) That's exactly right, David.",
        "Now, the interesting thing is that Germann and others find this is not just the case with physical activities.",
        "But it's also the case with mental activities.",
        "Volunteers in another experiment were asked to take a math test and given foam earplugs to block out sounds and distractions.",
        "The earplugs were all identical, but some were told they were 3M-brand earplugs.",
        "Volunteers who thought they got the brand-name earplugs expected to be less distracted.",
        "And they also ended up doing better on the math test.",
        "One interesting fact here, David, volunteers who used the brand-name products do not end up crediting the product when they do better at golf or math.",
        "They just take all the credit for themselves and say..."

        "The use of a strong-performance brand causes participants to feel better about themselves when undertaking a task, you know, have greater task-specific self-esteem.",
