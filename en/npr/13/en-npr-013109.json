        "Of course, The Wall Street Journal's a subscription site.",
        "We would often put those stories on the free part of the site.",
        "And we would encourage a lot of traffic back to The Wall Street Journal.",
        "We would also get our PR department working to make sure it was disseminated widely to a lot of other media outlets, always ensuring that at the end of the day people knew this was a story broken by The Wall Street Journal.",
        "What Rolling Stone has gotten out of this and this is important to keep in mind, is a huge boost to their names and their credibility.",

        "So, you're talking about details.",
        "He needs to give specific details.",
        "He needs to give specific details, but I think on that score, he will probably leave people wondering a little bit because he can't give so much detail that he gives away all the details of the strategy to the enemy.",
        "And one speech, Michele, is not enough.",
        "There has to be a very comprehensive roll-out strategy, both in the United States and abroad, that includes not only the president speaking many more times in many situations, but we know that later this week, we are going to have members of his administration testifying on Capitol Hill, that will be very important.",
        "I'm sure, they'll be speaking with editorial boards, getting validaters(ph) out there, op-eds in local and regional papers.",
