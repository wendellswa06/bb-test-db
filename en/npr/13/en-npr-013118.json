        "The incidents fuel the debate across Europe about the veil and the integration of Muslims in Western societies.",
        "We're going to spend the next few minutes exploring the origins of this custom and examine why the veil has become such a potent symbol.",
        "Modest attire is mandated by the Koran.",
        "Anthropologist Daniel Martin Varisco of Hofstra University has studied the veil's origins and says women covered up long before Islam.",
        "There are historical records of people who put - women who were from higher status categories, they would wear some sort of veil, some sort of covering, particularly of their face.",
        "We have that from ancient Assyrian records going back 1200 years before the Christian era, and there's pretty good evidence that, again, the elites were sometimes given this higher status in Iran through the Parthian Period, the Seleucid Period, right up to the Sasanian Empire, which was prior to Islam.",
        "Scholars believe the women in the prophet Muhammad's family covered themselves, and three or four generations later the practice spread more widely among all classes.",
        "Today, Varisco says, believers use the Koran as a guide.",
        "One of the most commonly cited Koranic passages is from a chapter called The Light, or Al-Noor, and particularly verses 30 and 31, where women are told to lower their gaze, not to look at someone with a desirous intent.",
        "And this comes exactly after a verse which told men to do the same thing.",
        "And they're to protect their private parts, which is talking about not engaging in illicit sexual activities.",
        "They're not to show off their adornment, except for that which is apparent, and most scholars say like your eyes, you need to see with that, your hands and your feet.",
        "So does that mean a headscarf or a full veil covering a woman's face?",
        "As all sacred scriptures, the Koran and even the statements of the prophet, is open to interpretation and has been hotly debated, that there is actually a tremendous amount of ink that has been spilled, we might say, over this issue or what people are supposed to wear.",
        "One of those who believes full veiling runs contrary to the Koran is Imam Sayed Moustafa Al-qazwini, an Iraqi born cleric in Orange County, California.",

        "In the West, the veil has its own connotations, according to Daniel Martin Varisco.",
        "The veil, like the issue of the harem, like the issue of polygamy, these are seen as signs that Islam is inferior to Christianity, that the people who live in this part of the world are backward, that they don't give women equal rights.",
        "Imam Qazwini acknowledges this custom does come out of a certain tradition.",
        "In some countries in Asia and the Middle East, since people live in a patriarch society, where the society is dominated by men, and therefore women are perceived as second class citizen and they are suppose to serve men, therefore they are also asked to cover their faces to avoid any negative temptations.",
        "Lately he's noticed Islamic dress adopted more widely in the West.",

        "And this is way its gained as much importance and significance.",
        "And in some countries it has become like a fashion, a fashionable trend, you know, especially among young people, the youth.",
        "So it is not only a matter of religion and faith; it's also a social, you know, a social consideration.",
        "I see that as an indicator that puritanical Islam is winning in this war of ideas in the Muslim world and that progressive interpretations of Islam is not winning the hearts and minds of Muslims.",
        "For me, that is frightening and something that causes me great concern and keeps me awake at night.",
        "Writer Asra Nomani believes the veil has become a political symbol, much like the Afro during the Black Power Movement of the '70's.",
        "And so while Muslims feel besieged and assaulted because of foreign policy, wars that are happening in the world, they can retreat to these symbols and find comfort and identity in them.",
        "And so what we have to think about, I think, as a society both on the side of the progressive Muslim world and the West, is how we can stop that alienation, you know, how it is that we can stop forcing folks to retreat into an identity that is pretty hardcore so that we can actually know each other and actually be interconnected."

        "Well, that's correct.",
        "I learned a long time ago when I was a young agent in the FBI, I learned an awfully lot from old time Texas sheriffs and people who had been in the law enforcement business.",

        "And using that over the years, I found that that worked very well for me.",
        "Obviously, there are differences of opinion as to techniques and interrogation, interviewing and so forth, but it depends on the individual in how he can make contact.",

        "And we went to them and laid out the scenario and said, this is what we think this guy can give us.",

        "And of course it was not an easy thing for them to put together but they did and provided the single cell.",
