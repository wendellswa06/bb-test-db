        "And let's get a caller on the line.",
        "This is Derek(ph), Derek with us from Madison in Wisconsin.",
        "Yes, hi.",
        "Charlie, it's great to hear to you talk.",
        "It's almost like having a conversation with my own father.",
        "He's a retired police detective.",
        "And even though I wasn't involved with that kind of work myself, I've learned a lot and the (unintelligible) rubbed off to me.",
        "A couple of interesting about my dad; he had a special knack for interrogations, in getting confessions.",
        "And he says, kind of - what he would say probably reflects what you said that, you know, it doesn't take a lot of drama and anything drastic.",
        "It's mostly conversational.",
        "And - but one thing that my father has a passion for in life that he's tried - he has a passion for, individually, to develop it and also to inspire other people to develop this passion.",
        "And that is that regardless of anybody's situation, to see dignity and have respect in them like humane dignity - regardless of what they've done.",
        "Because no one is beyond forgiveness, no one is beyond mercy.",
        "Nobody is beyond that - you know, people may actually be beyond ability to be rehabilitated in behaviors, but there is still - and the way that he would put it, from my own father's point of view, is that we all carry the spark of the divine.",
        "And you have to - not only does he try to develop his own ability to see that divine in others, he's very inspirational in helping to teach other people to do the same thing.",
        "And he approached criminals in the same way - you know, as he would approach a pastor or a church volunteer.",
        "They all have that same dignity absolutely and completely.",
        "And if you engage them on that level, you're going to, you know, you're going to be able to have their best interest in mind.",
        "And, you know, my dad still gets letters from guys who are sitting in prison in their friendly tone.",
        "They're like - they're almost trying to impress him like, hey, you know, I still got eight more years or whatever but, you know, I'm good - I'm on good behavior or I, you know, I've been promoted to a different level of, you know, different jobs I can do, et cetera.",
        "So, I really think that's been key to his success.",
        "Derek, thanks very much for that.",
        "I appreciate it.",
        "Well, I - if I might make a comment in that regard.",
        "He was certainly in the same sort of mode that I was.",
        "As a matter of fact, some prisoners that I've spoken to during their time, during incarceration, have been paroled now and there are a couple of them that I go out and have coffee and donuts with once in a while.",
        "In the end of the day, you started this project when Robert Browne was already in prison for the rest of his life, he is still there.",
        "What do you think you accomplished?",
        "I think our biggest accomplishment was the fact that he did provide details of unsolved murders - he would never use that word, he used the word cases - unsolved murders in various states and we were able to bring a degree closure to these families.",
        "There's no such thing as complete closure.",
        "From personal experience, my son-in-law was murdered when he interrupted a burglary in progress by three young gang bangers, and that was back in 1991 also.",
        "And, although there has been a lot of healing especially on my daughter's part, his wife, to this day we have not been able to resurrect Steven.",
        "I mean, he's…",
        "Sure.",
        "…he was killed and, yes, we know who did it and, yes, they're incarcerated and there is a certain amount of relief there, but it's never erased from your mind."

        "Charlie Hess, thanks very much.",
        "And by the way, are you working on any new cases?",

        "And there…",
        "And happens to be benched right now.",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, it was one the worst episodes of violence in the history of US sports, of course.",
        "Artest, certainly a character; off the court, he's almost universally described as having a heart of gold, but his issue has been his behavior on the court.",
        "He says he's learned his lesson, which cost him about $5 million in salary.",
        "David Stern said hello to him last night before their game in Miami.",
        "Artest responded that Stern's `a cool cat; I think he's from the hood.",
        "And Artest seemed no worse the wear.",
        "He scored 22 points; Indiana beat Miami.",
        "Also back in the game is Phil Jackson, who's always well-dressed, the coach of the Los Angeles Lakers.",
        "Well, he's trying to win a record-tying 10th NBA championship as a coach, but he's not likely to do it with the young team that he's got in Los Angeles.",
        "The Lakers are led by Kobe Bryant, who clashed with Jackson when he used to coach the team.",
        "Like Artest, Bryant is trying to make up with marketers and fans and get them to forget the past.",
        "In Bryant's case, it was allegation of sexual assault.",
        "The big mystery in LA, of course, is why Jackson came back.",
        "Ten million bucks a year for three years no doubt influenced him, but more likely, he loves the game, he loves LA, he dates the owner's daughter and maybe he wants to show that he can coach a team to a championship without a roster of stars.",
        "Well, like the National Football League, the NBA has a vagabond team that used to play in New Orleans, but was forced to relocated after Hurricane Katrina.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The New Orleans Hornets are now officially known as the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets.",
        "Not exactly what you think of as a big-league city; the 45th TV market in the country.",
        "It's only had minor-league teams, but the city and its fans are showing the love.",
        "Nineteen thousand people turned up for the team's opener on Tuesday; that's 5,000 more than the Hornets averaged in New Orleans last year.",
        "The Hornets are going to play 35 games in Oklahoma City, a half-dozen in Baton Rouge.",
        "They have an option to play in Oklahoma City a second season, and Stern said this week that he'd like a decision by early 2006.",
        "I wouldn't be surprised if, like football's New Orleans Saints, the Hornets think about moving permanently.",
        "Another new twist in the NBA this season: an official minor league, much like baseball.",
        "Stefan, tell us about that.",
        "Well, the NBA revamped its struggling Development League.",
        "It cut the number of teams to eight, and the big change is that NBA clubs for the first time can assign players to an affiliate team.",
        "And the first two players sent down today were Dwayne Jones and Bracey Wright of the Minnesota Timberwolves.",
        "Each NBA team can send down two or three players.",
        "There are some restrictions, so don't expect to see Kobe Bryant playing for the Albuquerque Thunderbirds if he starts struggling.",
        "This is a great move for the NBA, especially because it'll get inexperienced players--and there are a lot of them on NBA rosters--playing time."

        "And suddenly he had changed his tune, he was well, this is nothing but sports, and we just want to keep it to sports.",
        "And to me, once again, it reinforces this whole idea of here you've got this team of multi-millionaires led by LeBron and Kobe, and these guys basically were intimidated.",

        "So yeah, sports is very political by definition, and by the absence of it.",

        "It's just unfortunate that he came to be archbishop at the time when the communion was being driven apart by issues of human sexuality.",
