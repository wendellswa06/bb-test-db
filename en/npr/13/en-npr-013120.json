        "The tragedy of Rowan Williams is that he's a man of enormous gifts, gifts that the world and the church have both failed and not been able to appreciate because of the schismatic battles within its own church.",
        "And, it has to be said, because of the way he's dealt with his battle.",

        "Tennessee House Member Jim Cooper says the real issue is a system bent on telling consumers more is better.",
        "The message of our medical system has been to sell, sell, sell, buy, buy, buy.",
        "And the real message should be: What's really going to help me live longer and healthier?",
        "And with the fee-for-service model for health care, Cooper says doctors have little reason to discourage the demand for more and more health procedures.",
        "I liken fee-for-service medicine to the situation, if we paid lawyers by the word, or by the paragraph, we would have the longest legal documents in the world.",

        "Other lawmakers though say incentives for cutting health care costs should be directed more to the patients themselves.",
        "Wyoming Republican Senator John Barrasso is also an orthopedic surgeon.",
        "I don't see anything in this legislation that actually goes and gives incentives to individual people to stay and live a healthy life, nothing that's aimed at helping people individually and is giving incentive to that person to eat less, exercise more and quit smoking.",
        "Even outside experts say that while the health care payment system encourages waste, it's not clear what the fix is.",
        "I think the truth of the matter is we don't know exactly what would be the best way to reform payments."

        "And while she loves them, she says electric cars were vulnerable even before this administration.",
        "Electric cars are still heavily dependent on external regulation.",
        "And therefore, most car companies are still offering very few numbers, limited capacity and range and all of those things and not even nationwide.",
        "This is while Americans are ever more infatuated by trucks and SUVs.",
        "The regulations Sexton is talking about include CO2 emission rules in Europe, their rebates from federal and state governments, but most aggressively, the Obama administration's goal of getting the fleet above 50 miles per gallon.",
        "The Auto Alliance, the main industry group, wrote to the Environmental Protection Agency's Administrator Scott Pruitt upon his confirmation asking the agency to reverse the rules.",
        "Essentially, the car company said, why make us build electric cars when less than 4 percent of cars sold are electric?",
