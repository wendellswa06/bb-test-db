        "They realized that entropy had to do with the microscopic motions of atoms and molecules and, phrased in modern terms, the formulas they came up to describe it meant that entropy was the number of bits, bits of information required to describe the motions of these atoms and molecules.",
        "And then Boltzmann went and constructed his equation, called Boltzmann's Equation, which is--actually describes how those bits flip when molecules and atoms collide.",
        "So the universe is computing, it's storing information in the microscopic motions of everything--the vibrations of the air, the vibrations of radio waves--and every time those vibrations change or those bits flip, the universe is computing.",

        "And if you talk to them very nicely, and ask them very politely, essentially by shining radio waves on them, you can get those bits to flip and to perform computations.",

        "And in a conventional computer like yours, a bit can be stored by say, pouring a bunch of electrons into a bucket for electrons called a capacitor.",
