        "So your computer works by moving electrons around.",
        "Now, a quantum computer can work by moving electrons around too.",
        "So imagine I have a bit which is a single electron.",
        "So single electron over here on the capacitor, that's called a one--and a single electron over there off the capacitor, we'll call that a zero.",
        "So far that's not so strange, it's just taking the ordinary notion of how a bit's stored in electronic computer and miniaturizing it down to the level of a single electron.",
        "But the funky happens next, because quantum mechanics is weird.",
        "That's a technical term, it means weird.",
        "It means very funky.",
        "If quantum mechanics were a singer it would be James Brown.",
        "Quantum mechanics is the James Brown of sciences let's say.",
        "It's very counterintuitive and strange and one of the central counterintuitive features is that an electron can be both here and there at the same time.",
        "So if the electron is over here and that's one, and the electron over there is zero, then electron here and there at the same time, in some funky quantum mechanical sense, that's a bit that registers zero and one at the same time; a so-called quantum bit, or q-bit.",
        "Now how do you make use of that if you don't know which one it is?",
        "I mean, don't we have to know one or zeros to store things in a conventional sense.",
        "Brian, thank you very much.",
        "If only life were so certain, Ira that would be great.",
        "In fact, sometimes not knowing what's going on is helpful.",
        "I certainly find that in my own research.",
        "And quantum computers use that in a very simply but nice way, but still counterintuitive, to do things classical computers can't.",
        "And a good way to think of this is to imagine what does a bit mean?",
        "So a bit on its own doesn't mean anything, zero, one, yes or no. It depends on what it does.",
        "So, for instance, a bit in a computer say one, could tell the computer add two plus two.",
        "Or zero could tell the computer to add three plus one.",
        "A bit is an instruction in a computer, and if you take a quantum computer and you feed in this funky quantum bit, this q-bit that reads zero and one at the same time, then it instructs the quantum computer to do this and to do that at the same time.",
        "Say to add two plus two and to add three plus one at the same time.",
        "That's something no classical computer could ever do.",
        "But can you actually make it do that for you if you're not sure what, you know, what the states of these things are.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "In fact, with colleagues at MIT like Dave Corry and I.",
        "Chuang(ph), and at Cal-Tech, Jeff Kimball, a group at NEC and SCUBA in Japan; we've actually built very simple quantum computers performed computations where the computer is doing this and that at the same time.",
        "In fact it's doing this, that, and the other thing too.",
        "Is that was gives it its power, the ability to do all these things at the same time?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "This kind of quantum multitasking which--let me tell you when I became an assistant professor at MIT, my wife was a professor at BU and we had two kids at the same time, I learned a lot about the virtues of multitasking.",
        "Quantum multitasking is very powerful because the ability to do many things at once allows the quantum computer to explore many, many, many more possibilities than any classical computer could."

        "And so when might we have a quantum computer on your desktop, instead of my Mac or PC?",
        "Well if you are willing to reinforce your desktop, we could put one on it right now.",
        "If you look at these--you pick up one of these--well, it's hard to pick up one of these nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopers, these quantum computers that we have over at MIT.",
        "They look like a giant beer keg cooled with liquid helium to cool the superconductor(ph) magnets(ph) in them.",
        "And snaking out of them are wires that connect us to about a million dollars of electronics.",
        "But, in fact, because there are many different ways of building quantum computers, and because they're getting more powerful all the time, and the technologies for miniaturizing the components--just like the technologies for miniaturizing components of regular computers, are advancing--well, you might be able to get one on your desktop in a decade or two--as long as you don't mind it doing many things at once, rather than one thing.",
        "Well, yes.",
        "We're all multi-taskers.",
        "You say in your book that quantum computers then represent the ultimate level of miniaturization.",
        "That's right.",

        "Like, for instance, with the famous Moore's Law, in which the components of electronic computers get smaller by a factor of two every year-and-a-half or so--how far can that go?",
        "How miniaturized could bits become?",
        "And I found that quantum computers actually are storing and processing information at the ultimate limits allowed by quantum mechanics.",

        "I had a question about the whole concept of quantum computing for intractable problems that are common in computer science.",

        "Well, one example is the difficulty in handling or calculating cryptography, or encrypted messages, which is the basis of a lot of national security and stuff like that.",

        "Right.",

        "Seth, what do you think?",
        "Could we use quantum computers for, you know, breaking those codes?",
        "Well, Kevin, you're exactly right that breaking, code-breaking is the killer app of quantum computation.",
        "With a relatively small quantum computer with a few tens of thousands or hundred thousands of Q-bits(ph) able to form a few billion operations or ops--which is, you know, peanuts for an ordinary computer--you would be able to break all the public key codes that are used, for instance, to send information securely over the Internet.",

        "Luckily, before you decide that you're not going to buy your coffee over the Internet anymore, quantum mechanics actually supplies a solution to this problem because if you store bits of information on integral(ph) quanta, you can actually distribute information in a way which is provably secure--or at least it's guaranteed by the laws of physics themselves.",
        "So in order to break these codes, you'd have to mess around or discover new laws of physics.",
        "This technique is called quantum cryptography.",
        "So quantum computers not only create problems, at least for the NSA--though I like to think of breaking codes as solving problems--they also provide technological solutions that will allow us, the world, to continue.",

        "And indeed, we already have some quantum computers out there doing this particular application that are many, many times more powerful than any classical super computer is now or could ever be--is to understand how the universe works at its basic and most fundamental scales.",
