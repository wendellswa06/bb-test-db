        "Yes.",
        "Well, you know…",
        "That's the quantum world, isn't it?",
        "Thank you.",
        "…yes, that's the quantum world, and it's a computing world, too.",
        "You know, one of the great features of computers is that they can simulate each other.",
        "And this is very familiar.",
        "You can get a version of Word that runs on a PC and you can get a version of Word that runs on a Mac.",
        "Any program that runs on one computer can be translated to run on another computer.",
        "So computers can effectively simulate each other's actions.",
        "And when I say the universe is a giant quantum computer, on the one hand I'm speaking completely literally because, as I mentioned earlier, its been known for really almost a century and a half, that every little tiny piece of the universe is storing bits of information.",
        "And every time two pieces or elementary particles collide, those bits flip.",
        "So, the fact that the universe computes, has actually been known for a long time.",
        "But the fact that it can be used to, say, build a universe or quantum computer, or the fact that it itself is a universal computer, is something that people have only begun thinking about over the last few decades.",
        "And it has some remarkable and interesting consequences.",
        "Give me one of them."

        "You're doing very well.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "I thought you were just going to go ahead and, you know, you were on a roll there, so…",
        "Ira, every other time I've been on this show, you peppered me with these great questions and told all these great jokes.",
        "So I was worried, I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell any.",
        "So, okay.",
        "So, one of the consequences that, you know, quantum computers allow us to understand: the weird and funky nature of quantum mechanics.",
        "They are essentially little laboratories that allow us to create quantum weirdness and explore its features.",
        "Like, we're looking into the possibilities of, for instance, teleporting a rubidium atom from one place to another, using a strange quantum phenomenon called entanglement.",
        "So that's a nice feature of quantum computers.",
        "They're a laboratory for exploring quantum weirdness in the universe.",
        "And we've…",
        "That's one of my favorite subjects is entanglement.",
        "I know you like quantum weirdness, Ira.",
        "We're--and I do, too.",
        "It's so spooky at a distance.",
        "You know, it's so hard to believe that, you know, you entangle two particles and they never separate or… You can separate them any distance--you know, we talked about people actually carry them across rivers, now--but they could be on the other side of the universe.",
        "And if something instantaneous happens to them, they influence each other instantaneously, right?",
        "Well, Ira, I have to share with you a discovery I made since we last talked about quantum weirdness--this apparent spooky action at distance that Einstein called it."

        "So I recently, together with some other researchers, found that you could use this spooky action at a distance, this funny quantum entanglement, to escape from black holes--assuming you happen to find yourself caught in one.",
        "I'm glad to hear that.",
        "Yes, so in fact, if you have this funky entanglement between the inside and outside of a black hole--which you do because Stephen Hawking showed decades ago, that black holes radiate--and, in fact, this radiation that comes out of a black hole is entangled with what's going on inside the black hole.",
        "Under the right conditions, something that falls into the black hole--a spaceship or my TV set or, indeed, I've had several computers that ended their lives as black holes--what falls into the black hole might, in fact, be able to escape in a transformed form.",
        "So you might, in fact--you might even be able to use a black hole itself as a computer if you could figure out the right way to program that.",
        "Yes, but can the geeks fix it is the…",
        "Yes.",
        "And also, let me say that as this theory has not been tried out in practice, I feel obliged to warn the radio audience not to try this at home yet.",
        "Do not jump into a black hole just now.",
        "We can't guarantee the results.",
        "Yes.",
        "Black holes are intimately connected with entanglement.",
        "And, in fact, this process of escape from a black hole, if it does work, works by a process akin to quantum teleportation--as on Star Trek, where, well, in fact this is something that could easily happen on Star Trek--Kirk is teleported, falls into a black hole, and teleports out at the last moment, before he hits the singularity.",
        "Wow.",

        "Oh…well, I don't know.",

        "You know, after you've talked with atoms for awhile and get on their wavelength and learn to listen to what they're saying back.",
        "Well, what they're saying has a certain strange and unearthly poetry of its own.",
        "And, indeed, you might imagine trying to use a quantum computer to compose a poem that says many things at once.",
        "Except, in fact, poetry often does that.",

        "That's right.",

        "Oh absolutely.",
        "But I just hope we don't end up being the same old people with this great new thing that we can do.",
        "Yeah, how would we look at ourselves differently?",
        "That's a good question.",
        "If we do ever, you know, get to the point where quantum computers are common, what kind of different view of the universe would we have, and how would it affect our daily lives?",
        "Can you speculate on that, Seth?",
        "Yeah, that's a good question.",
        "You mean apart from being able to get on eBay and buy used ski boots and things like that?",
        "Public key cryptography?"
