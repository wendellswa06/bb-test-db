        "This, from a piece by Jim Litke in the Associated Press.",
        "Joe Paterno had barely hung up on the phone when his wife of 50 years picked it up and redialed the number scrawled on the slip of paper.",
        "After 61 years, Sue Paterno said to the man who just fired her husband, he deserved better.",
        "We'll skip down a few paragraphs - yes, he did, Jim Litke continues.",
        "And there may be no more fitting postscript for the life and career of a football coach, husband and father who became not just the face but the unyielding, cantankerous soul of a school that over the course of his tenure, was transformed from a cow college into a top-shelf, public research university.",
        "Now, all those people who rushed to judgment about Paterno's role in the Sandusky case will have to find their way out from under the sordid scandal without the longtime coach.",
        "Paterno, 85, died yesterday of lung cancer.",
        "Those who knew him well believe it was something more akin to a broken heart.",
        "His legacy will be forever clouded, in large part because the chance to prove his remorse in the final chapter of his public life was taken by the trustees, and is now gone forever.",
        "For the lion's share of his 85 years, though, Paterno piled one good deed on top of another that had nothing to do with football; things that time can't erase - like the library that sits several blocks from the football stadium and was built, in large part, with his donations back to the school.",
        "On balance, all that good should have been enough to earn him one, final opportunity to erase the stain that he called one of the great tragedies of his life.",
        "He deserved better.",
        "Let's go next to Michael, and Mike's on the line from Portland.",
        "Hi, there.",
        "Thank you for taking my call.",
        "I just wanted to utilize him as an example of somebody who may have done a lot of good in his life, someone who may have accomplished a lot, can still make an extreme error in judgment that could have potentially caused a tremendous amount of harm.",
        "So a teachable moment.",
        "Yes.",
        "All right.",
        "Michael, thanks very much.",

        "This is from a piece on si.com by Stewart Mandel, remembering Joe Paterno: Though he wouldn't say so openly, Paterno had long feared suffering the same fate as Bear Bryant, the revered Alabama coach who died of a heart attack four weeks after coaching his last game.",
        "Eerily, Thursday's the 30th anniversary of Bryant's death.",
        "Paterno couldn't imagine life without football.",
        "When he was finally confronted with that dreaded reality, it was not of his own volition.",
        "So an 85-year-old man found himself grappling with his unexpected professional demise while also fighting something as unmerciful as lung cancer.",
        "Whether you rooted for him or hated him, admired him or detested him, you can surely see the sadness and the self-wrought tragedy of Paterno's final days.",
        "One of the perks of becoming an idol is achieving historic immortality, but Paterno was never more human than during the final 11 weeks of his life.",
        "And let's go next to Paul, Paul with us from Black Mountain in North Carolina.",
        "Hi, Neal.",
        "So you did a good segue because what I - my comment is, basically, this is a tragedy.",
        "And the thing about a tragedy, and a tragic figure, is that they're caught up in forces that are far bigger and far beyond their control.",
        "And the question about this tragedy is: What is the tragedy of it?",
        "And I would like to say that in my opinion, this is an incident that shows that there's something amiss in how we finance, and how we support, higher education in this country - when football and the reputation of a football team, etc., becomes something that could cause all of these lapses of judgment.",
        "And so it's not really about Joe Paterno.",
        "It's about our values being kind of misplaced.",
        "And I'm not saying - I mean, I basically think that this could be mitigated a lot if we had a better way of financing public higher education.",

        "Thanks for the call, Paul.",
        "This along the same lines from a piece on espn.com by Howard Bryant, who, of course, also appears Saturday morning sometimes with Scott Simon.",
        "(Reading) Despite the urge, Paterno's death should not be used as an opportunity to massage and soften the events that led to his downfall, for it's possible to mourn his passing without rewriting the truths that are known.",
        "The truth that his passing should also mark the end of college sports coaching dynasty.",
        "For all the victories and championships, the recruiting coups and runaway revenues, it cannot be understated that his death stands enshrouded in bittersweet contradictions because of the dynasty he was allowed to build.",
        "Paterno had too much power, with not nearly enough oversight.",
        "He was bigger than the school, and the school towered to - cowered to him.",
        "Paterno gave millions back to Penn State, and as his power grew and grew unchecked over four decades, the university lost the ability to control whether he was benevolent or a tyrant.",
        "It was not a power particularly special to Paterno, but to his industry.",
        "The entire culture of the coach deserves deconstruction and revision, for the same can be said, in varying degrees, of Bryant and Knight, Bowden and Calhoun, Krzyzewski and Boeheim.",

        "He reported it to the people who had jurisdiction over the situation, and then he let it go and let the chips where they - you know, they had to fall where they had to fall without him coming on either side of it, because he realized all the things that the reporter just wrote, that he was, in many ways, you know, Penn State.",
