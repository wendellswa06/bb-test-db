        "If we're going to prevent large parts of this Earth from becoming not only inhospitable but uninhabitable in our lifetimes, we're going to have to keep some fossil fuels in the ground rather than burn them and release more dangerous pollution into the sky.",

        "In Kentucky, these regulations would likely mean fewer jobs, shuttered power plants, higher electricity cost for families and businesses.",
        "The power plants rules were drafted under the decades-old Clean Air Act, which critics say was never intended to regulate greenhouse gases.",
        "The Supreme Court disagreed, but opponents have filed numerous lawsuits challenging the rules.",

        "That's why any agreement in Paris will not take the shape of a treaty so it doesn't require Senate ratification.",
