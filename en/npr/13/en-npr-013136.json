        "And many of them were, in fact, released.",
        "It's a touchy situation, though.",
        "Even though the US officials knew that these abductions were going on, they continued to cooperate with the very units involved in the abductions and see them as their closest allies in fighting an insurgency in Kirkuk.",

        "There were 30 people in that cell.",
        "It was actually fluctuated from 45 to 55.",
        "And he described a situation in there where they had to alternate in shifts in order to just get through the day.",
        "In other words, half the inmates would sit cross-legged for three hours.",
        "The other half of the inmates would lay down and try to sleep.",
        "They would both take three hours doing it one way, three hours doing it the other throughout the day.",

        "There was an effort by Saddam Hussein's government to change the demography of Kirkuk, to make it a majority Arab city.",
        "After the fall of Saddam Hussein, Kurds started returning to the city, and there's been a real effort by the Kurdish parties to try to create a Kurdish majority within the city.",
        "They see it as part of Kurdistan and want it as part of Kurdistan in northern Iraq.",
        "Arab and Turkoman are obviously fighting that, and they've created an alliance together to try to keep Kirkuk under the control of the central government in Baghdad.",
        "Anthony Shadid, thanks very much."
