        "After a lot of public outcry, yesterday the Border Patrol relocated most of those kids from those barren and squalid conditions to other government facilities.",

        "They were inside of holding cells in a Border Patrol station in little town of Clint, just outside El Paso.",
        "Three hundred and fifty kids in a space with a capacity for 104, sleeping on concrete floors, no soap, no showers.",
        "Some have the flu.",

        "So what happened?",
        "Exactly.",
        "The Border Patrol said what they'd been saying for months basically - they operate short-term holding facilities designed for grown-ups, not for these vulnerable populations of children.",
        "And they point fingers at Health and Human Services, which is the agency that's supposed to take custody of immigrant children within those 72 hours.",
        "But HHS has the same problem.",
        "They say their shelter system is overtaxed, and they can be slow to accept more kids.",

        "And they say those kids should have been allowed to stay with their relatives.",

        "And the government's justification for that is that they say they're trying to prevent child trafficking, right?",

        "The incidents that kind of form the center of your book were the two lynchings that took place in the Eastern Shore in the 1930s, the last recorded lynchings in Maryland.",
        "You also pointed out that the James Byrd lynching in 1998, the last recorded lynching in the United States.",
        "But that was three hocked-up, you know, drugged out guys.",
        "They were swiftly arrested, put through the system of justice, sentenced to death.",
        "And before that, the last recorded lynching was in 1981, the Michael Donald case in Georgia.",
        "The reason I say that is that those things ended long ago.",

        "My experience, for example, of talking to people who were children when lynchings happened and saw part of the lynching, I think there are white children who have never been able to talk about these events - that the silence came down and it came down hard and heavy in their families and in their communities.",
        "And they are now elderly and they need to process these events and to figure out how to reconcile themselves with their family members and what they saw happen.",

        "And then there are other simply who live in the community who also know that these subjects have been taboo, and they have information to share.",
