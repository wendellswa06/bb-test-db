        "In the mid-1980s, Polly Stewart was folklorist and she researched cases of lynching that had taken place in parts of Maryland's Eastern Shore during the '30s as an associate professor at what was then called Salisbury State College, which is now Salisbury University.",
        "Polly Stewart developed a talk for the local historical society.",
        "And as I understand it, Professor Stewart, it was a very painful experience for you.",
        "Yeah, it was painful.",
        "I had been there for 10 years already teaching at Salisbury and I knew practically everybody in the room.",
        "The (unintelligible) Historical Society is composed of white civic leaders and people who have been there for many generations, and it was an honor to be asked to give the keynote address.",
        "In Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan, the Taliban is getting stronger and stronger.",
        "This week in Kabul, some 700 tribal elders and officials from both countries are trying to come up with an agreement on how to deal with the Taliban.",
        "One problem: the leader of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf, didn't show up today.",
        "(Speaking Spanish).",
        "And so I thought that because I was in a position of prestige at the university, or the college then, and because I was socially friendly with a lot of this people, I would be able to present to them some theory which would explain why the lynchings had happened.",
        "And the result of it was not at all what I expected.",
        "I thought they - I just didn't know what would happen.",
        "But what did happen was that I was attacked.",
        "They were furious with me.",
        "They were in flames.",
        "They were just shaking with rage, some of them.",
        "Did they even…",
        "And…",
        "Had most of these people known that these lynchings took place?",
        "Was this new news to people?",
        "Oh, everyone knows.",
        "No, there's nothing - as has been discussed before, these are things that are known but not discussed.",
        "And I agree completely with Sherrilyn that these are extremely toxic and they prevent people from growing and they prevent communities from being whole.",
        "And I actually had it in my own mind that if there could be some plausible and reasonable explanation for why these things had happened, people might be able to change their minds about things.",
        "But the result of it was really that I was iced out of the upper crust for the next 20 years.",
        "I was there for 30 years and 20 of those years I was - my name was mud."

        "What was the source of their anger?",
        "They actually - it just replicated the theory I was trying to help them understand, and that is that outsiders are not welcome inside communities.",
        "And one thing I love about Dr. Ifill's book is that it explains so beautifully why people are unwilling to talk.",
        "Because there is a great deal of underneath confusion, guilt, fear, just a whole lot of things that are terrifying to people.",
        "And they would rather not talk about it and they'll do anything they can to silence it.",
        "But I think that it has to be talked about.",

        "Well, I do believe that people undergo change in their minds.",
        "When new information is presented, it takes time.",
        "But I think the people are willing, and I believe that the change in the world helps people of goodwill to change their thinking.",
        "Professor Ifill, what do you make of Polly Stewart's experience?",
        "And what, in your view, would help people talk about this?",
        "One of the things I try to advance in the book is that the conversations that we have to have about race are multiple.",
        "There's not one conversation.",
        "And some of those conversations are interracial.",
        "That is, within the white community there is silence, there are taboos that have to be addressed.",
        "There are conversations that have to happen within the black community.",
        "So I think we have to open up our whole idea about what our conversations about race would look like.",
        "What are some of the steps communities can take to advance this kind of reconciliation?",
        "Like, for example, the Virginia General Assembly just passed an apology for slavery, which is obviously very passionately discussed.",
        "Do you think things like that matter, or should they…",
        "I think they do.",
        "…be more local than that?",
        "Well, I think they do because they open up and they begin that conversation.",
        "They get people to talk about and to debate, even vigorously, you know, their views.",
        "And then you have to go to the next step and you have to say kind of why do we have these views."

        "The problem is that sometimes when we do these things, we pass this piece of legislation, for example, the Senate's apology on lynching several years ago, and then that's the end of the discussion.",
        "These kinds of initiative should be the beginning of the discussion.",
        "What about those who argue that the more time you spend living in the past, the less time you spend looking toward the future?",
        "It's because the wall of silence fell and has been maintained so perfectly that we have to have these conversations.",
        "This is not something that we've talked out and now we're revisiting it.",
        "We've never been able to confront in any comprehensive way the history of lynching in this country and the widespread complicity in that history of lynching.",
        "I wanted to get one final thought from Professor Polly Stewart.",
        "Professor Stewart, do you envision the possibility that you're former community - I know you've retired and moved away from Salisbury, Maryland - do you think it might be possible for you, these many years later, to go back and give that talk again and the reaction might be different?",
        "I'm not sure whether I'm in the same place.",
        "I do think that it would be possible for me to go back.",
        "But I also think that it's - I believe that the impetus to change will come from within.",
        "And I don't think that rubbing salt in the painful wounds of my white friends in Salisbury is going to help them at all; maybe it will, it would.",

        "And Soraya, why is this meeting important if Pervez Musharraf isn't there?",
        "Well, the main purpose is to get these 700 people together - basically a grass roots approach - to try and figure out if there's a way to get rid of the Taliban without having to do military intervention.",
        "In other words, the feeling is that if you get the people on the ground to sort of all agree about rejecting the Taliban and not providing them safe haven, then perhaps this problem goes away.",
        "And today was the first day of this meeting; it's called the jirga.",
        "What happened?",
        "Well, it's more that what didn't happen that was making the news initially.",
        "As you mentioned, President Musharraf did not show up.",
        "And he was considered key to this approach because certainly on the Afghan side the feeling is that the Pakistanis are not serious about addressing this issue, that somehow it's in their interest to have an unstable Afghanistan.",
        "And so the feeling is that this is really a last chance to come up with something concrete on the ground that can actually deal with the Taliban and perhaps put an end or at least reverse some of the things that the Afghan president Karzai was speaking about.",
        "For example, 250,000 Afghan children not being able to go to school in the south because of the Taliban presence.",
        "A woman being nailed to the tree by the Taliban was another incident that he mentioned.",
        "And more importantly, the issue of the 22 Korean hostages at the moment, most of whom are women.",
        "President Karzai said that he didn't feel that any Afghan Taliban or Waziristan Taliban, in other words right on the other side of the border - these are tribes that are related to each other and even though they are on different sides of the border.",
        "And his - the implication there was that this is coming from somewhere else.",
        "And so the feeling is if on both sides of the border people reject the Taliban and don't provide them safe haven, that in fact there could be move towards peace here and move towards security.",
        "So it sounds like there are a lot of issues to discuss, and it sounds like President Musharraf would need to weigh in on these.",
        "What was the official and the unofficial reason for why he wasn't there?",
        "Well, officially it was listed as pressing engagements that he - that kept him from coming, and this was reiterated today by the Pakistani prime minister.",
        "But unofficially, and certainly what made the news today, was the discussion that President Musharraf was having with his advisers about whether to declare a state of emergency in Pakistan to get insurgents under control.",
        "Basically that would eliminate democratic institutions; it would give the president the power to shut down parliament, to prevent free speech, and that sort of thing.",
        "And so the feeling was maybe that's why he was not coming to Afghanistan today.",
        "But then there's a third issue, which is the fact that there's been a lot of growing U.S.",
        "criticism, both by Democratic presidential contenders, as well as by the administration, that perhaps Pakistan is not acting strongly enough when it comes to the Taliban and when it comes to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida.",
        "And so the feeling was maybe Musharraf was sort of making a protest by not showing up.",
        "A protest to the United States?"
