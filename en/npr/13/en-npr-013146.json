        "Well, now, knowing what you do about South Korea and trends there, does it surprise you at all that it would produce a couple of dozen evangelicals who would be doing this kind of work in Afghanistan?",
        "Well, no. Unfortunately, it doesn't, because Korea is second in the world in terms of the number of missionaries that are sent overseas only to the United States, and actually I get proselytized.",
        "I get asked, do you believe in God, more by Koreans and more in Korea than I do when I'm in the United States.",
        "So there's a very large, you know, millions of Koreans who are very strong believers in Christianity.",
        "And when you say sending people overseas, missionaries overseas, we're talking about all around the world?",
        "That's right.",
        "They're in, I believe, more than 150 countries.",
        "In some ways among the more active churches, there's actually a competition to see who can send more missionaries to more different countries.",
        "And so it's led them to push the envelope, if you will, and to cover countries that they really shouldn't be in.",
        "Even in a context like that, it must have been a great challenge to decide to go to Afghanistan.",
        "And we've already warmed up a fair amount.",
        "And one or two more degrees of warming would definitely tip the balance away from boreal.",
        "Frelich says the only question is just how much boreal forest will Minnesota be able to hang onto.",
        "And it's not just Minnesota trying to hang on to these cold climate species.",
