        "We're going to take a look now at a disturbing and confounding case of sexual assaults.",
        "More than 150 women and girls came forward in court this year and said they were sexually abused by one man.",
        "And that abuse went on for decades.",
        "Larry Nassar was the top doctor for the U.S.",
        "women's Olympic gymnastics team.",
        "He also worked for Michigan State University.",
        "This past January, Nassar was sentenced to up to 175 years in prison.",
        "Today we're going to take a look at what is really the central mystery of this case.",
        "How did Nassar get away with it for so long?",
        "Two reporters at Michigan Radio have been digging into this question in a new podcast that's called Believed.",
        "I talked to the hosts, Kate Wells and Lindsey Smith.",
        "And before we start, we should warn listeners this conversation includes some graphic language describing sexual assault.",
        "Well, hello to you both.",
        "Well, as you've mentioned before, it looks to be a Category 2 at this point.",
        "That could change.",
        "The folks here at the Hurricane Center want to be careful about what they say because it still has about 300 miles to go.",
        "It's not moving terribly fast right now, about three to five miles per hour toward the Northeast, but it's packing winds of about 100 miles an hour.",
        "And they expect landfall perhaps around daybreak tomorrow probably around Naples, somewhere in the southwestern part of the state.",
        "And, of course, there's potentials for tornadoes and the storm surge has them worried.",
        "That could be as high as seven, perhaps 10 feet if it remains a Category 2, and it's about the same track as Charley took last year, which, I guess, people in Florida are rather tired of seeing this.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "It's been the eighth hurricane in two years.",
        "And it's a wide or a big one in the sense that it covers a lot of territory; last checked, I think about 170 miles across.",
        "So it's not necessarily the intensity of the winds that is worrisome; it's, you know, how much area it's gonna cover.",
        "And so, so far, they think about a 2.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "This storm has behaved quite differently from storms like Katrina and Rita who seemed to have--take aim at the coast and get there.",
        "How are forecasters explaining Wilma's wanderings?",
        "Well, one of them this morning said to me perplexing.",
        "I remember some of the discussions earlier in the week had--some of the models had the hurricane going as far north as Maine while others said it would stay and hang around the Yucatan which obviously was the correct one.",
        "They've got about a dozen models and five or six ones they really prefer, and there has been a lot of variety.",
        "And hurricanes are very complex.",
        "I mean, you might think of a spinning top, for example, on the top of your desk and you give it a little nudge and it's gonna head off in a direction you might not be able to predict.",
        "And you've got a low pressure system in North America, which is what's driving it to Florida now, and you've got currents in the ocean, in the Gulf of Mexico, that bring warm water and fuel the hurricane.",
        "And there's so many things working at once that while they're quite confident about the track so far, it's been mostly the speed of the hurricane that's had them confused.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Little doubt left now, though, that it's gonna go to Florida and hit Florida tomorrow morning."

        "No.",

        "And these could change at the last minute, but it's likely to be a 2.",
        "Chris, yesterday, there was a record set.",
        "The 22nd tropical storm of the season was given a name, this time Alpha for the first letter of the Greek alphabet.",
        "Is this large number of big storms indicative of a trend or is it just a weather quirk?",
        "That's a tough one.",
        "Climatologists and meteorologists say they expected a big year.",
        "I think the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted up to 21 named hurricanes this year.",

        "According to South Korean news media, Kim Jong Nam was poisoned there.",
        "Wire services cite Malaysian officials also saying that Kim was attacked.",
        "NPR has not independently confirmed those reports.",
        "To tell us more about this member of the Kim dynasty and his relationship with his half-brother, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, we called up journalist Jean Lee in Hokkaido, Japan, on Skype.",
        "She's now a global fellow at the Wilson Center, and she says Kim Jong Nam was once seen as North Korea's heir apparent.",
        "He had certainly been given some high-profile posts within the Workers' Party of North Korea and so had been assumed to be next in line to succeed his father, Kim Jong Il.",
        "But that all fell by the wayside in 2001 when he was stopped entering Japan apparently to go to Disneyland.",
        "And he was found to have been trying to get into the country on a fake Dominican passport.",
        "And so it's believed that that was so embarrassing to Kim Jong Il and to the regime that he fell out of favor and was no longer considered the heir apparent."

        "That's 15 years ago.",
        "What's he been doing since?",
        "So it wasn't too long after that that he went overseas.",
        "And he's pretty much been overseas apart from a couple of trips back to Pyongyang.",

        "So we do have reports of him surfacing from time to time in - mostly in Macau and Beijing, Malaysia, Singapore.",
        "Well, since there are reports that this is an assassination - or was - and since there are suspicions that Kim Jong Un would be behind it, how would you describe Kim Jong Un's relationship with his half-brother and the regime in Pyongyang?",
        "Certainly not very close.",
        "Now, they have different mothers.",
        "They did not grow up together, and they did not clearly have a close relationship.",
        "Now, one of the things that Kim Jong Nam may have been worried about was that Kim Jong Un, in 2013, ordered the execution of his own uncle.",
        "Now, Kim Jong Nam is believed to have been close to that executed uncle, so he certainly would have feared for his life because what followed after that execution was an extended purge.",
        "So he certainly would have been worried that that connection would have put his life in danger and that even somebody who is a member of North Korea's ruling family would not be exempt from that kind of scrutiny.",
        "He also gave some newspaper interviews, I've read.",
        "Did he say very provocative things in those interviews?",
        "So in the last couple of years, he has given a few interviews to Japanese media.",
        "He has said, for example, that he opposed the hereditary succession of leadership from his father, Kim Jong Il, to his younger half-brother, Kim Jong Un.",
        "And he has also said that he saw the likelihood that North Korea would collapse if they didn't carry out some economic reform.",
        "So certainly these two things would, under North Korean law, be cause for treason.",
        "Our delegation ver--made it very clear that first they've got to disarm, create a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.",
        "And once they are back in the NPT with IAEA safeguards, at an appropriate time we will have a discussion about the subject of a provision of a light-water reactor.",
        "The nuclear issues came to a head when North Korea pulled out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, or NPT, in 2002 and then expelled inspectors of the UN monitoring agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA.",
        "At the opening of the talks today, Chinese lead negotiator, Wu Dawei, said the discussions would focus on the concrete steps necessary to implement the September joint statement.",
        "The statement said that denuclearization would proceed in a series of reciprocal moves, commitment for commitment and action for action.",
        "But critics say that the statement was too short of specifics to be of much value.",
        "Peter Beck of the think tank the International Crisis Group has been watching the proceedings from Seoul, South Korea.",
        "I think the press made a mistake at the beginning calling what we had on September 19th an agreement--was just a joint statement, and really an agreement on principle.",
        "So they really haven't agreed on specifics of, you know, what an agreement would actually entail, much less how to implement it."
