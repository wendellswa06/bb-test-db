        "But for these pieces that we're producing for our bi-weekly print magazine, we're producing pieces that we hope will last not just for two weeks, but will last for months or sometimes even years.",
        "And that means that we're publishing longer pieces, we're allowing our reporters to spend even longer in the production of the pieces and the garnering of information and the actual writing of the pieces.",

        "Mash?",
        "But I think even more than the ideology, there's been a quality associated with the magazine and a brand of analysis that has less to do with actual political views and more to do with a certain hardheadedness about politics and a certain depth that I think that the magazine gets into when we start examining and picking apart political ideas or works of literature.",
