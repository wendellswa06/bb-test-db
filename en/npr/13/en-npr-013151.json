        "In addition to agriculture, the Netherlands and Iowa have a shared history.",

        "It has a lot of farmland.",
        "More than 150 years since the Dutch first came here Iowa's fertile farmland still draws visitors from the Netherlands, sometimes even kings.",

        "So far this year, some 1,800 migrants have died trying to cross the Mediterranean into Europe.",
        "Most have left from Libya, bound for Italy, which is straining under the pressure of the border crisis.",
        "And now the U.N.",
        "is considering a request by Italy and its European allies.",

        "this week.",
        "You're arguing against this idea of seizing and destroying the smugglers' boats.",
        "Why are you opposed to that?",
        "But, first of all, let me say that we must fight these smugglers and the traffickers, but in this phase of the Libyan crisis, we think it's a huge mistake to bomb the boats.",
        "The migrants are desperate people, and they will find other routes and other traffickers ready to use other routes to let them to join Italy or Europe, and so this is not the solution in this particular moment.",
        "And just to be clear, the idea was to destroy the boats before they're used, denying them to traffickers - not to endanger the lives of the migrants.",
        "There are a lot of people who think that's a good idea.",
        "I mean, Prime Minister Tony Abbott of Australia says the only way you can stop the deaths on the sea is, in fact, to stop the boats.",
        "They had their own migrant crisis in Australia not so long ago.",
        "I don't want to argue with the politicians.",
        "I only care about human life.",
        "And my point of view is this is not the right solution.",
        "It's just a way to don't let them die close to our borders, and then they can die in Libya because there is no solution for them.",
        "I spoke with one of the survivors of the tragedy that happened a few weeks ago in the Mediterranean, and he told me, you have no idea - you have no idea what we pass through, and if you change mind - if you want to go back to your country, they don't allow you.",
        "They push you on the boat with the guns.",
        "You don't know the level of violence in Libya."

        "There is not an easy answer to this issue, but the politicians are elected to solve complexity, so it's up to them to put the human being - humanity at the center of their policies.",
        "Those who are fleeing violence and conflicts - they have the need and the right to be protected.",

        "They are - when they arrive they are under shock.",
        "We provide them psychosocial supports, health assistance.",

        "To the extent that Nobel Peace Prizes send messages, what's the message here?",
        "Well, I think the message, as Dr. ElBaradei said, is that this is a crucial problem for international peace and security, the control of nuclear weapons.",
        "And whatever the flaws of the IAEA itself, it's the institution that we've got to do the inspections around the world to help us control the spread of nuclear weapons.",
        "But is it fair to say that the IAEA and Dr. ElBaradei are typically cautious--some might say gratefully so--over Iraq, but also over Iran?",
        "That's absolutely correct.",
        "The IAEA is a creature of its member states, and it can only have the authority and clout that its member states want to give it.",
        "But Dr. ElBaradei, I believe, has done a very professional job, both in the case of Iraq and in the case of Iran.",
        "We now know, from the CIA's own investigation, that Iraq had not reconstituted its nuclear weapons program.",
        "It had not done so precisely because they were afraid they would get caught by the international inspectors if they did.",
        "In Iran's case, even senior Israeli officials have said to me that they believe that the IAEA has done a very creditable job of peeling back one layer after another of Iranian lies and deceptions.",
        "On the other hand, one could point to North Korea and A.Q.",
        "Khan's work in Pakistan and say, `A Nobel Prize for this?'",
        "But the North Korean situation is again, in a sense, an example of how effective the IAEA is.",
        "The North Koreans pulled out of the inspections back in the early 1990s precisely because the IAEA managed to catch them making lies about how much plutonium they had separated when the North Koreans thought they had cleaned up their facility enough that the IAEA inspectors wouldn't notice what had happened there.",
        "To me, this prize is a sign to the international community that it's time to give the IAEA the money, the people, the intelligence and the authority it needs to get the jobs that we want it to do done.",
