        "I would identify March of next year - March of 2008 - as a very hard deadline.",
        "It's a deadline in the sense that that's the date by which troops committed to the surge will be redeploying back to the United States, absent a decision to further extend their 15-month-long tours.",
        "And if those tours were extended, the president would have to do that in the middle of a presidential election.",
        "He's unlikely to do that.",
        "It would be politically very unpopular.",

        "Congress on the Democratic side is talking about a 120-day term for withdrawal.",
        "That puts us somewhere in November.",

        "So these calendars are not that far apart.",
