        "There was an incident a couple of weeks ago where this Web site named Site meter which gives you a little widget that lets you count the visitors to your website, they changed something on their server and it caused every Web site that uses their widget to stop working, which included Paris Hilton and all of the Gawker blogs, a lot of the most popular Web sites.",
        "Many ways, as the web continues to grow, that this little fragile network could fall apart in places here and there and also just the general growth of web users outpacing the growth of web infrastructure right now.",

        "The Republic of Georgia has been under attack by Russia this week.",
        "But, now the reports are saying that the former Soviet Republic's computers were hit by cyber-assaults, that attacks on Web sites for Georgia's presidency and a major TV network were traced back to computers in Russia.",
        "So, do you think that this is a case of what's called hacktivism?",
        "The initial thought was that this was carried out by the Russian government, as sort of an advanced attack before they invaded.",
        "But seems to be more of a consensus now that it was what they hactivists, just regular citizens who wanted to sort of join in and jump on the bandwagon with what else is going on.",
        "There was a similar incident - there was a dispute between Russia and Estonia about a year ago where a similar sort of cyber attack happened and everyone pretty much agreed those were just regular folks doing it, which makes it even more frightening if we could just as easily be the government or a group of junior high school kids.",
        "So, it doesn't bode well for internet security."

        "It certainly does not seem to have a revenue model yet, and you know their explanation has been we're focusing on growth rather than profits right now.",

        "But we saw in the first dot com boom and bust, that those things often don't sort themselves out.",

        "There seems to be a slow down as far as IPOs and those things which I think you know in the short term could, you know, could offer less impetus for innovation.",
        "But I think in the long term it could be better because so much of the innovation we've seen up until now has been geared towards achieving an IPO or a buy-out instead of achieving a self-sustaining business model.",
        "So, I hope that if things slow down it'll encourage people to look for more pragmatic forms of innovation that make actual functional businesses.",
