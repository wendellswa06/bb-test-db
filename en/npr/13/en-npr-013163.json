        "Glenn Fine may be the most powerful law enforcement officer you've never heard of.",
        "Hes been the Justice Departments top watchdog for more than a decade, and during that time, Fine exposed widespread violations of civil liberties by the FBI, and he criticized Justice Department officials for injecting politics into hiring decisions.",
        "Fine has decided to step down soon, but first, he sat down with NPR's Carrie Johnson.",
        "A lot of people have underestimated Glenn Fine over the years, starting with his success in basketball.",
        "The San Antonio Spurs drafted him in 1979.",
        "Fine keeps a team poster on his wall to prove it.",
        "I'm quite short, I'm five foot nine, and they don't believe I played basketball.",
        "So I've taken to telling people, well, before I started this job as the inspector general I was six foot nine.",
        "Actually, Fine's stature has grown over 10 years as inspector general.",
        "One reason: the focus on national security at the Justice Department after the September 11th attacks.",
        "Fine exposed security flaws and privacy violations by the federal government.",
        "He trained his 400 employees to pick high value targets and he gave them the freedom to roam.",
        "Michael Bromwich used to be the Justice Department's inspector general.",
        "There were a lot of questionable and unfortunate things that were going on at the department that led to important investigations that the inspector general's office did and that Glenn led.",
        "And that helped inform the public and the Congress as to some of the things that were going on that shouldn't have been going on.",
        "During the middle years of the Bush administration, Fine found that politics motivated the hiring of lawyers for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and its summer interns.",
        "He also went after the FBI's use of national security letters to snoop on people.",
        "Some Republicans said that Fine was playing to the media and Democrats in Congress.",
        "But Fine says those kinds of complaints are to be expected in his line of work."

        "George Terwilliger is a Republican lawyer in Washington.",
        "He's defended several people under investigation by the inspector general.",
        "But he generally gives Fine good marks.",
        "Any time you're in that position, the person investigating your client is an adversary, but I always found Glenn to be a worthy and respected adversary.",
        "Terwilliger says it's important for the White House to choose a replacement with experience leading big investigations.",
        "But he says there's another factor that's even more critical.",
        "I would hope that they would be nonpolitical, because the position is subject to politicization and political abuse.",

        "As a matter of fact, we have struggled with this problem in Georgia politics for a long time.",
        "I carried the Georgian flag.",
        "I carried all the states except Virginia in the South.",
        "But beginning in 1964, the Republicans had very shrewdly capitalized on racism in order to become dominant in the Southern states, and they still have enormous strength there, politically speaking, because of a subtle and sometimes overt appeals to racism with the Confederate flag, and welfare mamas, and that sort of things that they still have used, and I think that - I believe that this nomination - I hope the election of Barack Obama will bring an end to that heritage of racism that existed ever since our nation was founded.",
        "As you know better than I, I suspect, during that time, there were various code words that were used, state rights, for example."

        "You still hear them in certain places.",
        "I saw my opponent in 1980, Ronald Reagan, began his campaign, his kickoff speech for his campaign was in the Mississippi village where the three civil rights workers were buried in the dam of a pond.",
        "And it wasn't an accident that the Republicans chose that just to demonstrate, although Reagan didn't have to say it, anything except state rights, that the racial issue was very important to them.",
        "And we've seen the campaigns run by Strom Thurmond in North Carolina against a black candidate a few years ago.",
        "And as a result, the Georgia governor's election almost eight years ago now decided on the basis of the Confederate flag.",
        "So, those things are very important, and are very present in my own life in Georgia.",
        "But there's been a remarkable breakthrough this year when Barack Obama came into Georgia and campaigned against two very attractive, white candidates, and won against Senator Edwards and against Senator Clinton, both of whom are very attractive.",
        "But it was a remarkable development when my state of Georgia went for a black candidate.",
        "In the Democratic primary, do you honestly think the state of Georgia is in play come November?",
        "It's in play, yes.",

        "Every time she would go out of the head campaign headquarters, her automobile would be covered with scatological comments written in soap, and the radio antenna would be tied in a knot.",
        "When my children went to school in Plains High School with a Johnson banner on their book sack, they would sometimes be beaten up, and would come home bloody at night, but go back the next morning ahead - again, committed to the Democratic Party.",
        "But we were in the minority then.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And now, of course, with Obama coming along, he has proven already that it's time for racial discrimination to be ended in this country, and I think he's made notable successes.",

        "It was a heartfelt and deep analytical presentation of that issue.",
        "I literally wept to hear the best explanation of this that I've ever heard.",

        "He came from nowhere.",

        "That's his heritage, and it's now being distorted completely by the swift-boat techniques that were so effective against John Kerry.",
