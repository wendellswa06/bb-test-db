        "I think New Jersey was a very personal rebuke to Governor Corzine.",
        "I was up at his party in - it wasn't so much of a party in New Jersey.",

        "That's a state Obama carried with close to 53 percent of the vote.",
        "The Democrats were asleep in Virginia and I think that is a warning.",
        "And they did very badly in the outer suburbs, in the ex-urbs, and that's a place where they've been making a lot of gains.",
        "They've got to keep their eye on that.",

        "And the insurgents groups, like Omer Mahdi was just describing to us in Hadithah, those are still saying any Sunni, any Iraqi who cooperates with the election is subject to be killed.",
        "Well, there's say - I mean, the background to this is that backdrop of raising obesity amongst young children, and indeed adults.",
        "Various health lobbyists have been trying to get these vans banned from operating in the proximity of schools in this country.",
        "I mean, obviously, ice cream vans are an iconic image of Britain, much like double-decker buses, one would guess.",

        "Indeed, another (unintelligible), some pressure is being brought to bear because of the increased number of cars there in the streets.",

        "And they seem to feel that - the ice cream van vendors seem to feel that they're being picked on here; which is a shame, because ice cream has a glorious history in Britain, and it's been around since the days of Charles II.",
        "Yeah, and it - certainly that tune, Greensleeves, just as the Mr. Softee tune in this country, makes people think of summertime.",
        "Well, exactly.",

        "They haven't become firm Republicans, but this follows on the wake of six or seven months of very interesting polling data - shifts to the right among independents, number of independents who thinks government is too big, government is getting too involved in regulating business, labor is too powerful, global warming is over-exaggerated - a whole series of polling data suggesting there's been a, sort of, reaction against what's been happening, a reaction to the right.",
        "Interesting polling data though because there's a move to the right, but the independents don't necessarily have great affinity for the Republican Party."
