        "And so these forces, when US or Iraqi forces go through the area--well, we're familiar with what happened in Fallujah where insurgent forces tried to stand up to US Marines and lost badly.",

        "There are a lot of efforts.",
        "I've seen Sunni leaders quoted as saying, `We need to get people registered, come out and vote against this.",
        "Under the Iraqi constitution, if two-thirds of the voters in three provinces vote no, the whole process has to start again.",
        "That's correct, and again, the referendum will be on October 15th.",
        "There perhaps are three provinces where Sunnis make up a majority, although there's no clear demographic data.",
        "There hasn't been a census of any merit in Iraq for a very long time now, so it's not clear whether or not they'll be able to do that.",
        "But, you know, if you have--given that the Sunnis are leading the insurgency here and there's a lot of passive support within their community and even amongst the people that aren't violent, you know, you're gonna end up with a situation where they are totally cut out and they feel totally betrayed by this process.",
        "If they don't manage to shoot a constitution down they're unhappy with, that might be even worse than if they do manage to shoot down a constitution they're unhappy with.",
        "Well, I only caught a little bit of his interview, and while he's right, there are insurgents like that and that is a huge problem for all Iraqis, and including Sunnis, that isn't the whole story on the insurgency.",
        "We both have these radical religious fanatics is all I can really call them like the Zarqawi types, I think like a lot of what he was describing in the Hadithah area.",
        "You also have Sunni-Arab insurgents who are Iraqis who might be brutal in their tactics sometimes, but are going to stand aside and encourage their people to vote because they recognize that a further boycott at this point could hurt their interests.",
        "The problem is it's not clear even within the Sunni insurgency which side is stronger and which side will prevail.",
        "Based on what you're hearing from leaders of the Shia and Kurdish factions today, are they willing to extend any kind of concessions at this point to the Sunnis?",
        "Not that we can tell.",
        "Their attitude last night and today has been they bent over backward already to accommodate Sunni demands.",
        "They are describing the Sunnis as obstructionists, people that aren't to be satisfied at all, and, `We've bent only so far and we can't bend anymore for them.",
        "And they have a certain point.",
        "A lot of Sunnis want to see this process fail now so that there are--new elections are forced in which they will hopefully be better represented in the parliament since they did boycott the last election.",
        "At that point they feel like they'll have a lot more input and influence over the process.",
        "So there is a very real sense at which there's almost nothing that the Shiites and Kurds are gonna offer them at this point that's gonna satisfy them.",
