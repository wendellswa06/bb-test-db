        "Well, the records show that they were Quanders present in Charles County, Maryland in the late 1600s.",
        "The oral history says that the family was brought in, particularly from Ghana.",
        "Two brothers got separated in southern Maryland and were not able to reconnect, but the descendants did.",
        "Subsequently, ancestors showed up on the Virginia side of the river, and some of them were in service to George Washington.",
        "So we've been invited to come - all Quanders, regardless of whether the Mount Vernon group or not, have been invited by the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association to celebrate a very special occasion, the 85th annual Quander family reunion.",
        "One of the things that I understand is unique about the Quanders...",
        "Yes.",
        "...is the Quander name itself.",
        "You're not Jeffersons.",
        "You're not Washingtons.",
        "You're Quanders.",
        "And there is a reason for that, isn't it?",
        "Yes.",
        "And, in fact, the family record of being in bondage and also in freedom goes back to the 1600s, when the rules on slave names and surnames was not yet cast in, as it became.",
        "So, we were able to hold on to our original African name, which we believe is Amkwandoh.",
        "It's a Fante name.",
        "When the forebear was asked his name and said, Amkwandoh, to untrained ears, they heard Quando.",
        "And the records appear as - name appears as Quando in the early records, and got corrupted to Quander with the passage of time.",
        "So, Quanders are everywhere in the United States, am I to believe?",
        "Well, I don't know about being everywhere.",
        "We're concentrated in Maryland, D.C.",
        "and Virginia, but we have spread around to other parts of the country.",
        "But we are definitely concentrated in this area and in Pennsylvania.",
        "Now, when you have your reunion - it begins tomorrow, or Saturday?",
        "Begins on Friday with a big fry on Quander Road, and then Saturday at Mount Vernon, and then Sunday at church."

        "So you have your own street?",
        "We do have a Quander Road in Virginia, and there will be a new Quander Street coming back in D.C.",
        "It was here before, right across the street from the baseball stadium.",
        "It's coming back as the area is reconstructed.",
        "It's already on the map, but not on the - there are no street signs yet.",
        "So how many Quanders and extended Quanders do you expect to show up?",
        "Well, hard to say.",
        "I know the count is well over 100.",
        "It might be 150, but anybody who has a history of the name Quander, even if that's not that their current surname, is still a Quander.",
        "But people come.",
        "Older people come, then go and drift away, and newer people come in who've never been apart of it.",
        "But we're going to have a good crowd.",
        "And it's going to be a good core to look forward to our centennial, which will be in another 15 years.",
        "But that's a start now.",
        "Now, I know that family reunions are about getting together - as you said when we first started talking - and also, you know, having a good time and connecting and looking back.",
        "How much of this is about the history of your particular family and an attempt to keep it going by educating the youngsters about who you really are?",
        "Well, a lot of it is about history.",
        "But I think the emphasis now is to realize that it's more important to talk about the now in the family, to keep a good core of the history so that we know the history and we celebrate the history.",
        "What is most important are those of us in the here and the now - the younger people, the older people, those in the middle - to keep the association going.",
        "Is there such a thing as a Quander family cemetery?",
        "Well, I wouldn't say there's a Quander family cemetery, but there are several places where many of us are buried, for example, the Bethel Cemetery in Alexandria, and actually inside the Slave Memorial at Mount Vernon.",
        "Oral history - there are no records showing who's buried there - but oral history have several of the Quander ancestors buried right there next to George Washington.",
        "So being in Mount Vernon, that's really significant for your family, isn't it, this weekend?",
        "It's very significant - only the second African-American family to have a family reunion there, family descended from several names like Westford, who is, himself, refuted to be a Washington descendant and Quanders descended from Westford.",
        "So there is, apparently, a possible sanguine connection, and that's why it's so important that the Ladies' Association invited us to come and celebrate."

        "It's a very difficult task.",
        "And we have an excellent president, Robin Quander Whitmire(ph), very dedicated.",
        "And I've been blessed to - asked to speak on Saturday.",
        "And one of the things I'm going to focus on is that at the 85th, we are in sight of the centennial.",
        "But in order to make it a good centennial and well beyond, we have to remember that all of us have to step up and play an important part in the family history.",
        "In planning - whether it would be food or activity or history, everyone has to do something in order to make it a success.",
        "Rohulamin, yet what you're saying sounds to me a little bit like - correct me if I'm wrong, here - that even in a big family like yours that has roots way, way back here in the United States, that when it comes down to doing the work, it falls on a few shoulders."

        "It's not a thing that they have.",
