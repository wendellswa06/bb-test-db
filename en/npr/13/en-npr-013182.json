        "This report focuses on the way that Comey and others handled the investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails.",

        "What stands out to you when you read that 500 pages?",
        "Well, really, the conclusion that Jim Comey, the former FBI director, was insubordinate and usurped the role of the attorney general by saying he would not charge Hillary Clinton with a crime.",
        "Of course, that's the Justice Department's job, not the FBI's job.",
        "Can we just remember also, Comey called this press conference - didn't just put out a statement but called this press conference and - was he told not to by his boss or just didn't ask permission?",
        "How did that come down?",
        "In fact, Steve, the inspector general found that Comey waited to the last minute to inform the Justice Department he was going to do this so they wouldn't overrule him, which is kind of a bold move.",
        "And in fact, the report - it also has some criticism for the former Attorney General Loretta Lynch for not cutting short her infamous meeting with Bill Clinton on the airport tarmac in 2016, which gave rise to allegations of impropriety.",
        "No actual impropriety - it just looked bad.",
        "But Steve, really the most serious stuff in this report are text messages between people at the FBI which cast doubt on the credibility of the bureau generally, the inspector general found, because these people were texting bad things about Donald Trump and often nice things about Hillary Clinton.",
        "OK.",
        "Just one thing about James Comey because you've covered him for so long, Carrie Johnson - he made this decision not to inform his superiors until the last minute, essentially because he did not trust President Obama's political appointees at the Justice Department to steer him straight.",
        "He wanted to make sure the FBI was independent.",
        "That's been the explanation he's given.",
        "Has he kind of assumed all along that some kind of rebuke like this would be coming; he accepted that as the price of looking independent?",
        "Yeah, I think Comey has concluded that he thinks he had tough choices but ultimately did the right thing.",
        "And I think a large part of the book tour that Comey participated in earlier this year was trying to explain to the public why he did what he did, even though a lot of people still don't agree with the guy."
