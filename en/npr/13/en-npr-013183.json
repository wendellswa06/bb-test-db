        "Three years ago, city workers in Portsmouth, New Hampshire discovered coffins buried under a downtown street.",
        "Tests and archeological reports confirmed that those buried were most likely colonial slaves.",
        "While old city maps once mark the gravesite, eventually the area was developed.",
        "Now, Portsmouth officials want to build a memorial to honor those buried there.",
        "New Hampshire Public Radio's Amy Quinton reports.",
        "A black SUV sits at a parking meter on Chestnut Street in busy downtown Portsmouth.",
        "As resident and black historian Valerie Cunningham walks by the SUV, she stops and points to the parking meter.",
        "This is the spot where city workers discovered 13 coffins buried in the ground in 2003.",
        "The parking meter is exactly over five coffins, and the person who is parked there may or may not know.",
        "But, yeah, this is what we've been living with since 2003.",
        "Portsmouth workers discovered the burials while digging a manhole for a sewer project.",
        "Archeologists removed eight of the coffins before construction resumed.",
        "DNA tests confirmed the remains were four African men, one female, one juvenile, and two others whose sex and age could not be determined.",
        "Cunningham suspected all along that the bodies were there.",
        "A 1705 city map showed the area as a Negro burying ground.",
        "There had been oral histories; there had been written references in the local newspaper to this burial ground.",
        "What we did not have was physical evidence.",
        "And this is what made it so very exciting.",
        "I never expected to see this in my lifetime, because I never expected them to dig up the street.",
        "Cunningham, who has spent three decades documenting the city's African American history, had erected a plaque on a nearby house in 2000 to mark the cemetery.",
        "But discovering the physical evidence of the gravesite only led to more questions about the people buried there.",
        "Well, we don't know their identity.",
        "We don't know whose family they were connected to.",
        "We don't know where they came from, if they were born here.",
        "We don't really know anything.",
        "But archeologists say the discovery reveals more than expected.",
        "Lead archeologist, Kathleen Wheeler, is with Independent Archeological Consulting.",
        "She says that historians have long believed that most enslaved African Americans were too poor to be buried in coffins.",
        "But that's not what they found in Portsmouth."

        "We discovered that they were put in coffins built in the same fashion they were using for white people.",
        "Not only that, they dug the whole with enough care that they dug into bedrock to put the coffin base down nice and flat.",
        "Wheeler believes a community of Africans, that's what they called themselves then, helped dig these graves.",
        "But by the early 1800s, the cemetery no longer appeared on city maps.",
        "In its place were houses.",
        "It's unclear whether city leaders back then intentionally paved over the site, but researcher Ellen Marlatt, with Independent Archeological Consulting, says at one point Portsmouth leaders must have known the cemetery existed.",
        "When the coffins were unearthed in 2003, a sewer line went straight through the bodies.",
        "It was a pretty dramatic scene.",
        "A sewer line went down the West Lane of Chestnut Street; it was probably installed in the 1890s, maybe up to about 1900.",
        "And it was hand dug, and the workers had dug it through the middle of four of the burials that we observed in the field.",
        "It's a simple question: If three plus X equals six, what's the value of X?",
        "Not exactly advanced calculus, but basic questions like this stump many of this country's high school graduates; so many that nearly one in four potential military recruits can't pass the academic enlistment test.",
        "For recruiters, it's not just an academic challenge.",
        "Seventy-five percent of all 17- to 24-year-olds don't meet the basic minimum standards required for military service.",

        "Some high school graduates see the military as their only viable career option.",
        "But a new report by the nonprofit, the Education Trust, shows that far too few high school graduates have the basic math, reading or problem-solving skills necessary to pass the test, which is officially called the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery exam, or, in military jargon, the ASVAB.",
        "Amy Wilkins is vice president of the Education Trust, and she's responsible for its latest report called Shut Out of the Military.",
        "There's been a lot of conversation in this country about whether or not students are graduating ready for college and ready for career, but a lot of the conversation about career readiness has been in the civilian workforce.",
        "So we asked the question, are they ready for a career in the military?",
        "And what we found is that far too few of our students graduate from high school ready to serve our country.",
        "And we're talking about basic problem solving here.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The ASVAB, the term that the Army uses for the test, is the world's most frequently used aptitude test, and it is a battery of several tests, and the Army gives it to potential recruits to ensure that they have the skills and knowledge to meet the needs of the Army.",
        "Now one of the important things about this is because the - many of the jobs in the Army, the workforce of the Army, so closely mirrors the civilian workforce -if kids aren't ready for jobs in the Army, they also aren't ready for jobs in the civilian workforce."
