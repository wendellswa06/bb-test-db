        "There's great research that shows, I mean, it's already in place, and it's numerous studies that have shown that it can have a real effect.",
        "Basically what it showed, that if you start early, you can vastly increase the number of graduates in high school years later.",
        "Conversely, one of the studies also showed that if you have this intervention early on, that you can also keep kids on the right side of the law.",
        "There was an alarming indication that the kids who were not in these early childhood education programs, like 70 percent of them had some problem with the law by the age of 18.",
        "When did it happen, do you think?",
        "I mean, your group, Mission Readiness, did you look at each other and say, you know, we're just headed in the wrong direction here?",
        "Rear Adm.",
        "BARNETT: I was the director of Naval Education and Training at the Pentagon as one of my last tours in the Navy.",
        "So it was something I was aware of very much for several years now.",
        "But all of us have this passion for young people, and so many of them want to be able to serve their country, and it's just tragic for them not to be able to because of one of these factors and especially because of educational attainment, because that also has a pretty significant impact not only in national security but our economic security, not to mention the achievement and accomplishment of that individual.",
        "Given the current political climate and the idea that some people think government's done too much, how confident are you that you can intervene and get behind something like early childhood education?",
        "Rear Adm.",
        "BARNETT: Well, you know, I think information leads to bipartisanship, and this is one that I think appeals to both sides of the aisle."

        "The high school diploma graduates have a proven record of successfully completing their term of enlistment.",
        "And for that reason, we're also troubled by the relatively high high-school dropout rates, particularly in inner cities and other disadvantaged areas.",
