        "Until the 1990s, the neighborhood was predominantly African-American, but now Jefferson's student population is roughly 92 percent Latino and just 7 percent black.",
        "Like many of the students, Justin grew up in a neighborhood with both black and Latino families.",

        "Well, just recently, there was rumors about that there was supposed to be drive-by killings; 500 blacks were supposed to die on Cinco de Mayo.",
        "And again, it was a hoax.",

        "You know, when I was growing up, race was not a factor.",
        "This was mostly black-on-black violence.",
        "But the root causes and I think the responses that we should take I think are very similar.",
        "You know, it's just really sad to me to know that young people are trying to figure out how to survive, and we as adults sometimes don't take these issues serious enough in terms of our own planning and strategy to come up with really a series of sound interventions, which keep children safe; at the same time, teaching them what they need to know in order to handle what's going to be the inevitable conflicts that come up between people of both the same races and ethnic groups, as well as people who come from different races and ethnic groups.",
        "We know more than we're sharing with kids right now about what to do in these kind of circumstances.",
        "Now you've really spent so much of your life dealing with youth and violence.",
        "What are the concrete things that teachers and counselors and parents and friends can do when something like this flares up, and there really have been flare-ups all over the country of racial violence between youth?",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, one of the first things we do--and we know that there is a conflict going on--is that we get adults to get to the facts.",
        "Because people said, `No, they said that Charles was going to come.",
        "And we say, `No, we talked to Charles.",
        "That was never said by Charles, who actually said there was this other kid, didn't have anything to do with it,' and you begin to just dispel a lot of the myths that start young people believing that something's going to happen when nothing is actually going to happen.",
        "The other thing that's absolutely critical, that we have to make sure that we anticipate where violence is going to happen.",
        "Now look, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that if you really put a lot of pressure that there's not going to be violence in school, going home from school is going to be the place that kids are going to get into fights or coming to school, and then we don't staff those areas, that we don't get adults out and say, `Look, in the next six blocks, we just want to have an adult present to make sure our kids get to school and get home safely,' so when something like this happens, we have to deploy people who know how to work with young people; not the police.",
        "And, Geoffrey, who should get involved in this issue?",
        "Is it an issue for government?",
        "You said you don't need to send police.",

        "They come from the same streets that the kids come from.",
        "They wear the same clothes.",
        "They talk the same language.",
        "But these are young people who have decided they're going to go to the local community college.",
        "They're struggling to make something out of their lives.",
        "One of the things we don't realize, that this is an opportunity to train the next set of leaders, and right now, all the leaders are saying, `Go out and cut somebody, go out and shoot somebody,' because that's all they know right now as tools, and this is the perfect time to get a group of 19- and 20-year-olds who have conflict mediation training involved, to say, `Let's get our act together as the African-American group or as the Mexican group or the Latino group--let's get our act together, and then once our act's together, let's go in with a set of demands that says to the school and to the police, \"\"This is what we expect from you,\"\"' and it takes that rage, and it turns it from being focused on another 14- or 15-year-old and it turns it into a strategy of how you improve the conditions in school, how you improve the conditions with police.",
        "I think that's the opportunity we have to grab right now.",
