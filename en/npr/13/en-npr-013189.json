        "Martinez told me he was a contractor and that his boss gave him the day off.",
        "The boss was sympathetic.",
        "But maybe part of that was Martinez said all his other co-workers were Jamaican and they weren't taking part in the immigrant boycott, so the boss was covered for the day."
