        "Topol told a jury the results of that study were never published, and in fact, the information that Merck did share about it was misleading.",
        "Finally he told the jury, in 2001 Merck did a second much bigger study called the VIGOR trial and it had more than 8,000 patients.",
        "Half were on Vioxx, half were on Aleve, and he said in that study, patients on Vioxx had five times as many heart attacks.",
        "Merck told doctors, `Well, that's happening not because Vioxx is risky but because this older drug is just great for heart,' and Topol essentially told the jury today that just doesn't make scientific sense.",

        "Let me tell you a bit about the alarm he sounded.",
        "He wrote a paper several years ago, a paper that now looks like an oppression paper, in which he told doctors essentially that this bigger study, this 2001 study, probably means that Vioxx is a problem for the heart.",

        "So Topol told jurors today that for those people, Vioxx was a public health disaster.",
        "He said the kind of trial that he called for was never done, but he said, you know, the heart risks of Vioxx were proven.",
