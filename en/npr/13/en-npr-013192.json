        "In one study, we looked at 225 cases that happened, there wasn't one false accusation.",

        "Their stories often don't stand up to any kind of scrutiny from adults.",
        "Therefore, it's really unusual, extremely unusual, for an educator to be publicly accused, and then later the accusations to be shown to have been fabricated or false.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So partly because children aren't very good liars.",
        "But the public perception is - and certainly the perception among educators is that, well, this could happen to anybody, and it's a terrifying prospect."
