        "And I assume most school administrators welcome a - an allegation of sexual misconduct by one of their educators, in the same way they'd welcome a hand grenade at their door?",
        "That's correct.",
        "Yet, there is something that is supposed to be done about this.",
        "What's the - you've had a lot of experience, has this come up in your life?",

        "Right.",
        "It didn't involve any allegations of physical activity.",
        "It was more words and nuances and things like that.",
        "When it was brought to our attention, we investigated it thoroughly, established that the individual had, in fact, said some things that were inappropriate.",
        "The - we took action to make sure that individual was never with kids again.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "The reason we didn't go any further, in consultation with the student who brought forth - and her family - who brought forth the allegations, they did not want any kind of public proceeding that their child would be involved in.",
        "And…",
        "Right.",
        "Have him testify or say what happened.",
        "Yeah.",
        "If we were going to actually - this was a situation we had - the person has some due process rights, and if we were going to proceed with a hearing, we would have had to involve some testimony.",
        "And…",
        "Yet, somehow - you're going through these entirely understandable and logical list of precautions and…",
        "Yeah.",
        "…it sounds like the system is set up to protect the teachers.",
        "Well, people - our entire judicial system is set up to protect people who are accused because, you know, our presumption is that people are innocent until proven guilty.",

        "But we would have had to - we could've had him face an arbitration hearing with an independent arbitrator, and obviously, we would have had to present some evidence.",
        "And the evidence - the person who's being accused can - at least in Connecticut, could make sure that that was on the public record.",
        "We never got to that point, because the - it was made very clear to us in the beginning that neither the student nor the parent wanted to get involved in any kind of public activity.",
        "They just wanted to make sure that this person never had contact with kids again.",
        "Yet, and beyond this case, though, there are a lot of these cases that turn out to be he said, she said.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, that would - just because it's that kind of thing it doesn't mean you don't investigate.",
        "And you have to arrive at a decision.",
        "In the case that we were dealing with, we were able to talk to others who had witnessed some of the behavior that the - some of the words, some of the conversations that the person being accused had engaged in.",
        "So we had some evidence to go on.",
        "And usually, you can't just stop at, well, an accusation is made and the person being accused denies it.",

        "No. I understand that.",

        "And it's our position that at that point, you need to involve the police and get their investigation going.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Would you agree with the basic findings of this survey by the Associated Press which suggested many cases go unreported, this happens far too often, and a lot of the times, the outcome of even investigations is that nothing happens?",
        "There's no question in my mind that all of that is true to a certain extent.",
        "I have no way of knowing how true it is.",
        "I would suspect that many cases do go unreported.",
        "We know that's true in many areas that involve sexual misconduct.",
        "One of the things that school systems have tried to do - and that we advocate that they do do - is to make it clear that it's against the policy of the school system for this to occur and that there is a very clear procedure for people to use to bring forward their concerns.",
        "And once those concerns are brought forward, it's our position in AASA that they need to be investigated thoroughly.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "…that reaction was totally unacceptable.",
        "I don't care - we don't care what the personal characteristics are of the person making the accusations, you still have to investigate.",
        "You can't just dismiss it and say, well, this kid is emotional or even if the kid's made false accusations in the past, you need to investigate each allegation and arrive at a decision as to whether it's valid or not.",
        "And finally, Mr. Cirasuolo, is this situation getting more attention?",
        "Are more school administrators being educated about this problem?",
        "There's no question - as opposed to, say, 20 years ago - that that's the case.",
        "Because we've had a number of instances that have occurred, it's been something that's been the subject of a number of workshops for administrators.",
        "In many states in the last 20 years, laws have been passed that make administrators and teachers mandated reporters of this kind of activity.",
        "So workshops, information has been disseminated in connection with that.",
        "All of it boils down to - it's completely intolerable for anyone to abuse even one child, you know.",
        "If the study that's been done indicated only one kid in the country that would have been abused, that's one too many.",
        "And it's something that I think - you began the program by saying the vast majority of teachers are people in whom we can trust.",
        "Our impression is the vast majority of administrators are people whom you can trust.",
        "Unfortunately, some people haven't met their full responsibility and that that should not have happened, and it shouldn't be happening now.",

        "And Caroline Hendrie, I wanted to ask you.",
        "From what he is saying, from your vantage point at Education Week, do you think that administrators are being educated about this?",
        "Well, I think there is some sporadic attention to this issue.",
        "But I don't think there's indications just that they are really focusing on it and making it a top priority in their schools.",
        "I think that, you know, the anecdote by the English teacher shows that administrators are often unprepared for this kind of thing.",
        "And, you know, they may go through their whole career, and it may be a long distinguished career, never having to deal with this kind of issue.",
        "So it perpetuates the sense that this is very rare, very idiosyncratic, very unlikely to happen in their school.",
        "So it's really not something they feel they have to devote a whole lot of attention to.",
        "They are unprepared and therefore, they often, when a case does arise, they won't even follow their own policies.",
        "That's not meaning they're - it's not that they're not well-meaning, they often are.",
        "But I think we often have - we also have to look at what systemic kind of pressures there are for school officials to act the way they do.",
        "If they do turn away, if they don't take something entirely seriously, is that because they're just bad people?",
        "No, of course not.",
        "There are things in the system that push them to act that way.",
        "You know, for one example, victims' families often say they felt that the one place that there were no child advocates were in the schools.",
        "Right.",
        "So as we discussed earlier, the school employees do have a built-in support system in that they have usually or have their union representation and, great, that's what unions are supposed to do - support and protect their employees.",
        "But on the other side, the student victims very often, as Charol mentioned, are exceptionally vulnerable kids and, you know, insidiously, sometimes the abusers pick them for that reason, because they're not credible.",
        "They are under a whole variety of stresses in their personal lives.",
        "So they're vulnerable kids to begin with and systemically, there's no one there to support them, no one there to advocate for their position.",
        "And so a school administrator, on the one side, has the employee with a very strong support system, with the threat of litigation always behind if they make a misstep…",
        "Yes.",
        "…meaning the administrator.",
        "But on the other side, they don't have sort of a countervailing pressure necessarily to respond and air on the side of caution when it comes to lending credibility to accusations."
