        "Grant was one of my first interviews, and he was actually saying that in the context of being frustrated that, you know, because his father was a history major and historian, that kind of stuff, and you know, Grant knows about the struggle and that kind of stuff, and he knows the irony of guys having this kind of money and no consciousness.",
        "And it takes a heck of a person to see through that money and understand that there are large numbers of your people who are really suffering, who are really feeling the cold.",
        "And interestingly, if you look at the quote after it, Larry Johnson said that, you know - I told Larry Johnson what Grant had said.",

        "One guy, Charles Stewart, was so - he made so much money training horses and that kind of stuff that he had to have an agent, and we're talking about like in the early 1800s.",
        "But the fact remains that he was still a slave.",
        "There were a lot of jockeys who were making a lot of money, and they'd finish a race, and they found out they had been sold to another plantation, but, you know, they made a lot of money.",
        "So clearly the metaphor of slavery and the plantation is troubling in this country just because of our history.",
        "But yeah, I think, Ed, you're absolutely right, is that like Curt Flood said, you know, he was kind of like a sharecropper, you know.",
        "When you don't own it, when you don't own the enterprise and you could be kind of treated like chattel, that's essentially what you are.",
        "And again for people that don't know, either too young or not big sports fans, Curt Flood is the man who really put his career on the line and brought about free agency in the sense of believing that you ought to have some sense of guidance in your own career and that you shouldn't be owned lock, stock, and barrel by that owner and that team forever.",
