        "Well, that's a good question.",
        "What happened is right, because for the longest time, nobody saw it coming.",
        "There were some Republicans who probably thought that Martha Coakley was vulnerable, that there was either a referendum or was a referendum on Martha Coakley or with Democratic arrogance or the health care bill or, you know, anything, anything that you want to anything you want to say happened, happened.",
        "The point is that Republicans had a good candidate, exciting candidate.",
        "Whether he was qualified, whether he had the right solutions is one thing, but he campaigned in this pickup truck that really won the hearts and minds of independents, and we'll talk about that in a bit.",
        "Whereas Democrats basically, you know, went to sleep after the December 8th primary, Martha Coakley in a state that hasn't elected a Republican to the Senate since 1982.",
        "She thought she had it in the bag.",
        "Democrats in Washington thought it was all over.",
        "Pollsters both in Washington and Massachusetts saw it not being competitive at all, and they just basically dozed.",
        "Well, that pollster question I think is key because, you know, frustration with Washington and the health care legislation, economic hard times, disenchantment with President Obama, that was all true two months ago, but Martha Coakley was up 25, 30 points in the polls two months ago.",
        "So what made it turn around so dramatically in such a short amount of time?",
        "Oh, of course.",

        "Well, we teamed up on several, but one that stands out in my mind was an educational initiative that would restore the vitality and the integrity and the initiative and imagination back to the National Parks Service education program.",
        "What is some of that?",
        "Like, what can people learn from the parks if the program's gone well?",
        "Let's look at what parks represent.",
        "You know, I mean, there are 391 sites and they're an expression of our national identity.",
        "They represent the best collection of what we are as an American people from places where we gained our liberty to some of the most incredible wilderness and wild places to homes of leaders and sites of shame that we even commemorate as part of the learning process of the culture.",
        "It's important for people to have a touchstone as to what we are as a people and where we came from.",
        "And history is part of that, but also the protection of our resources, of maintaining these vital places as part of the fabric of American culture, is an important piece of business.",

        "That's correct.",
        "…was against a new law that allows visitors to carry loaded guns into national parks.",
        "And that law is going to take effect in February.",
        "So what does the Parks Service do to prepare for that?",
        "Well, the first order of business for the secretary of the interior is to start a rule making that's required once the law is passed, and it has to answer such questions as, you know, does that allow employees to carry weapons on the job now?",
        "Those are unanswered questions and there's a multitude of others that are not answered in the law.",
        "So once the rule is articulated, then in fact it's up to the Parks Service superintendent to follow those rules and implement those rules.",

        "And I think you feel some degree of cultural connection with the person because he is a Korean-American background.",

        "For example, that's the way to deter an individual from committing a heinous crime, and that way, the society maintain law and order.",
        "So in addition to the sort of predictable reaction, almost anyone would have, oh my goodness, this was one of us who did this horrible thing, there's something specifically Korean about a collective response, do you think?",
        "No.",
        "I think that's more of a cultural component.",
        "More importantly, I felt, here we go again, and there might be some backlash against Korean-Americans or Asian-Americans - increased anti-Asian violence.",
        "These are the common concern by many minority groups in America because we had a long history of racial oppression and racial violence against minority group.",

        "URLs will imitate real news outlets or will use headlines that are not actually reflected in the text of the article.",
        "So the spread of fake news has been really turbocharged by how the newsfeed algorithms worked, but I do think the entirely fabricated news can be easily spotted by professional fact-checkers.",
        "But beyond sort of outrageously obviously fake headlines, when you get into the content, how do you decide what is it's fake?",
        "Because, you know, a lot of reporters would tell you figuring out the facts is not always easy.",
        "You have to confirm numbers, figure out whether sources are lying, cross-check.",
        "I guess how involved do you think the fact-checking is going to get?",
        "I do think that especially in this stage, in this pilot phase that Facebook is deploying, the fact-checkers will try to concentrate on the glaringly fake news.",

        "So it's been at least since the beginning of 2015 that users could report something as false.",

        "I think that Facebook is obviously on a tightrope.",
        "The balance between avoiding that entirely fabricated stories get an enormous reach on their network is one concern, but the other concern, of course, is that they don't want to be censoring or reducing the reach of information that may still be accurate.",
