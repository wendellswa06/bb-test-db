        "You have people trying to cash in their tickets at the betting windows.",
        "Other people are leaving not knowing who won.",
        "And in the press room, we were just sitting there stunned, waiting for the official call.",
        "Why did racing officials disqualify Maximum Security?",
        "Yeah, so in the final bend, Maximum Security drifted wide into another horse's lane.",
        "That caused a domino effect, disrupting the progress of three other horses.",
        "Country House's jockey, Flavien Prat, was the one who filed the objection after the race.",
        "So three stewards, which are basically, like, referees, reviewed the footage and interviewed the affected jockeys.",
        "Eventually, steward Barbara Borden gave a brief statement saying that they unanimously decided to disqualify Maximum Security, then walked away without taking any questions.",
        "Wow, it sounds like a political conference.",
        "All right.",
        "Has anything like this ever happened before?",
        "So one other horse was stripped of his title after the fact.",
        "That was because he essentially failed a drug test back in 1968.",
        "But no, this - this was a first.",
        "And the outcome of this year's Derby was just so unpredictable.",
        "The original horse couldn't even compete.",
        "And the second favorite, Maximum Security, lost even though he crossed the finish line first.",
        "All right, so give us the story with Country House briefly.",
        "His trainer is named Bill Mott.",
        "Did you hear from him?",
        "Yeah, so Country House is a chestnut colt, bred in Kentucky.",
        "He was a longshot, with 65 to 1 odds of winning ahead of the race.",
        "The payout for his winning ticket was $132.40.",
        "That's the second-highest in Derby history.",
        "He started out the race slow but picked up momentum throughout.",
        "He definitely saw his opportunity going into that last turn.",
        "And he took it.",
        "In a press conference after the announcement, Mott himself said he was a little bit surprised to see how well the horse was doing.",
        "He called the victory bittersweet and said it's not how he wanted to win, but he knows it's a race that will be remembered for years to come.",
        "So I can't imagine this is done.",
        "Is there any chance for an appeal?",
        "There is.",
        "It's possible that the trainers or the owners could file an appeal with the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission.",
        "And in the meantime, Country House has a chance at the second jewel in the Triple Crown at the Preakness Stakes later this month."

        "Well, there's a combination of things.",
        "I think the fact is that, you know, his campaign style was better than hers.",
        "There was a thing the other day, a week or so ago, when we started to see that there was something really going on here, when Paul Kirk, who was the appointed, the interim senator, appointed after the death of Ted Kennedy, he said that even if Scott Brown wins this thing, I'm going to vote for health care.",
        "And that I think was part of the arrogance that a lot of people felt about Washington, about Democrats, about entitlement - that wait a second, if there's a feeling in the state where we don't want this health care, where we don't like what's going on in Washington, and yet the Democrat in the Senate seat at the time says I don't care, I'm voting for it, it was a sign, I think, that some independents said wait a second, this is not the way to go.",
        "And which goes a long way towards explaining why people wouldn't vote for Martha Coakley.",
        "Why would they vote for Scott Brown.",
        "What was appealing about his campaign?",
        "Well, I mean, he was, you know, he was I don't like the word, use the word attractive because there's more important things to talk about in politics, but of course he did the famous 1982 posing in Cosmopolitan.",
        "He had a good-looking family and a very aw-shucks kind of way of campaigning.",
        "You know, a lot of other Republicans were thinking about running, and perhaps they regret not running, but I think Scott Brown is probably the only Republican who could have won this seat.",
        "There are other ones who were establishment figures, who had long records.",
        "Scott Brown was hardly known at all.",
        "His win in the December 8th Republican primary was so underreported, and basically for most of December, the media, including much of the Democratic establishment, just thought this election was not worth covering.",
        "And what issues did he go out for?",
        "Well, he said, you know, is wasn't only health care.",
        "It was terror - the rights of terrorists, which he talked about over and over again.",
        "He didn't attack President Obama directly, but he talked about what was going on wrong in Washington, about the bailouts, about taxes, about terror, as I said, and of course about health care and the fact that Washington didn't care for us, you know.",
        "It wasn't Ted Kennedy's seat, as he said over and over again.",
        "It was the people's seat.",
        "When Scott Brown made his victory statement last night, the big headline said the people's seat, and I think that was part of his appeal from the beginning.",
        "President Obama did show up to campaign for Martha Coakley.",
        "He did cut an ad for her.",
        "He's now 0 for three: New Jersey, Virginia and Massachusetts.",
        "President Obama has not been able to deliver votes for a candidate, at least enough to win.",
        "How much of a referendum on the president, do you think?"

        "We heard that in New Jersey with Jon Corzine, and now we hear about Massachusetts, about Martha Coakley.",
        "All these candidates did have something left to be desired.",
        "Clearly, they were not the greatest candidates, but we've seen bad candidates win if they have something to say.",
        "We've seen bad candidates defeat good candidates if they have something to say.",
        "And the question is: Could these Democrats have something to say if they were not getting a lead from Washington?",
        "And the fact is that the Democrats, not to say that they should have had health care passed by now because it's been taking a half a century so far to get health care passed -going back to Harry Truman - and yet they had 60 votes for at least eight months.",
        "They still a lot of people didn't like the way with the horse-trading, with the dealing, with the cajoling, with the bribery, some people say, and they say that's not the Washington should work.",
        "And what about local Massachusetts issues?",
        "Was that part of this campaign to any large extent?",
        "Well, in some sense, yes, because Massachusetts already has health care, and that was instituted by a Republican governor, Mitt Romney, several years ago.",
        "And so maybe perhaps a lot of people felt that, well, you know, I don't want to subsidize this national health care bill because I like what I have here.",
        "But also again, it was part of the, you know, the Democrats, both senators were Democrats, all 10 House members were Democrats.",
        "A lot of times in Massachusetts, you'll elect Republican governors because they're tired of one-party rule, and perhaps that was part of the result on last night, as well.",
        "We're going to be talking a little bit later about how this plays into 2010 elections and what sorts of lessons might be applicable from this Massachusetts race to races around the country, but just a couple quick logistical questions.",
        "When does Scott Born get sworn in?",
        "Well, there was a debate.",
        "Before that, there was some talk about maybe the Democrats would like to keep him out as long as they can, and by state law, it could take you up to 15 days to swear somebody in, and in the meantime, perhaps there was going to be some kind of a way to keep Brown out for 15 days, and then somehow on some kind of an agreement on health care.",
        "But Jim Webb, the senator, the Democratic senator from Virginia, said yesterday, look, no tomfoolery here.",
        "He won fair and square.",
        "There's no issue.",
        "There's no controversy over his swearing-in, over his election.",
