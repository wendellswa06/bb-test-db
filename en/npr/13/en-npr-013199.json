        "There is a lot of back and forth on whether who's willing to compromise or not.",

        "But the House Democrats have serious reservations about a lot of things in the Senate bill, mostly the lack of public option, the higher taxes.",
        "There's - the pro-choice Democrats in the House don't like the Stupak Amendment, and they say they will not vote for it if it is included.",
        "The pro-life House Democrats say if you strip the Stupak Amendment out of the House version, they won't vote for that.",

        "Well, if some of the reason for the upset is frustration with Washington over, you know, the $300 billion the deals to Nebraska and Louisiana and the unions not having to pay the taxes on the Cadillac plans and just the sort of feeling of back-room deals from a president who campaigned as saying he was going to publicize the whole thing on C-SPAN.",

        "But there are others, like Evan Bayh, who said look, this party is going too far left.",
        "We're making a big mistake by not dealing or compromising or working with Republicans the way Bill Clinton did after the 1994 Democratic debacle, and we should be going that way.",
        "So the Democrats still can't decide which way to go: left or to the right.",
        "And Dick Wadhams, do you think this now gives some fire to the Republican argument that they have got the voters' voice on health care and that they don't need to pass this legislation?",

        "The polls across the nation are showing that the voters are rejecting this health care bill.",
        "I would personally be delighted if the Democrats ram through the Senate version of the health care bill through the House of Representatives.",
        "There would be one more act of arrogance coming on top of the bribery of senators to buy their votes, coming on top of the buyoff of labor bosses with the exemption on the tax on Cadillac health care plans.",
        "That would be adding insult to injury in the eyes of the voters if they rammed through that Senate bill through the House of Representative.",

        "Folks are moving to a more-independent position, to a nonpartisan position.",
        "Again, there's angry there's anger.",
        "I don't think that this jeopardizes the rest of the president's agenda because I hope one of the things that came out of yesterday is that it's time that the Democrats get more confrontational because bipartisanship, an attempt at bipartisanship, didn't work.",
        "The Republicans sat out just to say no, just to stop any form of health care reform, and I think it's time that we point that out and that we show that the voters of American of 14 months ago voted for change, and the agents of no to change has been the Republican Party in a wholesale way."

        "Mr.�VASSILIADIS: Ken, I'll tell you, I think one of the what's made it very, very difficult, one is probably we need more of a common enemy.",
