        "There's no doubt that we're frustrated by that.",
        "So I think everybody bears some responsibility, certainly, including the White House.",
        "So Dick Wadhams, that puts (unintelligible) a little bit to your point that the White House is trying to blame circumstances on the ground in Massachusetts.",
        "Mr.�WADHAMS: Yeah, the finger-pointing started yesterday.",
        "Even before polls closed, the White House sources were trashing Martha Coakley and her campaign, which I found incredible because I think that the hand that was dealt to her in terms of a health care monstrosity that the people of America were rejecting but it goes deeper than that.",
        "It goes back to the failed stimulus bill that was signed right here in Denver, Colorado, this past February, which has not had any appreciable impact on the economy.",
        "In fact, the unemployment rate has hit 10 percent.",
        "It's the cap and trade legislation, which even the the White House is now indicating they're backing off of after that was another issue that Scott Brown put front and center in the campaign.",
        "The fact of the matter is the Obama Democratic agenda has failed, and the people of the United States are rejecting it.",
        "And so I look forward to what Billy is laying out, that the Democrats are going to be even more confrontational.",
        "They're going to continue to try to ram this agenda down people's throats because the results in November will reflect continued opposition to that.",
        "And let's get some callers in here.",

        "I mean, Obama is well liked in this state by many people, not just Democrats.",
        "And I think it really had to be a referendum on her.",
        "She wasn't really - first of all, she didnt put herself out there.",
        "She kind of snoozed through Christmas, didn't really campaign at all.",
        "And then, when she did campaign, she campaigned in Eastern Massachusetts.",
        "And people in Central and Western Massachusetts have been ignored by many politicians in this state.",
        "And it didn't help her any by not campaigning too much out here as well.",
        "So Jennifer, if you weren't surprised, but we keep talking about what a huge surprise this was, and the president is talking about what a huge surprise this was, what did you and Massachusetts know that we, nationally, didnt?",
        "Well, I guess, what I mean by not a huge surprise is that - because of the way the campaign went.",
        "Like I said, she kind of just sat back over the holidays, really didnt say much at all.",
        "And the fact is is not a lot of people are big fans of Martha Coakley.",
        "So I was surprised that it got as heated - or at the end - as it did.",
        "And I never imagined that Ted Kennedy's seat or a Democratic seat would actually go to a Republican.",
        "I'm disappointed in that greatly because he did so much for this state for so long.",

        "What's going on there?",
        "I - well I think - again, I think the senator has a - as the leader of the partisan opposition to George W.",
        "Bush for seven years of his term has - got some scars and some welts coming out of those battles like every warrior does.",
        "But we're very confident the campaign has been moving in the right direction, that the polling is going to eventually catch up with the momentum that we've been seeing.",
        "There is not a Senator-elect Brown in the field in Nevada.",
        "It's a pretty weak field of candidates.",
        "And the senator has anticipated a tough race for a long time, and that's why his campaign started a year ago.",
        "Could I just say add something to that?",
        "I think - but you - I think people would have said the same thing about Scott Brown at this point in the campaign, that there is no strong Republican candidate out there.",
        "And, yet, in a field against anonymous Republicans, Harry Reid's numbers are poor.",
        "And you could always make the case similar to what Chris Dodd went through in Connecticut before he was forced out.",
        "Yeah, Ken, but again, I mean - you know, I don't know Scott Brown but as I've observed the campaign, he has a lot of charisma and worked hard and was a very, very unique candidate and a very good candidate, obviously.",
        "The field that is running against Senator Reid in Nevada is a little better known.",
        "Theyve been in politics for awhile.",
        "One of the candidates has run has had two failed campaigns in the last two cycles.",
        "The other one is a former Republican Party chairman who had quite a bit of controversy inside the Republican Party with the Ron Paul people and a couple of contested conventions.",
        "You've got another candidate who's very, very extreme right who I dont think would be able to get pass 35 percent."

        "So right now, you've got a - some of these polls are almost like referendums on Reid, and an indication of the fights that he's been through for six or seven years.",
        "Once we get to an election and the states picking between the United States Senate majority leader who's done a tremendous amount for the state of Nevada and how important that is for a small state versus a field of not-successful candidates who are - or not been successful in previous parts of those careers.",

        "He was the weakest incumbent governor we've seen in, literally, five decades in Colorado.",
        "He withdrew and Mayor John Hickenlooper is now the presumed Democratic nominee for governor.",
        "His problem is is that he went trotting off to Copenhagen a few weeks ago with Barack Obama to the climate conference.",
        "He stood by Barack Obama and signed the failed stimulus bill here in Denver.",
        "He has risen he has raised taxes in Denver repeatedly.",
        "There's really not a lot of difference between John Hickenritter(ph) as I like to call him - and Governor Bill Ritter and Barack Obama.",
        "And then, there's an appointed senator, Michael Bennett, who - he was reappointed to replace Senator Ken Salazar.",
        "And Michael Bennett is trailing likely Republican opponents across the board.",
        "So this health care monstrosity which Bennett voted for with which John Hickenlooper supports as well, there will be a lot of national issues playing in both the Senate and governors' races in 2010 in Colorado."

        "This is by New York Democrat Charlie Rangel, and he says he'll introduce legislation next year reinstating the draft.",
        "It is a form of grandstanding, I believe, because surely Congressman Rangel knows that 70 percent of the people in the country in all polls do not want a draft.",

        "So if we're going to have the kind of foreign policy this administration has been pursuing, or wants to talk about in Iran or North Korea, we're going to have to have a bigger army.",
