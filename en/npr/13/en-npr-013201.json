        "That was very fortunate.",
        "I think the media, in the beginning, were focusing on his immigrant background Korean-American identity, as well as his Asian background.",
        "So, you know, South Korea, they kept mentioning that particular point.",
        "But what's race, racial identity, ethnic identity has got to do with this mass murder?",
        "There is no connection.",
        "Therefore, media began to focus on other issues such as gun control or mental health.",
        "So that was very fortunate, and being far removed from Virginia in Los Angeles in California, we did not hear much about anti-Asian, anti-Korean-American violence.",
        "You wrote in your opinion piece that you were worried some of the coverage would fall back onto the stereotype of an Asian student under enormous pressure to succeed, you know, repressed emotions exploding under the pressure.",
        "That has not been borne out, you think?",
        "No because, you know, there are more than 100 million students in America under tremendous pressure to excel in school, but you know, this is one person and one act, a very rare act mind you, and so I mean, it's very difficult to connect being an Asian-American student pressured to excel in school and committing this crime.",
        "So it's a very remote possibility.",
        "Of course, in the beginning when he came, eight-years-old, he may have faced such pressure or problem to adjust, you know, American society, and perhaps we may have done better to help him out, but I don't know.",
        "We don't know that.",
        "But you know, whole model minority stereotypical image of Asian-American, Korean-Americans a model minority, and this crime - I don't think there is a connection at all.",

        "I just wanted to quickly point out that as an American Muslim living in a post-September-11 era, I can completely relate to the Korean-American community and the Asian-American communities because what happened September 11 had quite a bit of backlash against American Muslims.",
        "And even though I think the majority of Americans understood and they were understandable that this was by a very small, tiny minority in the Muslim community - and actually they were not even American Muslims, they were people who were just coming to America for a specific thing.",
        "But nonetheless, it did gave the people who had prejudices and hatred toward the Muslims and probably generally all people who did not believe like them or look like them, it gave them a platform to go out and speak against Islam and Muslims.",
        "But I can - what I would like to convey to the Korean-American community is that the majority of Americans, in my opinion, they are understandable.",
        "They understand that in each culture, each religion, each tradition, there are people who are extremists and they will commit an act of violence, but the majority of the people are understandable."

        "And actually I had the same reaction after September 11, when the planes hit the towers.",
        "And when the first one hit, I thought maybe the pilot was drunk.",
        "When the second one hit, you know, I thought maybe - I was pretty sure it was a terrorist act, and I was praying oh God, please don't let this be a Muslim.",

        "Yes.",
        "I talked to many of my colleagues and students, and most minority persons feel the same way: I hope it's not one of us.",
        "And when the shooter was identified as a Korean-American, there was a big, huge sigh of relief for, you know, every other group except Korean-American.",
        "So it's a shared experience and probably points out the current state of race relations in America.",

        "And for example, I as an ethnic studies professor of Korean-American heritage, I have to represent an entire group of Korean-American community now just doing an interview, which is a tremendous responsibility and burden, and any misstep and any mistake I make is going to have negative consequences.",
        "So it's a burden that we carry all the time.",
        "Do you think the media coverage before the shooter's identity was known and then afterwards, in terms of describing as Asian or Korean-American, was fair?",
        "Do you think people hammered on that point too much?",
        "Do you think it was relevant to the case when the media was covering it?",
        "I don't think it was relevant, particularly when the media kept showing Cho Seung Hui from South Korea, and it shows that he's a foreigner, he's an immigrant, and there is a, you know, a suggestion that being immigrant and foreigner has something to do with this heinous crime.",
        "And if we jump a little further, then you could blame the entire immigrant community or anybody who is not a citizen, and I've heard some commentator asking: he's not an American citizen, how could he obtain a gun?",
        "And blaming his nationality.",
        "And so therefore, they kept saying Cho Seung Hui instead of Seung Hui Cho, and looking at his background.",
        "He grew up in America, and he seemed to have culturally and linguistically assimilated very well.",
