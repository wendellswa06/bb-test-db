        "Now I don't know if that will happen, as a matter of fact I doubt it will happen, but it is curious in many ways.",
        "It's more curious with John McCain because he's the author of this campaign-reform bill, and if he decides not to accept the public funds and to go out and raise the money, I certainly think it gives the license for Barack Obama to do exactly the same thing.",

        "Now what this means for the future of the city's Olympic bid and for pro-football ambitions, we will find out from New York correspondent Mike Pesca.",
        "Mike, what happened up there in Albany?",
        "Well, the deal was to have the state and city pay 300 million for the Jets to build a stadium in Manhattan.",
        "The Jets were going to be spending over a billion of their own dollars, but first, the plan had to clear some hurdles, as you can imagine.",
        "Two months ago, they cleared the first hurdle.",
        "Since they were going to be building the stadium on top of what's now railroad yards, they had to buy the land from the MTA.",
        "When the MTA approved it, Mayor Michael Bloomberg declared, `The public has spoken,' even though the MTA board is just a collection of political appointees.",
        "So of all these hurdles, by the way, a public referendum was never part of them.",
        "So here comes the next hurdle, which was this vote yesterday.",
        "It was to come from the Public Authorities Control Board, and we found out that approval was not forthcoming.",
        "You know, I'm not that familiar with the Public Authorities Control Board, and to say I'm not that familiar, actually I've never heard of it.",

        "The three men in the room have spoken.",
        "Well, there is a mayor's race going on, and maybe that's got something to do with this broken stadium deal.",
        "Yeah, this is an irony, I think, in that Bloomberg was on the losing side of the stadium deal but it may wind up helping him.",
        "Now think about it.",
        "If the stadium is off the table as an issue, will voters really punish the mayor for an idea that's come and gone?",
        "Mike, beyond the city's politics and beyond its football team, wasn't this stadium--didn't it have an important role to play in the city's bid for the Olympic Games, which is something the whole country might get behind?",
        "It did.",
        "It did.",
        "It was of national importance mainly for that and also because it was to have been the most expensive stadium ever built, three times as expensive as number two, but as far as the question, `What does this do to the Olympics bid?",
        "let's let Mayor Michael Bloomberg answer that.",
        "If we don't have a stadium, we cannot get the Olympics.",
        "But Bloomberg says he'll keep trying.",
        "Maybe he can get a stadium built in Queens.",
        "All along, Queens was seen as the Solomonic solution.",

        "The last game there they lost to the Steelers, 34-to-7, and a young boy named Mike Pesca stole a tuft of grass from the field."
