        "I mean, this is my favorite Shakespeare play \"\"Much Ado about Nothing.\"\" I mean, the fact of the matter is that Rush Limbaugh is a very influential voice in the Conservative movement.",
        "The Democrats have decided, well, George Bush isn't around, no Dick Cheney, No Karl Rove.",
        "We need a new bogeyman, we need a new scapegoat, and Rush Limbaugh is the perfect embodiment for the Democrats now to find somebody who they love to hate.",
        "The fact of the matter is, I listen to Rush's show on a daily basis.",
        "I enjoy it.",
        "I think it was a mistake for Michael Steele to have called his show ugly and incendiary because it's not.",
        "And that's what he apologized for, but the Democrats to go around and to suggest that Rush is the head of the party is wrong.",
        "But, listening to his show today, Tony, I found this interesting.",
        "Rush said on his show today, said, well, if the Democrats are going to say that I'm the leader of the Republican Party and that President Obama is the head of the Democratic Party as well as the president, then why don't we have a debate.",
        "Since they want to make me the leader of the party, let us have a debate.",
        "So, now, I will aback from the Democrats and say, the Democrats are so interested in pointing and painting Mr. Limbaugh's the leader of the Republican Party, which he is not, then why not the president and Mr. Limbaugh have a debate so that will satisfy the Democrats' zeal to make him the leader of the party.",
        "One of the questions that I would have for both of you before we go on to another topic is this.",
        "Rush Limbaugh aside, is this distraction healthy for a party that by its own admission is trying to rebuild the coming off of the losses that it suffered last year.",
        "Sherrilyn, you first.",
        "Ironically, I think this is actually all going to end up being helpful to the Republican Party because what their party is going to learn is that while millions of people, some say 20 million, that maybe an exaggerated figure, like to listen to Rush Limbaugh, it's not necessarily true that 20 million people want to vote Rush Limbaugh.",
        "And I think that many Americans, Republicans included, who may enjoy the show in the same way that many Democrats may enjoy listening to Michael Moore, they're going to still vote what makes sense for them and their families.",
        "And that means a more pragmatic way.",
        "They're not going to be voting their most extremist impulses that may make them laugh when they listen on the radio or that they may even like when they listen on the radio.",
        "The reality is, we're in a serious economic crisis, we've got two wars going on, we've got problems at home, and people vote for what's going to help them and their families.",
        "And what that means is that Rush has largely becoming irrelevant.",
        "It's a fringe element of the Republican Party, it didn't work with Sarah Palin, and ironically, it's going to help the Republicans refashion their party into one that's relevant and that it speaks to more than the fringe element that would be willing to vote as well as listen to Rush's policy.",
        "An argument could be made, Ron Christie, that what Rush Limbaugh is doing is galvanizing the base of the party at a time when, if you listen to what Michael Steele and others who are party leaders say, they want to expand the base of the party.",
        "Is this going to help them do that?",
        "I think it will, and I absolutely agree with Sherrilyn's premise, of course I don't agree with the context, but I agree with the premise.",
        "This will be a good soul searching for the Republican Party.",
        "We have been shellacked in the last two elections and the party needs to recognize what its for.",
        "You win elections by addition rather than subtraction, and we've lost voters by the millions over the last two elections.",
        "We need to have a honest soul searching and recognize what we stand for, what the principles are for being a Republican Party and offer clear policy alternatives in areas where we disagree with the president.",
        "And I think this will be a good process for us because we need to articulate what we're for as oppose to saying we're against this and we're against that.",
        "We need to for something, be very positive, be very forward-looking and that's what I think is going to be the net result of this Rush Limbaugh flap.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's move on to another topic.",
        "The economy is causing havoc as we both know, as we all know, on both sides of the Atlantic, and of course this was the main topic of conversation between President Obama and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown in their meeting yesterday and in his appearance before a joint session of Congress today.",
        "The prime minister is saying that the financial crisis is a global problem and it needs global solutions.",
        "My question to you Sherrilyn is will the Brown-Obama relationship be similar to that of Bush and Blair, thinking now how the relationship between those two may have cost Mr. Blair?",
        "Well, to paraphrase Ron, let us hope not in content (laughing), in the sense that I think the idea of a strong U.S.- Britain alliance is a great one and an important one.",
        "It was unfortunately misused by President Bush to the detriment of both the United States and Great Britain.",
        "And so there's an opportunity to rebuild and refashion that relationship between Barack Obama and Gordon Brown.",
        "and it's a good idea, I think, to begin on an economic piece because it is a global crisis, and because there are many people all over the world who are pretty p.o.'d at the United States, at some of our lax financial practices that really permitted this despite a lot of control on this country and to have a domino effect throughout the world.",
        "So, I think it's important for Obama to reach out to some key allies and to begin to talk about a global solution and to rebuild relationship.",
        "It's a smart move.",
        "Gordon Brown is a pragmatic, low-key guy.",
        "He lacks the charisma of Tony Blair, and hopefully will lack some of the impulses of Tony Blair that led him into so much trouble.",
        "Now, Ron, in your former life working for former President Bush you met with Gordon Brown who was then chancellor of the Exchequer in charge of British finances, just how sincere would you say, on one hand, and how capable on the other do youth think Brown is with regard to solving the economic crisis?",
        "I had to tell you, Tony, I led a delegation on behalf of United States to Great Britain, upon which Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were the co-sponsors of the event, and I sat down with the then Exchequer of the currency Gordon Brown for several hours on a one-on-one consultation.",
        "And his intellect is remarkable.",
        "His grasp and his comprehension of economic issues to me, I found, was particularly staggering.",
        "I mean, he really does understand what he's talking about.",
        "So, I find that the American-British relationship has always been a strong one.",
        "I think that this President Obama and this new prime minister need to sit down.",
        "I'm glad that they have the opportunity to sit down face to face to talk about the impact in a reach of this crisis which is reached around the world.",
        "We must find a way out of this, and one of the ways that will find the way out of this is close consultation and working with their allies both here in the United States and in the banking industry as well our foreign leaders and our foreign friends around the world to dig our way out of this.",
        "So I'm very encouraged not only by Gordon Brown's meeting with the president this morning, but also with the opportunity for the prime minister to address the joint session of the Congress later in the day.",
        "All right.",
        "Just before we go, one last topic we want to hear very, very briefly because we only have a few seconds left.",
        "It's another round for an Obama cabinet appointee.",
        "This time Kathleen Sebelius, who are secretary of Health and Human Services, Sherilyn, I can break it down at the one question, really, simply, it's actually a yes or no. Do you think that they've checked her taxes?"

        "You certainly have left some of the bureaucratic luggage that comes with the job.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think the answer to that is yes and no. That is, no, I can't affect change over a broader range of topics in areas than I could in the White House, because I had more power in the White House.",
        "On the other hand, if I use my influence now in concentrated ways and I make efforts based on, you know, what I've learned and what I know and who I know, my ability to raise funds in concentrated ways, I think I can make more of a difference.",
        "So that, for example, this system we've set up to provide care and treatment for AIDS is highly efficient, very cost effective, much cheaper than any government program could ever be.",
        "I've got over a hundred volunteers doing a lot of this training work.",
        "And negotiating the details of the cheapest AIDS drugs in the world is something that I could do as a private citizen that I could not have done had I been president.",
        "The two initiatives that you are pushing now, that's the AIDS initiative in Africa most specifically, but here in the United States, and the childhood obesity.",
        "Quickly, talk to us about that and why you decided to push these two issues?",
        "Let me first start with the childhood obesity.",
        "I decided to push that because the Heart Association came to me after my heart surgery and said I'd become the most visible heart patient in America and they'd like me to do something to continue to increase public awareness and to help them with their endeavors.",
        "So I looked around and decided the most important thing I could do was try to increase public awareness and public action in the area of childhood obesity, which is going to lead to massive heart problems and is already leading to, interestingly enough, adult onset diabetes in our kids.",
        "This is going to impose enormous strains on the health-care system.",
        "We're here in Atlanta doing this interview.",
        "Emory University just did a study which showed that over 25 percent of health spending increases between '87 and 2001 came out of obesity increase.",
        "So I did it because I think it'll save a generation of children.",
        "I think it's essential to the health of the health-care system.",
        "I don't think we can succeed with health-care reform at affordable rates unless we do something about it.",
        "And I think there are ways we can do it.",
        "We can cut down the fat and sugar content of food that we eat at home, that we eat in restaurants, that our children are served at school cafeterias, increase exercise and get more kids involved in public awareness.",

        "AIDS I did because I was angry when I got out of the White House, that even with the money that we were then spending, so few people were getting the medicine, and there was so little care in rural areas in Africa and the rest of the world.",
        "So now we're providing medicine to a hundred and ten thousand people.",

        "Why do you think it's so?",

        "He seems to be a very impressive person, and the fact that he's a conservative Republican is consistent with President Bush's winning the election.",
        "The only thing I've seen in these documents that bothers me that I really want to see the Senate explore is that he apparently had a big fight within the Reagan administration, where he was to the right of other people in the Reagan Justice Department in claiming that the Congress could keep the Supreme Court from hearing all kinds of cases involving school busings, school prayer, abortion, flag burning, lots of other things.",
