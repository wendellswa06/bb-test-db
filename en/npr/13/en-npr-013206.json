        "That's better than two hours.",

        "JOHN: People like Vega make ten million trips northbound at this port of entry every year for work or business.",
        "More than 50 million more legal trips from Tijuana to San Diego every year are made by locals who go shopping, to visit friends and family, or by tourists.",
        "This is the busiest border crossing in the world.",
        "From a pedestrian overpass high above the freeway, you can see cars lined up in multiple lanes, as far as the eye can see, waiting to get across.",
        "Immigration reform is still alive and kicking.",
        "The bill was barely breathing but now it might return to the Senate floor as early as this week.",
        "Supporters say it would provide a comprehensive overhaul of American immigration policies.",
        "Opponents regard it as amnesty for lawbreakers.",
        "Amnesty, it's become the buzzword of the debate.",

        "Welcome to the program.",
        "Thank you.",
        "How would you define the word, amnesty?",
        "Well, I would follow the Greek definition, which is amnestia meaning oblivion.",
        "So it is really an act which erases all previous legal remembrance.",
        "So it's a situation where you're already wiping the slate clean.",

        "I think it's loaded because it's used rhetorically by different parties in debates to signal a particular position.",
        "So I think in the current immigration debate, for example, it's used to suggest a sort of forgiving of lawbreaking.",
        "It's used in a loaded way to suggest that.",
        "We are meant to be a law-abiding society but we're not really playing by our own rules.",
        "Does the immigration reform bill - that's now being considered - does it provide amnesty?",
        "I would say, technically speaking, it's not an amnesty because the qualifications to getting the legal status are quite onerous.",
        "People have to demonstrate that they have permanent employment; people have to leave the country.",
        "So there are a whole set of measures, which are anything but oblivion.",
        "On the other hand, of course, it is true to say that this would be a substantial benefit for a significant group of undocumented migrants who at the moment have no avenue to gaining a legal status.",
        "So in that sense, it is putting behind them something that they did which at the moment disqualifies them from a very substantial good, which is legal status.",
        "So I guess my answer is slightly complicated to say that, technically speaking, what was proposed in the immigration reform bill was not an amnesty.",
        "But in terms of colloquial usage, yes, it is really what we often think of as an amnesty.",
        "We want to let people hear what President Bush had to say when he addressed the issue directly this past week.",
        "President GEORGE W.",
        "BUSH: Amnesty is forgiveness with no penalty for people who have broken our laws to get here.",
        "In contrast, this bill requires illegal workers to pay a fine, to register with the government, to undergo background checks, to pay their back taxes, to hold down a steady job and to learn English in a set period of time.",
        "So, Jacqueline Bhabha, is this then discussion of amnesty?",
        "Is this about the meaning of the word or do you consider it or think it might be rhetorical cover for a deeper political disagreement?",
        "I think that is what it is.",
        "It is a rhetorical cover for a very deep political disagreement about the way forward with immigration.",
        "And, of course, this is a very serious problem.",
        "And many countries have tried to address the role of amnesty or legalization as part of a series of measures to bring people who are essential part of the workforce into the citizenry without abolishing effective immigration enforcement.",
        "So I think in this context, it is interesting to look at Spain.",
        "The Spanish government decided in 2005 to grant an amnesty to 700,000 - over 700,000 undocumented migrants.",
        "And the terms were much more generous than the terms that was proposed in this immigration bill.",
        "All the undocumented migrants have to show though is that they have been the country for up to five months and that they have no criminal record and they have a job."

        "So Chris, how does this compare - this recession - how does it compare to other recessions?",
        "Well, in the early 1980s, we saw a 10.8-percent unemployment rate, so that would be worse than what some economists are predicting, but that was one of the worst recessions in the entire post-war period, you know, since World War II.",

        "The economy keeps losing all these jobs.",
        "What's at the root of it?",
        "Well, there's a lot of causes, but probably the biggest is that before the recession even started, the banking system in this country, and probably the world, was in terrible shape, and money is still not flowing right to a lot of average people or businesses.",
        "You know, it's harder to get car loans right now, harder to get mortgages, credit cards, and all that results in less spending by people, and companies, too.",
        "I mean, if they can't get a loan, it's harder for them to hire people and you know - so, that results in job cuts.",
        "And then you get into this cycle where people get laid off and then there's even less consumer spending, so more people get laid off, and you know, it just continues."
