        "Well, nobody can say that quite yet.",

        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "The respected Consumer Sentiment Index put out by the University of Michigan came out today and it was up, surprisingly, although not a lot.",
        "It was up a from a 28-year low also, so you can't read too much into this.",
        "Here again, the reason seems to be those government stimulus checks gave people a sense that they just might be able to cope with gas prices and the dropping value of their homes.",

        "But like most things in life, the devil is in the details.",
        "And for over a century, geologists have been puzzling over how and when the canyon formed."

        "I shook his hand and find destitution and told him I fully supported what he was doing.",
        "But just the way that he went about pursuing his cause and the actions that he took that landed him in prison, I think, brought too much negative attention to the cause, and kind of detracted from people who have a right to make that choice to die with dignity's ability to forward that cause.",
        "When you say negative publicity - negative attention, by filming them, by seemingly seeking publicity?",
