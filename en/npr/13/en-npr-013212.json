        "For example, one of the things we found out after we started to study this is that there's twice as many people in Oregon, who if they - for some reason can't get assisted suicide or can't access a doctor, simply stop eating and drinking.",
        "And then I tell you that we did - we found out that they had very peaceful deaths that gave them a lot of control.",
        "In addition, it's been become increasingly clear that physicians - for patients who have suffering or pain that can't be controlled - can offer deep sedation for people until they die.",
        "That's not considered euthanasia.",
        "So I think that there are very many different ways that people can maintain control and avoid suffering at the end of life.",

        "Well, I don't have any direct knowledge about that, but my opinion is that people who are pressuring terminally ill people to end their lives prematurely are still callous that I doubt that they really care whether they're suffering or not.",
