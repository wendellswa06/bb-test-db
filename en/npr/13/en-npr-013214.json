        "There are a lot of smokers out there who are looking for less risky alternatives to their cigarettes but who find it difficult to give up tobacco altogether.",
        "The tobacco industry does have a long history of making misleading claims, think light cigarettes, which turned out to be just as bad as regular cigarettes.",
        "But some tobacco experts are keeping an open mind this time - why?",
        "- because it's the first time the FDA will decide whether there's enough scientific evidence to support what the company wants to say.",
        "Michael Eriksen is the dean of the Georgia State University School of Public Health.",
        "This product appears to be less harmful than cigarette smoking.",
        "And if that's established by the evidence that they have presented to the FDA, then I think they should be able to say that in their advertising and in warning statements.",
        "But some experts are skeptical.",
        "Michael Steinberg heads the Rutgers Tobacco Control Program.",
        "He says snus may be safer than cigarettes, but it's not totally safe.",
        "It certainly still contains nicotine, which has physiologic effects in terms of raising heart rate, blood pressure, etcetera.",
        "And it can increase risk for certain cardiovascular outcomes, such as stroke.",
        "There's also evidence snus may increase the risk for other health problems, such as pancreatic cancer.",
        "So although there's evidence that snus may have reduced harm, reduced harm products are not the same as safe products.",
        "Another worry is that snus may actually help smokers keep smoking by giving them kind of a crutch to get them through those times when they can't have a cigarette.",
        "And, Steinberg says, the move could end up hooking a new generation on nicotine.",
        "If you imagine a young person who sees on a label that this is a less harmful tobacco product, they may interpret that as, oh, this is not harmful at all.",
        "I might as well try it and see what it's all about.",
        "And that person can still become addicted to the nicotine effects, which could either lead to them becoming a long-term smokeless tobacco user or could escalate to them starting to smoke cigarettes.",
        "The FDA is holding a two-day hearing beginning April 9 to get advice about whether snus should become the first tobacco product that can officially claim it's safer than cigarettes.",

        "Now when I think about what comes next in the movement and where I fit in, I think that some of it is about can we build coalitions and create entrances for people from broad backgrounds, for people who might not have the same goals, but believe in the same outcomes?",
        "And the second is, can we be as organized on the inside as we are on the outside?",
