        "So if you'll recall a couple of years ago he created a program called deferred action for childhood arrivals.",
        "And through that program, they basically allowed undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children to register with federal government and have any deportation proceedings against them deferred for a period of two years.",
        "And what they're talking about is expanding that now to their parents, to undocumented immigrants, who've been living in the country for a long period of time.",
        "So they're just talking about basically expanding that power, expanding that process.",
        "And is it clear that he has the legal ability to do that without congressional approval, or is that up for debate?",
        "Great question.",
        "I mean, it's a source of a lawsuit right now.",
        "And it was brought forth by a group of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents.",
        "And in it, basically they're arguing two things - A, that they're being asked to violate their own oath by not deporting people that they find to be in the country illegally, and B, that the president himself went too far because in the Constitution it says that the president has to faithfully execute the laws that are passed by Congress.",
        "And they're saying that by doing this, he's basically violating the will of Congress."
