        "You're welcome.",

        "Thank you, Ira.",
        "Karl, let me begin with you first, and talk about why is the canyon so mysterious to geologists?",
        "It seems - it's there.",
        "There's a river running through it.",
        "It seems simple.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Yes, well, I suppose an even deeper question is: Why is it to fascinating to the world's public?",
        "But to answer the question of why it's mysterious, I don't think it really is that mysterious.",
        "I think that, as you said earlier, the basic ideas of how a river carves through rock to carve a canyon are well-understood.",
        "The timing of how it happened, I think, is reasonably well-understood.",
        "Maybe the age of the canyon, in my opinion, is very well-understood.",
        "But the events that led to the carving of the canyon, I think, are challenging because, as you said, it's an erosional landscape, and the record is being carried away."

        "So as you go farther back into the history of this iconic landscape, I think the evidence becomes more fragmentary, and there's much more room for discussion and debate about how we got to where we are now.",
        "Richard Young, your work on the Grand Canyon began at the same time as Ivo's, 50 years ago, when you discovered that rivers around there used to flow east and not west, as they do today.",
        "How is that possible?",
        "How'd you find that out?",
        "Well, I was sent out to work on a different problem altogether, but eventually, over a period of years, it became obvious that there was another canyon right next to the existing canyon, which is kind of amazing since all the erosion that has occurred.",
        "So it just kind of gradually emerged that there was a much older story, but we had a hard time getting the actual age confirmations until, in fact, only about a couple years ago.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Ivo, your research on the Grand Canyon was sort of a plug at the western edge of the canyon, correct, where the Colorado couldn't have flowed before a certain time?",
        "It's an immovable object.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "So how certain can we be of the age of the Grand Canyon, based on that immovable object?",
        "Well, I think one has to start by defining a few terms.",
        "The history is very complicated, and we should be talking about the Grand Canyon that we see today and the Colorado River that we see today.",
        "But in reality, these are just the last episode of a long chain of events stretching back millions, if not tens of millions, of years.",
        "So it is - one really has to say: How much departure for what we see today will we accept and still view it within the same framework?",
        "Now, the river that we see today, because of the immovable object at the mouth - and let me explain to the audience what that would be.",
        "It is a sequence of deposits that were laid down in the conditions of interior drainage.",
        "You can get the mental picture of that by going to any basin in Nevada, (unintelligible) at the bottom, no river flowing through it."

        "Those are the kinds of deposits that you see at the mouth of the Grand Canyon.",
        "And they have a date and age that has been debated, but we're zeroing in on it, for sure around six million years - it could be less.",
        "It could be less.",
        "And so that, in a sense, are - no, not in a sense, rather conclusively, I think - gives you an upper boundary for the age of the carving of the present canyon.",
        "So we're looking at six, for sure, perhaps as little as between five and six.",
        "So this was not just - as most people, and everybody, I think, the general public thinks a gradual decay of the river down through, you know, a period of millions of years.",
        "It's a lot more complicated.",
        "Things were going up.",
        "There was thrusting of tectonics happening, things like that, Ivo, at the same time.",
        "Sure, sure.",
        "But really what - fundamentally one has to think of river systems - and this has been one of the great lessons, I think.",
        "One has to think of them as competing entities which respond to external circumstances - uplift, glaciers, you name it.",
        "Each of these entities is trying to increase its kingdom by a variety of means, like a headwater, erosion or what have you.",
        "And ultimately, some of these entities, some of these drainages become advantaged by what happens, external causes, and some become disadvantaged.",
        "So they're all duking it all, and some of them win out.",
        "And what we see today is the result of a long process of such responses to external conditions - the physical equivalent of biological evolution, I might add.",
        "I see.",
        "There is a - there was a theory that there was a giant lake - and Richard, you can jump in on this, too.",
        "There's a giant lake that was around here that spilled over and carried away all kinds of stuff and maybe some of the secrets of the Grand Canyon.",
        "Can you tell us about that, Richard?",
        "Well, basically, that was a theory that went back to the 1960s, but we didn't have good age control at that time.",
        "But basically, when Ivo and I started working together, he started at the top of a section, kind of with the younger rocks, and I really started at the bottom and worked my way up.",
        "So the lake story is really - it really belongs in the younger part of the history, rather than where I started at the bottom.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And are we ever going to be able to solve the mystery, do you all think, of how old the Grand Canyon is and how it finally - Karl, you're shaking your head.",
        "Yeah, you think we're going to get that?"

        "Well, we've had a number of decadal conferences, collaborative get-togethers of scientists.",

        "So each one of these brought together people with very different points of view and different data sets, and I think each decadal meeting has resulted in a giant leap forward.",
        "This present one that was just last year, I think there were several really important data sets.",
        "So I think, yes, we're honing in on it, and the ability to measure age is better, and to look deeply into the earth better and understand river systems better.",
        "I think we're close.",
        "Well, then, Richard, can you tell us, then, why the Grand Canyon is even here and not some other place along the Colorado River?",
        "Well, I think part of the story that you just finished discussing is the fact that there are hardly any rocks that are between approximately 20 and six million years old.",
        "So there's a big gap, because the rocks are missing.",
        "But from my point of view, the country to the west of the plateau and the rocks that I study was much higher, so that the rivers were actually flowing from California, Nevada, toward Flagstaff and toward the east.",
        "So the system I saw was totally the reverse of what we see today, and gradually that went on for tens of millions of years, until approximately maybe 50 million years ago, somewhere in that range.",
        "And then we begin to lose track of the details for a period of time, and there's very little evidence.",
        "So 10 to 20 million years ago, that's the fuzzy period?",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",

        "(unintelligible) Oh, sorry.",

        "And that's called the Basin and Range orogeny, roughly 20 million years ago.",
        "And that lowered the area to the west.",

        "It's going to take us another 10 years to finish it.",
        "But the images that are coming out from the Earth Scope experiment are showing an interior, an Earth's interior that's quite dynamic.",
        "And there's upwelling portions of the mantle, and there's down-welling portions of the mantle.",
        "And although they're 100 kilometers beneath us, they're exerting forces on the surface, causing the plate to tilt one way and the other, to extend.",
        "And it's those dynamic forcings - to me, this is the exciting part about the Grand Canyon, is that it's providing a very sensitive record of young and ongoing uplift of the Western U.S."
