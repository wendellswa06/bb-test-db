        "And when we left talking about this mystery, we were talking about, this is a dynamically tectonic, active place.",
        "In other words, the Earth goes up, moves around, changes direction, tilts up.",
        "And you can see that in the Grand Canyon.",
        "And it makes it hard to decide the exact nature of how things happen here.",
        "I heard it described, and it may have been by you in a research paper, as maybe having a - it's like having a cake knife standing still while the cake moves up, right?",
        "That's right.",
        "That's the way you cut your cake, isn't it, hold the knife there and lift the cake up?",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Sort of, but I mean that's what's going on here with the river.",
        "The river is standing - is etching out just enough now as the surrounding area is rising.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, there's about 100 things in here.",
        "Well, and the river is cutting down too.",
        "So it's the balance of - you know, the river would like to reduce the landscape to sea level with enough time.",
        "But in this case, the land level, I think, is moving up as well.",
        "So how to quantify those two interacting forces, the erosion that's moving things down and the tectonics that may be moving things up.",
        "Is the tectonics evident around here?",
        "Are there, you know, earthquakes and volcanoes and things like that, Ivo, that...",
        "Well, there are certainly plenty of volcanoes.",
        "We are living in the middle of a very active volcanic field.",
        "But to go back to what Karl was talking about a little bit, the geomorphic evidence that we see, in other words the reason why we have canyons as opposed to big, wide, broad mature valleys, is probably because there has been a recent uplift which has caused the river to cut down at a very rapid rate.",
        "So it hasn't had time to expand the valley side.",
        "It's just cut down.",
        "So all of those things work together rather nicely to tell us, yes, there has been young uplift."

        "The two big dams on the Colorado, the Glen Canyon Dam and the Hoover Dam, how have they changed the evolution of the river?",
        "Oh, my goodness.",
        "Rivers are living things, and they've taught us a great deal about a great many things, including the processes by which they react.",
        "Now, a river likes to erode and likes to carry sediment.",
        "If you are - and it likes to carry a certain amount of sediment so it is in equilibrium.",
        "If you cut off the supply of sediment, the river is hungry, it's angry.",
        "It wants to do something with all this energy that it has, and it starts cutting down and transporting some new material down to the sea.",
        "Well, when, for example, Glen Canyon Dam was built, people were very much aware of what would happen to the reservoir upstream.",
        "But as far as one can tell, they didn't really think enough about what would happen downstream in the Grand Canyon National Park.",
        "And national parks are pretty touchy.",
        "I mean, you don't mess around with them.",
        "So there's been a big to-do about the fact that the beaches are being eroded away.",
        "The ecosystem is being changed, and so the big thing has been what to do about that.",
        "And a couple of us, Luna Leopold(ph), a famous hydrologist, and I, discovered that by utilizing floods on the Little Colorado River, which happen every seven years or so, and by adding to that flood some input from the dam to give you enough discharge so that the sand would be parked high, one can actually remedy that to a considerable extent.",
        "You can never bring it back to the way it was, but you can help.",
        "Is it possible, if you don't do anything, the dam is just going to fill up with silt, and it'll look like a wall is there?",
        "It will, absolutely.",
        "But, you know, nature has performed this experiment many times in the past with the lava dams that poured over the walls of the Grand Canyon and blocked the river.",
        "And the river makes pretty short order.",
        "We have to get the time scales right.",
        "And so tens and hundreds of thousands of years see these dams long gone.",
        "So - but at the scale of the - our human time scales, we have to worry about the silt filling up and dredging the dam, for sure."

        "Dick Young, did the engineers not know this would happen when they built it?",
        "They did know, and they got the timing pretty right.",
        "For example, Lake Mead today, at the other end, is seriously filling with sediment, and it was projected to have a lifetime of about 100 years, which is kind of approaching us now from the 1930s.",

        "Actually, I didn't know that, but it wouldn't surprise me that there had been a lot of people before Powell who had gone down at least parts of the river.",
        "And the best I can tell you is that in the current studies, the people who are studying the Grand Canyon, monitoring it and so on and so forth, which I'm not doing anymore, but they do include Navajo and Hopi as stakeholders, as it is said, to make sure that the cultural issues are preserved and the ideas are also incorporated.",
        "So the best I can tell you is that yes, it's a process that's happening.",
        "Karl?",
        "And also, we just finished - in October we opened an exhibit at Grand Canyon Trail of Time Exhibit to try and communicate to the public a sense of the magnitude of geologic time.",
        "Into that exhibit we incorporated - we were told very early on by some Native Americans that time is not linear.",
        "And yet we're doing a timeline.",
        "So how to incorporate the concept of cycles and repetition and the interplay between the upper - the atmospheric forcings and the Mother Earth forcings, these are all things that are embedded in the exhibit and very powerful concepts that have come, I think, from indigenous science.",
        "All right, thank you.",
        "Let's go to this side, yes.",
        "Well, I'm wondering about the Mexican equivalent of the Grand Canyon.",
        "And is that a similar laboratory to the Grand Canyon, or is it just completely different, that it perhaps can't apply?",
        "Copper Canyon?",
        "Yes.",
