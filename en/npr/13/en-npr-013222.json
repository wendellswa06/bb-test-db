        "It's mostly volcanic.",
        "It's a spectacular canyon but carved by a spectacular drainage system as well.",
        "So there's lots of lessons from it.",
        "At least 100.",
        "Well then, you know it's not natural.",
        "I think the Grand Canyon preserves a longer and richer record of the geologic history.",
        "And just a comment, that at the Grand Canyon we're trying to make clear to people is that it's a relatively young canyon carved into very old rocks.",
        "So in the case of Copper Canyon, it's a relatively young canyon carved into relatively young rocks.",
        "When you go to the Grand Canyon, you see layers, wonderful layers upon layers of different colored rocks, which the river has cut into.",
        "What is the age of those rocks up there?",
        "The top ones are 270 million, and then as you go down, they get older, and the oldest rocks that we've dated in the inner gorge of Grand Canyon is almost two billion, 1.84 billion years.",
        "And so give us - jump in our time machine and take us ahead to a couple of million years.",
        "Well, but that's only half the age of the Earth, of course, two billion.",
        "Okay, now jump ahead - as I say, it's getting deeper, about a thickness of a piece of paper every year.",
        "And the river is carving down, and the landscape is moving up.",
        "So I would hazard a guess that we're going to - the Grand Canyon is getting grander.",
        "Probably, for sure.",
        "But, you know, this is a good time to introduce an idea that a lot of people don't really understand.",
        "What is a million years?",
        "How many people have really a physical understanding of what a million years is?",
        "A good way of doing that is I think to bring in human life.",
        "Assume that the human generation is 20 years, good enough, easy number to work with.",
        "So how many generations between us and Christ?",
        "A hundred.",
        "How many generations between us and the time when Bronze Age Troy was sacked and burned as described by Homer?",
        "A hundred and sixty.",
        "How many years between us and the time when people in Mesopotamia, between the Tigris and Euphrates, started, invented agriculture and invented urban living and gave rise to the civilization we have today?",
        "Well, that's about 300."

        "But not in Earth time.",
        "No, one million years for us geologists is chump change.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "But it's 50,000 generations, and that explains why you can carve Grand Canyons in five million years.",
        "You know, creationists have jumped on some of these problems that still need to be solved, and they say this proves creationism.",
        "I mean, how do you react to that, Karl?",
        "When you go out to the Grand Canyon and go on a raft, and you go to a spot, and you describe it, and then someone else comes along and says, oh, this is carved out by Noah's flood.",
        "Yeah, the next river trip behind us could be creationists talking about the same rocks with a different set of stories.",
        "They view the horizontal layers in the Grand Canyon as Noah's flood rocks, and the ones in the basement as the ones that God created in the first days.",
        "The - it's a difficult one to address.",
        "I think the Grand Canyon gets visitors from all over the world with all different creation stories about how humans originated.",
        "And scientists operate a little differently.",
        "Scientists operate with data, with testing of evidence, with refinement.",
        "The arguments that go on between scientists are to refine the ages, not to presume any particular answer from the beginning.",
        "So it's just a different way of approaching your belief system.",
        "And we think science is the one to - the park agrees they're presenting the scientific interpretation of Grand Canyon as the one which the public deserves to hear."

        "Well, what happens is with time, the river will carve - well, erosion will carve the - the sides of the canyon of the valley back and back and back and back.",
        "And the river will transport the debris that's produced by this down to the sea.",
        "How fast this happens is very variable, depends on the rock that you're dealing with, depends on the energy of the stream, and so on and so forth.",
        "But one thing is for sure, and that is in time, the Grand Canyon will not be a canyon anymore.",
        "Maybe it'll be a wide-open valley.",
        "Huh.",
        "Will it find, on its own, a way around these dams before that?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "In fact, this is an interesting thing.",
        "If you look at Glen Canyon Dam from below, from below, you'll notice - and many of us have noticed that there are some big springs developing on the right abutment of the dam that didn't use to be there, and big blocks of rock are falling down.",
        "Now, the abutment is in a sandstorm, which is cemented with calcite, calcium carbonate.",
        "Calcium carbonate is soluble in acid.",
        "The water of the lake is weak acid.",
        "So guess what happens?",
        "It's a self-reinforcing mechanism.",
        "The more solution happens, the more water goes through, the more solutions - so it is possible that at some time, perhaps not too far from today, there will be a big plug of concrete sitting there, with the river going around it, maybe on both sides.",

        "Yeah.",
        "We have to keep in mind the time frames.",

        "To think about the things that geologists can help society with that are at human time scales, for my lifetime, for my children's lifetime, versus the processes that we need to think of over longer periods of time.",
        "That's what geosciences have to offer, I think.",
        "Let's go to the - yes, this man in the audience.",
        "Well, so there's lots of caves in the Grand Canyon, like, around it.",
        "So how might they have formed?",
        "How did the caves form in the Grand Canyon?",
        "Good question.",
        "The cave systems are, for the most part, in the limestone layers.",
        "And just as Ivo was describing, these weakly acid waters will move down through the crack and expand the crack into a room, and then eventually the rooms can be linked together into vast cave systems.",
        "And once that happens, then our groundwater finds its way through the caves.",
        "So if you want to find a lot of water out in the plateau, you have to somehow figure out where the water is flowing through these cave systems.",
        "And it's a great challenge, but it's one of the main aquifers for the Colorado Plateau, which is the place where the water can be found, if you could find the crack systems.",
        "You're not suggesting he go out and find those.",
        "Well, he may want to.",
