        "Yeah, we were driving in the other day and our Syrian colleague handed us this bag of bananas and a box of chocolate bars.",
        "And he said, Here, you know, take these - you're going to need it.",
        "Aleppo is starving.",
        "And then we drive into the city and we are just shocked to see a place that was full of life.",
        "There were people in the streets and there was food everywhere.",
        "There's food in the marketplace; as there was freshly butchered meat, oranges, apples, potatoes, radishes, parsnips.",
        "One morning, we went out to get breakfast.",
        "And, you know, the typical breakfast is foul.",
        "It's a fava bean dish you eat with fresh tomatoes.",
        "And our colleague, producer Rima Marrouch, said to a guy, you know, we're going here to get - he said, no, don't go there to get the foul.",
        "You need to go to this place to get the foul - its better over there.",

        "You know, we realized Aleppo is one of the oldest cities in the world.",
        "This is a city of merchants that's not only survived for centuries and centuries, but has thrived.",
        "And we just got the sense that you really just can't keep the place down.",
        "I do have to say, I don't want to be too flip here.",
        "I mean we were the lucky ones.",
        "This food that we saw was to have two and a half to three times more expensive than it was before the conflict started.",
        "So, you know, there was a lot of people in that city who can look at that food but who couldn't afford to buy it.",
        "Well, you've been describing in recent days on NPR a city that is partly held by the government, partly held by rebels, with battle lines in between.",
        "Right, it's a city divided in half.",
        "And so what we seen, as we reported yesterday, is a lot of the fighting has left the center of the city it is now the outskirts of some of these government bases.",
        "And even though there's not as much fighting, you can still see just other utter destruction in some of the neighborhoods in Aleppo."

        "Angelus \"\"Golo\"\" Thomsen, the nephew of Martin Bormann, Hitler's personal secretary, serves as the Nazi High Command's liaison with the IG Farben factory on the grounds of the camp.",
        "He's a serious womanizer and keeps up a high level of ironic banter with a few close friends - fellow officers - mostly gallows humor about the horrors of the camp.",
        "Much to the dismay of one of his friends, Thomsen falls in love with Hannah Doll, the wife of the alcoholic camp commandant, Paul Doll.",
        "The commandant soon finds evidence of his wife's disloyalty.",
        "This sets in motion a plot that puts Thomsen and his beloved in dreadful danger, and exposes to the naked eye the debauchery, thievery and criminal incompetence of everyone on the concentration camp staff, from the highest-ranking Nazis to the IG Farben managers and technicians down to the Jewish Sonderkommandos, the complicit prisoners spared long enough to assist with the murderous work of the camp.",
        "Speaking about complicity, we actually come to sympathize with Thomsen and Hannah as they delicately thread their way through the intricacies and madness of their situation - no small, aesthetic feat on the part of the writer.",
        "Trumping both of them is Amis' creation of the character of Szmul, a longtime survivor of the current group of Sonderkommandos.",

        "Most schools are closed throughout the region, leaving parents scrambling for childcare and educators frustrated over another missed school day.",

        "It's been very extensive.",
        "We have 85,000 members, and at one time we had about 71,000 outages, so about two-thirds of our membership experienced an outage throughout the storm.",
        "This is going to compare to the greatest historical storm, the Hurricane Hugo, when it went through.",
        "At that time, we had a little over 48,000 members out of power.",
        "This storm, we're going to exceed that number quite a little bit.",
        "The logistical challenge to a utility like yours is not only to figure out where all the points of needed repair are, but then to get your vehicles there, to get your people there.",
        "So you're at the mercy of the road conditions as well.",
        "We've got road conditions and then we've got off-road conditions.",
        "A lot of our lines will go across country.",

        "We gear more towards the hurricanes that come along the coast.",
