        "He's also a writer with Baseball Prospectus and a columnist for ESPN.com.",
        "And he joins us by phone from Durham, New Hampshire.",

        "Very good.",

        "It has changed.",
        "The hardcover had Barry Bonds on the cover.",
        "Now we have Albert Pujols on the cover.",
        "Can't go wrong either way, though.",
        "Both great power hitters.",
        "That says a whole lot right there.",
        "Let's talk a bit about the numbers.",
        "What are the most abused statistics that fans like to throw around?",
        "And what statistics should they be talking about?",
        "Well runs batted in, RBI, is one that tends to get over-emphasized.",
        "And a lot of RBI and even runs scored and some other statistics are basically what we call accounting statistics.",
        "And accounting statistics - especially RBI - has a lot to do with context.",
        "So for instance if you bat in the middle of a terrific lineup and you have the number one, number two, and number three hitters getting on base all the time, if you are any kind of sentient human being you're probably going to get 80, 90, even 100 RBI in that kind of line up, even if you're not that great a player."

        "So people over-emphasizing that statistic are missing out on some other metrics which really do measure the quality of a player.",
        "Which is the most important one?",
        "It's tough to pin down one.",

        "The simple way to do this is to take 10 VORP and make that one win.",
        "So if you're talking about 80 VORP, that means that Albert Pujols gives the St. Louis Cardinals about eight more wins per season than the guy you would pick up off the street.",

        "Hm-hmm.",
        "But you point out in your book - and this was very interesting - that during the stopper era of the 1970s it was common to see a relief ace such as Rollie Fingers or Goose Gossage come in as early as the sixth inning to halt the nascent rally.",
        "That was the smart way to go.",
        "Wow.",
        "Why was that so smart?",
        "And why don't people still do that?",
        "Well the smart way to go was to use your best relief pitcher in what we call the highest leverage situation.",

        "If you come into the tie game in the ninth inning and the bases are loaded and the game's on the line, bring the guy in then.",

        "Sometimes that situation can happen in the sixth inning or the seventh inning though.",
        "You have to be flexible with how you use your closer.",
        "The problem is the way today's closers are being used is they come in in the ninth inning in what we call a save situation.",
        "A save situation is any situation which the team is winning by three runs or less and they have a chance to save the game late in the game.",
        "So often it'll be the team's up by two or three runs, the bases are empty, and they only need to get three outs.",
        "Well you know what, Ira?",
        "I give you a 50/50 chance at producing that situation.",
        "That's not all that tough.",
        "But if you come in, tied game, sixth inning, the game is on the line, you've got Albert Pujols at the plate, you need to strike him out to preserve the game - now, that's tough, and that's the kind of situation that a Joe Nathan or a Mariano Rivera or a Billy Wagner, a really elite relief pitches should be looking to enter, not necessarily the robotic situation in the ninth inning, but the real key situation that can sometimes be earlier in the game.",

        "Can you actually put a number on the statistics and see if he is or isn't?",

        "This is the in the book \"\"Baseball Between the Numbers\"\" too.",
        "You look at what's called marginal dollars per marginal win.",

        "So again, you have an Albert Pujols.",
        "You say he's worth on average about eight, nine wins a season over the guy you pick up off the street.",
        "So you establish what is the going rate in Major League Baseball for a player of that caliber.",
        "So if you say that one win is worth $2 million, and two wins is worth four million and so on, you would say Albert Pujols gives you eight wins.",
        "That's worth about $16 million a season.",
        "That's about the average.",

        "If you're getting him for 13 million or $14 million a year, you're actually getting a little bit of a bargain.",

        "I mean, if you have a manager who's really smart, and he's using his gut, I like that guy's chances better than the one who maybe uses statistics but uses them incorrectly.",
        "There is no one right answer.",
        "Statistics cannot solely do it, but sometimes if you have a lot of experience around the game, you might see something that the statistics don't capture.",
        "For instance, if you take a pitch - if you're looking at a pitcher, it's the fifth inning of a game, and statistically you know that this pitcher tends to do well six, seven, eight innings at a time, but the manager who's been in the game for 40 years looks at the pitcher and says his arm is dragging, his facial expressions aren't right.",
        "I think there's something wrong.",
        "He's either injured or tired, and he pulls the pitcher from the game.",
        "You might be saving a potentially explosive situation.",
        "The pitcher could give up five runs, tear his rotator cuff and be out for the season if you don't take him out at that point.",
        "So you need to have that combination of personal observation and statistical analysis to really do this right when it comes to baseball.",
        "You have a great chapter in your book called \"\"Is David Ortiz a Clutch Hitter?\"\" Because we all know that, you know, he - the last guy you want to face with men on base is probably David Ortiz.",
        "How do you determine whether, you know, he is a clutch hitter or not?",
        "Well, first of all, the reason that the last guy you want to face is David Ortiz is because David Ortiz is one of the best hitters in the league.",
        "I mean, that is the key, is that for the most part, the best clutch hitters tend to be the best hitters.",
        "There's not much difference.",
        "If you look at what we would call clutch hitting, most of that has to do with just the guy being simply a good hitter.",
        "A little bit of that has to do with luck and variance, where sometimes you could have a player who normally bats .250.",
        "In one particular season he'll bat .300 with runners in scoring position or in a clutch situation.",
        "But over the long haul, when you take a player's career, this stuff tends to even out."

        "If you talk about what we call true clutch hitting, that's maybe two percent of the equation.",
        "It's a very, very small number of players who consistently rise above, and even then a player more likely to do it is not necessarily an Ortiz type but rather a contact hitter who has the ability to make adjustments and knows how to dump a single the opposite way.",
        "Tony Gwynn, for instance, Mark Grace - these are players that over the course of their career hit a little bit better in what we call clutch situations than otherwise; not homerun hitters, but guys who just had great bat control and had the ability to put the bat on the ball in those situations.",

        "Hi, Andrew.",
        "Yeah, you were talking about the stopper era in the '70s.",
        "One of the people I remember from that is Raleigh Eastwick(ph), who was on the Reds, and he'd be brought in when the other team had a rally of runs that needed to be stopped, and when you saw him then, you'd wonder why he was a relief pitcher and not a starter, but when they got traded after the big Reds fire sale, you know, you wondered why he didn't - you found out why he wasn't played more because he was only good for about one inning.",
        "Well, that's true, and a lot of relief pitchers are built that way.",
        "If you look at some of the greatest closers, either from the '70s, '80s, '90s or today, a lot of them tried as starting pitchers, in fact I would say most of them did, and failed.",
        "Goose Gossage at one point was a starting pitcher.",
        "Dennis Eckersley, arguably the greatest modern closer since we went to kind of the new formation of bullpens, he was a starter who was a so-so starter.",
        "Sometimes if that person was very tall or very short, that gives us a really good clue.",
        "Eric Gonyea(ph) was a starter.",
        "He didn't really pan out.",
        "All these guys came up as starters and didn't work that way, so they realized, okay, we want to use this guy for an inning or two at a time and use him in that role.",
        "I just argue that one inning only, and especially with up three runs, bases empty, that's not the key situation.",
        "If you really believe that you can only use your ace relief pitcher for one inning, okay, fine, but use him in a situation that's very important, as opposed to one that's just kind of theoretical and it's what everybody else is doing.",
        "Why are players able to play so much longer and into their 40s now?",
        "Well, it's better training.",
        "I mean, these guys are making this a 12-month-a-year profession.",
        "Back in the day, everybody had another job because if you look in the '20s and '30s, everybody was underpaid except for Babe Ruth, pretty much, and they had to find other jobs in the off-season to support themselves.",
        "They weren't millionaires by any means, and they were pretty much working stiffs like the rest of us except that they happened to be playing baseball.",
        "So now you have a situation, these guys make $10 million a year or more.",
        "Their livelihood rides on not only them being in shape, but I mean being healthy and producing and doing well into September and October and in the playoffs.",
        "So their livelihood rides on it, they do a better job at keeping in shape, and as a result they're able to last not only longer in the season but longer into their career, in some cases as you said, well into their 40s."
