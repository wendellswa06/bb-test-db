        "What about - one of the great arguments in baseball is the lead-off batter, the lead-off position.",
        "People say, you know, you need a great lead-off player to get the - set the table, things like that, but he only comes up once in the game at the lead-off position.",
        "How important is that statistically?",
        "Is there really a statistical advantage to that?",
        "Well, it's an excellent point that you're only guaranteed to lead off an inning once a game if you are the lead-off hitter.",
        "However, one thing that the lead-off hitter has over the other eight guys, he bats more often than everybody else.",
        "It seems very obvious to you and I.",
        "We're sitting here and saying the number-one hitter, of course he comes up most often, but here's the problem.",
        "Many Major League teams still use old theories about how to construct a lineup.",
        "They say this guy's fast.",
        "If he gets on base, we feel like he can steal a lot of bases.",
        "That's why we need him as a lead-off hitter.",
        "They don't put their best hitter at number one, they put sometimes their fastest hitter at number one, and that's not always the same thing.",
        "You want to have your guy that has the highest on-base percentage bat lead-off.",
        "A great example of this is the Boston Red Sox in the 1980s.",
        "Wade Boggs was their lead-off hitter.",
        "Well, I think I might even be able to beat Wade Boggs in a foot race, but Wade Boggs was a tremendous on-base guy who would get on base about 40 percent of the time, and that's why those offenses of the Red Sox were so good in the 1980s.",
        "Because he gets more at-bats being in the lead-off position?",
        "More at-bats in the lead-off position.",
        "If you try to mess around with your best hitter and put him number four or number five or number six, and you think you're being cute, all you're doing is you're costing him at-bats.",
        "Let's go to Gary in Palo Alto.",
        "Hi, Gary.",
        "Hey there, guys.",
        "It seems like the context for this conversation is how do you win the most games.",
        "You know, when do you put your lead-off guy in, when do you bring in your relief pitcher?",
        "What impact does VOIP have?",
        "But I'm wondering as well how much owners are motivated by team valuation, which is going to have to do to (unintelligible) turnout.",
        "You know, how do you - is some of this factored in by coaches or managers - you know, how are we going to play our players, and who are we going to pay and how much in order to please the fans in order to get - in order to maximize our revenue as a business?",
        "It's a great question, Gary, and the way I would look at it is this.",
        "The tried-and-true way to attract the most fans and to make the most money is, get ready, win the most ballgames, and if you want to find a way to win the most ballgames, you have to be more efficient than the opposition.",
        "So obviously that means going out and getting the premium talent, and yes, you're going to have to spend money, but the little things, how you use a bullpen, how you position your defense, which pinch hitters you have coming off the bench, all those little, little things can add up to a lot.",
        "They can be the three, four or five wins that make the difference between making the playoffs or staying home.",
        "And of course if you're making the playoffs, people are interested in your team, you're generating more revenue, and it goes hand in hand."

        "So I think those goals are not at all mutually exclusive.",
        "You can win a lot of games and make money at the same time.",
        "In fact, that's the best way to do both.",
        "You know, when a lot of people talk about records in baseball, they look at Joe DiMaggio's hitting streak, and they say that's an unbreakable record.",
        "But when I go through the record book, there are a lot - much more difficult - many more-difficult records on the pitching side that no one's ever going to break, you know, and I'm thinking of one in particular, the consecutive complete game record.",
        "I think it's 27, held by Robin Roberts(ph) or somebody like that.",
        "Who's ever going to pitch a complete game, more or less 27 of them?",
        "How about Cy Young's 511 wins?",
        "I don't think that's going to happen, either, and you're right, and it just has to do - the thing is, people like to glorify the good old days in anything, whatever you want to talk about, baseball, life, anything.",
        "And when you look at the good old days of baseball, I'm going to be a little bit politically incorrect now and say that someone like Babe Ruth was the best player against the best white players in America that the scouts happened to find.",
        "Morale is very low.",

        "In addition to the well-known brand, he cites sophisticated technology and access to reams of data.",
        "The game was not integrated, the players were not as good, they weren't as big, they weren't as strong, they weren't as fast.",
        "It just was not the same game, and when you have that situation, when you're a pitcher, certainly in the 19th century this was the case, you could mow down the lineup because they didn't have a player come up who could hit 20, 30, 40 homeruns, let alone seven or eight guys in a lineup who could do that.",
        "So because of that situation - Christy Matthewson talked about this in his great book.",
        "It's called \"\"Pitching in a Pinch.\"\" He used to say he likes to preserve his energy for later in the game because he's going to need it in the eighth and the ninth inning.",
        "Well, if you try to preserve your energy now, and Barry Bonds comes up to the plate in the second inning, you are going to the showers, my friend.",
        "You cannot do that anymore.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, I want to thank you very much for talking with us.",
        "It's time for us to go to the showers, and then we can't wait for opening day.",

        "It's become a litmus test of how and if the Iraqis can handle their own security, and just as an indication of how this is going, earlier this week, Maliki gave gunmen 72 hours to lay down their arms and warned that those who didn't do so would face the full brunt of the law.",
