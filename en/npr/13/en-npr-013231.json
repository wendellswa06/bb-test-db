        "And so you'd say are we more resilient?",
        "And the answer is yes.",
        "We can see that simply that El Nino has killed tens of millions of people in the 19th century and equally strong El Ninos, while having devastating economic effects, did not have nearly the death toll in this century.",
        "Does that lead us to be complacent?",
        "Absolutely not.",
        "Two reasons.",
        "One, we're far more...",

        "We're totally complacent.",

        "Yeah.",
        "But we shouldn't be.",
        "I mean, we're, while we're much more resilient than past civilizations, we're much more leveraged for good weather than any past civilization.",
        "We have six billion people getting 40 percent of their sustenance from five staple crops produced in just a few food-exporting nations.",
        "So that's one reason.",
        "And we can't be complacent because climate is changing around us.",
        "I mean, if you look at this, you'd say, well, we have the advantage of hindsight, we have the advantage of science.",
        "Everybody's doing their job except we're sort of blasé and oblivious to the dramatic changes that we're seeing around us.",
        "And if these changes, if climate changes in a way even remotely similar to the ways it's changed in the historical record, the consequences could be economically ruinous.",
        "I think the concern that is most troubling, I guess, is the recent talk about the change of the global water patterns, the currents that warm the Atlantic Ocean in England, and up there through Europe, possibly changing with the runoff of icy waters from Greenland.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean that...",
        "Go ahead.",
        "That's been an ongoing concern, and what was funny in the fall was, right after a meeting in Aspen when a bunch of climate modelers got together, and it, in essence, tended to downplay that threat.",
        "Well, not downplaying the threat of climate change at all, thinking there wasn't enough fresh water to really affect the thermal hyaline circulation.",
        "A couple of weeks later, a British study suggested that the thermal hyaline circulation is already diminished by thirty percent in the past 40 or so years.",
        "So, there's a lot of unknowns.",
        "No one would deny that.",
        "The sort of bullets that might get us come in and out of vogue.",
        "I mean, back when I went to Antarctica in the late '90s, people were downplaying the notion that there could be a catastrophic collapse of the ice sheets down there, or the Greenland ice sheet.",
        "Now that notion has come very much back into vogue, because the mass wasting of the Greenland ice sheet is much more rapid than people anticipated."

        "And the point, the sort of the take away point here is that the surprises, and they're coming more and more frequently, always seem to be on the more alarming side.",
        "You write in your book about Michael Crichton, the fiction writer who wrote about global warming.",
        "Last week, The New York Times reported that he met with President Bush to talk about global warming, and Michael Crichton has, basically, taken on environmentalists who believe in global warming, and he's saying, you know, he's written a book about a fiction.",
        "And he was on our program, and I asked him, why don't you present this, you know, these findings in a peer review journal, and he said, \"\"I'm just a science fiction writer.\"\" You know.",
        "Yeah, but he's happy to be treated as an authority, and had testified before Congress.",
        "It's, I find it truly amazing.",
        "Earlier this year, when Crichton's book came out, he was interviewed by John Stossel, on 20/20.",
        "And Stossel said, in introduction, here's an author who thinks that global warming's just another over-hyped media scare, and a lot of scientists agree with him.",
        "That same week, Naomi Oreskes had an essay in Science Magazine, which looked back over ten years of peer reviewed papers about science change, climate change, and found that of the 700 papers that directly addressed modern global warming, not one took at issue with the consensus that humans have played a role in modern global warming.",
        "So, I don't know where these a lot of scientists who agree with Michael Crichton are.",
        "I find that there's a dwindling cadre of scientists, and if you take away the ones that have direct ties to the fossil fuel industry, the cadre gets smaller, still.",
        "But they have disproportionate interest, influence over the debate, because they've been amplified, brilliantly amplified, by lobbyists trying to create the illusion that the issue is still under debate long after consensus has been achieved.",
        "That's 1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "Where will the, finally, the wakening up occur?",
        "Is there an event?",
        "Is there something you would expect to happen if, as you say, global warming and this, the events that we're going through now, can change very quickly with the melting of the glaciers and the change in the currents.",
        "Is there going to be, it's not going to be like that movie disaster, happening overnight, or within a matter of hours?",
        "No.",
        "I think that if you look back in the climate record, what you see is that climate has, I hate to use this overused analogy, but in the past people thought it was like a dial that you turned up very slowly over thousands of years, and then in the early '90s they discovered it's more like a switch, it changes state.",
        "Wallace Broecker, the great oceanographer, wrote a paper for Science in the '90s, where he talked about the transitions between, that typically occur when climate finds a new equilibrium and changes state.",
        "And they can go on for decades, and you can get whip-sawed going back and forth and back and forth between warm and cold, until climate settles into its new state.",
        "That's the kind of thing that's truly scary, because it could, you know, I think the event that might awaken us to climate change has already happened, and that was Katrina.",
        "It showed that a hurricane that was only marginally stronger than previous storms did over a hundred times more damage and loss of life.",
        "And it's these threshold-crossing events, if they come more frequently, floods that over-top levies, droughts, heat waves like you had in Europe in 2003, where 35,000 people died.",
        "Those kinds of things, as they become more frequent and more clustered, will have an effect, not just on the politics and public awareness, but on economies.",
        "And already in Florida, in some parts of Florida, insurance rates have doubled for homeowners, so that people are not being able to afford homes--not because of rising interest rates, but because the average insurance policy has gone from $2,000 to $4,000 a year.",
        "That signal, as it percolates through the economy and gets stronger, I think you'll see people react.",
        "What we can hope is that it won't be too late.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",

        "It usually has been the insurance companies, and certainly about environmental things, whether its flood insurance, or flood plane insurance, that kind of stuff, they recognize, they keep records of these things, and they keep track.",
        "The changes that occur, don't they?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean, they are the, in essence, the, on the front lines of this.",
        "To use an analogy, a huge wake-up call for insurance companies was 9-11, because they, essentially, bore the risk of terrorism for free.",
        "And then, Swiss Ray, I thought, lost 3,000 Swiss Francs in those attacks.",
        "And I think it started them thinking, many of them had been farsighted in thinking about this before, but what other risks they're bearing for free?",
        "And one of those, of course, is climate change.",
        "Because if you use past patterns to set rates for the future, you're going to underestimate, if climate is changing, the amount of damages you're likely to suffer.",
        "And one of the interesting responses to Hurricane Katrina were that some programs in some states have now begun to change their rate structures based on anticipation of future, more frequent hurricanes and wind events and ice storms, rather than just solely relying on past patterns.",
        "That's unprecedented, as far as I can understand, in the insurance industry.",
        "But it is an indication of the ways in which a industry tries to come to grips.",
        "Another way, of course, which would really strike home to corporate America, is if the insurers who give directors and officers insurance, what's called D&O insurance, for directors of companies, where if the company is out of step, it's a, takes a very aggressive position that climate change is not a threat, the insurer might say, well, if you don't think it's a threat, you won't mind if we carve out your liability for that threat in your D&O policy.",

        "And I speak from Tucson, Arizona, where we have issues here, as every city has, and the individual who wants to make a change is faced with resistance, like you spoke about, the fossil fuel industry.",
        "But I think that's the biggest issue that we face, is having some leadership to make these changes."

        "And if President Bush is inviting Michael Crichton to visit the White House and have a science fiction writer give his views on climate rather than James Hansen, who the administration tried to muzzle, or Wallace Broecker, or any of the other great scientists who've been working on this issue for years, it's sending a terrible signal.",
