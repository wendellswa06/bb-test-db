        "And this is really a very interesting development because when those journalists got there, as you know, they saw a lot of more protests happening in front of them from both sides, both by Uighurs and by Chinese against each other.",
        "So this is something we haven't really seen before, a Chinese state that seems to be being quite open with the foreign press and allowing them into the city.",

        "Well, how do the demands of the Uighurs compare to the demands of the Tibetans?",
        "Are they similar, and maybe the response by the Chinese - is that to do with what they're demanding?",
        "Well, they do appear to be very similar, indeed.",
        "And, in fact, this is one of the things that unfortunately has led to lots of Chinese popular opinion bracketing these two kinds of situations together as being the same.",
        "It's certainly the case that one of the touch-paper issues for both communities is immigration.",
        "And I think in the long term, the Chinese leaders are really going to have to sit back and say who was responsible for the last 15, 20 years of really breakneck immigration policies in both areas.",
        "Now, immigration - you're talking about the Han majority immigrating into these regions."
