        "How do you defend the platform against the criticism that between universal health care, and I think it's a $50-billion economic stimulus plan, and a variety of other things, whether it's better post and pre-natal medical care and seven more days of paid annual leave, that this platform is phenomenally expensive?",
        "Well, I think that there are a variety of ways to pay for it, and that is also stated in the platform.",
