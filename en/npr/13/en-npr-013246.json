        "At least six feet of floodwater poured into this neighborhood, obliterating many of his neighbors' homes and washing huge piles of debris into his yard.",
        "Two cars were flooded out and the carcass of a small plane he owned lies twisted amid some nearby brush.",
        "But Fiola believes the damage to the area was caused not by floodwater, but by one of the many tornadoes that preceded the storm.",
        "He points to the way shingles were torn from the house next door.",
        "It's going to be up to the insurance company and we'll probably, you know, be negotiating, but the flood came after the tornado.",

        "If insurance companies can prove that a home was damaged by flooding and not wind or rain, they don't have to pay claims.",
        "Bob Hunter, insurance director of the Consumer Federation of America, says there are likely to be many legal battles in the years to come over how different homes were damaged.",

        "What happened?",
        "And when did it happen?",
        "But insurance industry officials say such concerns are overblown and disputes are likely to be rare.",

        "Adjusters who've had experience with this--this is not a new thing, these coverages have existed side by side for a very long time.",
        "People are used to looking at a structure and, obviously, if the roof is blown off, the flood didn't do that.",
        "And Stewart insists that insurance companies will process claims fairly.",
        "Still, many homeowners are likely to be disappointed by the size of their payouts."
