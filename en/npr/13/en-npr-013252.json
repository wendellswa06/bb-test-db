        "Yeah, that is such an important question, and every one of us involved in projects of this kind around the world have that question right up in our mind.",
        "In fact, it often influences your choice about which animal you're going to try to see if you can rescue.",
        "And in the case of, for example, the Thylacine, it's an interesting challenge.",
        "The Thylacine is an animal we exterminated from Tasmania, that little island south of Australia.",
        "I think because that happened, it's possibly going to cause the extinction of one of our other precious animals, the Tasmanian devil.",
        "This is an animal that has a communicable cancer.",
        "Dogs have something like that as well.",
        "The devil is the only other one.",
        "So if devil can meet devil, they can pass this wretched disease on.",
        "Now, the Thylacine, when it was in Tasmania, competed with the devil, and you had a balanced system.",
        "And if that disease ever popped up in the devil populations, it burned itself out because not all of those devils could come - could contact each other.",
        "If we could get the Thylacine back, put that king of beasts back in the throne, which is still warm and waiting, it would suppress the number of devils, keep them at a manageable level and the disease would burn itself out wherever it started.",
        "So getting these ecosystems back by putting in key species can be critical to maintaining the stability of them.",
        "You think about Yellowstone National Park.",
        "We're all aware of the fact that things started to go terribly wrong when wolves were destroyed from Yellowstone.",
        "The herbivores, the plant eaters began to increase in numbers.",
        "They overrate the plants.",
        "Their river systems began to degrade 'cause there weren't trees along the edge to protect them.",
        "When they get the wolves back, the whole thing starts to fall back into a natural rhythm.",
        "So this is driving us, importantly.",
        "We do need to know that we could put these animals back and that it would improve the world, not in any way diminish it.",
        "Let's go to the phones.",
        "Nathan is in San Francisco.",
        "Hi, Nathan.",
        "Hi there.",
        "Thanks so much for taking my call.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think the answer, Nathan, is pretty simple.",
        "You're right, of course.",
        "There's nothing immoral or dreadful intrinsically about extinction.",
        "In fact, if extinction didn't occur, life wouldn't be able to change in the way that it needs to to adapt to a changing world.",
        "It's been going on for three and a half billion years.",
        "The problem is, you need new species to originate at about the same rate to offset the ones that are going extinct so that you maintain a balance of the amount of biological diversity in the world.",
        "And that's what's not happening now.",
        "You'll hear people talk about the fact that we seem to be now launching into the world's sixth great extinction or mass extinction event where the number of things going extinct is vastly exceeding the number that are appearing.",
        "So we're losing - we're net losing species in the world.",
        "And as life plunges off this cliff, we have to say, are we the reason that this whole massive global imbalance is starting to happen?",
        "And if so, do we want to live with the consequences?",
        "In the previous five mass extinctions on Earth, it took about 10 million years for ecosystems to be balanced again after those dreadful events.",
        "Like the meteor when it came at the end of the Cretaceous and took out the dinosaurs.",
        "We're kind of doing the same thing now.",
        "So the view I have that this is a moral obligation to try to stop this if we can is based on the fact that I want to live in a world that basically has its biological components collapsing.",
        "We need those things in the world."

        "So working through your method there, how many different attempts would you need to be successful to really actually rebuild a species?",
        "'Cause if you just have a bunch of frogs that are cloned off of the same frogs, you don't have a whole lot of diversity within the species.",
        "It's not like frogs really were back before they were - became extinct in the first place, if you get my meaning.",
        "Yeah, I do.",
        "And fortunately, when I went to the chap who had last kept these frogs - this is Professor Mike Tyler at the University of Adelaide - he had not just kept tissues of one frog, he had a whole bucket full of tissues of many frogs, so we know we've got, you know, male, female tissue.",
        "But technology is getting so good now.",
        "Many of these questions that we have presumed to be important - i.e., we have to have hundreds of different kinds of, or different individuals to have a viable population, it's not clearly the case that that's necessary anymore.",
        "Sometimes genetic variation could be engineered.",
        "Sometimes it will pop up itself even in a population that is very little.",
        "The cheetah, for example, really every cheetah is a clone of every other cheetah and yet they're doing fine.",
        "There's not much genetic variation there at all.",
        "And we do know that you can, in fact, do letter by letter gene replacement therapies now - these are all new - where you can introduce variation into populations that wasn't there.",
        "You can swap one little piece of DNA for another.",
        "This is a new world and it's so exciting because it offers the potential to increase the viability of the natural world in a way that we've never been able to do before.",
        "I'm John Dankosky, and this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR.",

        "Yeah.",

        "One of the good things, you know, that happened in this meeting were all of us came out of our closets and admitted what we were trying to do, was that we met each other.",
        "And as a result of this meeting organized by these organizations, a lot of new collaborations developed.",
        "So I already know that there are three or four different groups combining their efforts together to try to get that passenger pigeon back.",
        "The same thing is happening with the mammoth.",
        "In the case of our gastric-brooding frog, we've teamed up with Advanced Cell Technology, Bob Lancer.",
        "who's a brilliant cloner of mammals.",
        "So I think we're going to suddenly see an acceleration in these projects.",
        "Many interesting animals that have been the target of de-extinction events are going to accelerate their path back into the world.",

        "Doing well.",
        "What's on your mind?",
        "I'm curious - you brought up the morality issue, and I'm curious if you're getting any kind of pushback from either the scientific community or anywhere else, and to see whether or not this is wise and what will happen if people who don't necessarily have the appropriate tools to do the right kind of research - or maybe even just the appropriate intentions in mind get a hold of this kind of technology.",
        "And is anyone worried that you're going to take it too far?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Shannon, that's very interesting and a very good question, and it is something we're all thinking about.",
        "But the first answer to your question, are we getting pushback?",
        "Not a lot.",
        "We're getting exactly the kind of question you've asked, which is informed concern about - everybody wants to know that these issues are being talk about.",
        "But in this particular case, one of the most curious objections or concerns I heard expressed comes from conservationists themselves.",
        "They're little worried that we actually may succeed.",
        "And they're worried because if we do, they're going to say, well, why are people going to bother to do standard conservation projects anymore?",
        "If you can haul an animal back up the cliff after it's fallen off and gone extinct, why waste all this energy trying to conserve them now?",
        "And there are lot of reasons why this is - while a good worry, not one that we really do have to worry about.",
        "In the first place, we haven't done it yet, so, you know, we all have our fingers crossed and we're working hard.",
        "Second place, it's actually cheaper and easier to look after endangered species today than to try to pull them back up the cliff again afterwards.",
        "The third reason, which I think is most important, is the technology that we're developing to try to bring an extinct animal back always involves trying to take your DNA from the extinct animal and put it into the cell of a completely different species because the species you want isn't here any more.",
        "Duane Hughes agrees.",
        "He's retired after 38 years with the Cargill Company.",
        "Hughes also served as a Marine in Vietnam.",
        "I think we all got to share the load.",
        "You know, when you get one group of people, you know, that have more than others, and we need to share where we can and help them out.",
        "We do it when there's a disaster.",
        "Americans pull together when they need to pull together.",
        "So this is very different than Dolly cloning, when they took the nucleus from a live sheep body cell and put it into the egg of a live sheep.",
        "This is a much more challenging issue.",
        "But if we succeed, then those endangered animals that we're all concerned about seeing disappear off that cliff and their numbers are reducing, we can use that technology if we can refine it to take the endangered species DNA, put it into the egg of a common species - a different one - and use the common species to increase the numbers of the endangered species.",
        "Actually build up a population that's in decline."
