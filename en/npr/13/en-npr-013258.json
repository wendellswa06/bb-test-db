        "Its main purpose, actually, was the ability to verify missile silos and whatever armaments that the Russians had, and it permitted President Nixon, in the early 1970s, to sign the SALT 1 Treaty; SALT being Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty.",
        "What was it able to verify?",
        "It verified the number of airplanes, tanks in one shot, because it orbited the Earth in a polar orbit.",
        "While the Earth was rotating beneath it, it could cover the whole Earth.",
        "Previous cameras took spotty pictures, and they could move tanks, move planes.",
        "And this way, we could count - I mean, the government - could count everything.",
        "It reminds me of President Reagan's famous dictum: trust, but verify.",
        "Exactly.",

        "Yes.",
        "This - it is believed by not only those of us who worked on it but by experts in the government and in industry that it still is the most complicated thing ever put up in orbit.",
        "Why?",
        "Because it had film, and it was the last film recovery system that was used at the time.",
        "Actual film.",
        "Actual film.",
        "It was all mechanical and, most importantly, electronically controlled.",
        "The servile mechanisms controlled the speed of the film relative to the image of the Earth.",
        "OK.",
        "If this was orbiting the Earth and taking pictures on film, how did you actually get the film back to develop it?",
        "The film canisters were sent back to Earth in a re-entry vehicle that re-entered the atmosphere just like the astronauts used to do...",
        "Which was launched out of the satellite.",
        "Right.",
        "And then, at around 50,000 feet, a parachute slowed it down and a C-130 airplane caught it in midair over the Pacific..."

        "The movie \"\"The Tree of Life\"\" from auteur director Terrence Malick and starring Brad Pitt is playing in just over 200 theaters at the moment, and some of them have reported a peculiar problem: Filmgoers are walking out and in some cases even demanding their money back because the movie's just too art house.",
        "One theater in Stamford, Connecticut, has actually posted a sign at the ticket window.",
        "It tells patrons that \"\"The Tree of Life\"\" does not follow a traditional, linear narrative approach to storytelling, and it reminds them that the theater has a no refund policy once they've bought their tickets.",
        "A small but consistent number of patrons have been walking out of screenings at the Coolidge Corner Theatre in Brookline, Massachusetts, too.",
        "Jesse Hassinger is program manager for The Coolidge, and he joins me now.",
        "Welcome to the program, Jesse.",
        "Thank you, it's a pleasure to be here.",
        "That theater in Connecticut was saying that about five to 10 percent of the audience walked out on opening weekend.",
        "What's the walkout rate there at the Coolidge?",
        "I would say it's approximately that.",
        "The numbers aren't spectacular on the film because it is a challenging film to begin with, but I would say that for every screening, there is at least between one and five, depending.",
        "And is there a certain point of the movie when that's sort of when people up and leave?",
        "About 25 to 30 minutes in is when the film kind of goes into the celestial, very beautiful and space photography, and that's usually the point that people walk out on.",
        "This is some sequence - I haven't actually seen the movie yet.",
