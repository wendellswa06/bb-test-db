        "The reporting implies that there's something very new about what's in this, but actually the White House laid this out very clearly in a public document with lots of press in attendance and a whole bunch of Cabinet secretaries just a couple of weeks ago.",
        "And what they say is that if there were ever a cyber-attack that was sufficiently damaging that it would be equivalent to what we'd expect from a kinetic attack, a violent attack, that we would at least retain the option as a country of responding with force."

        "And if that's easy to send a stock market, which is all controlled by computers, crashing for so short a time, it looked to me that Wall Street, where all the countries' wealth is located, could be a really simple and easy place to attack.",
