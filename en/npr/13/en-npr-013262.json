        "It's because politically, militarily, they know it's a dumb idea.",
        "So you can paint all of these scenarios, and they make great movie plots, but back in the real world, Wall Street is safe against nation-states bringing it down because that's not the way nation-states work.",

        "Response in cyberspace, response anywhere, depends on who's attacking you and why.",
        "And so whether you call the FBI or Homeland Security or the military or your corporate lawyers depends not on what happens but who does it and why.",
        "So when you look at response, that's where you have to look, not on the effects but on where it comes from.",

        "How vulnerable are we?",
        "I think the key is to say what - vulnerable to what?",
        "What is the most likely threat, and then what is the most dangerous threat?",

        "We're such a way long way from that I dont see that point coming, but that's how far we would have to go for that kind of threat to become a national security threat.",

        "This is a real threat.",
        "Companies are losing their intellectual property, in some cases to foreign governments, in many cases to organizations we don't know much about and for reasons we don't know much about.",

        "A real threat is also in battle.",
        "It's almost impossible to imagine a future conflict that doesn't have a cyber dimension, and so we just have to be prepared that others will try and interrupt our command and control and that there are offensive tools that we would expect our military to use, as well.",
        "I hope that doesn't happen anytime soon, but looking over the broad swath of history, conflicts occur, and in the future, cyber will be part of that.",
        "If one guy mistyping a B can bring down all the stock market in a matter of minutes, why is that not considered a threat if you might have an organized attach that can do that with many people?",
        "Well, it is a threat, period, full stop.",
        "It is a threat.",
        "But it's also not something that is imminent, I think for some of the reasons Bruce laid out.",
        "First of all, who has the motivation to do that?",
        "It's not nation-states.",
        "The Chinese, for instance, have so much money invested in the American financial system that they would perhaps be the most hurt.",
        "So there are a lot of reasons why nation-states would be deterred from engaging in that kind of attack.",
        "Now, I think something to be at least concerned about looking forward into the future is that criminals and terrorists or whomever can increasingly purchase advanced cyber-capabilities on an open black market, and to the extent that malicious actors who have an ideological intent, like the group around Anonymous that was going to go after the base in Quantico, to the extent that those actors can gain access to sophisticated capabilities, that's something to at least watch over the long term."

        "Indeed, and you know we quote that in the report.",
        "And I think the reason we raised that is because everyone is grasping for examples, trying to understand cyber-conflicts, cyber-war and in fact have grasped on to some very poor examples of what to be worried about.",
        "But we have to be preparing now for the threats we might face in the future, and the way we need to do that is by building better software, more secure systems.",

        "I think there's a real risk of spending a tremendous amount of money on cyber-security for a low return.",
        "You can't possibly secure every potential target.",

        "Whether it's, you know, two guys from China or the Chinese government, they're doing the same stuff.",
