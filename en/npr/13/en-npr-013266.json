        "Yeah.",
        "I won't bore you with all the details.",
        "It was a fantastic trip.",
        "I blogged about it every day and I wrote a little puzzle every day I was there, which I incorporated into the blog.",
        "It's like an NPR challenge but a little easier.",
        "And there's a link to all this on NPR's Puzzle page.",
        "Great.",
        "I've always wanted to go to Alaska, so I will live vicariously through your adventures and I'll check out your blog.",
        "So, let's get down to business.",
        "Remind us what was last week's challenge.",
        "Yes.",
        "I said name a movie in two words - five letters in each word.",
        "Both words start with vowels.",
        "I said take one letter in the first word, move it two spaces later in the alphabet, and rearrange the result.",
        "You'll get the second word in the movie's title.",
        "Well, the answer is a recent movie.",
        "In fact I think it's out right now.",
        "I saw it a couple of weeks ago: \"\"After Earth.\"\" The F from after changes to an H, and you rearrange that to get Earth.",
        "OK.",
        "We got over 500 correct answers this week, and our randomly selected winner is Joseph Young of St. Cloud, Minnesota.",
        "He joins us on the line.",
        "Congratulations, Joseph.",
        "Thank you, Rachel.",
        "So, did this one come pretty quickly?",
        "How did you figure it out?",
        "And it was sort of a tough one, mainly 'cause I wasn't real familiar with the movie.",
        "But I just took five-letter words and started with vowels that might be in movies.",
        "I finally just hit upon the right answer, and I made sure it was a movie, and it was.",
        "Are you been playing the puzzle for a long time?",
        "Oh, about 10 years.",
        "You know, so I'm really amazed that I was chosen.",
        "No, 10 years is a long time to accrue some good experience.",
        "That should help you today.",
        "And you're from St. Cloud, Minnesota, we mentioned.",

        "I like to bicycle and I do some writing.",
        "One thing about this puzzle too, Rachel, that I'd like to say that it's really ingenious because the letters in the name of the movie could be rearranged to form the word father.",
        "And Will Smith and Jaden Smith are actually father and son in the movie and in real life.",
        "So, I think Will did something very...",
        "Did you know that, Will?",
        "No. That is so clever.",

        "Well, I think Will was the creative one there.",
        "I just, you know, figured it out.",
        "OK.",
        "Well, let's see if you can put those skills to the test.",
        "Will, what do you have for us?",
        "All right.",
        "Joseph, today's puzzle is best to try if you're sitting down.",
        "Every answer is a familiar two-word phrase or name in which the first word starts S-I and the second word starts with T.",
