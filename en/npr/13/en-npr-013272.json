        "I'm very grateful to have this honor to speak to you about something that we all carry about which has to do with sound.",

        "Rauf is British-born, and he's thought to be the leaders of the alleged conspiracy.",
        "After his arrest, someone in Pakistan called one of the cell members in Britain to warn them.",
        "That call was intercepted by British intelligence, who determined the attack was imminent.",
        "Reid says the main suspects are probably in custody, but...",
        "I have to be honest and say that on the basis of what we know there could be others out there, perhaps we don't know, perhaps people who are involved in other plots.",
        "So the threat of a terrorist attack in the United Kingdom is still very substantial.",
        "So substantial that as many as 12 other alleged terror plots, described by John Reid as major plots, are now under investigation in the U.K.",
        "Of those arrested this week, some may be linked to the bombers who carried out last year's London transport bombings.",
        "For the first time since the bombings, Reid revealed that British intelligence operatives had thwarted other hitherto unreported terror attacks.",
        "I can tell you that at least four major plots have been thwarted.",
        "Despite this announcement, many Britains are wondering whether the strict airport security measures are still necessary.",
        "British officials say those measures will continue for the days to come, contributing to severe backups at Britain's three major airports.",
        "At the same time, Reid today said he's spoken to U.S.",
        "Homeland Security Chief Michael Chertoff, suggesting that he consider easing some of the restrictions imposed on flights from the United States."

        "This week, actually, next week, the 11th of February, we'll see the implementation of the global political agreement, which was signed in September of last year and due to the political differences between Robert Mugabe and his party, ZANU-PF, and Morgan Tsavangirai and his party, MDC, they've been unable to have a government, and so we've had a stalemate for several months.",
        "Now there seems to be some movement.",
        "The next eight days are critical.",
        "Although MDC, Morgan Tsvangirai have agreed to come into the official government, he has agreed to become prime minister, it hangs on a number of political issues that have been talked about and hatched out for the last five or six months.",
        "It seems as if the SADC really had a hand in getting Tsvangirai to move to the position of agreeing to this, and I'm supposing that the international community's reaction - the anticipated reaction may have also played a part.",
        "Am I right?",
        "That's absolutely correct.",
        "SADC or the S-A-D-C, the Southern African Development Community has been working since before the elections to try to quell the political divide between MDC and ZANU-PF, and under the leadership of former South African President Thabo Mbeki have finally started to see some fruit of their labor.",

        "You know, Qaddafi wants the AU to function more like the European Union where there is a central authority, but some of the other African countries fear, don't they, that that will erode their sovereignty.",
        "What are the pros and cons from modeling the AU after the EU, and how successful might Qaddafi be along that line?",
