        "There isn't really a question.",

        "They're both a society of Bantu Somalis, which are more kind of ethnic African Somalis, and traditional Somalis, which are a blend of the Arab and African world.",
        "And so there isn't really that tension.",
        "I think mostly for Somalia the biggest tension is whether or not the different political leadership can come together to actually secure the country so that regular Somalis can go about their lives.",
        "Really briefly, my last question is this.",
        "Ethiopian troops were supposed to have pulled out of Somalia but there are conflicting eyewitness reports that they have returned.",
        "What's the latest on that?",
        "The latest on that is that the Ethiopian government has spoken out strongly, saying there are no troops within the government, that the only troops that people are seeing are these AU forces that are coming under attack from Al Shebab, which is the kind of - an armed activist group with inside Somalia who's fighting for what they consider to be Somali self-determination.",
        "They're the ones who are mostly behind what may or may not be true, that Ethiopians are actually operating in the country, although all reports that we've had confirmed as of today have said that actually all Ethiopians troops are behind the border of Ethiopia, and so we'll have to continue to monitor the situation.",
        "So this doesn't mean that the new president is beginning with a crisis of that proportion, at least in the beginning.",
        "He has enough crises on his hands as it is.",
        "I mean, Somalia is far from a functioning country.",
        "Most of the people who live in Somalia are internally displaced.",
        "It's kind of some of the worst fighting and just the dire situation on the continent.",
        "I mean, we talk about all the time about different crises, but Somalia really is Ground Zero right now for crises on the continent.",

        "We got a bit of legal advice yesterday from Sherrilyn Ifill, and she said, well yeah, apparently so.",
        "But this is a very odd conclusion to, you know, the presidential race and then the seat opening up, and, of course, the issue with the governor - not small issues - of him being currently under legal investigation and indictment.",

        "One of them is that Congressman Emanuel Cleaver said that this seat should not be viewed as, quote, \"\"the black seat,\"\" this Senate seat.",
        "But Congressman Bobby Rush asked Senate Democrats to seat Burris because there are no black Senate members, and he called the all-white chamber, quote, \"\"the last bastion of plantation politics.\"\" So what do you see in the intersection of those two comments?",
        "Well, I had the benefit of watching cable news all morning and watching as Reid sat down with Burris and had the photo op to sort of counteract yesterday's disaster, in my opinion, for the Democratic Party.",
        "Burris approaching in the rain, being turned away from this - I mean, it was just - it was disastrous.",
        "And now, you even have Barack Obama coming out and saying, he's a good man, and if he - you know, it's a Senate matter, but if he's seated, I will work with him.",
        "Talk about an about face.",
        "But the point is, they were scrambling.",
        "What I noted - the headline, as I rushed here, the headline in my mind was the secretary is - secretary of the Senate - excuse me - Timothy Wright is a player hater because it all comes down to this signature.",
        "So you have Reid reminding the press and all of America that Wright is an African-American, and that Burris says this is not a racial issue.",
        "So they're scrambling as hard as possible to keep race out of this.",
        "And they said - they must have said in Reid's press conference about 20 minutes ago five times, race is not an issue.",
        "So I don't know if there is an intersection, except that the race card was laid down.",
        "It's now visible, and they're trying to pull it off the table.",
        "Casey, what do you make of the partisan politics in this?",

        "Go ahead.",
        "If I can just chime in, I think it's interesting that Bobby Rush is so adamant about this seat being replaced by a black candidate, you know, or a black senator given the fact that if we rewind a few years ago, I think everyone would remember that Bobby Rush was not behind Barack Obama when he ran for Senate in the first place because, I guess, depending on who we ask, it seemed like he was harboring some ill sentiments given the fact that Obama ran against him and challenged him early on in his career.",
        "So it's very interesting that now, he's so, you know, adamant about the fact that we've got to have a black person in the seat when that wasn't the case.",
        "I don't know.",

        "And that may sound strange when you've got one of the biggest political events coming up in - I mean, some people argue it's the biggest in a lifetime.",
        "But cable news shows and electronic media in general actually saw their huge audiences evaporate after the election.",
        "There were massive, you know, multimillion-dollar viewer drops in - basically, in what was a huge audience for political news.",
        "And according to Nielsen Online, the biggest decline that you saw online was at popular news websites.",
        "No. No. I think the music is the only idea that it represents the quality of what it does.",
        "Have any of you guys - Carmen, have you - do you think that there is still as strong an appetite for political news?",
        "And if so, is that appetite changing at all, since obviously, we're not in a situation of seeing all these different races, except for maybe Al Franken?",
        "It's a tricky thing because I must say, my readership since November is up 20 percent.",
        "So I'm wondering if it's - but I blog about all sorts of things, not just politics, and that maybe politics drew them to the site, and they stay for other reasons.",
        "But I'm thinking that maybe purely political sites, where you don't have a relationship with the writers, or we're watching on news and anchors become news readers, shall I say, not even anchors - become interchangeable, that there is an impetus to turn off the TV, also because the news is so depressing, the economic news."
