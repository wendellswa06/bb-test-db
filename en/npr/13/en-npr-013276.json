        "UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: The location was Mexico City.",
        "All was normal until a gangly 21-year-old civil engineering student in mismatched running shoes did this.",
        "Fosbury jumped, shockingly, with his back to the bar, his head and shoulders clearing first, his legs and feet trailing - you know, the way every serious high jumper does it now.",
        "But he was the first to do it internationally.",
        "And Fosbury remembers the buzz that day in the Estadio Olimpico.",
        "They had started to notice me jumping at the early heights, and then everybody was telling all of their neighbors watch this, watch this.",
        "He remembers how he felt landing after clearing the winning height of 7 feet, 4 1/4 inches - an Olympic and American record.",
        "Amazement and joy.",
        "UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, here he is, Mr. Dick Fosbury.",
        "What?",
        "UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Welcome back home.",
        "Home is Medford, Ore.",
        "Naturally, it was one of the stops for Fosbury this week - a signing session for the new book \"\"The Wizard Of Foz.\"\" High school classmates and hometown admirers showed up, including 84-year-old Cees Garrett.",
        "She cheered him on in Mexico City."

        "I was one of the loudest voices when you made your jump (laughter).",
        "I understand and my mother nearly fainted.",
        "Gold medals make everything right because, frankly, it seemed a bit wrong to Garrett and others when Dick Fosbury started that cockamamie backwards jumping.",
        "We thought, this is really weird (laughter).",
        "This changed in 1969 when the Zulus were allowed to roll down New Orleans' main parade route.",
        "In the process, Zulu integrated Mardi Gras and became known for their unique traditions.",
        "While other Krewes riders used masks to hide their identities, the Zulus donned black face makeup.",
        "All parades throw beads and doubloons into the crowd, but the Zulus also hand out painted coconuts - some of the most prized giveaways of the Mardi Gras season.",
        "And there are other firsts for the Zulus.",

        "Twenty odd years later, when future City Councilman Roy Glapion attended the Mardi Gras parade, it was still a ragtag, disorganized affair.",
        "Glapion's son, also named Roy, remembers how seeing it touched his father.",
        "Mr.",
        "ROY GLAPION Jr.: I was a little kid.",

        "Zulu has long been the center of Mardi Gras for the African-American community.",

        "The pride continues this weekend.",
        "A year-long exhibit opens at the Louisiana State Museum in the French Quarter, exploring the Zulu's origins, carnival traditions, and civic contributions.",
        "Becknell says the exhibit is a formal recognition of what the Zulus mean to Mardi Gras and New Orleans.",
        "In the beginning, no one knew what Zulu was about.",
        "In the middle, it started questioning it.",
        "Now they really want to know because this made a big impact economically, socially, popularity wise.",
        "Even as Zulu celebrates its centennial, it's looking forward to a more stable future.",
        "Like scores of New Orleanians, many Zulu lost their homes when the city flooded, and they're still scattered throughout the country.",
        "Mardi Gras is one time when they get to come home.",

        "Professional bull riding is a wild brawl between man and bull.",
        "When a man wins, he does it by clinging to the back of an enraged animal for eight seconds and then hopping off to the roar of a crowd.",
        "The bull, of course, wins by tossing the rider to the ground, sometimes breaking bones and spilling blood in the process.",
        "Points are awarded for control, for posture, and of course for the difficulty of the beast.",
        "Adriano Moraes is a Brazilian bull-riding legend, three-time professional bull riding champion.",
        "He's been called the greatest bull rider ever, and he joins us today from his home in Tyler, Texas.",

        "You know, it's kind of weird that I chose that profession, and if I had to describe how it feels and why I get on, I mean, born and raised at the ranch and being around livestock my entire life - and one day I realized that what I was doing for fun, some guys were doing for money at the rodeos and bull-ridings, and I decided to try, and it has been 18 years professionally already.",
        "Well, that ranch where you grew up was of course in Brazil.",
        "Is there a professional bull-riding circuit there as well?",
        "Yes, there is.",
        "It's not as big, it doesn't pay as much, but it's very, very hard competition also.",
        "Our bulls are extremely good, and our riders are extremely good, and so that's why us Brazilians ride so well, because when we are in the process of learning, we compete against very rank animals.",
        "Rank animals, rank meaning not in a good mood.",
        "Well, that has nothing to do with being happy or upset or meanness, and it's nothing to do with bucking ability.",
        "You know, these animals are born to buck.",
        "They are bred to buck just like horses are bred to race or jump, you know, and these animals, they are not wild bulls anymore, there are born to buck, bucking bulls, you know.",
        "And are they injured in this process?",
        "Not at all, not at all.",
        "I don't know if any bull ever got an injury, you know, because they are so massive.",

        "They always, you know, stay in a good physical condition.",

        "So 50 years ago, you arrived in New York, you've turned the jazz world on its head with songs like \"\"Lonely Woman\"\" and \"\"Congeniality,\"\" and people started paying attention to what you were doing, but it wasn't always positive.",
        "What kind of reactions did you have to people who praised you but also to those who criticized you?",
