        "The numbers remain low to reflect reality.",
        "Women make up just 7 percent of the Marine Corps.",

        "Some of the females performed better than some of the other females.",
        "Some of the females performed better than some of the males.",
        "Still, more than 30 percent of the women in Dober's infantry unit washed out, most due to injuries like stress fractures from carrying heavy packs.",
        "That rate is far higher than for the men, some officers say, although the Marines are not releasing any details and are still completing their report.",

        "Well, we have a trade policy that says shut down production in Garfield Heights or Toledo, Ohio, and move it to China and get a tax break.",

        "Not everything that has happened since Justice Scalia died has had a sort of a loving tone to it.",
        "From the moment last weekend when we learned that he was dead, that he had died traveling in Texas, there has been comment and argument about filling his vacancy on the court.",

        "Of course, in the eastern United States and for those areas where the eclipse occurs after midnight, it's the calendar date of December 21st, which is also the date of the winter solstice.",
        "The moon will continue to progress into the shadow, and then at approximately 2:41, it will be completely in the shadow, 2:41 Eastern Time, 11:41 p.m. Pacific Time.",
        "And for 72 minutes, while the moon is completely immersed in the shadow of the Earth, one would think that since the shadow is going to cut off all sunlight from the moon, that it would black out completely.",
        "It will not.",
        "Instead, around the time of total eclipse, it's going to appear to light up like a coppery orange or reddish ball, and the reason for that is that the sunlight is going to be strained through the Earth's atmosphere, and our atmosphere is going to act like a lens and bend that ruddy hue - the same ruddy color that you see in sunrise and sunset -onto the surface of the moon while it's immersed in the shadow.",
        "And that will be the only light source that will be hitting the moon, during totality, will be that faint, coppery glow.",
        "And that's why the moon will appear to light up with a reddish color.",
        "And that will be for about 72 minutes during totality, and then totality will come to an end.",
        "That'll come at approximately three - well, let's see, Eastern Standard Time, 3:53, or Pacific Standard Time 12:53 a.m. The moon will slowly exit the shadow, and then the last little bite will disappear on the moon's lower right edge - if you have enough gumption to stay up - 5:01 a.m. Eastern Time, 2:01 a.m. Pacific Time.",
        "And also, the great news about a lunar eclipse is you don't have to be afraid to look at it with the naked eye, right?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "People sometimes get this confused with solar eclipses, and, of course, if you're watching a partial eclipse of the sun, when the moon is covering the sun, you dont want to look directly at the sun, lest you wreck your eyes.",
        "But a lunar eclipse is perfectly safe to look at.",
        "In fact, I use the analogy, Ira, of a lunar eclipse, the equivalent of when, you know, folks go to a movie.",

        "Consider all of us on the dark side of the Earth to be inside the movie theater, you and your neighbors all around at that part of the Earth's hemisphere, and you're all looking up - not at a movie screen, but you're looking up at the moon.",
        "And you're waiting for something to be projected upon the moon's face, and that will of course be the moon's shadow - the Earth's shadow, I should say, as it slowly creeps across the disk of the moon and will provide you with some entertainment for a few hours next Monday night."
