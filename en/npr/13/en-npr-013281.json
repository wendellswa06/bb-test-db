        "You know, we don't get to talk very much about occurrences of a lunar eclipse.",
        "Are they very rare?",
        "No, not really.",
        "Actually, lunar eclipses are more common, though actually a little less frequent than total solar eclipses.",
        "To see a total eclipse of the sun, for example, you have to be in a specific spot at a specific moment when a narrow track of the moon's shadow passes you by.",
        "That's why for any one singular spot on the Earth to see a total eclipse of the sun, you may have to wait as long as 300 or 400 years.",
        "But a lunar eclipse, because it's visible, whenever it does occur, to half of the Earth, is more commonly observed.",
        "In fact, on average, I'd say roughly, per decade, if you are, you know, aware of things and keep track of your astronomical almanac or calendar, you could see maybe four or five total lunar eclipses per decade.",
        "So they, again, are a bit more common to the man on the street, as opposed to a total solar eclipse.",
        "And so a lunar eclipse has to happen when there's a full moon.",
        "That's correct.",
        "So the alignment is the Earth is at exactly on the opposite of the sun than the moon is.",
        "The Earth is in between the sun and the moon and throwing its shadow - getting between the two and throwing its shadow upon the moon and blacking it out, or at least diminishing it during an eclipse.",
        "And during totality, depending upon the state of the Earth's atmosphere - and I mentioned the coppery color.",
        "Depending upon how clear the atmosphere is, if there aren't any clouds, if there are not any, you know, large amounts of particulate matter in the atmosphere, then the moon, during the total phase, could light up like a fiery orange color.",
        "But then if there are more particulates - for example, there were a couple of volcanoes that erupted during the past year, one in Iceland, most recently one in Indonesia.",
        "If there are some aerosol clouds up there to block out that red light from reaching the moon, then instead of an orange or red color, the moon could appear murky brown or dusty red-gray.",
        "It all depends upon the effects of cloud and haze elsewhere around our globe."

        "Well, directly below the moon, during totality on Monday night, early Tuesday morning, will be the most beautiful of all constellations, the constellation of Orion the Hunter, four bright stars making up the body or torso of the hunter, and three stars in the middle forming the belt.",
        "Although at this time of the year, Ira, at planetarium shows, I like to point Orion out as the giant Christmas package in the sky, the four stars outlining the package and the three stars in the middle outlining the bow.",
        "You could also see, nearby to Orion, Taurus the Bull, a V-shaped face to the upper right of Orion.",
        "And the brightest star in the nighttime sky is Sirius, the Dog Star, below and to Orion's left.",
        "Also dominating our evening sky, people going outside during the first half of the night might be noticing a bright, silvery-white star with not much twinkling to it, and that's the planet Jupiter, the biggest planet in our solar system.",

        "We're going to celebrate the winter solstice and talk about the lunar eclipse.",
        "We're first going to have people come in, look at the simulation of the winter sky and also the eclipse using our Zeiss 9 planetarium projector in our space theater.",
        "And then after we do that, we're all going to adjourn to the Rose Center Terrace, where we'll have telescopes set up by the Amateur Astronomer's Association, and you'll be able to look at the moon and look at Jupiter and other objects.",
        "We won't be out there for the eclipse.",
        "It'll be a little late for that, but..."
