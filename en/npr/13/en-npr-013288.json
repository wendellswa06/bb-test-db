        "And a lot of that's going to depend if - there's a wonderful book out now, Jerome Groopman and his wife wrote, called \"\"Your Medical Mind,\"\" and it's about trying to discern what your own values are.",
        "Are you someone who really wants to just get at the problem right away and be really aggressive, you want to cut that cancer out, you want to go for the surgery?",
        "Or are you more of a less aggressive, let's see if something less invasive works first?",
        "And you and your doctor have to sort of work those things out together.",
        "So there is not necessarily a right scientific medical answer on what to do.",
        "Not always, in fact rarely, probably, unless it's like this is a really aggressive cancer, it's going to kill you in two weeks, you'd better get out there and do something about it.",

        "Kate, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Hi, I had just been diagnosed with cancer and went through a surgery technique and then after that was presented with chemotherapy options and of course radiation following that.",
        "The second opinion after considering chemotherapy, was that this - the initial prognosticating index that the first doctor gave, was using data from 1992.",
        "And other prognosticating indexes showed that chemotherapy was of no measurable benefit in my case.",
        "So I really urge listeners to look at the statistics that back up what your doctor is trying to do.",
        "Maybe he's trying to sell you something that, you know, has $5,000 to $55,000 in cost benefit per treatment, like chemo.",
        "And then when it comes to radiation, I was presented initially with only one type, which is on rather old machines where they were trying to sell time, had significant damage to peripheral organs such as the lungs and the heart, and wasn't told about 15 other types of radiation that are more up-to-date, more focused, less damaging.",
        "And all this can be learned by personal research on the Net, although it took a tremendous amount of time to find this out.",
        "Yeah, I was going to say, Kate, it sounds like you needed to do an awful lot of work and to have a lot of energy and a lot of push on this yourself.",
        "Yes, and it was disappointing that my doctor didn't want to educate me because he wanted to sort of send me down the mainstream pipeline that's endorsed by, you know, his insurance, indemnification, to send you through chemo and wide-beam radiation.",
        "And it is the most profitable of things.",
        "So, you know, you have to bear in mind that that may be a motive for some large doctors - some large hospital groups."

        "Laura Landro of the Wall Street Journal, is it the case sometimes that doctors themselves will seek a second opinion?",
        "And I've heard of cases where they'll put together a team from across several disciplines to try to help them...",
        "Well, that's like a tumor board.",
        "If you go to one of these big breast cancer centers, they'll have a tumor board because, you know, the surgeon may want to do surgery, the radiologist may want to do radiation, and they may be able to come up with what's the best thing for this patient.",
        "Let's reach a consensus within our organization.",
        "You're also seeing a lot more pathologists within their own institutions will have a second pair of eyes, what they call secondary review, because pathology, it's a little bit of an art, so is radiology.",
        "You're looking at images.",
        "You're looking at slides, and you're trying to figure out what is that, and things can differ.",
        "We've seen this happen in my family, where things were read one way, and, you know, it was read to be a tumor, and it turned out to be scar tissue.",
        "So, you know, with someone more experienced looking at it - and you do have to really hope that within - I think you can count on a lot of doctors, well, they're trying to do the right thing.",
        "Yeah, I don't know if you'll mind doing this, but I know because you alluded to it in your Wall Street Journal piece that you actually had a serious medical condition, and you went for a second opinion.",
        "Oh, yes, and I've written a book about it called \"\"Survivor.\"\" Before the TV show, I had the name.",
        "But anyway, yes, I was diagnosed with leukemia, now, 20 years ago, CML, and the only - you know, I knew I had to get a bone marrow transplant, but there were three different approaches to the transplants being done at three major cancer centers.",
        "And I really had to study the data and look at the long-term survival rates and look at, you know, what was going to be best for my disease, my condition, my stage of disease at the time that I had it.",
        "And, you know, it was kind of a tough call, but in the end, I went with the center that had the most experience, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, and which also had the best long-term disease-free survival for people with my situation.",
        "And it was tough.",
        "You know, I had to 3,000 miles away from home, and I was fortunate to have insurance and an employer who allowed me to do that.",
        "When you say it was tough, do you mean that it was wearing, or do you mean that you had to fight to get this?"

        "And at the time, I think doctors were not used to - my doctors in New York weren't used to having someone question here's what you're going to do and ask them, you know, come in with note papers and ask them questions and give them statistics that I pulled down off of, you know, medical studies.",
        "I was a reporter, and I was a little bit at - obviously at a big advantage for that, and I had a lot of friends who were scientists, and I pulled together a team of people who really helped.",
        "And you can do that as an individual, as well.",
        "But I really had to make a decision that was a tough one, because it meant leaving where I had started, you know, down the process, and it also meant again going 3,000 miles from home.",
        "And - but it was very much a decision, it was also based on a feeling about the doctors, a feeling about the hospital, a feeling about - that they cared, you know, a little bit - you get a little into, not just the diagnostics, but how do I feel about the treatment (unintelligible) people.",

        "Oh, OK.",

        "The other thing that I would suggest to patients is that if they feel the need for a second opinion, I really do think that they should discuss that with their primary doctor, and oftentimes, you know, I can try and help facilitate that.",
        "I can provide them all of the records that we have so far, the tests that we've done, and you know, maybe suggest that, oh, this research center really specializes in what we think you have, and that might be a good place for you to start looking...",

        "So we've heard and just heard from a doctor and from several patients who have been talking about their experiences in seeking second opinions.",
        "I have a few questions, and one of them is actually put - I was going to put to you, but it comes in the form of an email.",
        "Del(ph) from Florida puts it this way, and it's very blunt.",
        "He says: Doesn't asking a second opinion insult the doctor?",
        "How could it not?",
        "You're saying that you don't trust his opinion.",
        "And I would assume that maybe that inhibition exists in a lot of patients, that they feel they're going to make an enemy of the doctor if they say I want to go somewhere else for more advice.",
        "Well, when you have a life-threatening condition, such as cancer, it's your life, it's your decision, and if the doctor gets insulted, maybe it's time to get another doctor.",
        "I think that many physicians will understand that when you get into a complicated medical circumstance, that having another set of eyes and ears, so to speak, to go over things is not a bad idea.",
        "And I think that many physicians that I know will actually encourage people if they have a question to seek a second opinion.",
        "So if your doctor is going to be insulted, let your doctor be insulted; it's your life, take charge, do what you need to do to make yourself comfortable.",
        "How does it work among you, though, as colleagues if you were to give a second opinion that essentially, let's say, corrects or updates or turns out in the end to be better than your colleague's?",
        "Does that put your colleague in a bad light?",
        "You know, say it happens more than once or twice or three times.",
        "Well, you know, I don't think it puts the colleague in a bad light.",
        "Understand, as was mentioned earlier in the prior segment, medicine, there's a lot of art to medicine, as well as science.",
        "So not everything is as clear-cut, and different people have different approaches.",
        "And as Ryan just mentioned, sometimes you may have a better comfort level with one doctor versus another, and that's a very important consideration.",
        "I can't emphasize that enough.",
        "So you know, I will say I've seen situations, and I think something to be cautious about, I've seen situations where someone who – a surgical opinion, asks for another opinion, and they gave them somebody else in the same group; that got a little testy because I don't think the second doctor necessarily wanted to overrule the first doctor.",
        "After I took the class, I said, I'm just so passionate about these issues.",
        "This is what I want to do.",
        "They know each other, work with each other every day in the same hospital, same - essentially the same practice.",
        "But you know, again, it comes down to the bottom line: Life-threatening conditions, serious conditions.",
        "If you have the option and opportunity and the time to get the second opinion, and you feel that you would feel better from having that opinion, do it and not hesitate.",
        "And is there any etiquette to this that we need to know about?"
