        "Hopefully you have someone who's your primary source of care.",
        "Unfortunately, not everyone has that these days, but a primary care family physician, a primary care internist, can be a critical ally in helping you get through that process.",
        "The etiquette simply is once you've made the arrangement, the decision to do that, is to say to your doctor this is something I want to do, and this is not necessarily a reflection on you personally, but this is important for me and my family, and just make that doctor aware that you're pursuing that second opinion.",
        "Jim from Rochester, New York, you're on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Yes, I have been complaining for a year, a year and a half to my primary physician about a coughing and clearing my throat and phlegm situation.",
        "And finally I bugged him enough where he sent me to a throat doctor.",
        "And the throat doctor concluded that I had laryngeal, pharyngeal acid reflux and to see him in a couple of months and take a couple of pills that he said and a diet.",
        "I somehow just couldn't buy that.",
        "So I had an upcoming appointment with - for a colonoscopy.",
        "So I decided to go in to see my doctor that was going to do the colonoscopy, because he is a little familiar with that area, he comes - I guess he's from the throat down, and he considered doing an endoscope, an endoscopy, which we had done, and he spotted something and said I should go to a throat doctor.",
        "And I said I just got through two weeks ago, and he said, well, it may be a tumor, and the long story short, I went back, and in effect they did find that it was a throat cancer, actually a tumor on my tongue.",
        "And Stage 2, and then I did my seven weeks of radiation.",
        "But my point is that I was basically misdiagnosed.",
        "I was a self-advocate and moved on and asked another doctor and got the right answer.",
        "It was...",
        "I'm curious, Jim, you're the third caller to mention that something bothered me, something didn't feel right with me.",

        "I don't think there's any question that we know our bodies better than anyone else.",
        "And when something is amiss, and you're not comfortable with the answers you're getting, it is perfectly appropriate to seek that other opinion.",
        "Now, there comes a time when you say the repetitive opinion-seeking might not be appropriate or productive.",
        "But it comes down to the fact that we know ourselves better than anyone else does, and I think we always have to keep that in mind.",
        "And the other point I would make is that in our medical system today, unfortunately, it's becoming a lot more fragmented, and that means more of us going forward are going to have to be responsible for our own health, be our own advocates and take charge and take responsibility of how we live, what we do and how we obtain our medical care and how we engage in seeking that care.",
        "Jim, you wanted to add something else?",
        "Yes, yes, and amen to that, and my radiology oncologist told me that - she said I always listen to my patients because invariably they are correct.",
        "And my type of cancer, by the way, which is a very important situation I would like to get out there, was caused by HPV virus, human papillomavirus, which is similar to what Michael Douglas the actor has.",

        "And we're - you know, we've gone from a system that was very paternalistic, where the patient really had no, not many rights and not much responsibility, to a system where we are trying to become more consumer - more of a consumer.",
        "And so we have not only rights but responsibilities as patients to educate ourselves, to follow our instincts, and there's just really in this day and age, with online resources, there is just no excuse for not being able to access journals and educating yourself as intensely and deeply as you can about any diagnosis you get, not just getting a second opinion, which is, you know, essential sometimes, but also having - being armed with knowledge so that you...",
        "You know, because there - I see instances with patients who, because they dove into something, they really became an expert in their particular diagnosis.",
        "I mean, they knew as much, if not more than their particular physician.",
        "Marjorie, I hear you on that, and I thank you for your call.",

        "Prior to your being an oncologist, you did primary care, did you not?",
        "I have been a primary care internist at one point in my career.",
        "Yes.",
        "So at that level, you might be dealing with aches and pains and sore throats, and let's say something like a chronic nerve problem, somebody has sciatica.",
        "And you know what they need to do for sciatica, which is, essentially, is to, I think, in most cases, to ride it out, maybe with some painkillers.",

        "Hi, Joe.",
        "The Ninth Circuit did the right thing.",
        "There is a sense of justice, a sense of joy.",
        "A patient who comes in seeking a second or a third or a fourth opinion because they're frustrated by the pain, or a patient who comes in with something discovered off of the Internet because of that kind of research that Marjorie's talking about, and that kind of energy and devotion, would that sort of patient not drive you crazy after a while?",
        "The patient is - partnership is the best way to approach medical care.",
        "So I will never say to somebody, don't go to the Internet.",
        "I will say at some point, you have to have trust in the people who are caring for you, because they are - hopefully, have your best interests at heart."

        "But when it comes to a more complicated case, they seem very flummoxed.",
        "And I don't think doctors have any training in trying to figure out a more complex case.",
        "And I just - I wonder if there's any movement to train doctors better in that way, because it seems if they come up with a first diagnosis in 17 seconds, and if that's wrong, then they have no idea.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Dr. Lichtenfeld?",
        "Well, I can't speak to making a diagnosis in 17 seconds, and I would go back to a comment that was made earlier.",

        "We are not training primary care physicians in this country.",
        "And as part of the training of primary care physicians, they have experience across a broad spectrum of illnesses.",
        "They are taught - particularly internists and family physicians - are taught how to bring the pieces of the puzzle together.",
        "Instead, we're having a fragmented system, highly specialized, people going off in different directions, and nobody - captain of the ship, shall we say - nobody in charge, nobody who's bringing all of it together.",
        "That's the risk we have.",
        "And the point - if the point is that we're not able to have a person to synthesize all of this, that's valid.",
