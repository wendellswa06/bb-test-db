        "And she really likes them.",
        "Now, compare this to people who have a version of the gene which makes them very sensitive to bitter.",
        "Their strong perception of bitterness overwhelms the natural sweetness in greens, and her hunch was that this may lead them to avoid greens.",
        "So she decided to test the theory.",
        "So what we did was we recruited young adults.",
        "And we asked them to come into the lab, and we did a bunch of taste tests with them.",
        "They sampled all kinds of vegetables to establish their sensitivity.",
        "They were tested for the gene, and they filled out questionnaires and kept journals to document what they were eating.",
        "What came out of the study was pretty striking, Duffy says.",
        "The tasters who had the version of the gene that makes them super sensitive to bitter ate far fewer vegetables of all kinds - more than 200 fewer servings over the course of a year.",
        "Did that surprise you?",
        "Yes.",
        "What we think is that if somebody finds some vegetables too bitter, they kind of generalize to all green vegetables that they don't like.",
        "But Duffy is quick to point out that many other factors play into this.",
        "Take, for instance, the couple on the lunch date, Matthew and Samantha.",
        "Matthew says his affinity for bitter could be in his genes.",
        "Or maybe it's what he learned from his parents.",
        "I just know I was exposed to a lot of food growing up.",
        "And so I got an appreciation for all of it.",
        "And researcher Valerie Duffy says definitely; what our parents teach us is influential.",
        "But there are other influences too.",
        "Yeah, I don't know.",
        "I thought I heard that your taste buds change after a certain amount of years.",
        "Samantha may be onto something.",
        "Duffy says there are changes over a lifetime.",
        "For instance, the perception of bitterness is boosted during the childbearing years.",
        "And then, by age 70, regardless of the gene you carry, the intensity of bitter tends to fade.",

        "It was a tumultuous world of poverty and gangs.",
        "To Paul, the rest of America was just a shadow of reality.",
        "My family moved probably - every three or six months, we moved.",
        "And we lived in 7th Street, 4th Street, 17th Street.",
        "For him, college wasn't even an option.",
