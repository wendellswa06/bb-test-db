        "My wife and I are both theater artists, and before our children were born, I certainly said to anyone who would listen, you know, I would never encourage them to go into the theater profession.",
        "It's a difficult career, absolutely, and hard times ahead for anyone who tries it.",
        "But it became inevitable.",
        "They were just there.",
        "You know, they grew up backstage, as you said, and on the sets and understanding that as simply a lifestyle.",
        "That's what life was to them.",
        "And so there came a point where my daughter said, you know, when am I going to do a show, when's my show?",
        "And of course it made sense to put her in.",
        "I relished seeing her onstage and then began to realize that, you know, they truly were gaining a great education not only in the art itself but in the human condition and interpersonal relationships, you know, their language skills, and everything about it was making them better people.",
        "And so now we embrace - my daughter is eight, my son is four.",
        "My daughter has a bit of a resume now, and my son is making his stage debut next week alongside his sister in a little Christmas show we're doing.",
        "Well, congratulate them for me and tell them to break their legs.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Thank you very much, I will do.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Darrin, and if I seem to take some familiarity with Mr. Lithgow, it is because we do know each other.",
        "We worked together many, many years ago at a radio station in New York, and he was appearing in a show called \"\"Under the Gun,\"\" a weekly satirical effort, and other productions at WBAI, where I was working in the news department.",
        "Even that makes an appearance in the memoir."

        "You play to children all the time, but you have children of your own.",
        "Would you want to see them follow you on stage?",
        "You know, it's a very difficult thing, and it's nice that you've made that the theme of our interview, particularly since there's so much father and son dynamics in my book.",
        "I tell young people, including my own kids, don't do this, it's too difficult.",
        "It's a career full of rejection, disappointment and failure.",
        "It's murderously hard on the ego.",

        "I mean, the choice to become an actor is very courageous, but like all courageous acts, it's very foolhardy too, you know.",
        "You were, in a sense, though, cocooned until you got to New York by the fact that you so often worked with your father.",
        "Yeah, and I had the huge advantage of not only a backlog of experience onstage, but I knew what the business was some - to a great extent.",
        "I knew how hard it was.",
        "I knew what I was in for.",
        "But even so, I suffered a couple of brutal years of unemployment and could not get any traction, even with all my - with my huge head start and with my Harvard training, London Academy training, and a year - a convenient father directing a repertory company who was all ready to hire me to get me going.",
