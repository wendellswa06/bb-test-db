        "Yeah, and she's done well in her small pool, and I don't know if she's ready for the times and times and times of no callbacks.",
        "Well, she'll survive it.",
        "You know, if it's something she really wants, she will survive it, and if she's in that Rochester program, it means she's pretty good.",
