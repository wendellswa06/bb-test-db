        "But as a TV critic, I'm always interested in continuity of character and making sure that plotlines make sense.",
        "And, you know, it felt a little inconsistent to me to take someone who was very self-aware - the original \"\"Roseanne\"\" character - a bit of a feminist, a great nose for hypocrisy, and have her vote for Trump without giving you a little bit more explanation for why she made that decision.",

        "Well, I spoke to the stars, Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys, and they both just said they felt like they wanted to go out on top creatively.",
