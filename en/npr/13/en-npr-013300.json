        "Sure.",
        "The report we documented more than 20 types of torture, the most common ones are something called in Syria, the dulab(ph), which means tire.",
        "They put the detainee in the tire so they cannot move and then they proceed to beat the detainee with all sorts of batons, sticks, cables.",
        "And when you say they put them in the tire, you have illustrations of this.",
        "The victim is basically folded in half and put inside a tire.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So it's a way of immobilizing the detainee while, at the same time, causing great stress to their back.",
        "Another method is what's called in Syria shabha(ph), the ghost, where they suspend the detainee sometimes for up to 10 or 12 hours from the ceiling just by their arms and their toes barely touching the ground.",
        "And then, they can proceed to beat them, throw cold water at them, or even use electricity.",
        "And the list of means of torture goes on and on.",
        "You describe attacks with electric shock and acid, sexual assault, pulling out of fingernails, mock execution.",
        "Did you see physical evidence of these torture methods that you describe?",
        "Yes.",
        "Many of the people we've interviewed still have the scars even months after they were out of detention.",
        "Others, you know, had moved on, in terms of physical harm, but were clearly psychologically very much still in pain.",
        "Your report says that the detainees were mostly young men, but also women and children.",
        "And we're about to hear the voice of a 14-year-old interviewed by Human Rights Watch.",
        "He's describing the torture that he endured.",
        "UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Speaking foreign language)",

        "They couldn't find them.",
        "They took the father and beat the father instead.",
        "You know, some of the most revealing descriptions, I think, come from defectors from these security services, intelligence agencies.",
        "You mentioned a member of the riot police, another who described the death of detainees from beatings and one who said if you don't beat or torture, you fear for yourself.",
        "Exactly.",
        "I think the defectors provided key information.",
        "They helped us identify the officers in charge of many of these detention facilities and when we were able to verify this from multiple sources, we published these names.",

        "I know you interviewed Danny Boyle, and I thought he said something quite interesting.",
        "He thought the film - and this is not made on a huge budget by any stretch of the imagination.",
        "As you say, it has no big-name movie stars, at least not big name in terms of the West.",
        "But the fact of the matter is, he said, well, he thought it would do well in Britain because there's such a big Indian connection but was surprised by how well it has done in the United States.",
        "It's a kind of a story that actually works very well in the U.S., which even Danny Boyle and the studios weren't aware of.",
        "It's a story of an underdog.",
        "It's a story where this kid who goes through a lot of hardship, a lot of torture, a lot of pain, (unintelligible) tragedies in order to win the girl who he loves.",
        "I mean, that's the basic story.",
        "I mean, the backdrop, of course, is the game show.",
        "And in that sort of backdrop, you see a whole lot of what's happening in India - the religious issues, the riots, the political problems, the poverty, the slum.",
        "But it's a very upbeat film.",
        "It's a film that really gives a lot of joy to people, and that's why I think the film has really done well here in the U.S.",
        "A light-hearted comedy romp about police interrogation.",
        "Well, it's not light-hearted necessarily, but it does have a very happy ending."

        "Well, yes, you're right to some extent.",
        "Danny Boyle has been very generous in acknowledging that this film would not have been made possible - it would not have been made at all without the support of the Indian cast and crew, especially the crew that he had.",
        "In fact, his casting director is this woman by the name of Loveleen Tandan, who is a very well-known casting director.",

        "One of the reasons why Bollywood films do not sort of cross, especially in the U.S.",

        "Nevertheless, I mean, it's very well done.",
        "It was, you know, the kind of movie, that, yes, it's plausible, everything that could happen to one person's life, but still, it probably goes over the top in those respects.",
        "Well, strange belief, Aseem Chhabra.",
        "Does Dr. Rajani gave a point?",
        "Well, he has a point, but then, you know, if you look at Bollywood movies that we are all very used to in India, I mean, they are really over the top, and they have even far more issues that they try and deal with, and, of course, the scripts fall apart.",
        "I think this is a very tight script.",
        "Despite the fact that there are, yes, a lot of issues and problems- you know, race issues, villages issues, prostitution, beggars, it's a reflection of what life in Bombay is like, and I think it's handled very well.",

        "That's all.",

        "Absolutely and, in fact, there's another movie I saw recently on terrorism which was called \"\"Wednesday.\"\" And it sort of reminded me about that a little, but there's some sort of overlap of the two movies.",
