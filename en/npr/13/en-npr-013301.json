        "And what I appreciate a lot about the film is that it didn't only show very poor Indians, but it also showed very rich Indians.",
        "I think it gives an awareness to Americans that not all Indians are poor.",
        "There are actually some that are very well off, especially the scene where he wouldn't sue his brother's (unintelligible).",
        "And then also the scene where they went into that man's house, very beautiful house.",
        "I think it just shows Americans that there are a lot of rich Indians out there.",

        "The city's not called Bombay, but it's the city of Mumbai or Bombay as it exists today.",
        "And the other thing, a lot of people curious to see the city after reading so much about it and the terrible events in the newspapers, indeed some of those places we see, at least glimpse in the movie.",
        "That is true.",
        "The Victoria Terminal Station, which is now called the Chhatrapati Shivaji Station.",
        "There's a big dance number.",
        "I won't tell you about it, but that's shot there, and there's a lot of other action and emotional scenes that are shot there, and that was where almost 50 plus people were killed by the terrorists on November 26th.",
        "We'll tell you about it, but don't leave until the credits roll.",

        "I've never traveled to India, but I've always heard the poverty is profound I've been told, and America's homeless people are wealthy by comparison.",
        "Does the movie closely and accurately depict what happens in India to orphans who are forced to live on the streets?",
        "Well, it does reflect at least one side of the story.",
        "Not all orphans are kidnapped and made, you know, and then converted and, you know, made beggars as such.",
        "So that is not every often story.",
        "There are a lot of NGOs, a lot of government agencies that are actually working to help the orphans.",
        "But the living conditions, I mean, the slums that are shown toward the beginning of the film, that is - those scenes were shot in the slums, and those are very real, you know, homes and real lives, harsh existence, and yet, you know, those people have a whole system.",
        "There's sanitation.",
        "There's - they have television.",
        "They have electricity, and that's how a large part of India lives in these big, you know, cities.",

        "And the companies aren't shy about reaching out.",
        "Yes, they do, but never in this sort of gritty way.",

        "I mean, in fact, if you watch the early 10, 15 minutes of the film, if you've been a fan of Danny Boyle, you would know his films, like \"\"Trainspotting,\"\" this is \"\"Trainspotting\"\" set in the slums of India.",

        "Secondly, the movie, I thought, was just a little bit cliched and banal, if you will.",
        "I mean, you have sort of - it sort of seemed to conform to the same recycled Bollywood script where a boy falls in love with a girl.",
        "You know, there's a story behind that, and at the end of the movie, the boy gets the girl.",
        "And I mean, it was - it did give an interesting perspective of life in India, and certainly there's - but I just thought it was sort of a variation of that, sort of a common recycled theme.",
