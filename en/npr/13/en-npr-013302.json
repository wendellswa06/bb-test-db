        "O'Leary says it's based on the value they think their innovation brings to the market, especially compared to other drugs already out there.",
        "But with so many similar products, shouldn't costs go down - nope.",
        "O'Leary says that's because insurance companies have so far been willing to cover all the options regardless of cost.",
        "O'LEARY: So lowering the price is not something that would result in greater market share.",
        "In other words, since insurers pay for the drugs no matter the price, companies like Bayer really have no incentive to lower them.",
        "Unlike what you may have learned in Economics 101, competition doesn't always lower prices.",
        "The price of any drug in the U.S.",
        "is whatever the market will bear, as seen by the manufacturer."
