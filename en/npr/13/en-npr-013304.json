        "And the third one is actually manual dexterity and physical mobility.",

        "And so jobs that depend on that will also be safe for a while.",
        "And I think the right way to think about it is not so much looking at jobs, but looking at tasks 'cause almost every job has parts of them that are in one of those three categories, or maybe all three, and other parts that will be affected or even automated.",
        "It's interesting 'cause when I think about how that translates to education, there's been such an emphasis on science and technology education.",
        "But it sounds like you're saying one of the sectors that's likely to be safest is sort of creative work that would suggest liberal arts education.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "In fact, I think there's probably no better time in history to be somebody with some real creative insights.",
        "And then the technology helps you leverage that to millions or billions of people.",

        "Would you say that blue-collar workers are generally more likely to be replaced by robots than white-collar workers?",
        "We hear so much about people in manufacturing being replaced by automation.",

        "I don't think it's so much of a blue collar-white collar division.",
        "The big waves have been more structured work versus less structured work, with more structured work being automated faster and work that involves creativity and interpersonal skills as being more robust in the long run.",
        "If people are at the midpoint in their career right now and they want to prepare themselves for the oncoming robot invasion (laughter), what can they do to make it less likely that they will ultimately someday be replaced?"
