        "The mileage of paved roads, this is just a few years ago, in Africa, outside of South Africa, was less than the mileage of paved roads in the country of Poland which is about the size of Zimbabwe.",
        "Yes, those are startling facts, and if you, you can go through many countries in Africa, where you have weak states or where you've had civil unrest and the like, and you can look at the statistics in terms of paved roads or roads that are workable and, at some level, and you can find that actually the numbers compare very negatively against the colonial era, as well, which is a very startling and disturbing fact.",
        "It's hard enough to build these structures in the first place.",
        "Also difficult to have the money to maintain them.",
        "Right.",
        "This has been one of the big dilemmas for road and port infrastructure, as well as power infrastructure in Africa, is that when there were big investments made in the ‘60s, the ‘50s and ‘60s in these sectors when it, where it was much more fashionable in terms of foreign aid to be putting money into these large projects, they proved to be non-sustainable.",
        "None of our towers were touched.",
        "None have never lost a single dollar in infrastructure throughout this year.",

        "I regret to say, I think there are examples of wells being poisoned, but nevertheless it is a risky investment, high risk, high return, quite lucrative.",

        "That's the fun part, inventing those characters and their pasts, and that's one of the most enjoyable things about writing a novel.",
        "One of the themes that seems to run through this book is a kind of betrayal felt by some of the characters toward the British prime minister at the time, David Lloyd George.",
        "He was supposed to be a hero of the working classes, but many of them turned on him in part because he led the country into the First World War.",

        "Secondly, at the end of the war, he continued in coalition with the conservatives.",
        "It looked as if he would do anything to remain prime minister, and of course, people can't respect that.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, you were a pretty strong critic of Prime Minister Tony Blair and his decision to go to war in Iraq.",
        "It's hard not to see parallels between that and David Lloyd George, the way he is portrayed in this book.",
        "Well, it certainly has my familiarity with modern British politics.",
        "And your wife was a member of Parliament.",
        "My wife was a member of Parliament for 13 years.",
        "She was a minister for three years.",
        "But more importantly, most of our friends, the people we have dinner with, the people we go to the theater with, the people we go on holiday with, have been ministers in the British government."
