        "He writes: Occasionally NPR covers a story that I have no interest in, but that's okay, so it's the eclectic nature of your broadcasts which makes it so interesting.",
        "However, today's coverage of Tiger Woods' press conference had me checking the channel of my radio thinking perhaps it was tuned into the wrong station.",
        "I believe for the vast majority of listeners to your broadcast, coverage of Woods' personal issues is the exact sort of subject matter which we are seeking refuge from when tuning in to hear ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.",
        "We also heard yesterday about ham radio enthusiasts going strong even in this new world of Facebook and instant communication.",
        "We profiled a few of the nearly 700,000 licensed ham operators in the U.S.",

        "When hurricanes, earthquakes or other natural disasters knock out electricity and phones, amateur radio is one of the most reliable means of communication.",
        "The Amateur Radio Relay League Web site even has a story about 62 hams providing emergency communication in Lincoln, Nebraska last week, when telephone service went down.",
        "Twentieth century technology isn't just a fun hobby, it's an important way to be prepared when the Internet and cell phones suddenly stop working.",

        "Bart Husky(ph) of Austin, Texas writes: You gave us the setups and skipped the conclusions.",
        "What became of Texlahoma and forgot-onia?",
        "Well, in his book, \"\"Lost States,\"\" Michael Trinklein writes: The chief problem with all the proposals to split Texas was that the residents of the new state would no longer be Texans.",
        "That is a huge stumbling block to a population fiercely proud of its heritage.",
        "For that reason, as much as any other, Texlahoma never came to be.",
