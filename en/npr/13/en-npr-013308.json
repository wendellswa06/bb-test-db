        "You can pick up a taxi, a cab, and go there.",
        "You can use Underground, you can, but not of these alternatives are available in Africa.",
        "None of these are working, so the equity of a phone call is extremely valuable.",
        "It saves so much in fuel and time and just communicate from one place or another, and this is correct for a fisherman as it's correct, a fisherman, at the end of the day, want to work, to land his catch, you know.",

        "If you were to drive around the outskirts of any major metropolitan area in Ethiopia, for instance, where you have very severe climate changes in the course of the year and you have lots of roads washed out every year and you have to go back and do major repair and you have very long distance, heavy trucking patterns, you get into a habit of simply refinishing them on a superficial basis with the full expectation you're going to be back doing this again in another nine to 12 months.",
        "Another of those sobering statistics I was reading in preparation for this program, traffic fatalities per 10,000 vehicles in the 10 most developed countries in the world is something like 2.3.",

        "Well, certainly any major infrastructure project, if it's roads or ports or power generations, where you're putting out huge contracts, has the very, very strong invitation for corruption.",
        "And so it requires very strong oversight.",
        "And the gentleman, Zellato's comment is one that's made very often.",
        "The counter to that is to say, is to point out the many different points of promise in Africa and elsewhere, where governments have come to power with a very strong determination to curb corruption and where donors have begun to put money behind those governments which are showing a record of achievement and are willing to begin to, to reengage on infrastructure because they have a higher level of confidence.",
        "This is certainly true when you look at the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the approach taken in places like Benin and trying to clean up the corruption around the port and road system, in and around that site.",
        "And, Zellato, as we heard earlier from Mohammed Ibrahim and just now from Stephen Morrison, Africa's a big place not every place is as bad as every other.",

        "What kinds of projects are they involved in, why are they involved in them?",
        "Well, the Chinese have, along with the Indians, Malaysians, South Koreans, are coming into Africa and have been now in a very accelerated pace in the last few years.",
        "They're coming in search of scarce commodities in the energy, hard rock minerals and the like.",
        "They're coming in to strike political relationships.",
        "And they're coming in to make investments and to engage in trade.",
        "And they're putting a much bigger emphasis on infrastructure, unlike what we've seen from the Western donors.",
        "And part of it is that they come in in a packaged approach.",
        "The business model that might be applied by a Western European, or North-American donor or a private investor in how they go about doing the business is quite different with respect to the Chinese."
