        "The Chinese are making a very long-term, generational investment in these countries.",
        "They believe that they will be generating jobs for their own corporations, which often come in with the laborers and with the inputs.",
        "So there's very direct, home-tied benefits to their own industries.",
        "They believe, in some cases, that they can bring strong controls over the quality of what they produce.",
        "But they've also been criticized in many places for low quality in the construction standards that they have pursued.",
        "There's also been accusations that they are less concerned, perhaps, with human rights and corruption than Western governments.",
        "Is that accurate, or is that sour grapes?",
        "Well, they've come under very strong criticism, deservedly so, with respect to the Sudan and their indulgences of Mugabe in Zimbabwe.",
        "I think, though, we have to be careful in looking at the, in making categorical statements at this point, about Chinese behavior in Africa.",
        "Because the Chinese are making very sizable investments in places like Nigeria and Angola and elsewhere and I don't believe they have an interest in seeing those investments squandered in a short period of time.",
        "That will only burn out the goodwill for them and their own interest in continuing.",
        "And as I said earlier, this is a long-term, generational investment that they're making.",

        "Hi, I am an undergrad at FSU.",
        "And I'm studying telecommunications.",
        "And speaking about the infrastructure, the telecommunications, I guess I was wondering what is the protection of the underprivileged people here?",
        "Is there a safeguard against money coming in and creating sort of a huge capitalistic machine?",
        "And, you know, these people can't, these people, the people who maybe can use the internet for help won't be getting it and they're just worried about food.",
        "What are some of the, what can these elements of the infrastructure bring to less privileged people instead of just sort of an economic capitalist machine for foreigners?",
        "Stephen Morrison?",
        "Okay, let's, let's look at two pieces of this question.",
        "On the cell phone technology and the rather remarkable and surprising spread of that technology into poor settings in Africa.",
        "It's had a very broad, democratizing and leveling impact in the sense that poor people have demonstrated their interest in picking up that technology, making it part of their lives and it's been affordable.",
        "And, in that sense, you can say it's had a liberating and empowering impact in bringing greater economic life, economic vitality and access to information and the like.",
        "It has not yet though, translated into really broad equitable access to the internet, in the same way that it has in other settings like in Asia.",
        "And that has to do with the further, the enduring limitations in terms of infrastructure on technology side within Africa as compared to many places in Asia and the like."

        "Now, on the other question on roads, let's take the Chad Cameroon Pipeline as an example.",
        "Here is an instance where oil corporations, the World Bank, NGOs come together with the government of Chad and put together a $3.7 billion pipeline to bring oil forward.",
        "And the earnings from the oil are supposed to be dedicated towards schools, education, road building and the like for broad beneficial impacts.",
        "Now this has been going on for about a year and a half, it's in a bit of crisis right now.",
        "There's been a lot of questions around the equity.",
        "Some of the most recent investigations in The New York Times and elsewhere have shown that, in fact, the big contracts on road construction that have come out of that experiment, which is a very promising experiment, have, in fact, lined the pockets of relatives of President Deby of Chad and raised the whole question that Sarah brings forward, which is, at the level of this average citizen, how much benefit actually accrues to the citizen in terms of access to well paved roads that weren't there before that could connect them to markets.",
        "So, even under the most carefully managed projects, things can go off the rails.",
        "Sarah, thanks for the question.",
        "Thank you.",

        "I wanted to ask you about some of the projects Stephen Morrison was just referring to.",
        "The difficulty of building such capital intensive projects in these regions, it's daunting.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "It is daunting from every perspective.",
        "It's daunting from the point of view of mobilizing the finances and I think it give the figure of $3.7 billion as the cost of that project.",
        "It is also daunting from the point of view of managing them, and it's daunting from the point of view, also, of building partnership.",
        "Nonetheless, the size of the challenge or the scale of the challenge should not be an excuse for inaction, and I think the power plant which you talked about and other projects under, (unintelligible) does an underlying commitment of African leaders to grapple with that challenge.",
        "The importance of these projects cannot be underestimated.",
        "Again, reading statistics, the difficulties of internal transportation within the continent of Africa has been described as adding like a 10 percent tariff to every African export.",
        "Right.",
        "Absolutely, and that is even true of the landlocked, least developed countries.",
        "As you know, quite a number of African countries are landlocked, and these landlocked countries have to transit through what you call the coastal states and that means that because you just identified, is in fact, mostly with those landlocked countries that have these greater constraints on transportation.",
        "For the coastal states, the problem is less so.",
        "But that having been said, it's also true even for the coastal state that in some cases, they find it difficult to move goods from the hinterland, right, to the coastal.",
        "The key challenge to address here is improved road transportation and where possible rails, some of the countries have rail lines, which suffer from bad maintenance policies.",
        "Therefore, it is a two-track approach that we are talking about that can revive that.",
        "One, maintain the existing rail and road links and build new ones in order to get good from the hinterland at a cheaper cost.",
        "We're talking today about infrastructure in Africa.",

        "Where else is that capital going to come from?",
        "Of course, if you have them, then maybe Africa can start its own development and generate more income of itself.",
        "Mr. Otobo?",
        "Yeah, well, you see, the question --",
        "First of all, let me reply to the last caller, because he said something which is interesting about the ownership.",
        "He is from Ghana and Ghana is an exemplary contributor in the (unintelligible) countries.",
        "It is the first country that has a completed peer review mechanism under the African Peer Review, under the APR and cultural initiative under (unintelligible).",
        "And ownership is the central organizing principle of (unintelligible).",
        "Now, it is true, historically, if you look at the economic history of all the countries, including your own country, United States, when a country is at a developing stage, there is no question that they will need foreign capital.",
        "When the United States was developing, it needed money from England.",
        "At that time, England, the United Kingdom was the financial hegemony, so there is no inherent incompatibility between ownership and looking for external resources.",
        "I think what would be a pity is to be completely and perpetually dependent on external resources, but insofar as this capital come, either in loan or whatever form, I don't see any incompatibility with ownership.",
        "Now, to go to your question.",
        "I think that, I don't know how much familiar you are with the projects under the new partnership for African development.",
        "But the projects that have been articulated under the infrastructure were intended to address some of the issues, which is the point of the talk to this radio.",
        "And in fact, I can tell you that there are now two programs.",
        "There was a short-term infrastructure program, cultural development with the help of the African Development Bank.",
        "And (unintelligible) the African Development Bank has put its own money worth the tune of several hundred million and has mobilized another $1.6 million in the form of credits and loan.",
        "So, the issue, the fact of the matter that the leaders recognize the importance of this issue and are addressing it in the (unintelligible) program.",
        "And I don't mean to cut you off, but I wanted to give Stephen Morrison a chance to address this issue before we go.",
