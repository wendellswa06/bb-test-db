        "It's the kind of place where you might leave your truck running while you duck into the store.",
        "At Landrum Hardware, owner Shawn Evans has a firm opinion when it comes to the Confederate battle flag flying at the Statehouse in Columbia about a hundred miles south of here.",
        "Yeah, it should come down, absolutely.",
        "It's got too much impact on the economy of South Carolina at this point.",
        "It's past time for it to happen.",
        "Evans grew up in Michigan, and he thinks the flag at the Statehouse is hurting South Carolina's image outside of the state, where it's widely perceived as a symbol of hate and racism.",
        "But to many of Evans's customers, the flag means something else entirely.",
        "That flag did not cause any shootings in Charleston, and I feel terrible for those people.",

        "I'm originally from south Georgia.",

        "The town of Landrum is mostly white, and the mayor, Robert Briggs, says state representative Brannon might be a little ahead of the curve.",
        "But Briggs predicts that most people in the district will follow his lead.",
        "And I wouldn't want to ever see our history just rewritten, but I also understand that if something is so controversial and can create so much division among people, that maybe it's time to retire the flag from the Statehouse."

        "And that's something that the Chinese are desperate to avoid.",
        "They really fear waves of North Korean refugees coming across their border.",
        "And so many analysts were admitting it.",

        "Whether or not he resists such calls is something that we'll have to wait and see.",
        "Well, what are the chances that not just Japan, but South Korea, other of North Korea's neighbors, will say if North Korea has the bomb, we need one?",
        "Yes, I mean, that's something that analysts have been very concerned about.",
        "At the moment, everybody is trying to react in a very calm and cautious manner, and the Japanese prime minister himself has been saying that first it's time to collate the information and act in a cool-headed manner before making any decisions.",
        "But analysts have warned that perhaps if Japan were to go nuclear, then South Korea and Taiwan would also perhaps feel the need to bolster their arsenals.",
        "And even if Japan does resist the urge to go nuclear, there could be, we could see some significant increase in defense spending and in defense budgets.",

        "The debate was also timed for election season, and we'll have more on that in a moment.",
        "We begin with NPR congressional correspondent David Welna.",
        "And David, first, what is the White House proposing now?",
        "Well, Steve, we don't know the details of what they're proposing.",
        "But what we do know is that in fact they were sending over to the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee John Warner a new alternative proposal last night.",
        "Clearly, the White House is trying to move closer to the position of the senators who've been holdouts on this.",
        "They don't seem to be budging much in their position.",
        "And the big bone of contention between them is what's called Common Arcticle 3 of the Geneva Conventions.",

        "has in Guantanamo Bay right now.",

        "can give its own take on its interpretation of what Arcticle 3 means.",
        "And the senators say this is really, in effect, trying to give the CIA an opening to go on with what the White House calls the program, which is a series of secret prisons and interrogation techniques that the president is unwilling to talk about.",
        "So the president urged the passage of this measure that would allow coerced testimony in trials of terror suspects.",
        "It would allow the introduction of secret evidence.",
        "This issue over the Geneva Conventions and other things -can the White House and Republican senators, who've been fiercest in the opposition, come to an agreement?",
        "Well, I think they can probably reach common ground over the evidences use at these trials.",
        "It's more a sticking point over this Common Arcticle 3.",
        "And we've actually kind of seen this movie before last year when Senator John McCain - who is one the senators pushing back on these military commissions proposals - insisted that they're be language that would ban the use of torture in interrogations, and this applied to both the military and the CIA.",
        "But when the president signed that bill, he left an opening for the CIA to go ahead and do what it wanted.",

        "David, we're talking about opposition in the Senate.",

        "And the House postponed its vote on the president's measure.",
        "Why'd they do that?",
        "Well, House leaders thought that they had the votes to go ahead and approve what was approved in committee last week, a proposal very similar to what the White House is proposing on military commissions.",
        "But as the days have gone by and there's been more criticism coming from Republican ranks, the House leaders decided not to go ahead with this vote tomorrow and instead have put it off at least until next week.",
        "It seems that what's been going on in the Senate in terms of resistance to the White House has spread to the House.",
        "Hm.",
        "You mean it's not just these three senators - McCain and the others.",
        "You've got House members who are normally quite loyal to the White House not so sure anymore."
