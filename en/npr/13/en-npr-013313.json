        "Republicans are pointing out, hey, your premiums are going up.",
        "So this is all getting back into the debate.",
        "This day has brought terrible news and great sadness to our country.",
        "Now actually, a friend of mines sent a letter to me from one of the insurance companies that explained why her premiums were going up, and it actually didn't blame the law.",
        "It blamed all the reasons that premiums are going up.",
        "And there was nothing in this law that was going to make premiums not go up, particularly not for the first couple of years.",
        "Everything that might hold down health care cost doesn't happen for several more years, in some cases more than a decade.",
        "One of the reasons that Republicans said that they were going to vote, in lock-step, against this is that they knew that that would mean that Democrats would own the health care system and everything bad about it for the next several years because they knew there was nothing that was going to keep premiums from going up.",
        "But insurance companies are, in fact, blaming the law for a lot more than they should in terms of the premiums going up.",
        "Last week in the House of Representatives, Republicans released their Pledge to America, which included provisions on the health care law.",
        "The American people have told us what they want is that we defund, repeal and replace.",
        "That's Congressman Bill Cassidy, Republican from Louisiana, and, well, defund, repeal and replace.",
        "Easier said than done.",
        "Nevertheless, this is a major tenet, a platform, if you will, of the Republican Party in this year's midterm elections."

        "Yes, indeed it is.",
        "As I mentioned, the Republicans were, you know, unanimously against this when it became law, and they remain unanimously against it.",
        "Repealing would be difficult.",
        "They'd need to get two-thirds, obviously, in both the House and the Senate, which seems unlikely.",
        "If President Obama vetoed it, which...",
        "Right, exactly, if President Obama vetoed it.",
        "But if they take over the House, which seems plausible, if not likely, defunding is a little bit easier because they will have the purse strings in the Appropriations Committee, and defunding it would be not so hard.",
        "And, you know, they could pull out what the Department of Health and Human Services is doing to implement this, and that would make things really quite tricky.",
        "They could perform all kinds of mischief on implementation of this law, and they intend to.",
        "One of the ideas that they came up with in that Pledge to America about health care, this is just one of them, but this is again Congressman Cassidy.",
        "Lower cost for the purchaser of insurance by allowing Americans to buy insurance across state lines.",
        "Make these big insurance companies with market concentration compete against one another for the benefit of the small businesswoman or the individual purchaser of insurance.",
        "Now, this was one of those ideas that was debated.",
        "Republicans said why don't you incorporate this as one of them?",
        "Obviously, it's not in the bill.",
        "No, it's not, and it's been actually, a piece of it is if the insurance if the state insurance commissioners would like to allow it, they could, but the insurance companies wouldn't be allowed to allow it.",
        "And this has been very controversial.",
        "It's been so controversial it's never, in fact, been brought up even to the full House for a vote, and it's been kicking around for five or six years.",
        "So this is actually much more difficult to do than it sounds."

        "They do have to apply some of them.",
        "They don't have to apply others of them.",

        "This goes back to this promise that the president made that says if you like the plan you have, you can keep it.",
        "That's the grandfathered plan.",
        "So it's a question of do you want to keep your plan knowing that you might not get some of the new benefits, but you also aren't going to get anything changed, or do you want to take the chance and switch to a new plan that might have better benefits but might also cost a little bit more."
