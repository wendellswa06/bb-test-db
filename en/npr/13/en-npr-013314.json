        "For a lot of people, it's next January 1.",
        "So a lot of people won't see these new benefits until January 1.",
        "So it's not automatic as of that date.",
        "It's just the next time your policy renews you see these new things.",

        "I guess I'm worrying about something that might happen later just because of the timing when all of this went into effect.",
        "It sounds like since she's got her son back on her husband's plan, he's good until he turns 26 years old.",

        "And then there's some there's some question about how long they get to stay on after their 26th birthday.",
        "That's still I think being determined by the Treasury Department.",
