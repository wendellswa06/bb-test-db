        "One recent undertaking by Microsoft bespeaks several of the problems that you spoke about today.",

        "People who can't get H1-B visas to work in the United States who have the right.",
        "Why can't you just put Americans doing those jobs on the U.S.",
        "side of the border instead?",
        "Well, the good news is that we are hiring people in the United States at a very rapid rate.",
        "And, you know, our success allows us to do more in research and grow employment.",
        "The thing that limits us is hiring the world's best engineers.",
        "Sixty percent of the students at the top U.S.",
        "universities are foreign born, and we compete with others to hire those people.",
        "In the past, they were allowed to stay in the United States, but now that these quotas have been hit, they have to leave the country.",
        "And so, on some cases, we take them to Vancouver where we've got a government that welcomes, not only those people for these high-paying jobs, but the four or five jobs we create around each of those engineers.",
        "Just to clarify, though, foreign-born covers many different conditions, it includes people whose families immigrated to the United States and grew up here but were born in Taiwan or Ukraine or wherever.",
        "We were talking about people who are actually here temporarily who account for a majority of the people in graduate programs?",
        "That's right.",
        "Yeah, the top computer science departments in the United States are 60 percent - people who are not citizens.",
        "Traditionally, most of them stay in the country and jobs are created around them.",
        "Now that we've hit these quotas, they have to go somewhere else.",
        "Whatever, if 65,000 of those visas are given in a year, that's it, no more."

        "We were getting attacked both from the anti-global warming crowd as well as a large number of people in the hurricane community who thought this was natural variability.",
