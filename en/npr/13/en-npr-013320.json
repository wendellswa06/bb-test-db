        "About a minute after liftoff on January 28, 1986, the space shuttle Challenger blew apart, killing all aboard, including Christa McAuliffe, the first teacher to become an astronaut.",
        "NPR's Joe Palca reports on how the tragedy affected this country and American attitudes towards science.",
        "On January 28, 1986, President Ronald Reagan was scheduled to deliver his State of the Union speech, but Challenger changed those plans.",
        "Today is a day for mourning and remembering.",
        "Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle Challenger.",
        "We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country.",
        "This is truly a national loss.",
        "President Reagan expressed in words what many people were feeling that day.",
        "It was a huge shock to the American people, because the space shuttle had come to represent our entire technological prowess.",
        "That's Senator Bill Nelson from Florida.",
        "At the time, he was congressman Bill Nelson.",
        "He was also astronaut Bill Nelson.",
        "His mission aboard the space shuttle Columbia had ended just 10 days earlier.",
        "Nelson says it was shocking enough just to think about what happened to Challenger.",
        "And when people suddenly saw on their television screens, that was played over and over, the close-up shot of those solid rocket boosters going off in different directions about 10 miles high in the Florida sky - I mean, this was a trauma to the nation's psyche.",
        "The country had to revisit that trauma 17 years later.",
        "Here's what a group that opposes you on all these.",
        "The program is (unintelligible) through, you know, through the very technology that you've helped develop all your life, they could be on the Web with their own response to your testimony this morning, and they say this about H-1 visas.",
        "They say you've used the H-1B program; I'm quoting now, \"\"to train a critical mass of foreign workers within the U.S., and then use these workers to establish overseas operations.\"\" They say, yep, our advantages eroding and the use of H-1Bs facilitates that erosion.",
        "What's wrong with that argument?",
        "The people who are here on H-1B visas overwhelmingly want to stay in the country.",
        "And so these people go on to apply for a green card and, you know, be great taxpayers, stay here and have the jobs around them stay here.",
        "It is true that universities outside the United States, like Indiana Institute of Technology, Xinhua(ph) in China - they are seeing what the U.S.",
        "has done well with its universities and they are getting better.",
        "But the good news is the U.S.",
        "universities are still the best, and our top goal is to hire the people who graduate from those schools, but because they're foreign born, they're not allowed to stay in our country."

        "You're saying that when you do get to hire a foreign worker on an H-1B visa and bring that person into the United States, that has no negative consequence for American employment.",

        "The only question we can deal with is, do we allow them to stay here and work?",
        "And traditionally, the U.S., because it's so attractive, has had this huge advantage than other countries bemoan the fact that these smart people living here now, they celebrate the fact that we're kicking them out after giving them the world's best education.",

        "In the early 1970s, before he entered politics, he taught a college course in environmental studies.",
        "He continues to espouse a conservative brand of conservation that he calls mainstream environmentalism in a new book called \"\"A Contract with the Earth,\"\" he co-wrote it with Terry Maple.",
        "Gingrich says he grew up a conservationist and there was nothing inconsistent about being green and being Republican - until later."

        "What I discovered starting in the '80s was that the leading environmental groups on the left - particularly the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters - began to equate the environment with litigation, regulation, taxation, bureaucracy.",
        "And you either were for their solution or you were against the environment.",
        "And so what happened was conservatives began to say, wait a second, if you're telling me that in order to be pro-environment, I've got to be for bigger government, more red tape.",
        "For example the super fund, which is a mess.",
        "Which about half the money we spent on super fund has been spent on red tape, bureaucrats and litigation.",
        "Now, that's not what people wanted.",
        "People wanted the money spent on engineering, on actually cleaning up, on getting back to using it.",
        "But the tension for Republicans when it came to environmentalism, you say - even though Theodore Roosevelt was their patrimony and had brought all these issues to American consciousness - the issue was regulation and litigation.",

        "And centralized control on Washington.",
        "I mean, it's very ironic - first of all, the Environmental Protection Agency was created under a Republican president.",
        "As you point out, Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican president, was the father of modern federal conservation in the national forest and dramatically expanded our conservation efforts.",
        "The great environmentalist who founded things like the Audubon Society, the New York Zoological Society, were almost all Republicans.",
        "And if you read Lou Cannon's last book on Reagan called \"\"Governor Reagan,\"\" Reagan in California was very - relatively pro-environment.",
        "And part of our point in writing \"\"A Contract with the Earth\"\" was to communicate to people that it's possible to have a science-and-technology-based, entrepreneurial, free-market approach that incentivizes the development of new systems and new approaches and new technologies that can lead you to a better environment we believe faster and with greater likelihood of achievement than you're going to get by focusing on regulation and litigation and bureaucracy and trial lawyers.",
        "If, in fact, you had had to vote in the U.S.",
        "Senate a few years ago, when Senators McCain and Lieberman had a measure opted that would have required industrial plants to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, would you have voted with them or against them?",
        "I probably would have voted against them.",
        "I would have cheerfully voted for a tax credit in favor of implementing carbon-reducing technologies.",
        "I'm very much in favor of incentives, and I think that there are ways to get this done.",
        "But I think if we simply impose restrictions in American auto companies, we have a fair chance of bankrupting Ford and GM.",
        "You acknowledged that there's global warming and that human behavior has contributed to global warming.",
        "There's not a difference between you and, say, former Vice President Gore on that basic point?",
        "Well, there are two big differences.",
        "What I acknowledge is that, as a conservative, I think that caution is a key part of conservatism.",
        "And so I don't think you have to prove the argument about carbon loading the atmosphere to reach the conclusion that it would be prudent to try to find economically useful ways to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.",
        "And I'm quite prepared up to that point to go along.",
        "I think if you look at Vice President Gore's film and other things, he suggests radically greater problems.",
        "And then, frankly, doesn't suggest solutions that are comparable to the size of the problem he's designed.",
        "There were no iconic pictures from the Columbia accident.",
        "It was just a vapor trail streaking across the sky, and some close-ups of bits of debris.",
        "But shocking as it was, the second loss of a space shuttle didn't hit the country in the gut the way the first one did.",
        "Jon Miller thinks he knows the reason for that.",
