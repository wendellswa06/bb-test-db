        "Newt Gingrich has, more articulately than any Democrat on the left, made the argument that someone who makes money while - tremendous amount of money for investors - while the company they invest in goes bankrupt, that's undermining capitalism; there's something wrong with that.",
        "And I think after the Wall Street bailouts where people felt that the people who were at fault came out fine and the taxpayers were left on the hook shows you that that strikes a chord even in the pro-business, pro-corporate, pro-Wall Street Republican Party.",
        "And I think that's going to continue.",
        "Is this an issue that's going to continue to be up for debate in the contests in South Carolina and Florida?",
        "Well, I think so because the Super PAC supporting Gingrich has spent more than $3 million to buy airtime, to air ads about this issue.",
        "And I talked to a senior Romney adviser today, he said it's just as well this issue came up now.",
        "We've got two weeks to beat it back.",
        "And, yes, I think this is going to continue because Gingrich thinks this is the way to go after Romney.",
        "It's best to go after someone in their main argument.",
        "This is what Romney says is the reason he should be president - his business experience.",
        "And, as Gingrich said today, he said the first thing you have to do was stop Romney.",

        "Mara, looking at this issue, something like this coming to the forefront in New Hampshire, what does it say to you about what the New Hampshire primary means to the modern Republican Party?",

        "That's 15 percent better than Kyoto, by that one policy change.",
        "Now, I think you could pass a law that would enable the development of safe, modern nuclear reactors with the same speed of construction as Japan has, which is about five years, and you could make it very desirable for the entire next wave of electricity production to come in forms that had no carbon loading at all.",

        "I think they are currently so totally focused on raising money and so totally focused on audition programs where 10 or 11 people stand around and get 30-second sound bites.",
        "That it's very hard to imagine how you have a genuine dialogue and no serious person thinks those are debates.",

        "Basically - yeah.",
        "And we turn power over to the media because they're the ones who get to decide what the questions are.",

        "In some ways, the decision that you have made and the reasons you are giving are in some ways parallel to what Al Gore has discovered, being an advocate of his view of what to do about global warming.",
