        "The September agreement, or joint statement among the six parties, included non-nuclear energy assistance.",
        "The South Koreans were willing to give them everything they needed within two or three years to power their generators and so forth.",
        "Economic assistance, which would require a lot of opening by North Korea.",
        "It may have been something they didn't want to do and some reason they walked away from this, but sending in international financial institutions, technical assistance with dismantling their programs and a dialogue with the U.S.",
        "and Japan.",
        "We - the U.S., Japanese - don't have normal diplomatic relations with North Korea, so a dialogue is what would be necessary to lift sanctions and have normal relations, but it required North Korea to begin taking very concrete steps to dismantle a nuclear weapons' program they clearly want to keep, even if they're going to take some heat for it.",
        "What about food assistance - something really basic like that?",
        "I think that's an excellent question because one of the things that is assumed is that these sanctions would starve the people of North Korea.",
        "There's nothing in the U.N.",
        "resolution that would do that and the Chinese trade is largely commodities and things that cross the border easily.",
        "And in fact, the United States, throughout all of this, has offered to give North Korea considerable food aid in spite of the nuclear issue as long as the regime would let monitors and people go in and make sure it got to the people, and North Korea is an extremely paranoid and closed regime and they said no, we'd rather not take the food if it means people would come in to make sure that it gets to the right places.",
        "To the people and not to the army.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Because much of the food that comes in from China, or even from South Korea, goes to the army.",
        "It's sold, it goes on the black market.",
        "We demanded certain standards and the North Koreans weren't willing to take them, but food aid is not part of this sanctions regime.",

        "Thank you.",
        "And I wonder, as you're looking with your experience at sanctions in Iraq and other places, as you look at the regime that they're talking about to North Korea, do you think this is going to be effective?",
        "Do you think it's going to work?",
        "Sanctions are almost never a substitute for a policy.",
        "They are a component of a policy.",
        "I think that's what we can hope for in the case of North Korea, but history teaches us to view them as a modest instrument.",
        "If you ask them to accomplish enormous things, for example, in and of themselves to persuade North Korea to get rid of its nuclear program, you would simply be asking too much of them and you will be disappointed.",
        "However, if you folded them into a larger policy, say one with a credible threat of force, and also an attractive diplomatic package then yes, I think sanctions can play a useful role here.",
        "Over time.",
        "Over time.",
        "That's the other think sanctions - the history of sanctions tells you - is don't expect instant results.",
        "The only problem, though, with time, is that sometimes one sees a little bit of sanctions fatigue.",
        "The world often begins to fall off because sanctions essentially not only caused the intended victim to pay a price, but they also asked others to forgo some economic benefit.",
        "And also, you need to be sure your sanctions are targeted, that you don't hurt the wrong people inside the country.",
        "Say, in the case of North Korea, the last thing in the world we want to do is make a population that already has insufficient caloric intake - that's often starving - we don't want them to pay any more of a price.",
        "We need to make sure we hit the people in the regime who are responsible for the nuclear program, not for the man on the street.",
        "We're talking with Richard Haass, who you just heard, and also with Michael Green about sanctions imposed on North Korea.",

        "The North Koreans have already demonstrated they have nuclear weapons' capabilities.",
        "You can't just undo that fact.",

        "Richard Haass?",
        "Well again, you can't use sanctions to directly influence their nuclear capabilities.",
        "What you can do is use sanctions to affect the calculations of decision makers, to make them realize what sort of a price they pay for their nuclear policy.",
        "But as I said, at the end of the day, sanctions are not going to persuade North Korea to give up their nukes, no matter how the sanctions are designed.",
        "And that's where other elements of our foreign policy or national security come in, and I would think that the United States has to offer this sort of package deal that Michael Green was talking about; some element or incentives - economic, diplomatic, what have you - security guarantees - as well as again, a credible threat of force.",
        "But I also think this is a powerful reminder of the world we're living in, of the post-Cold War world.",
        "We desperately need Chinese and South Korean support if this is going to work.",
        "And at the end of the day, even that might not work.",
        "We have to face the fact that we're living in a world now, where power is becoming redistributed in ways that are not always good for the United States.",

        "Iran is moving down that path, though fortunately isn't nearly so far along.",

        "And I wonder, the case everybody brings up, as you hear - sanctions seem to have worked - Libya.",
        "Well, I think Libya is a good example where sanctions work, but it's also an example that they don't work quickly.",
        "It takes a long time for sanctions to have an effect.",
        "In the case of Libya you had sanctions adopted after Pan Am 103, and you basically go through the rest of the first Bush administration, all of the Clinton administration, and it takes until this Bush administration before you actually see it work.",
        "You know, we travel with upwards about 80 people, maybe a hundred people.",
        "I say that whole period, because it's clear that we had Khadafi's attention relatively early on.",
        "We had President Mubarak trying to intervene on his behalf to get the sanctions lifted in the first Bush administration.",
        "And throughout the Clinton administration, we had several efforts on the part of Khadafi to work through others - a few times through the Palestinians, I know, because I was directly the recipient of it - again, to get out from under sanctions -always offering something but never prepared to meet all of the conditions.",
        "So, his mind was clearly concentrated by the costs that he saw himself paying.",
        "He wanted to see whether there was a way to avoid paying all the price as we defined it, if he was going to get out from under.",
        "And eventually he realized he couldn't and he made the decision.",
        "Mm hmm."

        "One other point I just might add, based on the previous conversation - Richard raised it at the end with regard to Iran.",
        "When you're taking certain steps towards North Korea, you focus not only on North Korea - there are other audiences out there.",
        "The Iranians are watching what happens with North Korea.",
        "And if it becomes clear to the Iranians, where there isn't, in fact, I would say a homogeneous view within the leadership, that there isn't a price to be paid - then the balance of forces within Iran about whether you proceed or you don't proceed shift in one direction.",
        "If the price is seen as being quite high, that can affect also, the choices that the Iranians make.",
        "So sometimes you evaluate the efficacy of sanctions, not only in terms of the specific actor that you're dealing with, but others who are going to be watching.",
        "Well, you were also involved in the decision-making process about using sanctions against Iraq back in the 1990s after the first Gulf War - sanctions that I guess everybody came to conclude at the end of the day - didn't work and achieved, perhaps, more harm than good.",
        "It's interesting that that's the case, although I find the Iraqi case also one that is interesting for some other reasons.",
        "If you go back to the period when we imposed them, everybody in the Arab world that we talked to at the time, were saying this will work: The Egyptians in particular, the Saudis in particular.",
        "I recall being with Secretary Baker on our first trip out there and listening to President Mubarak and his most senior advisors telling us that sanctions would work.",
        "So their own estimate of Saddam Hussein at that time, was that sanctions would work.",
        "It turned out that they didn't.",
        "Although it is interesting, that after the war, what was done in terms of the regime, certainly had an effect on whether they developed the weapons of mass destruction or they didn't.",

        "I wonder, as this Bush administration came into office, what was the view of the Iraqi sanctions regime at that point?",
        "Well, I was the Asia senior director but I…",
        "Part of Asia.",
        "Probably, the British defined it that way.",
        "I think the view by then, not only in the administration but in the Congress, was that the sanctions regime was becoming wobbly at best - vis a vis Iraq - that there is sanctions fatigue and that it was diminishing as an effective tool.",
        "Which is a bit of a danger in the North Korea case.",
        "One of the things Secretary Rice will have to do is motivate the team and keep them on target.",
        "Because over time, the North Koreans are probably calculating that they'll also be able to whittle away at any sanctions regime - that China and South Korea, in particular, will grow tired of it - and that they'll be able to get on with business as usual.",
        "So it is a useful lesson.",

        "Yeah, let me give you a slightly different take on all that, because I think the sanctions, vis a vis Iraq, are usually far more complex than has been suggested.",
        "It's true they didn't work initially.",
        "Sanctions alone could not shoehorn Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, and ultimately we needed Operation Desert Storm to do that.",
        "But afterwards, over the course of the 1990s and in the early part of this century, sanctions worked extraordinarily well.",
        "Indeed, we now know they worked far better than anybody realized at the time.",
        "Saddam Hussein, at the end of the day, could not have his weapons of mass destruction.",
        "At the end of the day, the sanctions helped create an environment where the inspections took place.",
        "Sanctions admittedly were part of a larger foreign policy than included the threat, or at times, the use of force.",
        "So what this tells me is sanctions can be a useful instrument of policy, particularly when they are multilateral, particularly when they are backed up by uses of force.",
        "And the argument that sanctions somehow hurt the Iraq people and are responsible for the deaths of children and the like, simply isn't true.",
        "That was Saddam Hussein.",
        "Sanctions got a bad rap, but the actual sanctions themselves actually constitute, I think, one of the signal successes of them as a foreign-policy instrument.",
        "But as in the execution, as you said, Saddam had a lot of control over how the oil for food program was manipulated.",
        "He manipulated it to his advantage.",
        "There was a considerable amount of corruption involved in it, and as you suggest, it may have been his fault.",
        "But hundreds of thousands, by the U.N.",
        "count - hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children died.",
        "Well again, you can't blame the sanctions for that, though.",
        "It's Saddam Hussein's cynical misuse of resources.",
        "and even more to the point, 85 percent of the money Saddam Hussein used was not because of the sanctions.",
        "That was when the United States and other countries looked the other way, when Iraq was able to sell oil to countries like Turkey and Jordan and Syria.",
        "The sanctions themselves, again, were far better than many people give them credit for.",
        "Dennis Ross?",
        "So I can imagine in such situations the United States would need to think about using military force, indeed would maybe need to use military force.",
        "So I think we need to maintain a credible military option.",
        "And it's important that the North Koreans not be able to dismiss it, because if they can, then obviously we're then left with only sanctions and diplomacy, and I'm not sure that the two of them combined will be able to exert enough pressure on North Korea to get them where they want.",
        "What Richard says is right.",
        "What is interesting, though, as it relates to Turkey and Jordan - we had to make a judgment.",
        "That the price of Turkey and Jordan was paying was so high because of sanctions, that we did look the other way and Saddam Hussein was able to take advantage of that: point one.",
        "Point two: in the oil for food - even though he was cynically manipulating it for his own purpose to create a sense that the public was, in fact, paying a terrible price.",
        "Throughout the Arab world, we were having to deal with what was a perception that you're hurting only the Iraqi public, you're not hurting Saddam Hussein.",
