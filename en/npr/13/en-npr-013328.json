        "I'm thinking about the South African situation where we know that what finally made the difference, was kind of sanctions, but much more the fact that the big players in the economic picture - (unintelligible) to think whatever else - said to the South African government, you know what, this will not do.",
        "Let's change things.",
        "And so I'm kind of wondering whether a similar approach might not work in North Korea?",
        "Michael Green, what do you think?",
        "It's an excellent point.",
        "One of the important differences, of course, is that at the end of the day the South African elite wanted to join the international economy, wanted to join international society.",
        "Whereas the North Korean elite probably fears nothing more - to expose their people to the outside forces that would result - could bring down the whole regime.",
        "It's a tougher nut to crack.",
        "I do think that the Chinese stance at the U.N., which was quite tough, vis à vis North Korea, was important though and as a signal to the North Korean regime that China is no longer going to give them carte blanche.",
        "Almost 80 or 90 percent of North Korea's oil and food comes from China.",
        "China has the physical ability - they're not going to do it - but they have the physical ability to pull the plug on this regime.",
        "They won't do it, but they've demonstrated now, that they're no longer going to protect the regime, they're no longer going to run interference for them.",
        "They're willing to impose some pain on them.",
        "And that's never happened before in this way and I think we can't calculate exactly what affect that will have.",
        "But it does send a very powerful signal to the elite that will be part of this mix of tools we need to convince them, over time, to give up these nuclear weapons.",
        "And, Gordon, as you know, many analysts believe that the situation in South Africa resolved - well, sanctions played their part - but it was really the internal situation in South Africa that…",
        "Right.",
        "And there was volition involved in that, which (unintelligible) maybe not…",
        "In North Korea's case, yes."

        "Dennis Ross, let me ask you also about the case about the former Yugoslavia.",
        "Did sanctions on the former Yugoslavia - we just had today, by the way, the prosecutor in the war crimes trials saying that Belgrade is making absolutely no effort to capture Ratko Mladic, who's wanted for war crimes - and this in the face of sanctions.",
        "But going back, sanctions did play a part.",
        "Well, it certainly played a part.",
        "Again, I think you have to keep this in perspective - and I think both Michael and Richard have made reference to this.",
        "You're dealing with regimes that will have what they consider to be core values, which is more important to them than anything else.",
        "And when that's the case, basically, they're prepared to pay any price.",
        "On the other hand, if you have regimes at the same time that want to be part of the international community and see that isolation from it is something that ultimately is a price they don't want to pay, then sanctions can be an important part of your overall approach.",
        "Yes, you have to have a, what I would call also, the carrots available - the diplomatic possibility's available at the same time.",
        "And there should be as well the readiness to keep the military option on the table or even to employ it.",
        "In the case of Milosevic, there's no question that there came a point where one of the things he wanted to do was to basically escape the sanctioned regime.",
        "Both on the road to Dayton and then certainly at Dayton, he didn't want Dayton to fail.",
        "And one of the reasons he didn't want him to fail was because he wanted the sanctions to end.",
        "He wanted greater international acceptability.",
        "So in that particular case, sanctions had taken a toll.",
        "There were other factors that influenced the process along the way, but you reached a point where getting sanctions relief because something critically important to him.",
        "And when that's the case, part of state craft is sort of recognizing - being able to make the judgment of when what you're doing, including the sanctioned regime - is creating enough of an opening to be able to come in with what may be a set of a diplomatic possibilities.",
        "We're discussing the question, do sanctions ever work?",
        "And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News."

        "Okay.",
        "I was just going to comment I know sanctions can work in some cases.",

        "There's an old saying where it says, keep your friends close but keep your enemies even closer.",
        "I think that could work until maybe this guy finally dies off and through, you know, closer relations, maybe eventually people could get more of their freedom, like hopefully is going to happen in China - with, you know, more and more capitalism, changing the makeup for the Chinese government, hopefully.",
        "Well, let's ask Richard Haass about that.",
        "Do sometimes sanctions harden a regime?",
        "And certainly in internal propaganda, it's easy to parlay the world is against us.",
        "I think you've got it exactly right and I think the caller makes a good point.",
        "It's one of the perverse or unintended consequences of broad sanctions, is it allows a leader to wrap himself in a nationalist flag.",
        "It also allows the government, at times, to control the economy more than would normally be the case.",
        "What goes in and out of the country.",
        "I think that's, for example, been the effect in Cuba over the decades.",
        "It's actually, in some ways, the sanctions and the policy of isolation has played into Castro's hands.",
        "So there is an argument that the best way to help loosen the hold of these governments is to do just the opposite.",
        "It's to kill them with Coca-Cola and tourism, and basically embrace, rather than to try to isolate them."

        "And in a funny sort of way in the global world we move in, we have far more tools to do that.",
        "So I really think what this last caller does, is raise in some ways, the most fundamental question mark about broad sanctions.",
        "I think there's still a case for targeted sanctions for some of the things we see, for example, in the North Korea resolution to try to stop specific technologies that'll hurt certain individuals.",
        "The day of broad sanctions has pretty much run its course.",
        "Michael Green, let me ask your opinion on this.",
        "I mean it's been commented on that, you know, the best way to change the situation in North Korea is have a tour of a South Korean supermarket.",
        "This was the gamble that the South Korean government and the Chinese government were making.",
        "It was their hope that by engaging in various kinds of economic projects and trade, they would convince the North Koreans that there was a better live to be had, that Kim Jong Il wouldn't need nuclear weapons, and eventually they'd wean him from those nuclear weapons.",
        "This nuclear weapons test by North Korea has crippled, if not completely shattered, that hope on the part of the Chinese and the South Koreans.",
        "It's part of the reason why the Chinese and the South Koreans are being quite tough now.",
        "I think North Korea has some unique elements that make it vulnerable.",
        "Kim Jong Il is not as legitimate as his father Kim Il Sung was.",
        "There are clear signs that the elite is dissatisfied with him.",
        "He's bought off their allegiance in part with this nuclear program, but also by, you know, buying them luxury goods, paying them cash.",
        "This directly targets that cash flow, and in a very effective way because it's going to make it… It may be hard to stop things along the Chinese border.",
        "But it's not going to be so hard to freeze assets.",
        "By the way, I think that's a lesson the Iranians will take away.",
        "They're very vulnerable when it comes to financial transactions.",
        "They need an active financial ability to sell and buy oil and do their deals.",
        "So…",
        "And unlike the North Korean elite they actually do travel in the world.",
        "And the Iranians have something to sell that the world wants, which is oil.",
        "The North Koreans sell some commodities, some mushrooms.",
        "They sell a lot of illegal drugs and counterfeit money - and these sanctions will make it easier for the international community to go after those.",
        "So there are unique aspects of how North Korea gets its cash and what Kim Jong Il uses it for, that make them perhaps a bit more vulnerable than other cases we've seen.",
        "Steve, thanks for the call.",

        "Right now we're continuing our conversation on do sanctions ever work?",
        "As you know, over the weekend, the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to impose sanctions on North Korea.",
        "Our guests are Michael Green, former special assistant to President Bush for national security affairs; Richard Haass, who is a former director of policy planning for the State Department as principal advisor to Secretary of State Colin Powell; and Dennis Ross, special Middle East coordinator under President Clinton.",
        "And, Richard Haass, one of the elements that you were talking about earlier that makes for a useful policy of which sanctions can be a part, was a credible military option.",
        "Is there a credible military option in Korea, where the North Korean army has artillery tubes focused on the city of Seoul and basically holds that city hostage?",
        "I would say only an extremist.",
        "No one in his right mind would try to trigger that kind of a war lightly.",
        "But it is possible to imagine scenarios where the alternative would be worse.",
        "For example, if we had hard evidence that North Korea was about to, say, transfer nuclear materials or a nuclear weapon to al-Qaida or actually had done so - or that the North Koreans were preparing to use nuclear weapons against South Korea where there are still thousands of U.S.",
        "forces, as well.",
        "We took a lot of candidates in the past who've had a lot of political experience, he says, and nothing happened.",

        "We never saw any results.",
        "Now, we are trying something different.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Michael Green, let me ask you a further question.",
        "One of the elements we talked about was time.",
        "North Korea has not detonated a nuclear weapon.",
        "Depending on who you talk to it may not have been all they wanted it to be, but nevertheless it's now confirmed it was a nuclear weapon.",
        "It is a matter of time before they get the technology to make warheads small enough and light enough to put on a missile and have a usable nuclear weapon.",
        "Sanctions take time, as you said before.",
        "Well, that's true.",
        "And it's part of what makes it such a difficult problem.",
        "In order to perfect the miniaturization of the nuclear weapons and mounting them on missiles, they'll have to test more missiles.",
        "They tested some in July and their long-range missile failed.",
        "They'll have to test more nuclear weapons.",
        "It looks like this nuclear test may have been a failure.",
        "If they test, there will be more sanctions.",
        "So, in effect, the noose will tighten more.",
        "The other thing is that North Korea - I mean it's quite striking that this test may have been a failure.",
        "And it's not surprising, as Richard said earlier, Saddam Hussein in fact had a very hard time sustaining WMD programs, because sanctions did limit his ability to get high-tech equipment.",
        "The North Koreans will need dual-use materials, high-tech aluminum alloys, chemical precursors.",
        "And they'll need cash to do that.",
        "They'll need international banking.",
        "They'll need access to advanced industrial economies.",
        "That will be very tough for them, and it will get tougher if they keep going.",
        "So there are some constraints that will slow them down."
