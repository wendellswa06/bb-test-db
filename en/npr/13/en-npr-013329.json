        "But the challenge here is that they do have plutonium, they do have this program, they do have the resources, to some extent to continue it forward.",

        "The head of the IAEA, Mohamed El Baradei, said he was afraid that something like 30 nations could be on the cusp of becoming nuclear powers, not just the nine we have a the moment, declared and undeclared.",
        "As you look ahead at this, the proliferation regime seems to be eroding - the anti-proliferation seems to be unraveling.",
        "As nations come on, people are going to be anxious in Japan, in South Korea, in Taiwan, elsewhere in the Middle East should Iran develop nuclear weapons.",
        "Is the genie out of the bottle?",
        "Well, I'm not sure the genie is out of the bottle, but I think one of the critical things is to make sure that now you implement this resolution in a way that makes it very difficult for North Korea to proceed.",
        "And if you really want success, you really have to get them to turn around.",
        "If you could succeed in turning the Korean Peninsula into a de-nuclearized Korean Peninsula, then that I think would have a tremendously positive effect on strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime.",
        "But if we end up with this being a situation where they don't back off, and if the Iranians draw the wrong conclusion - if the Iranians say, you know what?",
        "There really wasn't any serious price that they paid until they tested, so all we have to do is let's go up to that point.",
        "We just won't test.",
        "But we'll keep going this way, and if they don't pay a price, we'll proceed in this fashion.",
        "Now if that happens, then you may well the overall regime erode.",
        "And as you've said quite rightly - you know, this is a regime that basically, many people at the time it was adopted back in 1968, thought wouldn't survive.",
        "And yet we're talking about nine countries that have it now.",
        "We're not talking about 30.",
        "So when Dr. El Baradei talks about 30 who could be on the cusp, that should be a kind of wake-up call to say all right, look.",
        "We have to be looking for ways to strengthen the regime, not see it weaken.",
        "How we proceed with North Korea, what we do vis-à-vis Iran, what we do to try to strengthen what's known as the additional protocol, what we do to try to ensure maybe there's an international bank for the supply of enriched uranium fuel - all these things could be factors in terms of trying to make this a stronger regime, not to see it weaken.",
