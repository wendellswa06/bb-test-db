        "Fort Lawton was an Army base in Seattle, Washington, and in 1944, 28 black soldiers were sent to prison after a riot there led to the death of an Italian prisoner of war.",
        "This year, the Army's Board for Correction of Military Records reviewed that case and found that the court marshal was flawed.",
        "That ruling has already led to the reversal of the conviction and dishonorable discharge of Private Booker Townsell.",

        "We also know there was an issue of who really started it and who wound up paying for it and the fact that there was some prosecutorial misconduct thrown in there as well.",
        "Briefly, tell us what happened.",
        "What we have here is a political show trial.",
        "The War Department had two major strategic objectives in this case.",
        "First of all, to ensure that the axis - European Axis powers understood that the United States would not tolerate mistreatment of European prisoners of war, and secondly, to ensure that African-Americans understood that the War Department is not going to change its policies simply because African-Americans protest against their political conditions.",
        "In that context, this case arose.",
        "There was a dispute between some African-Americans and some Italian soldiers.",
        "It led to a riot or a rebellion, and the African-Americans were then put on trial.",
        "Within nine days, 43 African-Americans were given two defense lawyers, and then, shortly thereafter, were convicted.",
        "What was the alleged prosecutorial misconduct involving Leon Jaworksi who went on to Watergate fame?"

        "Joe Dear, CalPERS chief investment officer, says CalPERS took a serious risk by investing in the deal.",
        "Hindsight tells us clearly that that was gravely in error, and frankly the people that were responsible for that decision aren't at CalPERS anymore.",
        "All told, CalPERS' real estate portfolio lost half its value during the market crash.",
        "With $200 billion in assets, CalPERS can absorb the loss.",
        "Still, the transaction illustrates how pension fund investing has changed.",
        "Once, pension funds tended to invest in safe assets like Treasury bills.",
        "In the 1980s, many shifted their money into stocks, which promised higher returns over time.",
        "But when the dot-com bubble burst, many funds took a big hit, says Keith Brainard of the National Association of State Retirement Administrators.",
        "And so a lot of these funds came out of the 2002 market decline believing that they needed to further diversify their holdings.",
        "Today, some funds have less than a fifth of their money in safe investments like Treasury bills.",
        "The rest goes into international stocks, private equity, even hedge funds.",
        "In some ways, diversification is a smart strategy: Invest in a wide range of assets, and you're less vulnerable if one of them loses value.",
        "CalPERS' Joe Dear says diversification makes sense for another reason.",
        "One of the principal advantage of a pension fund, particularly a public pension fund, is a very long investment horizon.",
        "It's completely different from what individuals face on their own individual retirement planning.",
        "In other words, pension funds go on indefinitely, collecting money and paying out benefits only gradually, and that means they have some leeway to take chances.",
        "They can put money in assets like real estate and private equity.",
        "These assets are risky because they can't be sold off quickly, but they can be very profitable over time.",
        "But as Stuyvesant Town shows, pension funds can still get burned, and Dear says funds have to assess how much risk they want to take on very carefully.",
        "The danger is that some funds will go too far."
