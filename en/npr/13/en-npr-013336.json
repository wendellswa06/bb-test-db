        "What's most interesting about the book is the work Sands has done interviewing the participants.",
        "He's interviewed almost all the key players, from the low level lawyers with no international law experience who were initially ordered to draft the rules, to the Naval Investigative Service Psychological Interrogation team and the F.B.I.",
        "team who heatedly objected to the rules.",
        "He talked to the Pentagon brass including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and the Pentagon's top policy people including Under-Secretary of Defense for policy, Douglas Fife, and the Pentagon's top civilian lawyer, Jim Haynes.",
        "And he knows, as do some of the administration officials he interviews, that the people most experienced in international law, the top military, and state department lawyers were deliberately cut out of the process, presumably so they would not object to the new tactics, and prevent them from being put in place.",
        "He's most incendiary conclusion mirrors that of some other analysts, namely that the 15 techniques approved by Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, when used in combination, constitute a war crime.",
        "These techniques include everything from extreme heat and cold, stress positions, dogs, and round the clock interrogation allowing only four hours for interrupted sleep.",
        "Interrogation that lasted as long as 54 days in one case.",
        "And while Bush administration officials have said that these rules came from the bottom up, Sands contends that's not true.",
        "That the rules were developed in his words, at the very top, starting with Vice President Cheney's counsel, David Addington, President Bush's then White House counsel, Alberto Gonzales, and then Defense Secretary Rumsfeld's counsel, Jim Haynes.",
        "Sands describes a 2002 visit to Guantanamo by these three men.",
        "The message the three left for subordinates at Gitmo, according to Sands, was do whatever you have to.",
        "And he disputes that the tactics that he characterizes as torture ever resulted in good information.",
        "One of these tactics was in fact torture and thus a violation of international law, is a subject likely to be debated for decades to come.",
        "The conduct authorized by the top lawyers in the Bush administration may well be as much as a lightning rod for this generation as were the Hess and Rosenberg spy cases from the 1950s that still generate heated dispute today.",
        "Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington.",
        "Alex, we're going back to Jena, Louisiana now.",
        "Today, there's a hearing in the case of Mychal Bell, one of the six black students who beat up a fellow classmate.",
        "Mychal Bell, who is 17 years old, was convicted for that beating.",
        "His conviction was thrown out, but he's still in jail pending an appeal.",
        "Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched in Jena yesterday, demanding that Bell be released.",
        "Meanwhile, Justin Barker, the white student who was beaten by Bell and the others, is at home avoiding the spotlight.",
        "We reached his father this morning just before he headed out to the courthouse to attend Mychal Bell's hearing.",
        "And I asked David Barker about what exactly happened to his son Justin last December at Jena High School.",
        "Tell us the nature of the injuries that he sustained.",
        "In press accounts we have heard that he was knocked unconscious, and that he was badly bruised, but that two hours later, he was back at school.",
        "Well, no, he wasn't.",
        "He was knocked unconscious and repeatedly kicked by at least six or seven of these students.",
        "He had several bruises and his eye had swollen shut, and bleeding from both ears.",
        "And he was released and we went home until about, I guess it was 6:00 o'clock and he had a ring ceremony to go to; it was his junior year.",
        "This was a school ceremony?",
        "Yes, ma'am.",
        "One of the kids that was involved in this was at this ring ceremony.",
        "And not long after he got his ring on stage, we had to take him back home.",
        "You know, he was still bleeding out his ear, and was, you know, really in a lot of pain.",
        "And so we took him back home.",
        "And no, he did not go back to school.",
        "I don't know where that come from."

        "Well, I really don't know.",
        "You know, all you hear is these three nooses that were hanging in the tree about three months prior to this had triggered this.",

        "It may have had a little effect on it, but these kids were involved way before this noose incident.",

        "And when they went out, they run around to the other couple of doors where some of these kids were coming out.",
        "And when my son come out, he told his girlfriend to turn left so they wouldn't have to go through them.",
        "And when he turned left, one of them hit him from the back and knocked him unconscious.",
