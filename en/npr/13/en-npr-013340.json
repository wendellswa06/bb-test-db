        "Solier grew up in a family of Quechua farmers in Peru's highlands.",
        "Whether speaking or singing, she often calls on Quechua, in addition to Spanish.",

        "She says that had a lot to do with growing up in a place that was affected by violent repression during the 1980s.",
        "(Through translator) You always had to be quiet when I was growing up.",
        "If you made noise, the Shining Path guerrillas would come, take you away and kill you.",

        "The world knows this.",
        "The administration's tough language on Iran came as President Bush was trying to convince the United Nations Security Council to expand its sanctions against Iran if the Islamic republic didn't end its nuclear enrichment program, a program, Tehran says, is aimed only at producing fuel for peaceful nuclear reactors.",
        "Yesterday, President Bush was asked whether his intelligence advisers had ever suggested that he scale back his rhetoric against Iran in light of the possible new information.",
