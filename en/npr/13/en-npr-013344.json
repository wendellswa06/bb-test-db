        "But in my story, Tru hasn't heard from her mother in a good 10 years.",
        "You know, she's basically abandoned.",
        "And it was important for me to tell her side of the story, coming into herself as a gender non-conforming queer person back home.",
        "You know, and I said that very carefully as well because Tru - in the book, if you notice, Tru doesn't really have the language for that.",
        "She just knows that she's not inside that box that people want to put her in.",
        "And like her mother, in a world that is quick to define who they are, they're trying to define themselves first.",
        "One of the things that's interesting about the way that Tru is experiencing her gender in Jamaica is that it is acknowledged.",
        "It's not OK, but it's not totally ignored either.",
        "Yes.",
        "And I wondered what your experience was as a gay woman growing up in Jamaica.",
