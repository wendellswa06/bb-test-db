        "What do you think?",
        "First, true, and if so, why?",
        "Well, it is true, because as David Duval said several years ago, if you've got four majors, one of them has to be ranked number four.",
        "And I think the reason for that with the PGA is that it doesn't have anything about it that's unique.",
