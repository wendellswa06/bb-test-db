        "Well, you know, the way I see that is that, for one thing, there are definitely interests who are interested in keeping the prisons full.",
        "Now, I don't think that these are people who are devoted to keeping colored people in prison, but it is better for them if the prisons are full.",
        "Such as the unions of guards, such as people -Congress people in the districts who know that these sorts of populations technically increase the populations of their districts.",
        "Those things are unpardonable.",
        "And as far as I can see it, the fact that we have this situation, and the fact that a lot of this prison population swelling is due to the Rockefeller laws, and people committing offenses with possession of and use of drugs - it seems to me that we need to really think about getting rid of this rather peculiar policy, as it will be seen in history, of having these kinds of criminal prosecutions for drugs.",
        "And drugs should be - drugs that hurt people very much, I think, to a large extent, legalized, because whatever harm that would come in the fact that it would be easier for a lot of people to use these kinds of drugs if they were cheaper, and if you couldn't make a living by selling them on the street, then I think that there would be a lot less of this sort of thing, such as these swelling prison populations.",
        "And it would be easier to do that than to stop inconsiderate people from being interested in having full prisons.",
        "Mary Frances Berry, it seems to be - it seems to me, when we tick off these numbers, sometimes we become immune, numb to them almost.",
        "But when you think about the highest rated states of prison incarceration, Louisiana and Georgia having more than one percent of their population in prison or jail, that really is an astonishing number.",
        "It has an impact on politics.",
        "It has an impact on the communities from which they come.",
        "All those people who have benefited from it, economically, that John talks about, they're happy that - if people don't pay attention and become sort of numb when they hear the numbers again.",
        "But when you think about the families of the people who are in prison and the communities from which they come, which are already, in many cases, poor communities, you think - you can think of the heinousness of this policy of doing nothing about the drug situation.",
        "And I happen to think that people who are on drugs, who are addicted to them, there ought to be some kind of legalization, some kind of change in policy toward them.",
        "It's another thing if they're, you know, selling drugs in large quantities and getting other people addicted.",
        "But it's the impact on families.",
        "And we have to - we keep hearing the numbers over and over again, we talk about the prison industrial complex, and then we don't do anything.",
        "The Sentencing Commission recommended a change in the sentencing guidelines.",
        "That never happened.",
        "There're judges who complained because they've lost their discretion.",
        "And we can talk about how much it costs to keep people in prison.",
        "We've all made these speeches.",
        "But it seems - nothing seems to happen.",
        "This also is a red state, blue state issue.",
        "If you look at those top five states, as you mentioned, Ed, Louisiana, Georgia, Texas, Mississippi and Oklahoma; the lowest rates, Maine, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire.",
        "What you have is, in those higher states, you have this attitude of law and order, who can be the toughest.",
        "I mean, I recall a number of years ago, when the governor of Texas was running against the challenger, and they had these television commercials and they had these huge posters of folks they put to death.",
        "And it was like this badge of honor how many people I've killed when I was governor.",

        "Yeah, because you're not rehabilitating.",
        "You are not educating.",
        "Because, when they are in prison, people then say, well, I don't want to have to pay for a prisoner to go to school and to get a degree.",
        "Well, you have to make up your mind.",
        "Either you're going to accept the crime when they come out -and then, when people also come out, you also don't want to hire ex-felons.",

        "And so there's a stigma attached to it, and I'm not saying that I'm going to be soft to anybody who commits a crime.",

        "But we have to make some very critical decisions if we're not going to train them and we're not going to hire them.",
