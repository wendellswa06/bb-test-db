        "Sarah Tishkoff from the University of Pennsylvania was in charge of the project.",
        "I think the most remarkable finding is the extensive amount of genetic diversity not only within but among African populations.",
        "And one of the key points of the study is that there is no single African population that is representative of the diversity present on the continent.",
        "By looking at how many changes have accumulated in the DNA of various groups, geneticists can determine how long they've lived apart from each other.",
        "Scientists can also tease out information about when and where different groups migrated over thousands of years' time.",
        "The team says their genetic map shows that modern humans probably originated near the South African-Namibian border, and their last waypoint before migrating out of Africa was Northeastern Africa near the Red Sea.",
        "The scientists also compared the African genes to those of African-Americans and concluded that on average, African-Americans inherited about 71 percent of their DNA from ancestors in Western Africa and about 13 percent from Europeans.",

        "If you shut down a court system where arrests are not being able to be processed through to conviction, then you're going to see an increase or a spike in crime in any urban area in the country.",
