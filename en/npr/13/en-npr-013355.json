        "We have so many ways and means of going skyward, so much that we can do on the surface of the ocean and the land, but when it comes to really getting down into the sea 1,000 feet, 5,000 feet - and drilling is going on now in greater than 10,000 feet.",
        "If we're having trouble getting down to understand and to react to this catastrophic event in a mile of water, what about two miles?",
        "What about the deep-sea mining that is going to - that is already underway in some parts of the world in 20,000 - not 5,000, 20,000 - feet?",
        "Shouldn't we know what's there before these actions are undertaken, and then shouldn't we be prepared to follow up and to take some kind of positive response?",
        "One thing that I hope that this monstrous event will inspire is care for the ocean, to identify critical places in the Gulf of Mexico that can be protected as sources of renewal.",
        "Not all of the Gulf is going to be affected by this.",
        "So those healthy places that remain need to be regarded as what I might refer to as hope spots, places that if we can embrace them, can help not only protect the health of that immediate area, but restore health to places that have been affected.",
        "And you think that - one of the things that you say that we're not doing is not actually getting in there and doing the field work.",
        "To look at it prior to whatever actions are taking place.",
        "Now, some deep-sea work in the Gulf of Mexico has taken place.",
