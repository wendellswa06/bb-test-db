        "And I'm happy with the robots.",
        "That's true.",
        "Robots, I mean, there are places that are unrealistic to send humans, and then you have to have the robots.",
        "But where you can go, why not?",
        "I agree.",
        "I mean, it's amazing to think that the oceans are such a central part of the Earth, but so much has not been explored.",
        "And the point you made I think that's really useful, too, is that a lot of the important science that inevitably will deal with catastrophes like this is not on trying to say how we can deal with a catastrophe, but just curiosity-driven research, trying to understand how the oceans work, how the ocean floor works."

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "We've learned more about the ocean, literally, in the last 50 years than during all preceding human history, but the magnitude of what we don't know is staggering.",
        "And it should just literally whet our appetite to need to know more, want to know more, now that we understand the basics: that the ocean drives climate and weather, that the ocean delivers most of the oxygen to the atmosphere, that the carbon cycle is driven by life in the ocean.",

        "And this is just one small example.",
        "And I think that your point about learning is a key one, because the -we - in science, you know, you tend to think about the long-term and the medium-term plan, but when it comes to human life, we don't."
