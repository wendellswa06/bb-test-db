        "But what's missing from consideration - and it certainly would be missing from use of a, let's say, a big bomb to close the problem: Think of the impact on life.",
        "You might stop the oil flow, which has an impact on life in the water column.",
        "But what guarantees -what would be the impact?",
        "What would be the effect of that?",
        "We haven't a clue.",
        "And shouldn't we know before unleashing yet another unknown?",
        "Part of what I find so troubling is that we are - we fail to think about the precautionary principle throughout all of this.",
        "I have tremendous respect for the engineering that has gone into developing the capacity to drill not just down to 5,000 feet, but, in some cases, 35,000 feet beyond that, through rocks into the substrate below to retrieve fossil fuels, the fossil materials that have accumulated over millions of years.",
        "This is a feat worthy of \"\"Star Trek,\"\" for heaven's sakes.",
        "It is astonishing, the technology.",
        "And yet we're baffled by what to do when something goes wrong.",
        "Where is the precautionary principle that would cause us to want to know, to need to know, to have in our back pockets the solution before the problems arise?",
        "Or how can we, in good conscience, just put a million gallons of toxic substances into the Gulf of Mexico and not know in advance what the effects on not just birds - although that is clearly not a good thing for them - not just turtles and dolphins, but the life in the water column itself, the living minestrone that drives away the ocean works and contributes to our lives, as well?"

        "Yeah.",

        "Oh, exactly.",

        "It's when this happens, not if it happens.",

        "When you do something like this, you have to know it's going to happen.",
        "Just like when you build a space shuttle, you have to know it's going to - some of them are going to be destroyed and people are going to die, and you can't pretend it's not the case.",
        "And so, if you're sensible and that's - you know, really the scientific method is you have to know that these things are going to happen a certain percentage of the time, and you have to assess the risks and anticipate not only the problems, but the solutions.",
        "And I think, really, that's what science - you know, I'm educator, but that's really what we can do as scientists to some extent.",
        "It's not up to us to determine public policy, but what we can do is say, look, here are the problems.",
        "Here are the risks.",
        "And here's the information that you can use to decide whether it's - whether the risks are worth meeting.",
        "And that's really what the scientific community should be doing.",
        "Sylvie, I've got about 30 seconds left.",
        "Are you hopeful about this turning out - about how this is all going to turn out?",
        "We'll make something good come of it.",
        "I mean, as some have said, we can't waste this disaster.",
        "We have to turn it to an advantage and look for the good that we can learn and not just let it slide by and continue business as usual."
