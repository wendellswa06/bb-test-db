        "He maintained that American troops are making progress.",
        "Retention is high, recruitment is meeting goals, and people are feeling strong about the mission, Mark.",
        "But I also recognize that we've got to make sure that our military is transformed, and that's what is taking place right now.",
        "We're transforming the United States Army so that capabilities and the threats are better aligned.",
        "Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld also dismissed the Pentagon study, saying the military is prepared to take on challenges of the 21st Century.",

        "Well, our army is not equipped to do that at this point.",
        "Representative Wilson, we should know that you've traveled to Iraq five times, and in fact, have three sons in the military, one who has served a year in Iraq.",
        "And when you've talked to your sons, when you've talked to the troops, do you get a sense that the feel stretched?",
        "I agree with David, actually, that I've never been prouder of the military.",

        "Let me suggest that we have heard from troops that have come home who have suggested that they are weary, that their colleagues, in fact, are fighting the good fight, but they are weary.",
        "Representative Scott, is there a concern that in all of this talk, everyone wants to make sure that they say they support the troops, you'd be hard-pressed to find many folks in America who would go against that notion, but there are still those - the president did not necessarily address this yesterday - who feel that those troops are there under false pretenses and that we cannot let that go.",
        "Yes, I think so.",
        "And that's why I say we really have to back off and separate this into two parts.",

        "Two, the one person in the administration who had the credentials, who actually fought in wars, who were actually there in the very beginning, who pinpointed so much accurate information, was kicked to the side.",
        "That was Colin Powell.",
        "I think we made serious mistakes in not having the force capable to do post-stabilization effort, that has brought about the insurgency because we went with a lean, mean machine.",
        "So we didn't have the support mechanism to go in to do it.",
        "So I'm not going to say it's an unjust war, but I will say it's a mismanaged war.",

        "One of them has to do with the court system; it's expediting prosecutions of murder cases.",
        "A couple more are putting more police on foot patrols, late night checkpoints, stopping people with drugs and alcohol.",
        "Which of these do you think could make a difference?",
        "Well, I think that cutting down the time and providing better police reports, a more timely information in homicide cases, can and will make a difference.",
        "Historically, what New Orleans has done, we've done a good job of arresting people but a very poor job of convicting people.",
        "And until we do a better job, we're going to see a perpetuation of the crime problems that we have here.",
        "And that's what the people that are marching on city hall are demanding, not looking to lock up everybody that moves.",
        "In fact, I think the average person on the street would rather see fewer arrests but more quality arrests, and removing the criminal element that have been plaguing this community for decades.",
        "Thank you very much for joining us.",
        "Thank you."
