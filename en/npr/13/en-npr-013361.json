        "And it might seem innocuous, but if the right pieces of information are put together in the right order, then that can really put our troops in danger.",

        "I think they might be a little overblown, and I think that more people in the military community actually act like your first caller, which is they are already aware of operational security and are already taking great pains to avoid disclosing any real secrets.",
        "And the sort of only quantitative study of whether secrets were leaked on social media or not took place in 2006, when military blogs were really up and running.",
        "And they found that independent military bloggers had only had 28 security violations over the course of a year, while official military sites, you know, dot-mil official publications, had 1,813 violations of those same security policies.",

        "And so do you think this is a solution in search of a problem?",
        "In some ways yes, but I also think that the military review is very necessary, not because there's no policy but in fact because there are dozens of overlapping policies about what various branches of the military are allowed to do and what they're not.",
        "For example, the Marines recently banned Twitter and Facebook from its official networks, while the Army ordered its network administrators to allow those sites.",
        "And that's just one example of how there's a lot of tension within the military about whether to use these sites or not, and that's why I think this review is very helpful.",

        "That's correct.",

        "I really can't comment about the ungentlemanly stuff that may be on there, but things that may not be, quote-unquote, \"\"approved talking points\"\" from, you know, from a bureau like mine, public affairs, I actually welcome that sort of talk and chatter on the Web.",
        "I believe it shows a Pentagon that has multiple voices, and it gives a transparency to our decision-making process that I believe is good.",
        "Noah Shachtman?",
        "I don't think everybody in the military is quite as open-minded and quite as smart about this stuff as Price is, unfortunately.",
        "For example, there is a young lieutenant named Matthew Gallagher(ph) who ran a blog while he was deployed in Iraq last year, and when he had some unkind things to say about his commanding officer, his blog was shut down.",
        "So I think sometimes that ungentlemanly talk does get people into trouble in the military.",

        "Gallagher ran afoul of an Army regulation that said you had to approve each blog post with your superior officer before you put it up.",
        "And when I asked the author of those regulations what kind of information might be considered a violation of operational security, he mentioned pizza orders.",
        "There's an old wives' tale that the number of pizza orders to the Pentagon increased on the eve of the first Iraq War.",
        "And that by tracking those pizza orders, you could tell when the attack against Saddam Hussein was going to be launched.",

        "Do you, Price Floyd, sometimes find yourself having conversations either with people who don't understand social media, or they just have this sort of knee-jerk reaction that controlling is better than not controlling within the military culture?",
        "Well, there's kind of the basic operating - in government, not just at the Defense Department but elsewhere, that it's impossible to get in trouble for what you say to the media or on a blog if you don't say anything to the media or on a blog.",
        "So if that's the foundation, anything above that, I'll take as a good day."

        "I think that what I find at the Pentagon is not so much the pizza order phenomena, but it's a cultural difference and understanding about what social networks are and what media 2.0 is or Web 2.0 is.",
        "A lot of people think of it as a new way to get information out.",
        "So in that sense, when we went from blast faxing information to blast emailing, people were so excited you could push one button and reach so many people.",
        "And they believed that Web 2.0 is just the next extension of that.",
        "And I believe that's just a fundamental misunderstanding of what Web 2.0 is.",
        "It's not so much a way of getting more information out, but it's a way of engaging with the American people, one audience, those overseas.",
        "In the case of the military, as well, engaging internally with our internal audience of several million members of the Defense Department.",
        "And in that sense, it's that two-way street, and that's what Secretary Gates wants.",
        "He wants that engagement.",
        "He wants to hear back from people.",
        "And the new Web site that you mentioned, defense.gov, pentagon.gov, .mil, dod.gov or .mil, some of the features on that underscore his wish to engage with people and not just the typical ask the secretary a question, and he'll answer it, which is on there, but also what - right now, you know, what are the policy initiatives that are important to you?",
        "And I think that engagement that happens is much more important than a way - much better than just a new way to get more information out.",
        "Well also in addition to taking advantage of the two-way communication, the culture on the Web has a pretty high BS detector, right?",
        "I mean, if you are putting out talking points that are crafted and vetted and edited within an inch of their lives, people online smell that out in a second.",
        "That's right.",

        "I actually ask questions more often than not, and - or I saw an interesting article, and I want their opinion of it.",
        "And I wanted to highlight one thing.",
        "When this first - when this news broke about that we're doing the policy review, and when the Marine Corps made its announcement about blocking access, I just sent a Twitter out saying this is out there, what do you think about it?",
        "And it was interesting the response I got because remember, I was sending it out on a Twitter account.",
        "And the majority of people, unsurprisingly, said they wanted, you know, for folks to have access, but a minority - but a large minority, actually said they understood why these things should be blocked and that there were security concerns.",
        "And what was interesting about it was I was getting it on a Twitter account.",
        "These people were on Twitter saying yes, this should be blocked.",
        "So not everyone who uses social networking sites is in favor of having complete and open access.",
        "Well, Noah Shachtman, you asked cadets, Academy cadets, if they would block access.",
        "Yeah, I was at West Point a couple of months ago, and I asked a group of cadets who were heading out to be company commanders and platoon commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan if they would allow their troops to blog or get on Facebook.",
        "And I would say, like, 19 out of 20 of them said no way, no how.",
        "You know, oh my God, they're going to reveal secrets.",
        "Who knows what they're going to say?",
        "Oh, who's got time to blog when you're in a war zone.",
        "No way, they said.",
        "And then I asked them well, do you think there's any way of actually stopping that kind of information from getting out?",
        "Is there any way to stop these guys from getting on Skype, getting on email, getting on Twitter accounts, what have you, and talking to their friends and family.",
        "And they all said, well, that can't happen, either.",
        "And so we've got kind of a dilemma here."
