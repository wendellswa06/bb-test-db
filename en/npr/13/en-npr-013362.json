        "Yeah, hi.",
        "Thanks for taking my call.",
        "Sure.",
        "Yeah, you know, I served twice in Iraq, once during the invasion and once again in 2005, and I guess I bring a different perspective to it only because I really thought that there was an increased focus in what's going on at home instead of on the mission when we had all that access to social networking sites and whatnot.",
        "You know, my question is: Do we really need it, and is it appropriate for the war zone?",
        "So you found that constant updates from home were distracting?",
        "I really did.",
        "And, you know, not just personally, I saw it within - you know, I was a lieutenant for the invasion and a captain for the occupation - well, if it's appropriate to call it an occupation - for my time in Baghdad, and you know, again, I really thought that there was less focus on what we were doing, and time passed faster for me and for my soldiers when we didn't have that same access to home.",

        "Oh, he's gone now.",
        "I guess my questions to Matt would be did it make it easier when you re-integrated back here to the States?",
        "Did having had that constant contact make it easier for you and for your family when you came back?"

        "I've also heard your comments from other commanders on the ground, that they need to be focused on the fight, not what's going on at home.",
        "But I've also heard lots of comments about how it was easier to re-integrate once they came back.",
        "And of course what Noah said: There's just almost - there's no way to stop this.",

        "For example, you go on there and you see transit crews having to deal with tons of rats and IEDs, sleeping in tents and horrible conditions.",
        "But yet, he can't send me an email.",
        "I just think that the entire communication strategy isn't streamlined at all.",
        "Price Floyd?",

        "And I think it's good for morale for the folks out there and for the family members back here.",

        "I served one tour in Afghanistan and two in Iraq.",
        "And I guess I would take almost a diametrically opposite position as some of the things Price has heard from commanders.",
        "I was an NCO, and I will tell you that my soldiers being able to have almost seamless communication with their families - and by that I mean, hey mom here's some photos on my MySpace that she could go look at, as opposed to the usual email blurb - was absolutely helpful to our morale.",
        "And I saw it have a very positive effect on our soldiers.",
        "You know, I got - when I was in Afghanistan - I just got back, like I said.",
        "And I must have had a dozen, maybe more, family members of the Marine unit I was with email me to thank me because the regulations and bandwidth issues kept a lot of those troops from letting them know what was going on at home.",
        "But I was able to report on what was going on in their lives, and they just thanked me over and over again for the insight into what their sons and husbands were doing every day.",
        "They just - they crave that information back home.",
        "You know, Noah, we haven't really talked about the bandwidth issues.",
        "Explain what you mean by that and how big a problem you think it is.",
        "Well, you know, basically, you know, when you're out somewhere in the middle of nowhere in Afghanistan, it's a lot harder to get online than it is if you're sitting at your desk in the office.",
        "And the further you are down range out in the field, the harder it is to get online.",
        "That's just the fact of the matter.",
        "And so certain sites have been blocked on military networks because of bandwidth concerns, that they're eating up too much network space that should be going to predator video and to, I don't know, PowerPoints and to…",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "…and to other things.",
        "But the funny thing about the military policy is that it's really contradictory.",
        "And that's why the review, like the one Price has been talking about, is so important.",
        "For example, not only was - were many bases blocking YouTube because it took up too much bandwidth, they're also blocking the Defense Department's own answer to YouTube, which is a low bandwidth, totally secure, safe, no-bad-stuff version called TroopTube.",
        "They were blocking both YouTube and this military alternative.",
        "So, it just goes to show that, you know, when the military's blocking its own video-sharing site, we need a cleaner policy.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Price Floyd, did you want to jump in there?",
        "Well, I agree with everything that Noah said.",
        "And the previous caller, I must have been misunderstood.",
        "I didn't say all commanders have told me that, nor did I agree with some of the commanders.",
        "But several commanders have told me that this type of access, constant access back home, they thought interfered with their men's minimum admissibility(ph) to do their job where they were.",
        "But that was not, in any means, all of the commanders that I heard from.",

        "We were using our own service, so we weren't tying up the military service.",

        "I wouldn't say why or anything, you know, didn't realize how it was in the day or whatever.",
        "But later in the day, I'll get an email from her where a spouse that lived next door to her whose husband was a first sergeant in my battalion, had informed her we had been mortared that day.",
        "And stuff like that, when, you know, people are not paying attention to what they should be doing can cause, you know, some major problems.",
        "Well, this also gets to the point that the information is incredibly hard to control, that if you are able to close down one source or, you know, have consistency policy levels to one set of troops, that doesn't necessarily cut across all other channels of information.",
        "Actually, we have an email from Aaron in Minnesota, who says: I'm surprised there still isn't a policy in place for social media.",
        "When I was Afghanistan in 2005, the main social media site was MySpace.",
        "After six months in country, we were threatened by our commands that releasing too much information on MySpace will get us in trouble to the point of being prosecuted under UCMJ for violation of OPSEC.",
        "Apparently, there were supposed to be some government employees monitoring the sites to make sure that military members are not blogging sensitive information.",
        "Is this true, or was it an empty threat?",
        "I wasn't at the Defense Department at that time and - but to my knowledge, there's not - there are not DOD people monitoring MySpace to make sure other folks follow OPSEC regulations.",
        "We also have an email from Sarah in Nashville, Tennessee, who says: What about all the other military contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan?",
        "It is my understanding our soldiers count for only about half the U.S.",
        "personnel in both theaters.",
        "What about that security issue?",
        "Noah Shachtman, obviously, the Pentagon can't necessarily control the media of contractors.",
        "But is there an additional question here about how much the message is being controlled?",
        "You know, well, that's why there's all these overlapping and confusing regulations.",
        "The Army actually do apply to contractors, as well, but some other regulations don't.",
        "So it's confusing.",
        "Also, about the monitoring, while I don't think that goes on constantly, there have been, at times, teams from a group called the Army Web Risk Assessment Cell that have monitored troops communication over social networks.",
        "So, you know, it's off again, it's on again.",
        "The regulations apply to one people - one set of people, not the other."

        "There's not just risk involved.",
        "The military has got a chance to let its top commanders hear from soldiers that they would never hear from before and to let members in the military that would never interact together, interact over these social networks.",
