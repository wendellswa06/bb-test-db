        "But soon, these abandoned industrial areas will be the spot for a big, new, green energy project, and this is going to be something interesting.",
        "It's Italy's first algae-to-electricity power plant, and the developers are hoping that the plant will produce enough electricity from the algae to power half the city of Venice - and all that with zero emissions.",
        "How do you like that?",
        "How's it going to work?",
        "Is it really feasible?",
        "That's what we're going to be talking about with my next guest, Al Darzins.",
        "He is at the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, Colorado.",
        "Welcome to Science Friday, Dr. Darzins.",
        "Hello, thank you.",
        "Let's talk about the facility being planned for Venice.",
        "How do you turn algae into electricity?",
        "Well, I mean, apparently they are going to be using a technology based from a company here on the U.S., whereby they will grow the algae in what are known as closed photobioreactors, essentially large tubes; collect the algae, remove all the water, dry the algae; and then probably gasify that algae in a system that they call plasma gasification.",
        "That generates hot gases that can be then burned, turn a turbine, to generate electricity.",
        "So they're going to turn it into biomass, basically?",
        "Right.",
        "So they're going to grow, actually, biomass, the algae as a feedstock, and then use that feedstock to actually do the gasification process.",
        "Now this is different - I've always heard that people want to grow algae to take biodiesel out of it, make fuel oil out of it, but this is not what they're doing.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "This is dramatically different than really what most of the people in the world are looking at for algae.",
        "Algae are a really good source of potentially bioenergy routes.",
        "They make a lot of things like hydrogen oils, lipids if you will, carbohydrates, sugars -but then the biomass itself could be used as a feedstock."

        "And so this piece that they're looking at in Italy is really kind of a small part of where the larger, general interest is in algae, and that is actually on the oils that they produce.",
        "Right, 1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "Also you can tweet us @scifri, @-S-C-I-F-R-I, or join us in Second Life.",
        "You say it is different than what most people are doing, and how feasible is it, then?",
        "Well, that's the ultimate question, really, for any algae technology.",
        "It's always going to come down to cost.",
        "And so in our experience, some of the plasma gasification technologies, you know, they can be rather capital and energy intensive.",
        "You then have to figure into that the cost of growing the algae in these closed systems, which are expensive; the cost of harvesting and removing all the water; and then, in theory, drying the algae before you actually do the gasification.",
        "So, are you ready to play the puzzle?",
        "So what that all entails and what that costs is going to be absolutely critical to the bottom line and whether this is cost-effective and sustainable.",
        "Yeah, because it's going to take all that energy to, what, to dry it and do all the kinds of things you need to do to it.",
        "Absolutely, and that extends to really any algal biofuels technology - whether it's producing oils for biodiesel or there are some algae that actually can produce ethanol, as well.",
        "And so, all the processes that go into producing those fuels, what that costs is going to be absolutely critical in the future.",
        "Yeah, and of course when you burn it, you're then going to produce some of the greenhouse gases themselves, right?",
        "That's true, but I think in the process in Italy, I think they plan on reusing the CO2 to actually channel back into the growth of the algae because the algae need nutrients, sunlight, water and CO2 to grow."

        "And what is their schedule for getting this all done?",

        "I mean, it's unlikely that they'll go to full-bore commercialization.",
        "They'll probably have to start out very slowly with a pilot or demonstration plant just to see whether this works.",
        "You know, I've seen algae demonstration plants out in our deserts out there in the southwest, but Venice is not a southwest desert.",
        "Well, and that's absolutely critical.",

        "And again when you talk to Jerry Brand next, you know, you'll find out that there are many different algal species that have the ability to grow in fresh water.",

        "They can grow in sea water, and there are some organisms that can grow, like, in the Great Salt Lake.",

        "You can burn it to generate the electricity, but then you can also use that to make other fuels, as well.",

        "Yeah, I've heard that, too.",
        "We'll talk about it a bit.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Yeah, thanks for the question.",
        "Well, to address the caller's first issue.",
        "So as far as I know, the plans, at least in Venice, are to grow the algae in these large kind of vertically standing tubes if you will.",
        "And so they will essentially be enclosed, and so that's really going to limit, you know, where these algae can go in the environment.",
        "I'm ready.",
        "That is true - for the second question - algae can be used as both a food and fuel, but most of the food applications are grown in, you know, places like California and Hawaii, where, you know, they're growing these organisms that really don't produce a lot of the oils that we're looking for for biofuels."
