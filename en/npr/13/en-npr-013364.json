        "But if you grow algae for using biofuels, taking the oil out of it, could you then not squeeze the oil out and use the other byproducts, use as...",
        "Absolutely.",

        "That's exactly right.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Because?",
        "The reason is that different algae grow better under some conditions than other ones do, and so it depends on the conditions where they want to grow the algae.",
        "It depends on what product they want from the algae.",
        "And not only that, most kinds of algae haven't really even been researched very much in detail.",
        "So we don't even know which ones for sure have the most potential to grow vigorously, to behave well in large cultures, and to produce a lot of the products that people are interested in.",
        "Well, how many different kinds are there?",
        "I would say no one really knows.",
        "The estimates keep going up.",
        "Some conservative estimates say maybe less than a couple hundred thousand, but others claim that there may be more than a million kinds of just one group of algae alone, called diatoms.",
        "And so it kind of depends on how you divide them up.",
        "There's sort of - almost like a continuum in the genetic contents.",
        "So when you separate one species from another, where do you draw the line?",
        "Do you divide them with very - based on very subtle differences in their genetic content, or do we make the breaks more broadly?",
        "But theoretically, then, with all these different kinds, you should be able to find one for everybody.",
        "You really would think you could.",
        "The problem is the alga does what it wants to do, not what man wants it to do.",
        "And living out in nature, it's very analogous, I would say, to growing wheat."

        "(Laughter) Nice.",
        "When farmers, or let's say hunters and gatherers, first wanted to grow wheat, there was just a few stalks of this stuff, and it probably was enough to support a few people every square mile.",
        "But you had to develop new varieties.",

        "And I ended up becoming more interested in the algae than I did the specific process, photosynthesis, and so that's how I became involved.",
        "Wow, that's terrific, and algae can grow just about anywhere, can't it?",
        "Well, they've got to have light.",
        "As long as there's a source of light available, it's remarkable the diversity of places that they can grow, in practically every habitat where there's light.",

        "Yeah, you know, in fact I remember going - you know, I used to go to the zoo here in New York and see the polar bears had green fur, and I learned years later that was algae growing inside the little shafts of their fur.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "That's one of the interesting places you can find them.",
        "I've actually seen them under the bark of tree.",
        "If you have a young sapling that looks dark, but there's enough light gets through it that they grow right just underneath the bark of a tree where you'd never think a photosynthetic organism could grow.",

        "And they are very much like bacteria, and it's quite easy to get new genetic material into many strains of those.",
        "And so there's a number of scientists around the world who are attempting to modify those such that they grow under more favorable conditions for producing, say, a fuel, or they produce a more desirable product."
