        "Hi, welcome to Science Friday.",

        "I'd like to ask your guest if you were to engineer algae, would there - you know, it's a very virulent plant.",
        "Is there a danger that the engineered algae could go wild and maybe hurt the wild algae?",
        "Good question.",
        "That's an extremely good question and one that's being addressed now, very seriously, since we realize in order to provide a fuel source from algae or any other commodity, we would have to grow huge amounts of it.",
        "The first thing I would say is, that in my opinion, most algae are what we would call pandemic.",
        "It means that if you bring something in from a foreign place, if it's a small alga, microscopic, it's probably - you're not going to probably introduce something foreign, something that wouldn't eventually get there anyway.",
        "But now when we're talking about genetically engineered algae, that's something different.",
        "I think there would have to be a lot of testing going on before this could be approved.",
        "So this has not been adequately addressed yet, at least not to the public, but it's something that's been very seriously discussed in meetings of those who are trying to develop biofuels and other commodities from algae.",
        "So we're well aware of the problem.",
        "The testing procedures and things that we would need to do to authorize these to be used have not been put in place yet.",
        "Well, I guess you could call it a form of agriculture.",

        "Okay, well we'll create a room for you: algae agricultural.",
        "All right, that's okay.",
        "It's a kind of mariculture, I suppose, if it's marine waters you're using, and of course, some people think of doing that in salt water and some in fresh water.",
        "So it's a kind of mariculture, I suppose, but algae agricultural is probably a much better term.",
        "And the idea is to come up with something that we can use and harvest the best for whatever purpose we want to do with it.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "We would like to have an alga that's tailor made for the specific products that we want.",
        "Do you think that algae would be able to produce enough oil, let's say, to make a difference?",
        "Well theoretically, yes.",
        "Many people have done calculations that indicate that in scale, algae could make a significant dent in our fuel requirements, if we can do it, as Al Darzins said a few minutes ago, if would could do it economically.",
        "And so far, there's not been any real demonstration of that, although it appears like the possible price is coming down.",
        "But it would take a lot of land, and the reason why algae are so attractive is because algae can grow on land where not much else can grow, in deserts and arid land, various conditions.",
        "And so it would take a lot of land, but it doesn't necessarily take land that's needed for other things.",
        "One last question from Twitter.",
        "Lee Rosen(ph) writes: How much carbon can be captured in the algae energy production process?",
        "That's a good question.",
        "Some people think that, well, if you put in 40-percent carbon dioxide, 40 percent of the air is carbon dioxide and bubble it into your algae, you can do better than putting in five percent.",
        "That's not necessarily true.",
        "You're only capturing carbon as fast as the alga's growing, and I don't remember exactly what the percentage of an alga is carbon, probably in the range of 30 or 40 percent."

        "So a lot of the mass of the alga goes into carbon, but you can only remove the carbon as fast as that alga's growing.",
        "So if it only doubles once every day, which many of them do, that's how fast you're going to capture the carbon.",
        "I had seen stores of pilot programs in the Southwest where algae were growing in a greenhouse next to a power plant, and they fed the CO2 into the greenhouse, and they said they could suck out 80 percent of the CO2 coming out the stack, but it grew so fast you'd have to take - it like tripled overnight or something like that.",
        "That's right, and not necessarily overnight but over a period of a day, when the photosynthesis is allowing it to grow.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "Some tiny algae can double three times in a day.",
        "That means by nightfall, there's eight times as many as there were when the sun came up in the morning.",
        "So some small ones can reproduce very, very rapidly.",
        "And so in that case, they can capture an awful lot of CO2 during that period of time.",
        "So scaling it up is the problem here, making sure you don't have bad algae at the bottom of a pile someplace.",
        "That's exactly right.",
