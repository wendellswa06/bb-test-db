        "While Graham is benefiting from his corporate buyout, he says there is a reason much of the most prized wine in California comes from smaller operations.",

        "And if a winery is purchased, they are usually the first to sort of write it off, if they don't want to see their beloved passion tainted by corporate ownership.",
        "But if some wine drinkers are writing off a handful of newly corporate properties, there are still plenty of little labels to know and love.",
        "There are now more than 5,000 wineries in the U.S.",
        "- three times what they were just a decade ago.",

        "It's a costume comedy with a lush look that moves like a Hollywood period piece and that's not surprising.",
        "Laurent Tirard, who has now made two films in his native France, learned this trade at NYU Film School.",
        "Then he read scripts for Warner Bros.",

        "And I'm thinking, oh, wow, that's the kind of comedy I've never, you know, encountered (unintelligible).",
