        "Yes.",
        "And then some of it is just really nasty and destructive.",

        "And when people say they don't like the film, all I'm really hearing is they don't like me.",
        "And for some reason, the tonic effect of a good review just isn't as powerful as the critique?",
        "For some reason.",

        "And I have that feeling, too.",
        "So when I - whenever I read a good review, it's like, ah, I finally have been exposed, you know?",

        "Well, I can start by saying that the president--if you look at his overall track record, he has a very strong track record when it comes to appointing people with diverse backgrounds.",
        "He did appoint Harriet Miers, as you've noted.",
        "That obviously didn't go exactly how we expected it, and the president's deeply disappointed that she didn't get the type of fair hearing that he had hoped.",
        "Having said that, the president has chosen somebody that all Americans can be proud of.",
        "Sam Alito is a very distinguished judge on the 3rd Court of Appeals.",
        "He probably has more experience and credentials than any nominee to the Supreme Court in the last 70 years, and that is a record and qualifications that all Americans can be proud of.",
