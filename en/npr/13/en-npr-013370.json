        "This hour, we'll talk with conservatives and liberals about what happened to both political parties on Tuesday and how their ideologies may change.",

        "Nice to have you back on the program.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Is this truly a significant shift, do you think?",
        "Well, I'm trying to write a new book called The Left Nation.",
        "Not quite.",
        "I don't think this a significant shift.",
        "What it is a corrective and a reassertion of the power of the center.",
        "People aren't saying we want to move dramatically to the left, but what they're saying is that the Republican Party and the conservative movement just tried to take us too far to the right and we didn't want any more marching in that direction.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So what message should we take?",
        "I mean you see all kinds of commentators from the right saying, well, we lost our way in the wilderness of the Washington bureaucracy.",
        "We became, well, like Democrats.",
        "We got fat and happy and forgot our good, conservative values.",
        "I think there's some truth in that.",
        "The - what we see here is partly a rejection of incumbency.",
        "These are people who lost their ideas and became just concerned with being insiders, with doling out pork, with doling out committee chairmanships.",
        "So it's partly that but there is something more here, and that is that there is a rejection of a particular set of ideas, and that is the neoconservative ideas that led to the Iraq war.",
        "I think for an incumbent senator who's part of a party leadership to lose by more than 14 points is very dramatic.",
        "It's not been given the attention it should have been.",
        "So I think what we've seen is that big government conservativism alienates real conservatives, small government conservatives without winning over the sort of swing voters that it's intended to win over.",
        "Bush has been, in some ways, a very ideological president, not just a White House insider, but somebody who took the country in a really new direction.",
        "I think the whole idea of destroying rogue states, asserting American power, using American military force to change the balance of power in this or that area of the world - these were ideas.",
        "These weren't things that were pushed for by the permanent bureaucracy.",
        "These are things that were pushed forward by a very identifiable group of conservative intellectuals.",
        "And what we have seen is those ideas leading into a morass in Iraq and voters going to the polls and saying, look, this is a mess.",
        "We don't want any more of it.",
        "Though it is an ideological defeat as well as the defeat for incumbents."

        "For many years, conservatives argued that their side enjoyed the ideological fervor, that the ideas that were - even during the Clinton administration, welfare reform, for example - that these were generated from the right.",
        "Yesterday and after Tuesday of this week, they seem to be on the defensive.",
        "The right's on the defensive, but I think certainly, the neoconservative movement is on the defensive.",
        "I'm not sure that what we see is a terrible foment of ideas on the left, however.",
        "What we see is a very careful - a very good set of policy proposals by Nancy Pelosi - very sensible, centrist set of ideas - but not a real identity, not a real ideological identity in the way that you got with Newt Gingrich.",
        "I applaud that.",
        "My worry is that you will get a set - a new ideological movement, which will be an attempt to redefine centrism in a very different way from the way that Clinton defined it.",
        "And that will be, shall I call it, leudovisism(ph).",
        "It will be protectionism, building up walls against immigrants, building up walls against trade, and taking a culturally conservative position.",
        "Sort of a left-wing Buchananism as it were.",
        "I see some signs of that.",
        "Coming out of the Democratic Party?",
        "Yes, coming out of the Democratic Party because they're trying to become a - less of a liberal party, more of a national party.",
        "They're trying to become less of a fringe party, more of a centrist party.",
        "The real question that we're going to see debated over the next few months, I think, is what is this new centrism?",
        "Well, at the same time - I was talking about the conservatives saying that we lost our way and we have to get back to true conser… You also see progressives arguing that no, it wasn't that the conservatives - Democrats who won this election, it was progressives who won this election.",
        "They were the fervor behind getting people to the polls and getting people excited about this election.",
        "Sure.",
        "Do you see people arguing that?",
        "I think the case of Ned Lamont's doesn't necessarily demonstrate - I think the really interesting thing that's happened from the Democratic point of view…",
        "Ned Lamont, the anti-war insurgent who upset Joe Lieberman in Connecticut but then lost to him as an Independent in the general election on Tuesday.",
        "Exactly right.",
        "I think what you're seeing is the fact that they're making inroads into places like Iowa and Idaho and Kansas.",
        "The fact that they are more of a centrist party, they're willing to - or more of a big-tent party, shall I say.",
        "They're not a culturally elitist party.",
        "They're trying not to be.",
        "And I think that Nancy Pelosi is trying to produce an agenda, which is as broad - I don't want to call it banal - but it's not exactly full of cutting-edge ideas.",
        "This is as broad as you can be in order to try and hold this big-tent party together.",
        "Let's get some callers involved in the conversation.",

        "This was trying to use the power of government to push for conservative ends.",
        "And this election was very much a repudiation of that.",

        "And many people almost won.",
        "So I think, if I were a Republican strategist, I'd definitely draw the Democrats in on Iraq and thereby losing that momentum to change.",

        "Sure.",
        "Well, I think it's very interesting what has happened in Colorado and in the West, that we have a Democratic trend.",
