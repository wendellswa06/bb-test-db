        "Senate, to the Democrats.",

        "Republican George Allen, trialing his Democratic opponent in Virginia, is expected to speak in about 40 minutes.",
        "Today we're talking about this shift in American politics, what some call the end of an era where conservative ideas dominated the national agenda.",
        "Did the Democrats win on Tuesday or did the Republicans lose?",
        "Should Democrats work with the president where they can or oppose him at every turn?",

        "Hey, Neal.",
        "Nice to talk to you again.",
        "And I think you got a new chapter.",
        "Well, I got too many chapters, but that's a different conversation.",
        "Is this the end of an era?",
        "You know, no, I don't think it is, and I'm going to take a slightly different tack from your last guest because I think this is an important point.",
        "We kind of keep talking about this in terms of liberal versus conservative, or Democratic versus Republican.",
        "We had a Republican wave, now that era's over.",
        "We have a Democratic wave.",
        "You know, the West was Republican, now it's going Democrat.",
        "I would rather suggest to you that what we're seeing is the same continuum in American politics, and it's not best viewed as a conservative and liberal axis.",
        "It's best viewed as an anti-Washington versus governing conflict.",
        "And that's essentially what voters have been saying this country increasingly for decades - is that nothing is getting done to sort of turn us toward a 21st Century world, that nothing alleviates the economic insecurity and the insecurity they now have about foreign policy in the world, and that they don't believe that either party is addressing those concerns.",

        "They're still having - these two parties - the same fight they were having in 1975, and it means nothing to people.",
        "So the wave of 1994 versus the wave of 2006 can be seen as two separate waves of two separate ideological tilts of the country.",
        "But I would suggest they're not.",
        "I would suggest it's the same wave, and that in fact, as you were just talking about, you know - the West, say Colorado, used to be conservative - suddenly it's going liberal.",
        "I would suggest to you that it used to be anti-government and now it's anti-government, and it just depends on who's governing.",
        "The good news for Democrats is you won and the bad news is you won.",
        "That's precisely right.",

        "And if you don't deliver it - which, you know, for reasons we can get into, I think structurally they can't - then you're bound to be in the same situation again.",
        "Because what people are registering here is an exhaustion with 20th Century politics in 21st Century environment.",
        "One of the things that we talked a lot about - I think the last time you were on the program - was the battle between two electoral campaign tactics, as the Democrats were talking about.",
        "Rahm Emanuel, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Committee, wanted to spend all the money possible to win individual races around the country - seeing this as a historic opportunity to get back control of the House of Representatives.",
        "And then you had Howard Dean, the chairman of the party, who wanted to use the 50-state strategy to build up the party in places where it had virtually evaporated - Alaska, for example - and reestablish the Democrats as a national party.",
        "Did they both win?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, think it's very hard to partiside(ph).",
        "It's very hard to say well, this guy was right or that guy was right, and I think, you know, it was hard - I wrote about this in a cover story several weeks ago - and it was hard to come down on one side or the other then, and I think it is - I don't think the election made that any clearer.",
        "I mean, certainly, Rahm Emanuel deserves most of the credit, I would think, of everyone you can talk about in this campaign because the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee did a fantastic job of recruiting candidates - the right kind of candidates - and a very good job of targeting races.",
        "But it's also true - I think Governor Dean can claim some success in that a lot of the states where he has spent money on his 50-state strategy, they had a very strong turnout and a very strong - you know, and a very strong activist involvement.",
        "Which, you know, he certainly can reasonably claim to have fueled that.",
        "But I think in both cases - I will put it this way - in both cases I think neither of them are the winners they'll claim to be because the real driver here was Republican government and voter fatigue and exhaustion with the style as much as the substance of Republican government in Washington.",
        "And I think that it was a great year if you were a leader of the Democratic Campaign Committee or the Democratic Party to look awfully smart as a result of what your opponents were doing rather than what you were doing.",

        "I'm a firm Republican.",
        "I feel I'm very conservative in my views, but I did vote Democratic because I felt like Washington was just not listening.",

        "No, it doesn't.",

        "I don't mean to be a one-note song on this, but I think that's exactly right.",
        "And again, we have a policy and a political establishment that I really believe is thinking about politics in terms of - they're no longer entirely relevant.",
        "And we as a media institution do this too.",
        "So, you know, they won't think about people like Cheryl in Portsmouth as being a Republican voter.",
        "She therefore becomes a base voter, right?",
        "She's a Republican, she's part of the red team, and she's always going to vote red.",

        "But this - but a midterm election much more than a presidential election really is a referendum, particularly when one party controls all of the institutions of government.",
        "And so all of the Democrats really had to do, I think, was show up and make a few intelligent tactical decisions and the enormous frustration and anger towards the Republican Party, you know, kind of made the difference.",

        "Their base is smaller than the GOP base.",

        "The Dems have no new ideas at all except things like gay marriage, which I don't oppose, which doesn't excite me.",
        "All their other ideas - protectionism, minimum wage, etc., are right out of the 1930s.",
        "Well, I don't think it's quite fair to say these ideas are right out of the 1930s.",
        "The Democrats - the idea the Democrats want to push forward - things like the minimum wage, making it easier to pay for college - these are good ideas.",
        "But right now what the Democratic Party still doesn't have is a larger narrative within which to understand why these things are important.",
        "What the Democratic Party still has to do, which Bill Clinton did in '92, is tell Americans a story about the world which explains what's happening in their own lives, explains the rising economic insecurity that many middleclass Americans are facing, and then give an explanation about how an act - a more active government - not a bloated government, but an active, effective government - can empower people and allow them to succeed in this often quite destabilizing new global economy.",

        "For instance, by picking fights on healthcare, which then Clinton made his theme.",
        "What the Democrats have to do, it seems to me, in the next two years is have a very robust internal debate about what that story is.",
