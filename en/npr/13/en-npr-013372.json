        "Like how he massacred all those people at Attica.",
        "You know, one of the worst massacres in the United States in the 20th century.",
        "And he put in effect the nation's first life imprisonment drug laws.",

        "Dave, why are we debating the legacy of Nelson Rockefeller who's been dead, I think, 12 years.",
        "Well, because they keep talking, you know, calling liberal Republicans Rockefeller Republicans.",
        "Why do they forget that he also moved sharply to the right in his later years?",
        "Well, let me put this question to Peter Beinart.",
        "And thanks very much, Dave, for the call.",

        "Yes that's right.",
        "I think what Republicans should do is take a more honest look at the legacy of Ronald Reagan.",
        "Ronald Reagan was far less conservative then George W.",

        "Wade.",
        "Ronald Reagan in 1983 when social security was in much worse fiscal shape than it is now, didn't try to partially privatize it, he raised taxes and raised the retirement age to shore off its fiscal solvency.",
        "The truth of the matter is that George W.",
        "Bush has betrayed Ronald Reagan's legacy but not in the way that conservatives, because he's been too liberal.",
        "In fact, he has been much more ideologically extreme.",
        "Reagan had a much better intuitive sense for where the American center was and that would be a better center for the Republicans to return to.",

        "The committees would be public, the budget would be balanced.",
        "Those were the conservative issues the Republicans won on.",

        "Democrats are ironically, David writes, now the more centrist party and a party more devoted to the Republican Contract with America.",
        "Well, I do think the Democratic Party is the more centrist party ideologically.",
        "But I think that the very important point that's being made has to do with the importance of reform.",
        "Republicans - it's true - Republicans won in 1994 because of the promise of reform.",
        "That was very, very important to them.",
        "Now it turns out that this issue of corruption and reform is very important to the Democrats' victory.",
        "Success the Democrats will have will be very much connected to whether they are seen to keep faith with that desire for reform and not slip back into the bad old ways of Washington.",
        "That's why I think it's critically important that they do something really aggressive on lobbying rules, on things like gerrymandering, on campaign finance, and not - for goodness sakes - not just recreate the relationship with K Street that Tom Delay and the Republicans had with a new group of Democrats.",
        "If they do that, the American people will feel betrayed and Republicans will be poised for a comeback, particularly with John McCain, who of course is associated with this idea of political reform.",
