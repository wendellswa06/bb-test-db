        "Is there any profile you can draw that will include both Mohamed Atta and Timothy McVeigh?",
        "It's unlikely that you can draw that profile, but I suspect that if you were trying, it would involve not physical characteristics, but characteristics of mental belief--kind of an adherence to fanaticism, if you will--which, of course, is an extremely hard thing to see when you're looking at a man on the street.",

        "There are certainly are limits.",
        "You want to be as effective as possible.",
        "There is a connection--certainly both are male.",
        "The problem, of course, with saying `We're only going to be looking for males if we're looking for suicide bombers or terrorists' is that that's not going to work since we know the Chechnya terrorists have also used female suicide bombers.",
        "What does the law permit where profiling is concerned?",
        "Well, certainly there is the 14th Amendment, which prohibits intentional discrimination.",
        "And to the extent that a law enforcement officer is equating race or ethnicity or religion with increased criminality, that is discrimination and would be illegal.",
        "So you have both the 14th Amendment and then you also have the Fourth Amendment, which requires officers engaging in police activity to have a reasonable suspicion for a stop or for arrest: probable cause.",
        "And there again, you need to assess whether the information that the officer is using to make his stop, or deciding who to stop and who to interact with, was reasonable.",
        "Yeah, I would agree.",
        "I guess I would overlay onto that only that there's a structure of foreign counterintelligence, foreign counterterrorism under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that structure the times at which police officers or law enforcement officers or intelligence officers may interact with people to a different standard.",
        "It's not probable cause to believe that there's a crime or a reasonable suspicion.",
        "It's more probably cause to believe that somebody is an agent of a foreign power, which relates to their external affiliations.",
        "But again, that by itself, I think, really doesn't turn on physical characteristics; this tends to turn much more on things we know about a person or a group of people who are suspected of connections to overseas groups like al-Qaeda."
