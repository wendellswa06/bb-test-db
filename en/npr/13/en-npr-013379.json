        "But how does a free society prevent its liberties from being taken advantage of by people who want to destroy it?",
        "I think probably the best way to do that is by an expansion and a encouragement of our values in societies in the world.",
        "And so to the extent that we are a freedom-based and a freedom-loving society--to the extent that we put a great deal of emphasis on civil liberties and civil rights--when we, I think, promote those ideals in the world, I think that is helpful--much better than the sense that Muslim communities, Arab communities might have that they are being targeted because of their ethnicity.",

        "Now no sheriff who's acting on somebody's so-called tip can know his history.",
        "But it raises a real question.",
        "I'm sure that he felt terrible, but it would have been utterly irresponsible of the South Dakota sheriff not to respond if, in fact, somebody said, `I think I see somebody who I've seen on the TV from London.",
        "I mean, you know, to--for this sheriff not to do that would be irresponsible.",
        "It seems to me that those who are the receiving end sort of have to at least acknowledge some of the bona fides on the other side.",
        "Does a citizen who's stopped for scrutiny have any rights at that point?",
        "I mean, they have rights if it gets into court, but, I mean, do they--can they say, `I refuse to be searched.",
        "I won't walk down the street.",
        "I refuse to let you search me.'",
        "If someone's stopped by a law enforcement official, by a police officer, generally in many states they do have to provide identification and answer questions if the officer has a reasonable basis for making that stop.",
        "And is there such a thing as an unreasonable question, somebody who's just fishing?",
        "Is there a difference between someone who says--between an officer who says `Oh, you're a student.",
        "Where are you a student?'--and they might have to demonstrate that--and someone who would say, `Are you a devout Muslim?'",
        "It's actually the way you phrase this question brought to mind an interesting case that's proceeding out in California.",
        "A man named Gilmore has sued for the right to travel on airplanes without showing a government ID--in essence, asserting a right to travel anonymously.",

        "But it's kind of the very extreme end of testing that question.",
        "Do you we have a right to go through life anonymously?",
