        "There are other people in our neighborhood who have bought homes who don't care, and we're seeing some of the problems that we thought we had vanquished years ago starting to creep back in - you know, trash, homes not being taken care of, crime element moving back in because we're in the city.",
        "And it's very disheartening.",
        "There are folks who have purchased some of these homes and have restored them, not renovated them, restored them to their absolute original beauty, and they're having a very difficult time selling them.",
        "Chris Arnold, this seems to be a description of the downside of what you were just describing.",
        "Right, you know, it's good to buy up homes so they're not sitting there vacant.",
        "But if the person who buys them or the investment group that buys them, if they're sitting maybe not even in the same city, they're across the country or something, and you've got absentee landlords who it sounds like in this case aren't paying a lot of attention to how the properties are being cared for or who's renting them - I don't know who is the owner, whether it is a little guy or a big investment fund in this case, but you know, certainly you've got - another thing this brings up too is neighborhoods in transition are vulnerable coming out of a housing crash, that in some neighborhoods, you know, people were buying up property, the neighborhood was getting better, there was just a great diversity, all kinds of people living there.",

        "Of course you've got to keep in mind that, you know, we're still probably 40 percent of what we were back when, you know, the market was going really, really well, maybe too well.",
        "A lot of places would say 27 percent, we'll take it.",
        "A lot of people would be very happy with that.",
        "And housing starts are up about 26 percent over the same period a year ago, and that's also, you know, that's good news as well.",
        "Any speculation as to why?",
        "Well, a couple different things.",
        "One is the economy is better.",
        "Obviously buying a house is a pretty big economic decision for anyone, and if they feel more confident about the economy, that helps a lot.",
        "More people are working, you know, those sorts of things.",
        "We have - and Asheville is a great place to live.",
        "We have a lot of people who move here to retire.",
        "And so they are especially affected by the value of their investments, i.e., the stock market, whether they can sell their homes wherever it is they're moving here from.",
        "So as the market in Florida, the Northeast, has seen some recovery, as the stock market has come back, they're better able to have the confidence to come here and buy.",
        "Oh, one other thing, the weather helped.",
        "We had a very warm winter.",
        "How much it helped, I don't know, but you know, a year ago we had maybe not record snowfall but the most snow we've had in a long time.",

        "And so that first quarter last year wasn't much.",
        "So it didn't take a whole lot to get up 27 percent.",
        "Right, that's true.",
        "If you're batting 100, it doesn't take too much to get up to - you know, to improve your average.",
        "Chris Arnold, those factors, especially the weather, people said, you know, the statistics, those rather sunny statistics the first couple of months of this year, well, kind of inflated by the nice weather in much of the country.",
        "Right, in the wintertime you don't have as many home sales.",
        "People don't tend to go out and buy a house in the middle of the winter.",
        "So the seasonal adjustments, the error factors get magnified, basically.",
        "So you have a warmer early spring or late winter, and we take the small sample of data and then multiply by it by a seasonal adjustment factor.",
        "And so, you know, a warm spring or a warm late winter can throw off the numbers, and that's - there was some speculation about that one: OK, we've got this latest round of home sales data, it was little lower - is that what we're seeing, that maybe things aren't as good as we think they are?",
        "But if you look back over the course of, say, a year, we are definitely off the bottom in terms of home sales - things are picking up.",
        "And Mark Barrett, are people feeling pretty confident for the rest of the year?",
        "Well, you know, folks in the real estate industry, I think, always are confident.",
