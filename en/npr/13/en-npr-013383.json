        "But, you know, there are good neighborhoods in areas where the economy is still pretty solid, and by a good neighborhood, that can mean a lot of things, but a good school district, a place people want to live, basically, whether those are super-rich people or middle-class people or whatever.",
        "If there is a gravity to the area, if it's a place people want to be, those neighborhoods by and large, if it's not in the middle of the rust belt where some horrible economic thing has happened, by and large those areas are doing just fine.",

        "And I think that for most of those categories.",
        "Things have clearly moved past the bottom.",
        "It's still very early, obviously construction still quite depressed, if you will, but nevertheless permits are starting to heat up, transactions are starting to heat up.",

        "Well, those economies along the coast that are home to hiring properties, never saw the boom and so therefore are getting past the bust that much quicker.",
        "You know, we had an interesting phenomenon through this particular real estate cycle because it was driven by sub prime lending.",
        "And as such, it was kind of a bottom-up bubble.",
        "That is to say it was really those units at the lower end of the scale who were most inflated.",
        "And you saw a big compression between the high and low end in terms of prices over the course of the cycle.",
        "Well, now that things have dropped back to normal, the sort of price gap between higher- and lower-end neighborhoods had re-decompressed, if you will.",
