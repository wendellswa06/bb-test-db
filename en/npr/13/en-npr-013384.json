        "And the banks are telling me, well, they'll loan me and my partner the money, but they don't want to loan our company the money.",
        "And the reason, if I'm understanding it right, is Fannie Mae will buy the loan if it's a personal loan.",
        "But if our company buys it, the bank ends up having to actually hold the loan.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Sure.",
        "They want to get a loan that there's a guarantee on, basically, there.",
        "What's that?",

        "You're welcome.",
        "And, Chris Arnold, is money as tight as it was?",
        "I mean, in other words, those mortgage rates are really, really low, but apparently you have to be Warren Buffett to qualify for them."

        "This is interesting because what it brings up is the - what used to be called - and is still called, although it's nonexistent - the securitization market for mortgage-backed securities.",
        "It used to be that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are these two large mortgage companies that are now owned and controlled by the government, they guarantee loans so that banks will make loans, because it's uncertain times and everybody is underwater, or lots of people are.",
        "And so if the government is going to guarantee it, the bank will make the loan.",
        "If Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac won't guarantee it, there's almost nobody who will give you a loan unless you're Warren Buffett.",
        "So there are a lot of people right now who are running into a range of different problems, whether it's a business like this guy is running or somebody who doesn't fit into Fannie and Freddie's criteria.",

        "Interestingly, a lot of investors, about a third of all home sales are investors with cash, you know, because people are having trouble qualifying for mortgages.",

        "It's called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.",
        "It expressly addresses wiretaps during wartime and gives the president the authority to do warrantless wiretaps, but only for the first 15 days of the declared war.",
        "It then makes it a crime for the president or anyone else to conduct a wiretap without other statutory authority.",
        "And here the president simply ignored what Congress had said and went ahead and conducted wiretaps without any congressional authority and without any judicial determination of probable cause.",

        "There ought to be, and I think will be, an intensive investigation of this claim, and ultimately I think he has to be held accountable by Congress and by the people.",
        "What about the rejection by the Senate of the extension of the Patriot Act?",
        "What do you believe is the impact of the NSA on that and more importantly what will the Senate's position do to the Patriot Act if they continue to hold this stance?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, I think the NSA spying scandal had a great deal to do with the Senate's rejection.",
        "I mean, here we are fighting about the details of the Patriot Act, which actually sets forth and expands the power of the president under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to get wiretaps, and then we learn on the morning that the vote is going to take place that the president has simply been ignoring all the language that we've been fighting about and going forward without any authority whatsoever.",
        "And so this from an administration that has for years been saying, `Trust us.",

        "We won't abuse them.",
        "Trust us.",
        "Well, I think what the NSA story shows is you can't trust the government, and so what the Senate is now saying is we need to make sure that we have clear restrictions and checks and balances in the Patriot Act before we extend it.",
        "The president has said that he would veto just a three-month extension.",
        "Do you think that he'll be forced to accept that compromise?",
        "Yeah, he said he would veto John McCain's amendment banning cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment as well, and he was forced to back down on it.",
        "You know, I think what makes sense at this point is if they can't work out a compromise in the next day or two, which I think is unlikely, on the substance of the provision, which makes sense is to extend it for a month or three months so that when we come back in January, we can have a sensible discussion about what kinds of checks are needed and that discussion, you know, will have the benefit of knowing more about the kinds of abuses that the administration has undertaken in our name.",
