        "What is the difference, Stacy Smith, between an inclusion writer and a quota?",

        "You can only stumble if you're moving.",
        "All of us are sort of like chipped pieces of porcelain, working our way through this.",
        "And if she can feel that I can accept her as she is, and I can invite her to accept me as I am, and our church as it is; if we can come to that point, then I think we have a different way of constructing the dialogue than simply saying, I have an objection to the church on this point.",
        "It's just not a helpful starting point.",
        "Let me ask you, Reverend Baughman - in speaking to a lot of these younger people, a lot of them spoke about just in general, feeling like politics and social issues have just made them not feel good about any organized religion today.",
        "I wonder if you have some of those conversations with people in your community, and what you tell them.",
        "REV.",
        "MIKE BAUGHMAN: What I find is that the young folks I have conversations with, don't actually want the church not to take a stand on issues.",

        "The thing is, they're smart enough.",

        "They've read the Scriptures that talk about the importance of welcoming the stranger.",
        "They've read the Scriptures about the importance of caring for the poor.",

        "That the God that you present is bankrupt - I mean, it sounds like you have some real criticisms of how your religion has presented itself recently.",
        "Yeah, I think I do.",

        "I think we've shifted from caring for the well-being of the people around us, to caring for the spiritual well-being of the people who show up on any given Sunday.",
        "If what we're doing is creating a whole congregation of people who think just like us, then there's the danger we actually narrow our experience.",
        "I think one thing that makes Christian community Christian, is not so much everybody's all like each other but precisely when people are not an awful lot like each other, but find some sort of common story that unites them, that's beyond what makes them different.",
        "You know, hearing you say that - bring up the idea of creating a place where people all think alike - I mean, that's one of the criticisms about the Catholic church; that on many issues - abortion, gay marriage - you know, you can only think one way.",
        "You know, it's a place where I think differently, I can't be there.",
        "I can't be part of it."
