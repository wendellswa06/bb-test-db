        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "I'm Ira Flatow.",
        "We're talking this hour about noise with Bart Kosko, professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at USC and author of the book Noise.",
        "1-800-989-8255.",
        "We were talking about some of the benefits of noise, Dr. Kosko, and I needed to ask you - one of my daughters really seems to be able to work better on her homework whenever she's in a very noisy situation.",
        "Why is that?",
        "You know, that's a great question.",
        "It touches on a lot of research.",
        "But because noise is a form unwanted energy and therefore energy, it does tend to energize certain kind of systems.",
        "Well, what kind?",
        "If I could tell a story.",
        "I recently took the California bar exam to become a licensed lawyer in California as sort of a pastime or hobby.",
        "And it was a three-day exam and two of the days, the first and third days, were keyboard exams.",
        "The middle day was multiple choice.",
        "And on those keyboard days, I had brought earplugs as had many of the other hundreds of candidates.",
        "And didn't need them.",
        "Because once the wild tapping at the keyboard started, it produced a wonderful background sea of noise that suppressed other noises.",
        "But more than that, it created that effect we're talking about.",
        "It energized my thoughts, and I was very short on sleep as I think other people were.",
        "In contrast, on the multiple choice day, you could hear a pin drop and it was dull.",
        "I found myself wanting to fall asleep.",
        "I had missed that energy from the crowd.",
        "That kind of energetic background white noise, which studies show and the images we talked about before show visually, actually improve how non-linear systems work.",
        "That would be interesting - to make that translation you say the studies show visually.",
        "Are there studies that show that in a noisy background you do work better or things do work out better for you?",
        "There have been a few.",
        "There'd been others that shown that interference can harm things.",
        "For example, you wouldn't at first order want to turn up the volume in the midst of a surgery and those kind of interferences.",
        "No one has, to my knowledge, looked just for a noise benefit there.",
        "That is called a stochastic resonance effect, by the way.",
        "Other instances they have, but it remains largely unproven at this point.",
        "There's some research for anybody wanting to do that next paper.",
        "You seem to say in the visual side, there is that threshold, there's a limit, in other words, where they go too far.",
        "You muddy the picture instead of clear it up.",
        "I imagine the same thing in the auditory world is happening also.",
        "That's right.",
        "And in the book I talk about a formal result that I and some others arrived at called Forbidden Interval Theorems.",
        "Now that's a big name, but what it means is mathematically, as long as the average level of the noise doesn't fall within a certain boundary, as long as it's less than that or larger than that, you'll always have some kind of noise benefit."

        "And that's a guide we can use to see, first of all, whether a system we're dealing with, a visual system, an auditory system, can potentially benefit from noise and whether we're in the forbidden interval or not.",
        "And then once we decide that we are not in there, where noise will be a benefit, we have a variety of techniques that we can use to find the optimal level of noise to add to the system.",
        "Gary in St. Louis.",
        "Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "Yes.",
        "I have, when I fly I have a pair of noise canceling headphones.",
        "And they work well in just making it easier to pick up the sounds I want to hear in the headphone.",
        "But I realize they work by just basically making additional noise but in the outside frequencies.",
        "Are there any detriments to that?",
        "Whether, in other words, if I were using them alot, am I giving myself a false sense of security?",
        "And I realize possibly it's not helping hearing loss but I'm talking about other physiological detriments to loud noises.",
        "Interesting question.",
        "You're right that the way it works in principle is to build a model of the noise and take its reverse, its mirror image, and add it to it and hence to cancel it, and further it has to track the noise source, so it has to be adaptive, and by the way it often uses something like a neural network, the very system we use to find the optimal level of noise to add to a system we add here to cancel it.",
        "If you try to cancel a very loud noise, you'll tend to hear a background hum.",
        "And I guess in principle if that were loud enough, it could interfere with your hearing and other processes, but I haven't heard of any medical effects associated with it.",
        "Thank you, Gary.",
        "Thank you.",
        "You know, there have been - on the Internet now there are these places that will sell you a ringtone for your phone that is at such a high frequency that only people under 30 can hear it.",
        "You know what I'm talking about.",
        "Yes.",
        "Because we lose our hearing, our high frequencies, as we get older.",
        "And there are now even devices I've been reading about that people will put up outside a restaurant or in a public place to scare teenagers away by transmitting this high frequency, but older folks don't hear it."

        "Can you be damaged by a high frequency that you can hear that's very loud?",
        "Sure you can.",
        "And as you point out, as you get older - we talked about the comb that represents the frequencies - those upper-right portion of that comb, those hairs - a code for - high frequencies tend to go first, and that's often - what's often said, for example, why you can detect at a distance or get more sonority out of a man's voice than a woman's voice, because a woman's voice tends to have more of a higher frequency component.",
        "So if you're subjected to a very high frequency, even though you can't hear it you could still be damaging your ear?",
        "Yes you could.",
        "At some point, though, we simply don't have frequency detectors at that level.",
        "But in effect if you blew a dog whistle at that level, you could damage those hairs, those cilia hairs.",

        "Hi.",
        "I'll take this answer off the air because I'm on my way to work, but I wondered if the doctor had any opinion on the noise that the wind turbines cause.",
        "There's a lot of controversy about that, testimonials from a lot of people, and there are some doctors who have said that it causes headaches, dizziness, upset stomach, it can damage your ears.",
        "I am wondering if he has any information and if he has a Web site.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Thank you, Bonnie.",

        "Yes I do have a Web site.",
        "If you just type my name, K-O-S-K-O, it will come at USC, and you can, for example, look at some of these noise papers and see the images where we add noise and improve the system or the visual image.",
        "In the case of wind turbines, in general when you create power or transduce power, you do make a lot of noise.",
        "It does tend to be dangerous.",
        "It's not something you want to close to.",
        "Noise falls off with the inverse square of the distance, sound does, so to be a little bit close to a noise source makes a very big difference.",
        "I think most of those systems are designed with the idea that people won't be working around them unless they're OSHA protected, wearing appropriate hearing gear and other types of gear.",

        "Hey, thanks for taking my call.",
        "Hey, I've noticed lately that a lot of my friends, including myself, have a hard time falling asleep unless they have like a fan going or some white noise of some sort, and I just wondered if you had any comments about that.",
        "I'm the same way, Jeff.",
        "I use a fan to create a white noise effect, in particular to mask background noise, especially if you sleep late in the morning and you have a lot of car noises.",
        "For example, there are something like 90 million leaf blowers in this country and the number is growing.",
        "And impulse noises of various types can take over, but a fan tends to do that.",
        "It also, the white noise effect, if it's not too energetic, it can sound like a fountain, a waterfall.",
        "It does tend to soothe one.",
        "It energizes somewhat, but at the same time if it's not too powerful, it helps one sleep.",
        "Is there any link to, like, just the randomness of that, or?",
        "I'm not real sure why that happens.",
        "I do cite one study in the book Noise.",
        "If you have too much white noise at too high of energy level, it can damage the brains of baby rats, but that's the only negative I know of it.",
        "But we're not quite sure why that works.",
        "I've seen in some cases energetic white noise, the background hubbub of several conversations in a restaurant, will energize you and help keep you alert.",
        "In this case, a little bit tends to soothe you and help you sleep.",
        "It may just be the effect of masking other noises in the background.",
        "Thanks, Jeff.",
        "Our number, 1-800-989-8255.",
        "You talk about white noise, and we've heard that term for years.",
        "Are there other colors of noise that noise engineers talk about?",
        "All kinds of colors, Ira.",
        "There are pink noises and brown noises and black noises.",
        "That refers to the frequency spectrum.",
        "If you could wear special glasses like you see in some of the Star Trek sci-fi movies so that you could see the entire electromagnetic spectrum or a good chunk of it, and when you're listening to a sound, if you could see its frequency as engineers see through a prism they call the 4A Transform, then white noise would be the ideal case where the frequency is very flat and very long.",
        "Now that can't really happen, because it would have to be so long and so flat that there would be infinite energy, but you can get a good approximation.",
        "If it's, instead of being flat, if it tapers a bit, it tends to be pink noise, and that sounds softer, and in fact the human ear will hear that pink noise as white noise.",
        "But any noise that isn't white, we call colored, and if it has got a lot of bumps in it in the spectrum, it's called brown noise.",
        "Now there are many cases where we use brown noise models to model phenomena.",
        "For example, the distribution of temperatures in a city seems to fit a model of brown noise.",
        "And if the spectrum is really clumpy and jagged, we call it black noise.",
        "Now there are mathematical definitions of these, and they are not precise, they are fuzzy boundaries here, but we transition from an artificial ideal world of white noise, of a flat spectrum.",
        "As that spectrum becomes degraded, it gets more and more colorful, all the way down to black."

        "I'm an old guy that, you know, was brought up on albums and so forth, and I really don't like to listen to music these days on headphones at all, and I'm wondering, you know, with the amount of compression that all of these MP3s are using, whether that might inherently add to the, I guess, to sort of the dissonance of noise.",
        "I don't think the compression does, that's a different effect, but again if you're wearing a headset or ear pod devices, ear nubs, you're shooting noise, sound energy directly into the ear canal.",
        "It's very dangerous to do.",
        "If you do it at a loud volume, you're engaging in a high risk activity.",
        "You definitely should have your hearing checked at least once a year.",
        "Young people tend to be doing this more frequently than older, but all people do.",
        "And as we mentioned before, those who listen on headsets, one good thing about that is that you're not imposing noise costs on third parties, on others.",
        "The downside is you're hurting your hearing.",
        "By the time you realize you've hurt your hearing, it's too late to correct it.",
        "There's no known cure for that.",

        "And it looks that way that - again, it began with, say, rock musicians, and there are movements afoot from rock musicians themselves to help us become aware of hearing damage.",
        "But young people who listen to music at rock concert levels, which is about 130 decibels, almost surely have some kind of damage, and the younger you are when you damage your hearing, Ira, the worse it's going to be over time because you may continue to lose things through the aging process, but in addition to that you're probably going to be cranking up the volume just to compensate for the hearing loss in your youth, and you'll just speed up the process.",
