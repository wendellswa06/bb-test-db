        "Is there, and this may be a little bit far a field of your range, but talking about noise and isolation - are we in a generation where people who are in this generation are losing their interaction with the rest of the world because they're so clammed up inside these, you know, these ear pods?",
        "I think that's a part of it.",
        "One effect I've noticed, if you're standing in a checkout line, there are certain norms and customs you follow.",
        "Most people try not to look at the driver's license of the person writing the check, for example, and we all just bide our time, but when that cell phone rings and someone pulls it out, they are no longer in that little society.",
        "They're suddenly talking to the person on the other end of the cell phone, often quite loudly, and once they have crossed that line, you know, they don't seem to go back, and that sends a signal to everyone else that that's the rule of fair play now and it tends to only go up.",
        "I've noticed also when the airplane lands and people stand up to get their language is when the cell phones come out, and it seems as if more and more people treat others like rental cars here, that we talk directly and loudly about our personal events, you know, really not thinking about the noise effects we're imposing on others.",
        "It is getting worse, by the way, and I think at least in places like California, if that continues, it'll go the way of secondhand smoke and may very well lead to cell phone limits.",
        "You think we'll have laws against noise pollution?",
        "We do have laws against it right now, but against cell phone usage in public places, I think that's inevitable.",
        "If people simple won't tone it down, that'll happen, and again the unintended consequences as more people use these phones, it encourages others to do it both because you need to do that to maintain the signal to noise ratio, you need to speak more loudly, in effect, when everyone else is being loud, and two, you see everyone else doing it and so why not you?",
        "Is there a cutting edge in noise research?",
        "Where would it be?",
        "I think it is - there are edges in noise research.",
        "One would be in the case of canceling noise, and that's always going to be ongoing.",
        "But I'll say again if we take it to the very small level, to the quantum level, to the nanotechnology level, we have to learn to adapt to a very noisy environment.",
        "I did an experiment with some students.",
        "We took a carbon nano-tube, a very tiny piece of carbon, it looks like rolled-up chicken wire, the carbon molecule, and I used it as an antenna to recognize signals, and we showed that if you add very faint electrical noise, the kind of stuff that's in the background anyway at that level, you can improve how it receives signals.",
        "Now one thing you could do, Ira - no one's done this - but you could take those tiny carbon nano-tubes and use those to replace those missing hairs in your inner ear, in theory greatly improve it, to increase your frequency spectrum and make it more redundant.",
        "And I know there are a lot of research groups looking at that kind of thing."

        "A Pentagon inquiry made public today found that two months ago, Iraqi forces had come under fire from two snipers atop a two-story house there, so the Iraqis asked the U.S.-led coalition force to send in an airstrike to neutralize them.",

        "David, how could it be that neither the Americans nor the Iraqi fighters on the ground knew there were so many civilians in that building?",
