        "The target list would probably go well beyond those, says Jeffrey White, a former chief of Middle East intelligence at the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency.",
        "If we decide that we have to use force, I think we would go with a broader option, attack more facilities.",
        "Such as Iran's air defenses, ballistic missile sites, and the naval assets Iran might use to retaliate.",
        "Chuck Wald, a retired four-star Air Force general, says to do it properly, you would not be talking about a one-time strike.",
        "From a military standpoint, this would be a sustained activity over a period of time, more like weeks and months than days, let's say.",

        "allies abroad, there are serious practical challenges to consider.",

        "Did the researchers talk about why a country would want to get into the business of robbing banks?",
        "You know, according to the researchers, it's strange behavior, and I mean, really significant because, you know, nation states don't typically rob each other's banks.",

        "Again, that was the Central Bank looted by cyberthieves who took lots of money.",
        "And he said it's not an isolated incident.",
        "To his knowledge, other banks are being similarly attacked, small banks in particular.",
        "Part of the problem is small banks don't have response teams and fancy detection software like the big banks do.",
