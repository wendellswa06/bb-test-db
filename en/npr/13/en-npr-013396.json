        "It's basically a sort of \"\"get out of jail free\"\" card for as many as 2,000 people who are in prison right now.",
        "They're mainly nonviolent offenders, disabled people, people who committed crimes when they were minors, and mothers of small children.",
        "And it happens that the two Pussy Riot band members who are in jail - Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova - are both mothers of small children, so they should qualify.",
        "At the last minute, language was added to the bill that would apply to about 30 people who were arrested aboard the Greenpeace vessel Arctic Sunrise, during that protest in the Russian Arctic back in September.",
        "They've been out of jail awaiting trial, and possibly facing years in prison.",
        "We should keep in mind that none of this is guaranteed, because nobody is mentioned by name in the law.",
        "But critics have pointed out that it's very narrowly written, so it will only apply to some people and exclude a whole lot of others.",
        "And Corey, we actually spoke to Pete Wilcox, the American captain of that Greenpeace vessel, on the program recently.",
        "I mean, he was talking about getting his family visas in case he had to be in Russia for Christmas.",
        "I mean, when is the news going to come that these people can officially go home?",
        "And I'm Steve Inskeep.",

        "The law goes into effect once it's been published in a government newspaper.",
        "But prisoners who think that they're eligible have to apply to the prison authorities, and then they have six months to decide whether to free them.",
        "Pete Wilcox issued a statement just recently, saying that he might be going home to his family but adding that he should never have been jailed in the first place.",
        "You'll remember that these people were originally accused of piracy, and they spent about two months in some pretty bleak jail cells before they were bailed out.",
        "Yeah, the Greenpeace activists accused of piracy, and then members of Pussy Riot - I mean, their arrests caused an outrage because they were arrested for staging anti-government performances; and throwing them in jail for that angered a lot of people around the world.",
        "And might this be a way for Russia to sort of calm things down and improve its image as the Olympics are coming?",
        "Well, that's what at least some analysts are saying.",
        "And the Pussy Riot case would be a good example because the two jailed band members are scheduled to get out of prison in early March anyway.",
        "So this amnesty won't shorten their jail time by very much.",
        "What the Kremlin may be hoping is that this will remove their case as an issue during the Winter Games, so commentators won't be constantly referring to them as the band members still in prison whenever they talk about human rights."
