        "Late last month, he made a powerful case for striking Syria, only to have his boss throw the issue to Congress.",

        "Now he's in Geneva, Switzerland, trying to complete that deal.",

        "You know, the Syrian opposition is very skeptical about this issue, and certainly in no mood to negotiate with a government that's blamed for a deadly gas attack.",
        "Well, let's just remember there are multiple issues, here.",
        "There's chemical weapons, but in theory, at least, Syria could agree to give up its chemical weapons while a civil war is still going on.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, the opening remarks, Secretary Kerry got up there and challenged the Russians to really say that this is a test of their credibility, in a way.",
        "And there's also a big disagreement over accountability.",
        "You know, the U.S.",
        "says it's clear that Bashar al-Assad's forces gassed civilians on August 21st.",
        "Lavrov seemed quite annoyed at that, and about Kerry's whole speech at the opening of these talks in Geneva.",
        "Russia, you know, has blamed the rebels for carrying out the gas attack.",

        "Well, I'm wondering if there is an agreement that can be reached in that silence.",
        "Everybody, in principal, says they like the idea of Syria giving up chemical weapons, but the Syrian government is saying you also have to sell out the Syrian rebels and stop supporting them.",
        "There's this question of who's really responsible.",
        "Is there the basis for a deal, if the details can be agreed on?",
        "It's interesting.",
        "You know, when Kerry first talked about this on Monday in London, he told reporters that the only way that Syria can avert a U.S.",
        "military strike would be to give up its chemical weapons stockpiles in a week.",
        "He said he was speaking hypothetically at the time.",
        "And at the time, he said it was impossible.",
        "Now, as all these experts are here hammering out this issue, he and other U.S.",
        "officials say they do think there's a way to get this done.",
        "Obviously, though, there's immense technical challenges of doing this, as you said, in the case of a civil war."

        "Florida grew, I think, about 290,000 and New York only grew 50,000.",
        "And Florida's kind of reverted to its pattern of growth that it was experiencing before the financial crisis because after the financial crisis there was - a lot of migration stopped and so it's sort of started up again.",
        "And you know, also Florida had a lot of problems with the housing boom and the bust.",
        "Well, when you look at the gain of population Florida, is it mostly from migrants from other states, immigrants from other countries, are births exceeding deaths?",
        "What would you say?",
        "Because of the large population of 65-plus, Florida actually has a lower what's called natural increase.",
        "So in other words, its births over deaths is lower than New York's births over deaths.",
        "Both states have about the same number of immigrants going in from other countries.",
        "The real difference is the non-foreign-born population.",
        "New York had about 280,000 domestic migrants come in.",
        "Florida had about double that, about 560,000.",
        "And so I think that that really tells a story of why there's a shift."
