        "Yeah.",

        "I mean, he was - he had no background.",
        "He had no resume to offer.",

        "Eventually, when they didn't pay attention to him, his plans veered towards espionage.",
        "So he knew that he had to go to the Germans first, establish himself as a German operative, and then turn double agent.",
        "So after being sort of spurned by the British, he goes to the Germans.",
        "He says I am a Nazi sympathizer.",
        "I want to be an agent on your behalf.",
        "Of course, he really wanted to be a double agent, but he felt he had to prove this to the Brits.",

        "He was writing false dispatches about what was happening in London.",
        "He would go to a movie, and there would be a newsreel.",
        "And he would see some kind of ship, and he would be able to produce sort of a huge description of what the ship was capable of, what its secret compartments held, things like that.",
        "All the while writing these from Lisbon, writing what's happening...",
        "All the while writing it from Lisbon, taking great risks.",
        "I mean, had the Germans made one check of his sources, he would have ended up in a concentration camp.",
        "I mean, Lisbon was accessible to the Germans.",
        "In Britain, some of these communications were intercepted, and he was so believable, you write, that the British counterintelligence started looking for this guy.",

        "And the British were terrified.",
        "They were like, someone has sneaked past our lines and someone is in the heart of the beast, because his reports were so believable even to people in the country that he was supposed to be spying on."

        "But the final repair mission went off without a hitch last May, updating the old parts, outfitting Hubble with a sharp new camera, the Wide Field Camera 3.",
        "And astronomers have already discovered amazing star stuff with that new camera, detecting what could be the most-distant galaxies known to science, formed not too long after the birth of the universe."

        "A few hundred million years may sound like a long time, but that's actually pretty darn close to the birth of the universe, and so it's just very, very exciting they can do this with the Hubble.",
