        "He was creating a million-man army called FUSAG, which was going to be sort of the alternative army to the real one that landed at Normandy.",
        "Normandy would be presented as a faint, you know, provocative first move to get the Germans to attack it while the real invasion was going to come up the coast at Calais.",
        "So Pujol was the point of the spear in getting that information across to Hitler.",
        "He was giving them reports of huge movements of troops and battalions across England, all pointing towards Dover, which was the natural launching point for an invasion of Calais.",
        "There was also - there were fake destroyers being created out of rubber, fake airfields being cut into the English countryside and where real planes landed.",
        "So he was sort of the screenwriter for an epic film that was being played out right across England.",
        "What's amazing is that two months after the Normandy invasion, the Germans maintained two armored divisions and 19 infantry divisions in Calais waiting for that second attack.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean, General Eisenhower asked for 48 hours to keep the 15th Army out of his hair.",
        "That was really the standard of success for Garbo.",
        "But weeks and months later, those troops were just waiting for the real invasion, waiting for Garbo's army to show up.",
        "What's absolutely amazing to me is that, as you write, the Germans did not discover this deception until after the war.",
        "On July 29, 1944, they awarded him an Iron Cross for his service to Nazi Germany.",
        "Yes, they did.",
        "I mean, it was a source of endless amusement to Garbo and his handlers.",
        "But it was really proof of their success.",
        "And he kept that for the rest of his life.",
        "I mean, he was so proud of that.",
        "That was something that was really supposed to be given to frontline combatants, and here they were breaking their own rules to give it to a spy that couldn't be named elsewhere in their records but that they felt had been a loyal, fanatical supporter of the Nazis, when, in fact, he'd really been the opposite.",
        "The irony, of course, is just five months later, in another ceremony, but this one in Britain, he was awarded an MBE - a Member of the British Empire - for his real service to the Allied efforts.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I can't think of another spy, especially, who received high accolades, really, from both sides.",

        "She went with him for a couple of years but afterwards took the kids back to Madrid.",
        "They had three small children by that time.",
        "And Pujol lost touch with him.",
        "They grew up believing the cover story that he put out, that he had died in Angola or Mozambique in 1948.",
        "You know, they believed that for three decades that their father was dead when he was alive and well and living in Venezuela.",
        "So he paid a very high price for his service.",
        "He died in 1988 in Venezuela.",
        "He was running a small gift shop.",

        "A guy named Nigel West, who's really the dean of British spy writers, made it his life's work, really, to track down the real Garbo.",
        "And he found him in Venezuela, brought him back for the 40th anniversary of D-Day, and he walked those beaches where he'd saved so many thousands of lives.",
        "And there was a group of veterans, who were standing there with their wives and families, and they turned and embraced, and Pujol, you know, cried his eyes out.",

        "The site in Jordan is a hunter-gatherer site, and it was occupied by a group of people that we as prehistoric archaeologists call the Geometric Kebaran.",
        "But the main point is that they were seasonally mobile hunter- gatherers, and they did live at this site for a significant period of time, probably on and off for at least a couple of hundred, if not more years.",
        "And then after occupation of the site, they used it as a burial ground.",

        "And then, what the story goes on to say is, after 9/11, the whole world looked different from - when - inside the NSA.",
