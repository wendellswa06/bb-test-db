        "And so the story, again - to get back to Thomas Drake, the man who's going to be on trial - is that he was, to some extent - he was outraged by this and so were some of the others who worked in this program, because they understood it and they thought that Americans were being spied on in a way that was really unconstitutional and potentially a political tool that could be used for - in harmful ways in America.",
        "They thought it was - well, the comparisons they drew were to Richard Nixon, who, as people remembered, kept and enemies list and was not above using American intelligence services to spy on his enemies.",
        "Right.",
        "Drake, at one point says to me, you know, I felt I had to say something.",
        "We were making Richard Nixon look like the - the Nixon administration look like pikers.",
        "Now, there is another side to this story, and not just the government accusations.",
        "There was a rival program called Trailblazer, and some that you talked to - and, obviously, getting people on the record to talk and getting names and such at the NSA, this is difficult - but some of the people you talked to said, wait a minute.",
        "These guys, including Thomas Drake, were essentially the backers of one program called ThinThread and there was this other program called Trailblazer that got the money and the resources.",
        "They decided to go with that.",
        "And these guys were, well, very disappointed that their program was set to one side and this other program got the money.",
        "And they are just disgruntled people who were trying to discredit this other program.",
        "Sort of bitter losers.",
        "That has been, to some extent, the line that's been used by NSA officials on background - in other stories that's been written about all of this.",
        "In one sense, it doesn't make a lot of sense, because Tom Drake, who is on trial, was not actually part of the ThinThread program development.",
        "He just was championing it because he thought it was a good program.",
        "But he wasn't involved in developing it or inventing it or anything like that.",
        "So I'm not sure really why he would want to go to jail for a program that he wasn't even part of necessarily.",
        "But he did think that one program worked and protected the privacy of Americans and the other was a boondoggle for friends of the people who ran the NSA, and that was the one that they backed.",
        "And it ended up - and this is not disputed.",
        "It ended up losing nearly $2 billion and producing nothing.",
        "So - and also, I think more to the point, what worried these people that the disgruntled people in this story, interestingly, are all relatively conservative Republicans and what - and they believe in strong national defense.",
        "And they felt that the NSA was going down the path that was not smart in terms of protecting the country.",
        "And in terms of protecting the rights of its citizens.",
        "Well, especially that.",
        "And so you get these people speaking out in the story for the first time.",
        "They were kind of fascinating people to me.",
        "One of them is a woman named Diane Roark, who worked in Congress where she was the overseer on the House Intelligence Committee, who oversaw the NSA.",
        "And she finally spoke out in this piece about it and she was just incredibly upset with what she thought was an unconstitutional program.",
        "And she thought it was her job to try to stop it, because the oversight committee existed after Watergate to stop abuses of domestic spying and things like that.",
        "And so she tried and she confronted, actually, General Michael Hayden, who was the director of the NSA at the time.",
        "And there was this amazing showdown that I describe in the story."

        "General Hayden, I guess, responded to some questions, but have seemed to have, well, he came away with a different impression of it.",
        "Somewhat, yeah.",
        "I mean, he said he - I mean, he did confirm that there was this showdown.",
        "He said he only remembered the broad outlines of it, and he mostly said that the had warned Diane Roark, this congressional overseer, that everything was top secret and she better basically keep her mouth shut.",

        "And as this story evolved, well, the charges were initially brought during the Bush administration and the charges against Thomas Drake.",
        "And then, President Obama was elected and President Obama had said that he wanted to see a new day in transparency in government, but transparency in government did not extend to being any easier on alleged leakers.",
        "Yeah, it's been interesting because certainly people like Drake himself thought that Obama would signal a change in attitude towards these issues.",
        "And if anything, when I talked to experts on all sides of the political spectrum, including a conservative named Gabe Schoenfeld, who is in favor of more such prosecutions.",
        "They - the one they may agree on is they think that the Obama administration has been more aggressive in cracking down on leakers than any previous administration.",
        "In fact, I think there are five prosecutions going on of leaked cases right now, which is more than all previous administrations combined.",
        "And so there's a kind of - it seems to be an increase in activity in this kind of law enforcement.",
        "You describe a meeting at the White House between those arguing for more transparency in government and President Obama not so very long ago, where he seemed to draw a distinct line between whistleblowers, who are providing information that you can't get any other way, and people who reveal secrets.",
        "Once again, it's a vendor looking to collect.",
        "It was a very intense and responsible position, which I really loved.",
        "I got to arrange a lot of high-level board meetings with the visiting dignitaries.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I thought this meeting was very interesting.",
        "It was very end of March, and President Obama was meeting with advocates for more transparency.",
        "And he took the advocate's side up to a point, but that point was when it comes to national security, he is really against leaks because he sees them now as situations that could endanger the lives of American troops."

        "And I think maybe now as commander in chief, you know, it feels like this is his responsibility and he doesn't want to see lives lost.",
        "But basically what the transparency advocates said to him is you've got your cases a little confused, and the Drake case is really a whistleblower case.",
        "It's not something where people's lives were lost.",
        "But, you know, and so the two sides in the -the two descriptions of who Thomas Drake is and they are coming to this collision in the courtroom in June.",
        "And there is, interestingly enough, the investigation that led to Thomas Drake.",
        "His leak was to a reporter at the Baltimore Sun - then at the Baltimore Sun, now works for The Wall Street Journal.",
        "But in fact, the investigators were looking for whoever it was who may have leaked information to The New York Times, exposing this domestic wiretap program in the first place, looking for those leakers, and found Thomas Drake instead.",
        "Yes.",
        "And this is really an irony, I think, finally, which is that, well, first of all, you have to say is - almost all administrations hate leakers, right?",
        "I mean, they upset the - you know, they take control of the news out of the hands of the people in power.",
        "And they break a story in some direction, usually one that's very critical of the administration.",
        "So there are always these calls for leak investigations, and they almost always run dry.",
        "It's very hard to get to the bottom of whose people sources are in the news.",
        "And in this case, the Bush administration was furious when The New York Times broke the story of the warrantless wiretapping in December of 2005.",
        "And they vowed to go get whoever was the leaker, and they couldn't find the person.",
        "They couldn't find any of them.",
        "I mean, I think there were many sources to the Times.",
        "And so when they ran dry on that, they came up instead with Thomas Drake, who talked to the Baltimore Sun about something far less sensitive.",
        "And - but it was kind of like a poor substitute.",
        "Interestingly, one person has since identified himself as among the sources for The Times and that big story on warrantless wiretaps.",
        "That's Thomas Tamm, who is a former Justice Department lawyer, and who has stepped forward and said that he talked to the Times and he did it because he felt that this program was unconstitutional and a danger to the country, and he had to speak up.",
        "And yet he is not being prosecuted, while Thomas Drake, who is not the leaker to The New York Times in any sense, is being prosecuted.",
        "So there's a certain irony there.",
        "And you describe him as a man who is essentially being tried as an enemy of the state.",
        "Clearly, the government thinks these are very important charges.",
        "He's being tried in as - on one of the most, you know, serious kinds of charges that an American citizen can be tried on.",
        "He is being accused of violating the Espionage Act, which is, in essence, makes him an enemy of the state.",
        "I mean, it's about as bad as it goes for being a U.S.",
        "citizen.",
        "And, you know, his life, he spent it in the Air Force and serving the government, so it's really a difficult spot for him to be in.",

        "And so these are called transits.",
        "Kepler finds those.",
