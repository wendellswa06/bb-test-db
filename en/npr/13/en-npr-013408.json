        "Is that where they think these gamma ray bursts all come from?",
        "Well, a gamma ray burst in fact comes from a particular type of supernova, but these supernovae would be just a whole string of supernovae in the galaxy that would be separate from the one the gamma ray burst was given birth to.",
        "There, the new NASA administrator, Charles Bolden, spoke at the conference.",
        "Give us some take-home points.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, he was certainly very folksy, and he - one of the things he said was that back in 1980, when he was training as an astronaut, he said to the audience that if someone had told him then that we would not have returned to the moon with a manned mission yet, that he would have told those people they would have been smoking dope.",

        "Clarke said, many years ago, on, I think, maybe, let's say the 25th anniversary of the moon walk.",
        "He said: What's the most exciting -amazing thing about going to the moon?",
        "And he said that we could go there and not go back.",

        "But I think Bolden was, you know, giving some signals that, well, you know, we will go on to Mars, but it might be more gradual.",
        "We're going to -you know, we can't pay for big, expensive missions.",
        "We're going to need international cooperation.",
        "I think he was giving hints that we may not go back to the moon and Mars quite so fast, at least in my opinion, and we'll have to wait for what Obama says, I guess, in his State of the Union Address.",
        "But I think Bolden was giving hints like that, but I think the audience loved him, and you know, he was very natural.",
        "He was, but was he focusing on international space missions, or did he just mention that in passing?",
        "I think he just mentioned that in passing but saying that, you know, for big missions in the future, we're really going to have to find other ways to pay for them, and we're going to have to go with other countries to do that.",
        "Anything on upcoming, you know, on the Webb Telescope?",
        "Any mention of that, when Hubble is gone?",
        "Yes, in the sense of the fact that these candidate distant galaxies that they think they found from so far back in time and so distant, we are not really going to be able to examine them closely and confirm for sure that they really are as distant, until the James Webb Space Telescope gets launched in 2014.",
        "Hubble found these distant galaxies, or these candidate distant galaxies, looking at them at just one infrared wavelength.",
        "And James Webb is a much bigger telescope, and it's going to look at several infrared wavelengths at these same objects and really confirm not just that they exist, but how massive are they?",
        "Do they have a black hole at their center?",
        "All kinds of things which we really are dying to know because this is just the earliest moments of galaxy formation in the universe.",
        "But it's also remarkable what we've done already.",
        "Well, it sounds like a good time was had by all at this meeting."

        "And it wasn't until we had fully exposed the skeleton and done a very detailed, comparative morphological analysis.",
        "So looking at the features of the bones themselves and comparing it to modern and extinct canids in the region that we discovered it was indeed a red fox.",
        "Now, domestic dogs are descendent from wolves, isn't that right?",
        "I mean, these ancient people, if they had foxes, that's a whole different thing.",
        "So what we are suggesting is that perhaps when people were beginning to domesticate animals, fox may actually have been one of a number of species that people attempted to domesticate before they kind of settled with the dog as man's best friend.",
        "What makes you think it was a pet as opposed to some sort of a - maybe a totem animal or something that was indicative of the tribe these people belonged to or something?"

        "It is a big deal.",
        "I think the most significant things that comes from this site is that not only are we seeing these very early relationships between humans and other animals, but it also highlights a continuity in some of the practices, for example, mortuary practices, through time.",
