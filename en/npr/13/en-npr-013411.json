        "Well what we're learning now, because part of the reason that these medications are being prescribed like they are, we got into the brain during the decade of the brain and we are now producing medications that we actually know what they are doing and where they go as opposed to just sort of guessing.",

        "Psychiatry, if you look historically, we used to have problems of mental retardation called phenylketonuria, a genetic disorder that absolutely causes brain chemistry problems because the brain, the body cannot metabolize phenylalanine which is an amino acid that's commonly occurring in food.",
        "So if you pick up a diet cola, it says warning, phenylketonurics don't use this product, it's got phenylalanine in it and your body can't digest it.",
