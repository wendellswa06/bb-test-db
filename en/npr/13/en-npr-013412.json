        "Well first I want to just say, it's so wonderful to be doing this program because we really do need to raise awareness about how important mental health is, especially in the African-American community...",
        "Yes.",
        "And thank you so much, Dr. Bell, for all of your work and for being so clear and articulate and historically present.",
        "I mean this is a critical discussion.",
        "I grew up like many people in my generation, as a child of divorce, moving back and forth between different communities.",
        "And I think that created in me a kind of fragmented sense of self.",
        "And as a result I had serious social anxieties about how to behave in different cultural environments, how to negotiate who I was in relation to other people.",
        "I also had a hereditary predisposition to depression.",
        "It's, you know, run in my family for generations, untreated.",
        "And at a certain point, I realized that I needed support and that I had been in therapy you know, to work through some of my familial issues.",
        "But after years of therapy, there was a sense that I was, I kept going back to the same issues and going over them and over them and I was kind of reifying the wound rather than finding a solution.",
        "And I decided, after much consternation, because depression is still so stigmatized and we are supposed to be able to just work it out on some level -but because as an African-American woman, a mixed race woman, I was raised to believe that you know, we've overcome so much, you know, why, you know, we shouldn't need to get any help.",
        "You know, on my father's side we lived through the Holocaust.",
        "On my mother's side, we lived through slavery, you know.",
        "If they could get through all of that, growing up the way I did, you know, please, you know, I had an easy life.",
        "You don't have any problems compared to - that mentality.",
        "Right, exactly.",
        "Yes.",
        "So I finally decided to go to a psychiatrist, and he was really wonderful, very good.",
        "He was a very diagnostician - however you say that.",
        "I think the diagnosis aspect of psychiatry is so important, and it's such an important skill, and we started to work together, and through medication, I began to feel, you know, like a normal, stable human being, and that, you know, was a very important aspect of my development.",
        "And you got into a relationship with a man who has become your life partner, became pregnant, and then you had to face this question: Do I continue medication while I'm pregnant?",
        "How stressful was that conversation you had to have with yourself and your doctor, and how did you finally make the decision?",
        "Oh, it was brutal.",
        "I mean...",
        "It's a big question."

        "It was terrible, and I agonized over it.",
        "I, you know, talked very intensely with my doctor and my partner about all the different antidepressants and which I could take that would be the least potentially damaging to my infant, you know, my newborn, the baby that was growing inside of me and which would be best for me at the same time.",
        "Because I finally had to admit to myself that there was the chance that if I just stopped taking my antidepressants that I would fall into a depression that would make me not want the baby at all and not be able to have a healthy relationship with him.",
        "And so I had to really decide that my mental health was as important as his biological health, and so I made certain trade-offs.",
        "You know, I stayed on my medication throughout the pregnancy, but then when it was time to nurse, I decided that I could only expose him to my milk, which had very small traces, but still I felt I could only expose him for a few months, in terms of my conscience, and then I would have to switch over to formula because I wanted to find some kind of balance.",
        "But it was a very, very difficult decision and one I still grapple with, you know, because the drug I was on has a slight chance of creating seizures in children who were exposed to it in the womb.",
        "And whenever I see my son getting a little bit hyper, you know, I always think oh, you know.",
        "You know?",
        "I'm always scanning...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But so far so good.",
        "Well he's a beautiful, wonderful child.",
        "He does get a little hyper, and who knows if that's traces of the medicine or it's just he's a normal three-year-old.",
        "Yeah, it's probably toddlerhood and you know.",
        "But yeah, I do have to say that I wonder.",
        "Well, Dr. Bell, have you ever had to lead people through these kinds of discussions?",
        "Oh yeah, are you kidding?",
        "Yeah, it's hard.",
        "It's a hell of a decision to make.",
        "You talk to the person about it because, you know, you've got to - you can't be the boss of somebody.",
        "You've got to do informed consent.",
        "So, you know, all this paranoia that black folk have about Tuskegee, and - doctors are scared of two things: hurting somebody, which is number one, and being sued.",
        "And as a result - plus, we didn't go to medical school to hurt people, you know."

        "So you talk to people, and you just heard a beautiful explanation of thinking about it and trying to figure it out.",
        "The patients that I have had to do that with, I've seen - as a matter of fact, one of their children came in here who is now in the Ph.D. psychology problem, that had grown up and walked in my office talking about I remember seeing you when I was five years old.",
        "But first, to the story of one of those 15 million.",
        "Her name is Cyndi Norton.",
        "And not too long ago, she worked as an administrative assistant at the Rand Corporation in Southern California.",
        "It scared me to death, you know, but she was doing fine.",
        "So I've never seen -and I've looked, mind you - in the children who I've been treating with antidepressant medications and other medications.",
        "The biggest worry, of course, are the mood stabilizers, the anti-convulsive mood stabilizers, in terms of pregnancy.",
        "Give me a quick example of a couple of drugs that would fall in that category.",
        "Well, any drugs that people use to treat manic-depressive illness or bipolar disorder.",
        "Those have a higher risk.",
        "Well, let me go back to Rebecca.",
        "We don't have much time left for - between the both of you, but Rebecca, I want you to give me a sense of what else you think can be done to keep yourself mentally healthy.",
        "I know that you're someone who has spent a lot of time with spirituality.",
        "What else do you think keeps you centered?",
        "Very good question.",
        "I've always been - well, for the last 15 years, I've been a student of Buddhism, and that has helped a great deal.",
        "The tradition that I have studied, Vajrayana Buddhism, is really about being able to move into the parts of your mind that are wild, that fluctuate, that are unstable, and to exercise the muscle that stabilizes them, that can kind of remind you that underneath all of that static, there is, indeed, a calm that you can access at any time.",
        "Outstanding.",
        "And that's - yeah, I think that's what Dr. Bell is talking about, how to begin to retrain or to train that front part of your mind to interact with the reptilian, you know, so that you can actually forge new synapses -this idea that we actually can work inside of our mind to change the way that it reacts.",
        "Change it from the inside.",
        "Dr. Bell, I have to ask Dr. Bell just quickly, almost out of time, what advice would you give someone who is seeking help?"
