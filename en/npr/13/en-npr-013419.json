        "On Sunday, President Bush again defended his administration's use of electronic surveillance on Americans without court approval.",
        "The president maintained that the program is critical to detect terrorist attacks before they happen, that it only tracks people with known links to al-Qaeda, and only intercepts messages where one end of the conversation is overseas.",
        "The New York Times report on the program generated enormous controversy.",
        "Later this month, the Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to hold hearings on the legality of this program and the Justice Department has started an investigation into the source of the leak.",
        "But it's also hard to figure out exactly what is going on.",
        "The program does have a code name, for example, but it's secret.",
        "Since the story broke last month, many suspect the program is actually far broader than what the White House described.",
        "A follow-up story in The Times reported that the National Security Agency has been working with telecommunications companies to sweep up vast amounts of telephone and Internet traffic, not to track individual calls or e-mails, but to search for patterns of suspicious behavior in a technique called data mining.",
        "Later in the program, an investigation into congressional corruption gains a star witness as lobbyist Jack Abramoff pleads guilty and agrees to cooperate with prosecutors.",
        "But first, the technology of electronic espionage.",
        "If you have questions about what the NSA is doing, how they're doing it or how the information is being used, give us a call.",
        "Our number here in Washington is (800) 989-8255.",
        "That's (800) 989-TALK.",

        "Nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Nice to be here, Neal.",
        "First of all, I mean, what do we actually know for sure about what the NSA is doing?",
        "Well, we know what we've been able to read in The Times, and The Times has itself mentioned that it hasn't reported everything that it knows.",
        "Initially it looked as if the NSA was undertaking, without warrants, the surveillance of approximately 500 people at any given time, 500 calls or e-mail addresses.",
        "But as the story broke, it became apparent that as part of this program, the NSA was engaging in data mining."

        "This is just the latest distraction Penn has caused the Clinton campaign.",

        "Well, he's the chief strategist for the Clinton campaign - he was.",
        "He certainly created the strategy that focused on her strength and experience.",
        "He also happens to be at the very same time the CEO and president of Burson-Marsteller, which is a global public relations giant.",
        "And in that capacity, he met with the Colombian ambassador to help plan a strategy to promote a Colombian free-trade deal that Hillary Clinton opposes.",
        "After that meeting, he said it was an error in judgment.",
        "The Colombian government promptly fired Burson-Marsteller and then he also was fired by the Clinton campaign.",
        "Now, Mara, by this - by way of explanation, is it unusual for someone to be the top strategist for a presidential campaign while also running a public relations firm, particularly a public relations firm that represents clients that take positions that are oppositional to the candidate that they represent?",
        "That's the problem here.",
        "There are many consultants who also have private clients.",

        "George W.",
        "Bush, however, in 2000, when he hired Karl Rove, insisted that Rove give up all his other clients.",
        "Okay, so what does this mean for the Clinton campaign now that Mark Penn is gone?",
        "Well, I think it's almost more important that a guy named Geoff Garin has been brought into the campaign than Mark Penn is leaving.",
        "Garin was brought in about three weeks ago.",
        "He has very deep ties to the Democratic Party.",
        "Penn, on the other hand, has deep ties to the Clintons.",
        "And it's been explained to me by people inside and outside the campaign that Garin's job is to make sure that as Senator Clinton battles very hard to win these remaining 10 contests, she does it in a way that doesn't destroy the party or her legacy.",
        "And that could mean that we won't hear comments along the lines of \"\"only two candidates are qualified to be commander-in-chief.\"\" In other words, comments that seem to elevate John McCain over Barack Obama.",
        "And one potential sign of this possible change in tone is that right now in Pennsylvania, she is running a 3 a.m. ad.",
        "However, it's targeted to John McCain, not Barack Obama and it's about the economy.",
        "Now, Mark Penn will still do some polling for the campaign.",

        "And in that letter, Rockefeller, who was briefed as the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee in 2003, he says, `This sounds to me like TIAP, Total Information Awareness program,' which was indeed a massive attempt to glean terrorist, counterterrorist information by going through the Web.",
