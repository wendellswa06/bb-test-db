        "Well, what the British were saying to the Americans was what you have to do is you have to intercept traffic.",
        "Well, it's much more complicated now because in a world where most of your communications is going by broadband or less and less is going by satellite or microwave, it's much harder for the NSA to have physical access to these communications without the cooperation of private enterprise.",
        "And I think the very interesting aspect of this story is the extent to which the private sector has assisted the NSA in this program, because the NSA has had to get access to their switches.",
        "Again, we don't know what's going on, but is it reasonable to conclude that this data mining developed information about these other hundreds of calls that we believe that the administration was going after?",
        "Sure, cell phones also.",
        "It all--it'll come down--if you're talking about international communications, it's all coming down from this satellite.",
        "Now according to The New York Times article, they've also gotten access to key switches, and what that, to me, implies is that it was no problem picking up the information coming down from a satellite.",
        "It just comes down like rain and you just pick it up with a large dish.",
        "More difficult communications is that that comes through an undersea cable, and that's actually where more communications are being transmitted these days, or fiberoptic...",
        "Well, the way this information came out, it--no one's been able to bring it together to know exactly the relationship between the 500 calls or e-mails that are being surveyed, monitored at any given time, and the data mining operation.",
        "It appears that this is a two-step process.",
        "First there's data mining, which is a fishing expedition based on certain protocols and some inputs from intelligence services.",
        "That must lead to a smaller number of hits which do not for one reason or another appear to the NSA to rise to the level of something that could be--could achieve a FISA warrant, and those then are monitored without warrant.",
        "A FISA warrant.",
        "That's a Federal Intelligence Security court that's been set up specifically to do that, but you need probable cause to do that, and...",
        "And...",
        "...they may not have probable cause.",
        "No, you know, this is the part--look, there are so many aspects of this issue that are absolutely inscrutable at the moment.",
        "Not only the technical issues that the first caller raise, but also the reason why it was believed that you could not use the FISA, which is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, for these probable hits, because under the FISA, except where it's a matter of First Amendment rights, you don't need the name of a person, you don't need an identity.",
        "You can go after an e-mail address or you can go after a telephone number.",
        "My sense is that the data mining operation produces so many hits that the government decided, `Well, we just don't want to have a lawyer standing beside the NSA.",
        "We want the NSA to do what it has to do fast.",
        "And that's why they've gone ahead with this program which is illegal.",
        "Well, legality will be discussed at the Judiciary Committee hearings, and there are those, as you know, who argue that it is perfectly legal, among them the president of the United States, so we'll leave that question open for now.",

        "So again, are there any countries sharing data mining?",
        "That's a fabulous question.",
        "There is actually a tradition of that, not necessarily in data mining.",
        "In 1940, before the--before Pearl Harbor, obviously, the United States government couldn't legally open American mail, but the British could, or they could illegally, and what they was they opened all US foreign mail which went via Trinidad and Bermuda and shared it with the FBI.",

        "Jim, nice to see you again.",
        "Good seeing you, Neal.",
        "You've written the NSA has virtually the ability to get inside a person's mind.",
        "What did you mean by that?",
        "Well, when the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was set up to prevent previous abuses by the Nixon administration, when Nixon administration tried to use--do basically the same thing, turn NSA's big ear inward on American public, the NSA only had a small capability of really getting into people's lives at that point, because all it could do was listen to telephone hard lines and an occasional telegram that somebody would send, which was fairly rare.",
        "But today virtually everything a person thinks a person puts in the form of an electronic communications to some degree, either an e-mail at work, an e-mail at home, e-mail to friends, data transfers like bank transfers, medical records, cell phones as you're driving down the street or entering information into a BlackBerry as you're walking into an office.",
        "So there's this constant stream of information about a person going out in the form of electrons, and that's the problem you have now is that you have an agency that has the capability of eavesdropping on all that information.",
        "Cables, yeah.",
        "...transoceanic cables.",
        "And if the NSA has access to what they call a cable head--that's where it actually comes in--then they have access to all that information, also.",
        "So it's mammoth surveillance and that's what NSA is designed to do.",
        "It's the largest intelligence agency in the world, and its only function, its one function pretty much is eavesdropping on communications, breaking codes and making codes."

        "And when NSA was set up, it was set up to focus entirely externally at foreign countries because just like using the Marines, we don't use the Marines to attack people in the United States.",
        "We have police and FBI and we use the Marines to launch attacks against enemies overseas.",
        "So the NSA was supposed to be used externally.",
        "It turned out that the Nixon administration illegally turned NSA inward and began eavesdropping on American citizens, and that's why they set up this buffer between the NSA and the American public known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.",
        "So neither a president nor a director of NSA could arbitrarily or unilaterally make a decision to eavesdrop on Americans.",
        "There has to be this federal district court judge with a large list of clearances that would do it.",
        "But as Tim Naftali was telling us before the break, obviously technology has changed quite a bit since the Nixon administration.",
        "Oh, that's what I was just saying.",
        "It's changed a great deal in terms of what the capability is, but in terms of the law, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was fairly clear.",

        "Well, that's the biggest threat right now is the fact that you've got these two technologies.",
        "You've got NSA's technology--and just to give you a little idea of NSA's technology, an average listening post--and they have listening posts around the world.",

        "There's one in West Virginia.",
        "There's one in the state of Washington.",
        "And these listening posts will bring in about a million communications per half-hour.",
        "Now there's filters in these satellites and also in the computers and so forth that will eliminate all but about 6,000 of those one million communications per half-hour.",
        "And people in the listening post itself by tweaking the systems will drop that number down to about a thousand per half-hour.",
        "Now those thousand would then be sent to NSA.",
        "An NSA analyst would then put it through further analysis, and on an average there may be one message at the most that will come out of that one batch that started out being a million communications, because you've got to bring it all down small enough to be able to get bandwidth enough to send it to NSA, and then you've got to get it down small enough so that you actually get human beings that can actually read it or listen to it and make a determination.",
