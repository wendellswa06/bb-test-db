        "That is pretty much the way it does work.",
        "It's interesting because in order to find what you're looking for, you have to intercept the entire stream.",
        "Say it's communications coming into the country, that's information that comes down from a communications satellite over the Atlantic, for example, and will go to this giant ground station in Etam, West Virginia.",
        "That's the--AT&T's downlink for all those communications.",
        "And when this communication comes down, it's a very large what they call footprint.",
        "In other words, you can pick up those signals, not just in that one little spot, but miles away, and NSA has its enormous eavesdropping station just 50 miles away in Sugar Grove, West Virginia, and that's what it does.",
        "It pulls in all of that same communications, but it filters it through computers that are loaded with people's names, people's telephone numbers, keywords, and those that are loaded in, if a communication's come through with James Bamford or with my telephone number or keywords they're looking for, will be kicked out.",
        "It's much easier if you're dealing with data communications such as e-mail.",
        "It's much more difficult if you're dealing with telephone numbers.",
        "It's mostly--or if you're dealing with telephone calls, it's mostly telephone numbers and not actually words spoken.",
        "And cell phones as well as regular land lines?",
        "Let's get another caller in, Aaron.",
        "Aaron's calling from Ann Arbor.",
        "We are going to fight for every last American job.",
        "Hi.",
        "Yes.",
        "I'm wondering about the private sector's role in all this, because I keep hear--I've heard it a couple times mentioned in terms of that some of this stuff, they couldn't do it without private sector access, and I'm wondering--I'm partially wondering in terms of, you know, can--how much data mining could the private sector itself engage in, and--I mean, I'm just curious about the private sector's involvement in all this.",
        "I mean, is it to the--I don't--from what I understand, you couldn't just--it's not like sending a spy out to watch somebody in a public park kind of thing.",
        "No.",
        "No, there has to be a great deal of private sector involvement here, and my last book, \"\"A Pretext for War,\"\" I wrote a fair amount about how NSA and the CIA is becoming enormously outsourced to private companies.",
        "Half of the CIA now is made up of private contractors.",
        "So there's this merger that hadn't really happened until really the last half-dozen years where the intelligence community is becoming largely merged with the private sector, and there is almost no difference.",
        "So getting access to these--to the data, to your telephone records, to your computer records, your e-mail records and things like credit card records, all that requires some access to private corporations, and according to what I've been reading, they've been getting a great deal of cooperation from these companies.",
        "Aaron, thanks very much.",
        "You mentioned private companies and data mining.",
        "Well, joining us now is Paul Bradley, principal of data mining technology at Apollo Data Technology.",
        "He joins us from the studios of KUOW in Seattle.",
        "Nice of you to be with us on TALK OF THE NATION."

        "Thank you, Neal.",
        "Give us--as somebody who does it, give us an idea of how data mining works a little bit.",
        "It's similar to what the other guests have said.",
        "Data mining consists of a set of processes and computerized tools to extract patterns, trends and correlations that exist in the data set.",
        "These processes and tools have come from work done over the past 20-plus years in primarily three sub-areas of computer science and statistics.",
        "Those are the database field, machine learning and artificial intelligence.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Once--oh, pardon me.",
        "No, I was just gonna say, machine learning and artificial intelligence are two pretty immense fields.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And--exactly.",
        "These--the patterns and trends that are extracted by these tools tend to be mathematical or statistical models which are summarizing correlations in other relationships that may exist in the data, and the value that these provide to an analyst or an organization is in providing them with information that they previously may not have known was there or correlations that they didn't know existed.",
        "And then also could utilize these patterns and trends to predict what would happen in the future, say, if a certain event was likely to occur or not.",
        "Give us a for instance.",
        "For instance, if I go to a bookstore and walk in and I look at a couple data mining books and I buy one, my likelihood of buying, say, another math book or statistics book tends to be higher, so the event being, you know, buying a similar book.",
        "So this..."

        "And this is the tech--oh...",
        "This sounds like a more complicated version of what, you know, Amazon does.",
        "It's very similar to--or data mining technology is used in what Amazon does to analyze the sales data, and based upon what product people are buying and the similarity among sets of products people buy, recommending other books or products to people.",
        "So this is being more and more used in everyday life?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "You see it from, like you mentioned, Amazon.",
        "A number of e-commerce sites do product recommendations.",
        "Data mining is being used in telecommunications.",
        "A number of marketing efforts by large companies are driven by knowledge and based upon the patterns extracted from customer data and similar types of applications.",
        "We're talking about data mining and its relationship to electronic warrantless searches.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR news.",
        "And, Paul Bradley, let me ask you just a second about the use of this information.",
        "You've got a whole bunch of data and obviously the more data, the better for establishing patterns in searches and that sort of thing.",
        "Sure.",
        "Do you know what profile you're looking for ahead of time, or do you use the computer to develop a profile based on the data?",
        "Excellent, excellent question.",
        "There are two general types of approaches.",
        "One is more of an exploratory data analysis approach where you might not have a specific goal or event that you want to identify in the data.",
        "You want to see how the data might naturally group together, some properties of certain groups of data, things like that.",
        "So in that sense it's more of learning about what is in the data and then working with people who are knowledgeable about the data and how it's collected to see if a lightbulb pops in their head, see if they get interested in something."

        "Another type of technology called predictive modeling is used to--when you can identify an event of interest, you can show a computer examples of that event and also examples of that event not occurring, and these statistical methods will learn the patterns and trends which help predict whether the event may occur or may not occur.",
        "And what does Apollo Data Technology use this stuff for?",
        "That's right.",
        "Yeah.",

        "There are so--if you're just doing a broad search, there are so many that you're going to overwhelm any kind of analyst.",
        "So you really got to get a large number of keywords and get them as specific and unique to your target as possible.",
        "We primarily provide data mining as a service to our clients which tend to be national retailers, telecommunications companies and high technology companies to help them better market to their customers, help them to better understand some of the internal processes that the company has based upon data that is collected.",

        "And what makes it interesting is the technologies come and NSA is pretty much ready for the technologies, but then the protections--the encryption or the spyware, that kind of thing--follows later.",
