        "This is TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "I'm Neal Conan in Washington.",
        "Here are the headlines from some of the other stories we're following here today at NPR News.",
        "The federal government is assisting in efforts to rescue 13 miners trapped in a West Virginia coal mine.",
        "Rescue and safety specialists are on the scene.",
        "A robot has been brought in to explore areas in the mine that are unsafe for people, though apparently now they've decided to try to accelerate their operation and the robot will not be used.",
        "Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff has announced a list of cities that are eligible for the next round of urban security grants.",
        "However, those cities must first submit regional applications detailing how that money will be spent.",
        "You can hear details on those stories and much more later today on \"\"All Things Considered\"\" from NPR News.",
        "Also, Jack Abramoff, a prominent and powerful lobbyist, has pleaded guilty and is now expected to cooperate with prosecutors in an investigation of congressional corruption.",
        "We'll have more on that story in just a few minutes.",
        "But continuing now on our conversation with James Bamford, author of two histories of the National Security Agency, about spying and technology.",
        "If you'd like to join us, it's (800) 989-8255.",
        "And let's get another caller on the line.",
        "This is Dan.",
        "Dan's calling from Crestwood in Kentucky.",
        "Hi.",
        "Hi, Dan.",
        "Thanks for taking my call.",
        "Sure."

        "Got a question for you.",
        "I understand the gist of what I've been listening to.",
        "The voice recognition or the way you search for things is you're looking for words or catchphrases like `bomb' or `bin Laden,' that--if that's accurate, then all people have to do is substitute a code word.",
        "Instead of saying `tell bin Laden to bring me the bomb,' they'd say `tell Ralph to bring me the disc player.",
        "Doesn't that render all that technology obsolete?",
        "Guess that's all I have to say.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Bye-bye.",
        "OK, Dan, thank you.",
        "Well, that's, you know, a simplification of what's done.",
        "I mean, they don't use `bomb' or `bin Laden.",
        "It's much more complicated.",
        "It's like doing a Google search.",
        "You're going to use quite a few words and you try to make those words as unique to what you're looking for as possible.",
        "They may use a whole string of chemical names; these are the same kind of chemicals that might be used in a bomb.",
        "And if they find all those chemicals or an abbreviation of them or slang for these chemicals in one e-mail or one conversation, then they may kick that out.",
        "But it--the caller is, you know, exactly right that that is a problem and that there is so much out there, if you just put out, you know, a handful of words, you're going to be overwhelmed with too much information.",
        "They've also at various times captured computers used by senior lieutenants in al-Qaeda and presumably can pick up hints on what words to look for from them.",
        "What about disposable cell phones, which police have found very frustrating?",
        "Well, that's the problem you have today.",
        "When NSA was formed, they were looking at one big country that never went anywhere, the Soviet Union and its satellite countries, and they communicated all the time.",
        "They were always chattering to pilots of aircraft, ships at sea, military units, diplomats and so forth.",
        "Now you've got the complete opposite.",
        "Now you've got people that are running around the world, one country to another; they communicate very rarely.",
        "That's the whole idea of a cell.",
        "And they use things like disposable cell phones and untraceable calling cards.",
        "So that's where NSA finds itself, in a very undesirable position in this, quote, \"\"war on terrorism,\"\" unquote.",
        "An e-mail question from Gary in Panama City, Florida.",
        "`The activities of the NSA sound a lot like the FBI's Carnivore program which supposedly was halted due to privacy concerns.",
        "Could this just be Carnivore resurrected as a black-box NSA program?'",
        "Well, I think that's very accurate.",
        "I think the technology that was with Carnivore--NSA has had that technology for a very long time and has used it, but has used it internationally.",
        "It's used it around the world, not domestically.",
        "And the FBI did develop this system known as Carnivore, which was to go through domestic e-mails and data communications looking for keywords, key names, whatever.",
        "And so that may be what is being resurrected here, is some variant of that or NSA's equivalent of Carnivore being used domestically.",
        "Well, we've been talking about, you know, keywords and that's a part of it, but it's--the data mining is much more looking for these patterns of the length of messages and...",
        "Right, that's where you get the biggest danger here because you have NSA with this huge technology for--what Frank Church said was if NSA was ever turned on the American public, there would be no place to hide.",
        "And you marry that with this enormous data-mining technology where, you know, if you, you know, in the same week sign up for Al-Jazeera and go have a dinner in a Arabic restaurant in Washington, DC, who knows, you may be on the list.",
        "It has a very chilling effect on what people do.",
        "Should you buy this magazine with your credit card or shouldn't you?--because a record of it is going to be kept someplace and somebody is going to be looking at your pattern of activity.",
        "That's the problem when you have data mining, is that it doesn't discriminate against terrorists and non-terrorists.",
        "It can pull into its web a lot of people who do very innocent things."

        "And again, the questions of legality that the Senate Judiciary Committee will address later this month in those hearings, those are involving calls from--well, I guess the term of art is `American persons,' US citizens or people here in the country legally.",
        "Is there a distinction in the technology?",
        "I mean, the way the technology flows, do calls from overseas go through different systems as domestic calls?",
        "I mean, if you're searching all this stuff, are you searching through vast amounts of domestic information as well?",
        "There is some merger.",
        "It is very complicated technology, technologically speaking, but you have domestic satellites that handle just domestic communications and you have international satellites that just handle international communications.",
        "And a communications expert know which fiber optic links connect what cities and what microwave links connect where.",
        "So the problem you have now is that there is information that begins overseas, transits the United States, and ends up overseas again.",
        "So if somebody is calling--somebody is in Spain and they want to call somebody in Rome, for example, and it's 10:00 in the morning in Spain and that link would normally go through Paris or something like that, well, it's a very busy time, 10:00 in the morning, in Europe.",
        "And so those links may be all filled between Madrid and...",
        "Rome.",
        "...and Paris, redirected to Rome.",
        "So instead of redirecting it to Rome via Paris, they may redirect it to Rome via New York.",
        "I mean, you're only talking a millisecond of a time difference, but the problem is if you're eavesdropping on that communication between those two people, one in Spain and one in Rome, all of a sudden that call is now potentially a domestic call because it's transited, even though transited for a millisecond, a US link.",
        "And that's one of the problems that's being faced by NSA and this technology today.",
        "All right, let's see if we can get another caller on the line.",
        "And this is Serena(ph).",
        "Serena's calling us from New Jersey.",
        "Hi.",
        "I have a question about languages.",
        "I'm wondering when multiple languages are used in a phone call between two people, which would probably happen a lot with overseas phone calls, how the government interprets that.",
        "That's actually a very big problem for NSA, polylinguistic communications where you get more than one language being used.",
        "And it is very frequently used, especially with terrorists a lot of times.",
        "They're speaking several different dialects and it's a major problem.",
        "The two areas that NSA has never really been able to really solve completely is machine translation of voice communications and turning voice communications into written data completely because of the error rates and the amount of different ways people speak.",
        "Yeah, just check our transcripts sometimes, you begin to realize the problem.",
        "And so--but even translating stuff in time--I mean, I think after 9/11 it was found that they got two messages on September 10th saying `tomorrow's the big day,' but they weren't translated until the 12th.",
        "That's right.",
        "And if 9/11 hadn't happened, they might not have been translated for a month.",
        "The problem was NSA only had a handful of people that spoke Pashtun and Dari, which were the two key dialects in Afghanistan at the time.",
        "And language is a key problem.",
        "People in the United States don't grow up learning languages, let alone what they call exotic languages at NSA, languages where--or what they call low-density languages where the amount of people speaking are fairly small.",
        "Serena, thanks very much."

        "Interesting show.",
        "Thank you.",
        "So far the technology that's been described seems to be predicated on finding the presence of something that is there, but how capable is it in capturing the absence of any information?",
        "For example, if my friend overseas sends me an e-mail that says, `Thank you, Paul, I got it; thank you very much,' that could mean a lot to me, but it doesn't seem to contain anything that might trigger the data-mining filters.",
        "And I'll take my answer off the air.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Thanks, Paul.",
        "Well, what they'd be looking for is--in the old days they used to call it traffic analysis.",
        "They couldn't break a lot of the Soviet communications, so what they would do is look at the externals of the messages, where it was being sent from, where it was going to, what the precedent of it was, whether--was it a priority or routine, what the classification of it was.",
        "And you put all these little external factors together and you could start building a little bit of a picture of what's going on.",
        "You might not know what the message is, but you do know that this--somebody here communicated a short message to somebody there.",
        "That's right.",
        "And, matter of fact, one of the tests to join NSA a long time ago--I don't know if they still have it--was you open your--one of the pages in the book would contain a picture with a lot of different little islands in the South Pacific and there is smoke signals being sent from different islands, and then there's a series of questions saying, `On which island is the king located?",
        "Which island is the island that is the least necessary there?",
        "and so forth.",
        "And that's what you're doing.",
        "You're looking for patterns, and that's what they were trying to get people at NSA to do.",
        "And so to answer your question, it may not be the content of the message but, you know, was your friend in Damascus when he sent it or was he in London, and did your friend send it with a prefix or a suffix on the e-mail that indicated where he might be, in a government office or whatever, and how often do you get them and do you get them at 3 in the morning?",
        "So there's a lot of--these are some of the things that the government is looking at in terms of data mining and externals from the message themselves."
