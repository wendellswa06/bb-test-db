        "It's been more than three years since the earthquake and tsunami that triggered a meltdown at Japan's Fukuskima Daiichi nuclear power plant.",
        "As Time magazine's Hannah Beech reports, the country is still reckoning with the disaster.",
        "In the ongoing fight to prevent further damage, thousands of workers swaddled protective gear clock in every day at the plant operated by the Tokyo Electric Power Company, or TEPCO.",
        "Recently, Beech toured the crippled nuclear plan and witnessed the lingering devastation in the surrounding countryside.",
        "There is a 30-kilometer exclusion zone around the nuclear power plant, so nobody can essentially live within that area.",
        "And it's a really surreal place to go into because as you're driving in, it's almost like a Hollywood movie.",
        "These places have been depopulated, and they're preserved in amber.",
        "You see noodle restaurants - ramen restaurants.",
        "You still see the chopsticks on the counters.",
        "And yet, it's been completely untouched since March 2011.",
        "Now, the people who live there, which is about 125,000 people - most likely, for the rest of their lives, they will never be able to go home.",
        "You visited the control room at the plant where you saw evidence of the men that you wrote about, who were desperately trying to avert a nuclear meltdown.",
        "Can you describe that?",
        "Sure.",
        "I mean, just to get into the plant, it is - again, it's like a Hollywood movie.",
        "You have to put on these respirator-like gas masks, three pairs of gloves, two pairs of socks and then this, you know, weird hazmat suit that makes you look like the Michelin Man.",
        "And what was very strange about walking into this place is that it feels - it feels completely dead.",
        "You don't see that many people moving around.",
        "And those people that you do see, there's not a palpable sense of urgency, but you realize that the work that they're doing is so important.",
        "And they may not be getting the full of backing that they should to be able to do this.",
        "After the disaster, all the nuclear power plants in Japan were taken off-line.",
        "What is the status of nuclear power in Japan today?",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "So right now, 48 nuclear power plants are shuttered.",
        "The current government is now pushing to start up those nuclear power plants that can pass a higher level of kind of stringent tests.",
        "And there are a couple that look like they may potentially be able to come online soon.",
        "From the government's perspective, the costs of having stopped nuclear power have been expensive.",
        "I think the government's figure is something $35 billion a year.",
        "And from an environmental perspective, Japan's greenhouse gas emissions have gone up because, you know, you're replacing clean nuclear with fossil fuels.",
        "At the same time, I think public opinion currently, which was relatively pro-nuclear before the accident, is quite understandably anti-nuclear at this point.",
        "You know, there's been a lot of reporting about how unprepared TEPCO was for the disaster, in spite of what some would say was ample warning.",
        "With this push to restart the reactors, you know, is their faith from the people or assurance from the government that there are - have been enough reforms to prevent this from happening again?",
        "Unidentified Man#5: (Singing) Yeah.",
        "Happy birthday, homeboy."

        "Stem cell research holds the promise to cure diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.",
        "But there have been serious ethical concerns about using stem cells derived from human embryos.",
        "Those concerns have slowed scientific research.",
        "Today, though, a revolutionary breakthrough.",
        "Two independent teams of scientists say they can make stem cells from ordinary cells such as skin cells - and so no need for human embryos.",
        "Joining me now to discuss the new findings is NPR science correspondent Joe Palca.",
        "And Joe, who are these scientists, and they came up with the same conclusion independently?",
        "Well - yeah, pretty close.",
        "Shinya Yamanaka is from Kyoto University in Japan, and he had been working with this same procedure, but he was using mouse cells.",
        "And actually about 18 months ago or so, maybe a little less, he announced his initial results at a scientific meeting.",
        "And then he announced further results earlier this year and everybody was very excited.",
        "The other team was a guy named Jamie Thomson, who's at the University of Wisconsin.",
        "And the curious thing about Thomson is he's the guy in 1998 who first identified human embryonic stem cells.",
        "So this is like - it's like a bookend to his career, it's 10 years later, and he's come up with this really interesting approach to making cells that are, for all intents and purpose, embryonic stem cells, but you don't get them from embryos.",
        "So you can get them anywhere - from skin, from anywhere in the body?",
        "Well, the presumption is that with these four factors, these four genetic factors, you can transform basically any cell that you like - skin or what have you - into a cell that behaves just like an embryonic stem cell."

        "So obviously this would have big advantages, at least ethically, right?",
        "Because it obviates that whole debate over whether it's okay to use human embryos.",
        "Of course.",
        "That's one part of it.",
        "And the other part of it is that, you know, skin cells are plentiful.",
        "There's lots of them on all of us.",
        "And the other part of it is that when people started with embryonic stem cells from discarded embryos, it meant that they had to take a sort of genetic hodgepodge.",
        "I mean, a lot of times the embryos were donated anonymously, and so they didn't know what kind of genetic background they were coming from.",
        "But if you're starting with your own cell, they're you.",
        "I mean, they're Madeleine Brand cells, you know, and any stem cells from them will be Madeleine Brand stem cells.",
        "So the idea being - and let's just rewind a little bit and explain how this works - the idea being if I took a skin cell and reprogrammed it into a stem cell, it could then be used and put into the diseased tissue.",
        "Right.",
        "That's how they drew it up on the chalk board or the white board.",
        "And that's how it's supposed to work.",
        "But it's important, we have to make the point here, that now of these therapies that should work that way have actually been shown to actually work that way.",
        "I mean, there's many steps that are involved in getting the right kind of cell at the right time and the right place.",
        "And so the therapies say, well, if, you know, the heart cells are broken, why don't we just put in new heart cells, or you know, brain cells in the case of Alzheimer's, whatever.",
        "It's not that simple.",
        "But it's a very compelling idea that if you've got a single cell that's damaged and you've got an unlimited supply of replacement cells, well, maybe there's a way to get them in there and let them do their thing.",
        "Joe, are there any disadvantages to this process?",
        "Well, right now, yes.",
        "The way that these four factors are inserted into cells requires viruses and retroviruses, and those by themselves can be dangerous.",
        "And in the case at least of Yamanaka, one of the factors he's using to get these cells to transform or reprogram is itself a cancer-causing gene.",
        "So it sounds like big problems, but the scientists involved seem to think that these are problems they can work out and figure out a way around.",
        "So they are definitely problems in the short run.",
        "This is not 100 percent perfect yet.",
        "And so, Joe, we are not quite ready then to abandon all embryonic stem cell research?",
        "No, I don't so.",
        "I mean, it seems like that's where the field is heading.",
        "From the people I've talked to, the long-term prospect of this new approach is people consider to be fantastic.",
        "But in the short run, you know, there's been a decade of experience with human embryonic stem cells, and people want to find out how these new cells are the same and whether there are any differences, and as I say, get rid of some of these transforming factors that right now could be potentially dangerous.",
        "But people think these cells will become very important in the long run.",

        "You're very familiar with this debate.",
        "I'm curious if there are any other factions out there who even with the embryo question aside might still oppose any kind of stem cells in any sense, you know, thinking that it's not organic or manipulation of humans in general.",
        "Are there going to be those people out there that still say we don't think this is right?",

        "This research just doesn't involve either.",
        "And from the point of view of the people who have worried so much about the ethics for the past few years, this really does seem to be a solution."

        "The president has been very interested in the possibility of these kinds of alternatives.",
        "I would say since the spring of 2005, when his bioethics council produced a report called Alternative Sources of Pluripotent Stem Cells - I worked for him then, as you mentioned, and in presenting that report to him and briefing him on it - his response was just if it could be possible to have the ends that the scientists say we need and at the same time not have the ethical problems, that's the solution and that's what we ought to support.",
        "And so this is something that he's been hoping for a long time could work.",
        "Now, it's important to understand the president's policy, of course, is based on ethics more than on science.",
        "It's based on his view that the taxpayer dollars shouldn't be supporting the destruction of embryos for research.",
        "It's not as though he knew this could work, but at the same time his policy always had in it the kind of seed of hope that if you help science advance without crossing that boundary, it might advance in ways that would help people see a way around the problem.",
        "And that's what's happened here.",
        "You know, the achievement today is not the president's achievement; it's the achievement of the scientists who have been working on this for their own reasons and for reasons of scientific efficiency and not so much of ethical concerns.",
        "But certainly it shows that if you stand firm on an ethical basis in public policy it is possible for science and ethics to advance together and not necessarily to be opposed to one another.",
        "Because science is flexible, ethics sometimes has to be firm.",
        "What about the - all of the scientists who are out there who've been working for years on embryonic stem cell research?",

        "This wouldn't have been possible, for one thing, if not for the work being done on stem cell research in the past, really nine years since 1998.",
        "And so I think this offers them a new avenue to explore and one that involves a lot less political and ethical trouble.",
        "I think most of them will jump at it and will welcome it.",
        "Now, in California there may actually be a particular kind of problem because the referendum that passed there in 2004 that put a lot of public dollars into stem cell research actually says that those dollars have to be prioritized for research that can't be funded by the federal government.",
        "Now, this advance can be funded; in fact, it was.",
        "One of the two papers published today was actually supported by the NIH.",
