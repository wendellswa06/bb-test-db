        "We chose a few computer files that would just illustrate the range, but really, I mean, anything is just as possible.",
        "But we chose a photograph of our own institute because we're sort of self-publicists at heart, I guess, and an excerpt from Martin Luther King's speech \"\"I Have a Dream,\"\" all of Shakespeare's sonnets and a PDF that contained in fact the paper, the scientific paper by Watson and Crick that first described the structure of DNA itself.",
