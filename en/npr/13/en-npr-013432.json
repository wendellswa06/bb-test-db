        "So 10 years from now, it will be 100 times cheaper, and our projections are that at that point it's something you or I might be able to afford to do for information that was of great value to us that we wanted to keep on something like a 50-year time scale.",
        "And that's something like - you know, maybe that will be my children taking a video recording of their wedding and wanting to put that somewhere safe for their grandchildren.",
        "It will be expensive, but it will be possible.",
        "And if you care enough about the information you want to pass down through a couple of generations, you might choose to do it.",
