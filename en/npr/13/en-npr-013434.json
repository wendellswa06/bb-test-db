        "What were you thinking?",
        "You know, all three of the times that he was deployed to Iraq gave me pause for different kinds of thoughts on his homecoming, and probably the most - the one that is most poignant in my mind is the first one.",
        "The third one was certainly, you know, a great deal of relief, and he was going to be out of the Marine Corps by that time and ecstatic that I wouldn't have to worry through a tour.",
        "Well, then, tell us the first one.",
        "You said that was the most poignant.",
        "The most poignant was the first one.",

        "I think the complications of that and the anxiety that he felt, he literally would be walking across a room and pass out; not sleeping and some aggressive moments and things like that that were just very, very challenging for him, and really led to a life of, you know, not being able to have a productive life.",
        "And Derrick, how did that situation bear out on people close to you, other people close to you?",
        "Well, I mean, I'd gotten married very young at the time, and so we spent about a year together after the Marine Corps.",
        "Excuse me.",
        "And like I said, we got married young, and we didn't know what we were doing, and we later found out that we weren't in love with each other like we thought we were.",
        "And so that kind of, you know, coming back and not being part of the Marine Corps unit and struggling with life, that was a struggle with my relationships, and it has been since.",
        "To have lasting relationships with someone else has always been a hard time because there's a lot to deal with someone who's come back from overseas, and been in a combat situation because life is just different for us, and we - you know, there's a lot of needs that we have and a lot of needs that need to be fulfilled.",
