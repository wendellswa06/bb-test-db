        "And it was difficult - excuse me if I choke up.",
        "I'm an old man now, and I do that.",
        "So - but it was a different perspective for me as a man sending his own son into war and watching him come back and deal with the things that he has to deal with.",
        "And how would you say the two of you were different, Kent, and maybe how the same?",
        "Well, I think that, you know, different in the fact, of course, that I'd had, you know, 40 years between, and we left and came back from Vietnam, it was an unpopular, and for - and I would like to thank the men and women who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan for allowing us of the Vietnam era to be able to step forward and tell our stores now, but...",
        "Absolutely.",
        "As a father, you know, watching your young son - and I can just remember walking by the barracks doors, the same barracks, they haven't changed at all, you know, and reading the different names on the doors and the ages, 19, 20, 21 years old, seeing his own name on the door and then watching him pack his body armor and give me his civilian clothes.",
        "And the emotions that I had were obviously very intense.",
        "I just remember that whenever I get ready to leave him, and I put him around him, I start to cry.",
        "Yeah, yeah, is that...?",
        "He put his hands on my shoulders and looked me in the eye and said: Dad, I'm going to be OK.",
        "And at that time, I knew that he'd made that transition because for the first time in his life, he'd comforted his father.",
        "When he came back, you know, he came back after one tour, was home seven months, went back for a second tour.",
        "He now has some slight traumatic brain injury.",
        "He has hearing loss in one ear.",
        "He has partial loss of vision in one eye.",
        "But he's in college, and he's going to college, and just being able to - I think the bond that we shared is that of many veterans when they talk to one another but especially with a father talking to a son and helping him try to understand that to make that transition back into a civilian situation where he felt like that nobody understood him, especially in a college environment where he was with 18-, 19-year-olds who had no idea about what it is he had been through and what he was returning to and the adjustment that he was trying to make.",

        "I'm saying yes, yes to everything that Kent's saying there.",
        "You know, the difference is, too, that Kent knew what his son was going to go through because he'd been there, done that before, too.",
        "And I think that when they come back, and you know what they've done, and you know how they struggled to feel civilian again, that's really tough.",
        "You know, Derrick and I kind of skirted around the two years of his life that were the worst and the most traumatic on his homecoming that, you know, it's tough to talk about those things because I know that it changed his life forever.",
        "He's not the 18-year-old kid that, you know, I kissed goodbye on his way to war the first time.",

        "Oh Tracy, we're just very glad that you're here with us today.",
        "You know, I think that because they're always on when they're overseas, they're always in combat mode, to come back and then five months later be deployed again and then come home and five months later be deployed again, it was hard to get out of that combat mode.",
        "And things that seem normal to you and I are really overwhelming to kids that are trying to get their feet back on the ground as a civilian.",
        "And smells, sounds, too many people, things like that are triggers for them, that, you know, you and I are fine with it, but he struggles through it immensely.",
        "Well, we really want to thank Kent for calling and his son for his service, and let's take a look at the research looking into how service members are reintegrating into their home relationships, their romantic relationships, relationships with their own children if they're vets.",
        "There's less that's been - we've done but, but much less is known about what happens when young veterans return to live with their moms and dads.",

        "She is an assistant professor in the Department of Health and Sciences at Recreation at San Jose State University.",
        "And her 2012 study about young veterans' experiences of living with parents after deployment was published in the Journal of Contemporary Family Therapy.",

        "Well, our study was part of a broader study on veterans returning home after war, and it was led by Dr. Jennifer Ahern(ph) here at U.C.",
        "Berkeley and funded by the Hellman Family Faculty Fund.",
        "And one of the things that I found when we started having these conversations was really just how many young vets were coming back to live with their parents.",
        "Unidentified Man #6: For me?",
        "So we found three-quarters of vets under age 25 were living with their parents when they got from the military at least some time.",
        "Often they would start college, drop out, come back, live with their parents a few months, go back, get a job.",
        "So there was this pattern of coming back to the family home and then launching into some other time of their life.",
        "In California, we found that half of unmarried veterans under the age of 30 currently live at home, and given how many people do do that pattern coming back and forth, we think the number who live at home for some period is much higher.",
        "And I can't tell you why no one else has done this research, but I can say that within the military, the emphasis has always really been on communication with spouses and on supporting the family that lives at the base, and that's generally spouses and children and sometimes girlfriends or boyfriends.",
        "And so I think there's that predisposition from the military side, and so from the civilian side, that's where we're really seeing how the extended family - the parents, the siblings, aunts and uncles, all of those individuals - how they're affected and the incredibly opportunity that they have to support their young veterans who are coming back.",
        "Yeah, 70 percent of the Marine Corps are single men and women.",
        "So, you know, the support from the military is to 30 percent of the families that are married and living on the base.",
        "There's 70 percent that are out there that are single.",
        "And you also find in your research, Miranda, for a lot of these single young people coming home, it can also be a real net positive.",
        "Yeah absolutely.",
        "Overall, veterans really appreciated their parents' support, giving them a place to stay, helping them connect.",
        "I talked with one woman who said it was just helpful to be able to talk to her mom, find out when she was going off to an interview what kind of shoes were appropriate to wear because she had been in the military for so long that she had forgotten for a civilian job just how to dress.",
        "So there's that kind of day-to-day support that can be important.",
        "But then on the other side, as I think we've heard from Tracy today and Corporal Jensen and also from Kent calling in, there are issues with strain and conflicts, and these problems are particularly common when veterans return home with PTSD or other kinds of adjustment difficulties."

        "And I do think one of the things we found was once veterans and their parents had a common language to understand what was happening, so a diagnosis of PTSD, that kind of language enabled the parents to become tremendous advocates for their veteran children and also to take patience and really work with their child to understand what their experiences and what's going on for them.",

        "So what was it like for you coming home?",
        "For me coming home, I know the thing I remember most about when I first saw my mom, because I was single at the time, was I did not want - I hugged her, and then I'm like, OK, I'm ready to go back to the barracks.",
        "Have a nice day, Mom.",
        "And she kind of looked at me because I was trying to distance myself and go back to my battle buddies and my platoon.",
        "And I actually sent her home early because I just wasn't ready for the interaction.",
        "I didn't really know how to respond to an overly emotional parent and...",
        "How long had you been gone, Melissa?",
        "I was - I served during 2003-2004, and then I was out there November last year.",
        "I actually shut it down as well.",
        "So you just...",
        "Melissa, you're not alone here.",
        "I'll just share.",
        "We actually spoke with one veteran who hadn't even told his family that he had been deployed, so he had been in Afghanistan for nine months, and he told his brother to tell them that he was still on base in Texas.",
        "So I think there's a lot of hesitance to just share what you know is going to be extremely difficult and painful for those you love.",
        "And it goes both directions.",
        "I think parents often try to protect their children from their own emotional distress while the child is gone.",
        "And so that transition, that immediate time period is a point where, kind of, everything is bared open, and you see what is there and you kind of have to acknowledge it for the first time.",
        "It was, yeah.",
        "It was a lot.",
        "I found out when Jessica Lynch was captured, I'm actually blond-haired, blue-eyed when I was a private this time.",
