        "That's why it's so important that there was an intervention when Alyssa Milano started tweeting Me Too, and Tarana Burke had created Me Too 10 years ago, right?",
        "There is a way in which it is easy to literally steal black women's work and not feel anything about it.",
        "And I think it's important because we've laid a foundation around challenging patriarchy as part of the movement.",
        "And I don't think that three men would have had that at the center of their movement for black people.",
        "I think to me, when I first read it - at that time, 1986, \"\"Platoon\"\" hadn't been out, \"\"Born on the Fourth of July,\"\" all those things that gave us different perspectives in the Vietnam War hadn't happened yet in the film world.",

        "He was trying out and he came to speak at Harvard, and I had not - I didn't know from Steven Sondheim growing up in Chicago, but as I got to Harvard, everyone who has been listening to Steven Sondheim records were very sophisticated, so I had to get sophisticated, too.",
