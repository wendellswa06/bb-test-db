        "In particular, hospitals, drug companies and other health-provider groups agreed to take pay cuts in Medicare because they knew they would recoup that money through other provisions of the bill that ensured that millions more people would be getting private insurance.",
        "The fall of communism has a special significance for Arvid, because as a young man he became a communist and dropped out of college to work in a factory; this despite the fact that he was raised by working class parents.",
        "It was this decision that caused the rift between Arvid and his mother.",

        "Because there are so many civilian casualties, I think a lot of people are sort of scratching their heads and wondering why the rebels thought it was prudent to do that at this time.",
        "Right now it doesn't look either hand has the - either side has the upper hand in the city of Aleppo.",
        "It's Syria's largest city in the north.",

        "I'm not even sure they're going to get a statement out of the Security Council today because, you know, Russia's foreign minister will not be in attendance, and it's pretty much understood by most diplomats that Russia and China will continue to, you know, block any action by the Security Council against the Syrian regime at this time.",

        "I mean, for months I think they've been looking to the United States for some guidance, and yet the Obama administration, you know, continues to be very reluctant to get involved.",
        "I think everybody, you know, acknowledges that there's not going to be any kind of military intervention, you know, by the United States or NATO or any of its allies, but I think a lot of folks are saying that, you know, there are some things that can be done."

        "As you know, Francois Hollande, the French president, spoke about recognizing a government of the protestors, of the rebels, a provisional government, but some form of political recognition.",
        "And now the dispatch you just mentioned of talk between the French and the U.K.",
        "of the possibility of establishing a no-fly zone, these ideas have been about for a couple of months, but as the bloodshed continues in Syria, and there's a virtual stalemate between the Assad regime and the rebels and the opposition, the issue of the humanitarian dimensions of this situation, this tragic situation, continued to be evidenced through the media and to the world.",
        "And I think there can be a Srebrenica moment, where the international community, despite the more level-headed thinking in capitals of the unintended consequences of military intervention, that the international community may feel more pressure to act along the lines you've mentioned, a possibility of a no-fly zone, humanitarian corridors, buffer zones, and more assistance to the rebels."
