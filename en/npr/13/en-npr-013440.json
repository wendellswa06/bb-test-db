        "Ed Djerejian, that requires a unified opposition, and given the resignation and some of the accusations flying back and forth, that doesn't seem likely anytime soon.",

        "He is really insulting his mother and everything she has sort of hoped for.",
        "We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans.",
        "No, unfortunately, the Syrian opposition is quite divided - many parties, many individuals.",
        "The dichotomy between the external opposition and the internal opposition, in my view the real rebellion, the real revolt is in the hands of the local coordinating committees in Syria.",
        "The people who are fighting on the ground, that is truly the base of the whole struggle for Syria today.",
        "And there is not that close a linkage between the external opposition, many of whom have been in exile for many years, and the people on the ground who are really, if you will, literally bearing their breast to the Syrian military and, you know, really many of them dying and sacrificing their lives and their family.",
        "So there is not a unified opposition.",
        "I was in Istanbul several months ago and met with about 15 representatives of the Syrian opposition, and frankly I got 15 different points of view on various issues.",
        "I did ask them one question, Neal, that I think might be of interest to you, and I don't know what David's assessment is, but I asked a very embarrassing question to them.",
        "They - it basically took them by surprise.",
        "They, if you will, figuratively stuttered.",
        "I said: How large is the Muslim Brotherhood representative in the Syrian opposition?",
        "After a while, they came with an estimate of approximately 15 to 20 percent.",
        "They made the point that Salafists, extreme Islamic radicals, were a tiny, tiny fraction of the opposition.",
        "And I've tried to verify that figure.",
        "It's very difficult to come to any accurate figures on this, but that may be in the ballpark.",
        "Interesting, of course you have the Mohammed - the Muslim Brotherhood president in Egypt, who was in Tehran today and embarrassed the Syrians, also at the Non-Aligned conference and the Iranian hosts by supporting, full-throatedly, the rebels in Syria.",
        "But David Ignatius, this is a problem for, not just the Syrian opposition, it's a problem for those who would like to support them.",
        "Well, I think Ed Djerejian raises the question that U.S.",
        "officials are most concerned about, which is how strong is al-Qaida and how strong are jihadist extremists in general in the Syrian opposition.",
        "That's one reason that our intelligence operatives from the CIA and other agencies are meeting with the rebels on the borders is to try to get a better sense, who are these people, and do they pose a threat."

        "I heard some very interesting information yesterday from a non-American intelligence official who gave me a series of anecdotes about instances in which al-Qaida operatives who are there in Syria - no question of it, there are some hundreds of them - had been stopped by other members of the opposition.",
        "In two cases, the al-Qaida leadership had been killed by other members of the opposition, who said you do not represent our movement and had taken them out.",
        "So I found that somewhat encouraging, in the sense, that this is a rural opposition, increasingly - I'm curious if Ed hears this, too - from what I hear it's, in part, tribally based.",
        "The tribal sheiks are saying to their followers, join, take revenge against this regime that has killed members of our tribe.",
        "So the tribal sheiks are strong, as they were in Iraq, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to be swept away by al-Qaida fighters.",
        "Ed Djerejian?",
        "No, I agree.",
        "I think David's narrating a - probably the reality on the ground, albeit we all have very imperfect information.",
        "But the impression I get from my contacts is that the al-ihwan al-muslimun, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Salafists, the jihadists, they are not a dominant force in the Syrian opposition movement.",
        "The problem, of course, that we all realize, is that if the bloodshed continues, and it veers toward all-out sectarian warfare and Sunnis and Alawites start going after another, that the situation can be exploited by Islamic radical extremists.",
        "That's always the problem.",

        "Good afternoon, gentlemen.",
        "As a veteran myself in several different tours - Gulf War, Somalia, deploying into Bosnia-Herzegovina peacekeeping, Somalia peacekeeping and as well as three other tours, most recently - I would like to inject a comment very sternly that if America would take the role of leadership, that would be the galvanizing force, the helm of leadership to bring these various groups together and give them the leadership that they need to - as a cohesive force - to push out the Assad regime.",
        "And my second comment being Russia is in a very paranoid state of being in that they lost their sphere of influence over the last 20 years, ever since Yeltsin came into power.",
        "And this is nothing more than them making a very staunch and strong stand to thwart the freedoms of people that they desire.",
        "And they watch this deterioration, and they fear for themselves, as well as China.",
        "I'll take my comment off the air, gentlemen.",
        "All right.",
        "Two good points, Darrel.",
        "And I will put the first one to you, David Ignatius.",

        "And also, Putin certainly wants, whenever he gets the opportunity, to make the mark that Russia is still a major player in international affairs, especially in the Middle East.",

        "We're seeing now the destabilization of Lebanon, and we're seeing the wholesale destruction of the Syrian society.",
        "I think if we had gone in early and shown that we were not going to allow Assad to slaughter these people, I think you'd have had mass defections.",
