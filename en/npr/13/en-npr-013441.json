        "So I thought that was - it's a sort of crucial year for myself.",
        "That's why I chose it.",
        "And suddenly I realized this is big politics, because 1989 was a very, very important year in Europe.",
        "Because, you know, the Wall fell, the Soviet Union was crumbling, and so many things happened.",
        "In 15 minutes the world was changed.",

        "There's even a blue lives matter bill that was advanced in Louisiana even though there are already enhanced penalties for harming police officers in the commission of their work.",
        "So why do you think that evokes this visceral response from some people?",
        "When a group of people, but specifically black people - I think there's something about black people being visible or black people getting some threat of power that shakes up white people and their whiteness, that shakes up their experience of what should be true.",
        "I think there is a deep desire from even well-meaning white people to believe that they're not racist.",
        "But the reality is if you live in this country, if you're born and raised as a white person, you most definitely are racist.",
        "And you have to contend with that.",
        "And I think Black Lives Matter puts it in people's face to deal with not only the ways in which they benefit from whiteness and white supremacy but deal with the ways in which black people actually must be free.",
        "And I think that's actually hard to contend with.",
        "When you say whiteness, what do you mean?",
        "I mean, whiteness is a condition of, you know, it's a social construct just like blackness is.",
        "And so by whiteness, you mean what?",
        "Do you mean like the physical appearance of being, like, lighter skinned?",
        "Or do you mean like - what?",
        "- a hierarchy where whiteness is valued above...",
        "I mean, the latter, which is - yes, whiteness as seeing - whiteness as a social construct, but it's not just a social contract.",
        "It's a social construct that believes that white people are better, that if they work hard enough, that of course they just - they'll be able to be middle class or upper middle class.",
        "Whiteness, not just about individual privilege, but whiteness and its ability to have power over other people.",
        "That's really what I mean.",
        "And I think in the conversations I've had, no matter where I go, there's always one white person will come up to the microphone and say, well, but why not all lives matter?",
        "It's literally every single place I go.",
        "And I've had to really understand, why is that so important?",
        "Why is it so important to not center black people?",
        "And I think I've come up with - part of what I've come up with is that white people are really 500 years of centering yourself, your privilege, your children.",
        "I think it does something psychologically when white people have to actually say, oh, maybe I don't deserve this.",
        "But for those who say that - who experience Black Lives Matter as being anti-white, what do you say?",
        "It's unequivocally not true.",
        "Black Lives Matter is really Black Lives Matter Too.",
        "It is not a phrase that is about excluding.",
        "It's a phrase that is about focus.",

        "And even not to that extreme, I mean, the former police chief of New York, Bill Bratton, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, has blamed this movement for attacks on police officers, some of which have been lethal.",

        "It was painful.",

        "And knowing that these right wing pundits had audiences, it was painful because it was such a lie.",
        "But it was also scary because the impact of being labeled as terrorists and receiving death threats, both in my email and on phone calls, really start to shape my understanding of how serious, how unsafe I was out in the world when all I ever wanted was safety for myself and black people.",
