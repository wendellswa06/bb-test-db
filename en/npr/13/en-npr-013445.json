        "Kelly, you first.",
        "Well, sure.",
        "Because you can fire people for a lot of things and NPR has been pretty clear about its standards.",
        "You know, the one question that I have about the whole thing is NPR put up with this arrangement for quite a while, and I think it could have been avoided had they attended to the conflicts earlier.",
        "So, Kelly, you think NPR was within its rights.",
        "Rem, what about you?",
        "I think they were within their rights.",
        "You have a lot of freedom, you know, who you want to be on the air and who you dont.",
        "But I think in this case, to react so abruptly, so rashly to fire somebody without a hearing over something which, yes, was offensive but something where Juan was talking about his feelings, and then later in the conversation made it clear in another remark that he was speaking out against stereotyping, I think it led to an overly hasty decision.",
        "And, as often the case with hasty decisions, created a lot more trouble than NPR needed to bring on itself.",
        "Now, in this case, Juan Williams' role here at NPR was as what we call a news analyst.",
        "He was brought in occasionally to interpret the news and give context.",
        "Would, do you think, opinion logically slide in there?",
        "How do you distinguish analysis from opinion or are they one in the same?",
        "Well, I think there is a difference.",
        "But certainly, as an analyst, it's a different standard I think than for a reporter.",
        "I still think that Im very comfortable with reporters expressing opinions, as opposed to conclusions based on fact.",
        "In this case, you know, I think you give somebody a little more running room than you would have if it was somebody covering a beat.",
        "And, Kelly, what do you think?"

        "After a few stints in prison and a forced exile in Europe, Chet landed in Denver and went to see Dizzie, who was playing at a local nightspot.",
        "Dizzie by now was one of jazz's elder statesmen, whose trademark angled horn and bulging cheeks transformed his image from bebop rebel to beloved clown prince.",
        "Gillespie made a few strategic phone calls to club owners in New York, and Chet Baker was back on the map."
