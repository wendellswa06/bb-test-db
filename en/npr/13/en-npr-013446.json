        "And to a lot of people, I would disagree with, but who have the notion that NPR is liberal, that it's elitist, it's - kind of just reinforces all those notions.",
        "And it's just a totally unnecessary black eye for an organization I think is one of the bright spots in journalism, and is actually increasing the amount of actual reporting it does at a time when the field is plagued with so many cutbacks.",
        "NPR though says that it has very clear ethics guidelines, that opinions expressed on other outlets can be no different than anything that you would say on NPR, and that this violated that code.",
        "Yeah, and I agree it did.",
        "And I think in most newsrooms across the country, a statement like that would have violated a similar standard that says journalists should not share their private opinions about controversial issues in a public forum.",
        "You know, ultimately, I think what this gets to is that NPR has a different set of journalistic values than Fox does.",
