        "All of them had heard of rapes and sexual assaults on their bases in the companies around them, and so they were already on the alert, and because of the climate of sexual harassment that most of the women endure in the military, they felt very threatened.",
        "And then on top of that, a lot of them were told that once they were Iraq, by their commanders, not to go out at night, not to go to the showers, not to go to the toilets alone, that they should always go with a buddy, which the men weren't being told.",
        "And so all those things together would make them very wary.",
        "They were told to go to the latrines and to the showers with someone else, with another female, because there was a very real threat of being sexually assaulted there by fellow soldiers?",
        "Yes, and it's so widely recognized that they were told this by their commanders, yeah, by the sergeants and so on.",
        "Well if they were told this by their sergeants and commanders, why weren't those commanders doing anything about it?",
        "There's of course been a long tradition of the military being all male, and there's a reluctance to change.",
        "There's a reluctance to cause any trouble or alienate soldiers by telling them that they have to treat women like equal and they can't behave as if they're in a frat house or a brothel because that makes you unpopular when you say things like that to the men.",

        "It was a genetic test, kind of pricey - about $3,000.",

        "Still, the girls were only in their teens and might not even have the gene.",
        "It didn't seem the time to be anxious about their future.",
