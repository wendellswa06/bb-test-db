        "The curtain of shame is starting to lift.",
        "And we are seeing a movement of people in recovery stepping forward and giving a face and a voice to the experience of being a person who is recovering from an addiction.",
        "UT student Zach Edgerton is part of that face.",
        "Edgerton is from Dallas and became addicted to drugs and alcohol in high school.",
        "The summer before he was to start college in California on scholarship, he was pulled over for drunk driving.",
        "In addition to being severely intoxicated, he and his buddies had cleverly decided to ride around with copious amounts of illegal drugs in their possession.",
        "But UT has changed his life, and Edgerton is part of that vanguard of students who are willing to stand up and say to the world I'm a recovering addict and a fun and interesting guy.",
        "Most kids go through college trying to balance like their party life and their school life.",
        "You know, I still have a lot of fun and I do a lot of socializing, but I haven't shown up to a class hung-over since I got sober.",
        "Around the country, university and college presidents watch with dismay the catastrophic consequences of drug and alcohol abuse in their student bodies.",
        "Putting a meaningful break on the carnage has so far proved beyond them.",
        "But extending a helping hand to those students who've gone through hell and are trying to come out the other side, that's a small thing they can do.",
        "It's why the numbers have increased so dramatically lately.",
        "Also, the results can tear your heart in two.",
        "The friends that I've made here and the support group that I've kind of surround myself with, to watch them graduate and go on to their professions and really build lives for themselves, it's awe-inspiring.",
        "Some of them are doctors and lawyers already, petroleum engineers, influential people in society today.",
        "And so the students gently and not so gently usher one another into a new world - a world free of intoxicants where the love of learning, of life, of each other is judged to be enough.",

        "There are, and they seem to make a big difference when they don't tolerate that kind of behavior, but a lot of them aren't willing to make those waves.",
        "Let's talk about Iraq veteran Jennifer Springer(ph).",
        "She was with the military police, and you interviewed her.",
        "She told you about being Iraq during the early days of the invasion.",
        "It was a violent night with bombs going off around them, and let's hear what she told you.",

        "No, she didn't report it.",

        "You'd probably be dismissed.",
        "You might even be punished for making waves, and there was no way that she felt comfortable telling anybody about it at all.",
        "Of course the military says it has put in a program, a confidential reporting program, on its Web site for anyone to report incidents such as these, and does that, in effect, work?",
        "Those weren't in place yet when Jennifer was there, which was 2003.",
        "They were put in place later.",
        "But the trouble is that military platoons and units are small, insular places were gossip flies, and everybody knows everybody's business.",
