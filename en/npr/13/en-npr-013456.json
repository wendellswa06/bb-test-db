        "Okay.",
        "So I don't know how much you heard, but basically the resource in Wikipedia's case is kind of the thrill people get in adding something to this user-edited encyclopedia, and kind of the feeling they - of joy of seeing hundreds of millions of people around the world having access to your new addition.",
        "And in sort of these days, that's much harder to do it seems for new people to the site because it turns out that when you add something to Wikipedia and you're not very familiar with how it works, you have a -there's a very high chance that your new edit to Wikipedia is going to get overturned by someone who's kind of more familiar with the site.",
        "Novices to Wikipedia find that anything they add gets quickly reverted, in Wikipedia's language, to what was there before.",
        "So there's a much less, sort of, likelihood - much less fun people are having.",
        "Well, there is, as you have pointed out, even though everybody works for free, there is a bureaucracy that has developed.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And this is not - you know, I don't mean to use bureaucracy in kind of a negative sense, although I don't know if you can use it on a positive sense.",
        "But, basically, it seems like, you know, in order to be more accurate, in order to be more - a better or fairer resource, Wikipedia has adopted a bunch of rules that are - everyone recognizes are good rules - for making sure that things that are added to Wikipedia, you know, work - should be there.",
        "And - but the kind of downside of those rules is that it's…",
        "Is that they're rules.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Right.",
        "And it's reduced the sense of, kind of, free-willing sense that people had and enjoyed about Wikipedia, and that's some researchers say is, kind of, what caused growth to slow down.",

        "Yes.",
        "I just - I've been on Wikipedia for some time and I think one of its downfalls is the politicization of - like, for example, nobody knows who Senator Palin is in, you know, July of 2008.",
        "And then, by September, you have people going on.",
        "They're saying, you know, she had an affair with a polar bear and stuff like that, and then it having to be corrected.",
        "And I think some of the legitimacy is gone because they have to lock articles when they become newsworthy.",
        "Indeed.",
        "They did have a big change of those rules that we have been talking about, Farhad, when they said because of some hoaxes - indeed, like the polar bear one - they had to put a lock on the articles about living persons.",
        "Right.",
        "So they're now in the process of hashing out these new rules which could lead to, kind of, a new layer of editorial control over Wikipedia and basically, this would mean - if it's implemented and it, sort of - Wikipedia works as a collective, so it's unclear how it's going to shape - end up in the final rule.",
        "But, basically, it could mean that any edits to article about living people like Sarah Palin or anyone else would - before they go live on the site, they would need to be approved by some senior Wikipedia member, someone who's sort of more qualified and been on the site longer.",
        "So are you getting discouraged, James.",
        "Well, I - (unintelligible) some of the legitimacy, perhaps it was never there, but it seems to have passed - I think it's also in danger of becoming where people go to get updated on the latest comic book storyline because there's thousands of entries on that.",
        "And I - I don't know.",

        "I mean, I think the general phenomenon that she's referring to is something that one research called Wikilawyering(ph).",

        "And thought I would give it one more try.",
