        "Not yet, no, and there may not be.",
        "And that's the whole thing.",
        "That's what makes it either a scandal or just an annoyance because it is an awful thing, and it is obnoxious and outrageous that this happened.",
        "But if the White House knew of it, then it's even bigger problems for President Obama.",
        "But this is a gift for conservatives.",
        "Well, everything - see, the problem with this, a lot of people start rolling their eyes because the conservatives have been attacking the White House from day one, and we know that the conservatives have been using the talking points for Benghazi when most of the American people said, OK, there may not be that much there there with Benghazi.",
        "But something big like the IRS tax-free status for conservative groups, going after conservative groups; or when the Justice Department decides to go after the reporters' phone calls regarding trying to catch a leak, trying to see where the leaks are in the White House, that is disturbing, and that is not just a conservative disturbance, it's disturbing for both - everybody basically.",
        "Well, going back to the IRS for just a moment, the IG's report on the IRS does not seem to suggest that this is a huge scandal, but we have many questions to answer, and there will be 8,700 congressional investigations, certainly in the House of Representatives.",
        "The phone records seized, the questions, two big questions.",
        "First of all, it was done secretly, which did not allow the Associated Press time to take this case to court and protest, maybe they could work out another deal.",
        "And it seemed to be, well, over a couple of months, 20 different phone lines, three different bureaus.",
        "Yeah, apparently what the White House says it was looking for, and this was regarding a botched al-Qaida plot...",
        "Well, you can understand their plot.",
        "It was that double agent, the report there was a double agent in al-Qaida who had blown the whistle on this underwear bomber plot to blow up an airplane.",
        "But once the administration goes looking at phone records for reporters' phone records, then we know that any government official who ever thinks about talking to a reporter would be at risk because that - because his or her name could very well appear in these phone records.",
        "And that's the chilling effect, what this does, what the Justice Department did with the AP phone links."

        "Preclude - what higher office might she seek?",
        "Well, look, the point is Hillary Clinton is running for president by all indications, and that's exactly why the Republicans think they have a perfect way to go after her in advance of Iowa and New Hampshire.",
        "But again, you know, Mike Huckabee, a former presidential hopeful and perhaps a future Republican presidential hopeful, said that he thinks that President Obama is not going to survive his second term because he's going to be impeached, because basically nobody died, nobody died at Watergate.",
        "And they're still using that quote that we've seen 40 years ago, 30 years ago, that nobody, you know, drowned at Watergate; they did that with Chappaquiddick.",
        "Nobody died at Watergate, but people did die in Benghazi, and they're using this against both Obama and Hillary Clinton.",
