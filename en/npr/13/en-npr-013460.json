        "We heard this week that Stephanie Herseth, the former congresswoman from South Dakota, announced she will not run for Tim Johnson's seat.",
        "But Joe Sestak, who did run against Pat Toomey and lost to him in 2010, is up for a rematch in only three and a half years.",
        "And we also need to note this week the passing of a political figure from, what, now 50 years ago, Billie Sol Estes, involved in scandals back in the Kennedy administration."
