        "Now, that's all voters.",
        "So you can't say, oh, well, you know, what do you expect?",
        "It's African-Americans influential in the Democratic Party disproportionately.",
        "That's all voters.",
        "It's an extraordinary thing.",
        "So I wouldn't write off Alabama at all.",
        "I think there's a lot of success going on down there economically, and I think the Democratic Party has got a lot of growing and a lot of work to do.",
        "But I do think our message, particularly of economic empowerment, can resonate there.",
        "Ken?",
        "Governor, when you ran for president, you were very popular with many progressive groups.",
        "What do you say to progressives today who say that - that there's little difference on - certainly on the - on drone policy, on surveillance issues, on national security wiretaps - little difference between Obama and Bush administrations?",
        "Or even if there wasn't much of a difference, what do you say about the critics of the Obama administration?",
        "I think it's perfectly - I mean that's one of the great things about living in this country.",
        "We have the constitutional right to criticize our government, no matter where we are in the spectrum.",
        "I think anybody who blindly says, well, I'm a Democrat, the president's a Democrat, so I support the president, is nuts, anymore than it's a good thing for Republicans to do that when they have the presidency.",
        "I mean the dialogue and the openness is what allows this country to succeed.",
        "So, now, specifically, I think you have to be pretty tough on national security.",
        "We've had some pretty awful things happened to the country.",
        "And so I, you know, I said what I said about the wiretaps, and I said what I said about drones.",
        "But I would not refuse to support the president based on those two policies.",
        "And I - and for those who are upset about the drones, I think you do have to watch out for the drone policy.",
        "But the truth is, I think getting rid of those horrible people that blew up - helped to blow up the World Trade Centers by drones is a whole better than doing what Bush did, which is to send hundreds of thousands of troops to Iraq.",
        "Do you think that appeal of Rand Paul, the libertarian wing of the Republican Party, has appeal for a lot of Democrats too?",
        "No.",
        "I think Rand Paul is not qualified to be president.",
        "I mean, he's spouting off stuff he has no idea what he's talking about.",
        "Getting rid of the Federal Reserve is - that's a nutcase position.",
        "Without the Federal Reserve and Bernanke, this country'd be in terrible shape.",
        "So, I mean, he's going to get some play and he's going to say some outrageous things and there're going to be some young people who like him, and he's going to disappear and somebody else is going to get the nomination."

        "What they desperately want to avoid, the administration does, is postponing the mandate to buy insurance.",
        "Because that would wreak havoc with prices, wreak havoc with the insurance companies, and they're already getting some demands in their own party to do that.",
        "They've got to stop that and get this working quick.",
