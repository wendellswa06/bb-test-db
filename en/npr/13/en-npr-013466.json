        "So let me start with the sentencing document filed by the U.S.",
        "Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York.",
        "Should we understand from it that the Justice Department considers the president an unindicted co-conspirator?",
        "I think so.",
        "Although he is not charged, I do think he is accused because Michael Cohen specifically says that the campaign finance violation was done at his direction.",
        "So I certainly do, I would consider him unindicted co-conspirator.",
        "Now, the prosecutors in New York said Cohen did not fully cooperate with them, and they recommended that the judge hand down a four-year prison sentence, which some people consider substantial.",
        "But if Mr. Cohen is, according to the prosecutors, a liar, why should we trust what he told prosecutors about the president directing him to commit a crime?",
        "That's always the money question with cooperators, that - there's an aspect of them that they have, of course, violated the law, put their own interests ahead of other people.",
        "And now we are asked to believe that they are telling the truth.",
        "So here, the way that you can tell if a cooperator's telling the truth is really just through the corroboration.",
        "So they obviously have interviewed lots and lots of people, lots of documents.",
        "And that's how they test his credibility.",
        "Now, a downside for Michael Cohen - he tried a very unorthodox method of cooperation and sort of called, like, a Zen method, which is the art of cooperating without cooperating.",
        "And he didn't sign a cooperating agreement.",
        "And, in that sense, he had some advantages, some disadvantages.",
        "Advantage - he controlled what he really wanted to disclose.",
        "They don't know what he doesn't know.",
        "This advantage - you're seeing it now.",
        "They're hammering him for not having done the traditional cooperation agreement.",
        "And special counsel Mueller's office also filed a document about Michael Cohen.",
        "In it, we learn that Cohen told prosecutors a Russian reached out to him in 2015 and offered political synergy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.",
        "And the special counsel didn't make any recommendations about prison time for Cohen.",
        "So what should we draw from that?",
        "I draw from that - that, for the special counsel, who has taken a very aggressive approach towards this investigation, very much treating it like a mob investigation, looking to flip people as soon as possible.",
        "Their initial offers are already quite generous, and then you add in the cooperation.",
        "So I think what you take from this is their interest in him is much more focused very specifically on the flipping, giving information about Trump.",
        "You do?",
        "Yes.",
        "I feel it.",
        "McFaul says that during the 1990s, the Russian government viewed the Americans as partners.",
        "McFaul remembers first meeting Vladimir Putin, then a local official from St. Petersburg, during a conference sponsored by the Washington-based National Democratic Institute.",
        "While McFaul acknowledges that the U.S.",
        "has intervened in the elections of other countries, he says there was no attempt to influence elections in Russia when he was ambassador to Moscow from 2012 to 2014."

        "He says Donald Trump has been a disappointment.",
        "For two years, he essentially never said a bad word about Putin's regime, about our dictatorship, about the way they brutalize people in Russia, have political prisoners - not a bad word.",
        "The silver lining, Milov says, is the Kremlin will have a hard time portraying the opposition as foreign agents, since Putin is closer to Trump than his opponents are.",
