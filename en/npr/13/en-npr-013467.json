        "You can't believe in either party because you're not going to get anything there.",
        "There is no there, there.",
        "There's only one possible result that would change is the shortcoming of representative government and the party system which is a corrupting influence on representative government.",
        "We always think in terms of money corrupting the process.",
        "The party system corrupts it, because you see the party is mostly interested in power not substance, and change will only come about from substance not power.",
        "So what I would advocate is that go to the situation of being able to vote to empower yourself - the national initiative.",
        "I'm running for office because I wanted to empower the American people.",
        "I know the representative government cannot corrupt - correct the shortcomings it have.",
        "So if we can empower the American people, then just maybe - and I know for sure - they will have the capacity to turn around and to make the changes to representative government, and they'll be able to vote on all the policy issues that affect their lives.",
        "That's what needs to happen.",
        "If there's no there there in either party - and you include the Democrats in that - in the event that you're not the nominee of the party, would you be prepared to run for - on a third party ticket?",
        "Well, let's put it this way.",
        "I'm prepared to run all the way to get the message across, whether it's a third party, libertarian party, natural law party.",
        "I do know one thing that 67 percent of the American people do not think that the Democrats or the Republicans offer any, any hope for the future.",
        "If that's the case, then that means that most Americans are ready to vote for somebody independent of the existing party structure.",
        "What that structure is, I don't know at this point in time.",
        "I do know that I can continue to run as a Democrat up until the August convention.",
        "Until the party nominates somebody…",
        "What I do…",
        "…yes.",
        "That's correct.",
        "And now, what I can do then as a free agent even before then as a free agent - there was nothing wrong with me talking with libertarians.",
        "I get a lot of libertarians who will look at my candidacy and say, hey, you know, we like Ron Paul but we like you too.",
        "And Ron Paul says he's not going to run after the primary.",
        "Well, I'll tell you, I have no such compunction.",
        "And if libertarians want to support me, I will enjoy that support.",
        "If Democrats who are concerned about their party and don't want to see the continued ownership of the Democratic Party by Wall Street, which is really what's going on - and Bill Clinton in 1992, along with the DLC, hijacked the Democratic Party, took it to Wall Street and it's been there in residence ever since.",
        "And now, the Democrats are raising more money out of Wall Street than the Republicans.",
        "The same people who own the Republicans now are getting to own the Democrats.",
        "Is that what some Democrats want?",
        "That's not what I want and my bona fides as a Democrat are as good as anybody alive.",
        "And so, the party that I'm interested in is the party of ordinary citizens which is what was championed by Franklin Roosevelt."

        "I agree with pretty much everything he's said so far.",
        "The problem is that the system as it is is so engrained that just like when the man from California ran last time, you know, he just takes so much away from the Democratic Party and then the neocons win and that's, you know, such a bad alternative.",
        "But my big question is I know New Hampshire doesn't have near the issue with immigration that we do out here in Kansas, and I wonder how the senator feels about that.",
        "Senator Gravel?",
        "Well, you raised several points.",
        "One is the issue on immigration is just as bad here in New Hampshire as it is in Kansas and every place else in this country.",
        "I look at immigration this way.",
        "When I was a kid, there was no immigration problems in this country.",
        "There's only been an immigration problem for the last generation, last 20 years or so.",
        "It started with some people saying, oh, there's a problem with immigration and people started ragging it around - the nativists.",
        "You know, primarily, you know, ever since they got off the boat, they don't want anybody else to come into their country.",
        "I'm first generation and - American and my parents are French Canadians and they came in and they were very modest.",
        "Our country has been made great by immigrants.",
        "Now, when people say, well, we've got all these undocumented or illegal immigrants - if you want to talk about illegal things, let's round up everybody inside the Beltway in Washington, and I'll show you some serious illegality.",
        "So moving back to immigration, we now have a non-employment rate of 4.7 percent.",
        "Four point five percent is what economists assume is maximum.",
        "So that means that by and large, there's really not anybody in this country who has a job who's taking the job away from somebody else.",
        "…as the epitome of the romantic hero.",
        "Now, if we had 10 percent or 15 percent unemployed, that's different.",
        "And there are certain pockets of unemployment in this country that are very serious.",
        "But if you look at the totality of it, there is no problem of unemployment by and large - there are pockets of it.",
        "And so now, focusing attention on Mexico and the Latinos coming into this country, that they're the problem - well, if the problem is so bad, why is it that in the last 25 years that we haven't been able to pass legislation to correct the problem?",
        "All I can say is maybe there's an insight here that we're missing.",
        "Maybe there is no problem, that we've created this problem politically when it really does not exist.",
        "And that's the point I'm trying to make with the unemployment figures.",
        "But the other facet of this is that when a country fails - like ours, we fail in education; a third of our students don't graduate from high school; when we fail in health care - what, 50 million people aren't covered; when we fail as a power in the world - we go invading other countries, we incite violence worldwide; we fail - our bridges are falling down, our highways are clogged, we have gridlock across the country.",
        "We fail, we fail - and what do you do when you fail?",
        "You turn around and you look for a scapegoat.",
        "And so what do we do?",
        "We fail in handling terrorism.",
        "So what do you - you point to some people coming over from Mexico, or Latinos and point to them and say they're the problem.",
        "That's what you do when you fail, you look for scapegoats.",
        "And I see a touch of the scapegoating in this whole issue of immigration.",
        "I see a touch of a non-problem in the issue of immigration.",
        "What I see as a problem - if we had leadership in this country, we would not have an immigration problem.",
        "People would be able to come in here when there's jobs to be filled and could go home when they're done filling those jobs.",
        "That's the kind of openness and the kind of presidency I would provide.",
        "I don't know if I have satisfied your issue on immigration, but I'll tell you this, I want to empower you as a lawmaker.",
        "And I will probably have a national legislation on immigration, and we'll let the American people vote for it.",
        "And if you don't like my position, no big deal.",
        "I'm only going to have one vote, and you can cancel my vote.",
        "But I want you to vote on it.",
        "I want you to be responsible.",
        "So if we do make a mistake, then you'll suffer the consequences and make the necessary corrections and thereby mature as a citizen from the experience."

        "And throw it into the lake, and then you walk away.",
        "What's that about?",
        "What that is is - first off, it wasn't produced by me.",
        "It was produced by a couple of young men in California, and they were articulating a metaphor.",

        "Marijuana is not nearly as addictive as alcohol, and of course alcohol is legitimate, so we should be able to turn around and go buy marijuana in a liquor store.",
        "Last year, we arrested 800,000 Americans over marijuana.",
        "Now, that's appalling.",
        "We have 2.4 million people in prison more than any other country in the world.",
        "This is a shameful situation that we have.",
        "And so, now let's look at what we call hard drugs.",
        "Well, the cocaine and other substances - if you need it, you should be able to go to a doctor, get a prescription and get it filled at the drugstore like you do with any other drug that's manufactured by American pharmaceutical industry.",
        "That's the way you handle drugs.",
        "And if there's an addiction problem - and there is, and it's not only the addiction that's been criminalized, it's - we all have it to some degree or other - then what you do is you deal with it as a public health problem which is exactly what it is.",
        "A friend of mine, a doctor in - Terry Benet(ph) in Rochester, New Hampshire, he's the one that pointed that out to me.",
        "He said, Mike, it's a public health problem.",
        "And by criminalizing it, what we do is we damage - we damage human beings, we damage families, we damage the inner city.",
        "That's the position I take.",
