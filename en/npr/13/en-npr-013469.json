        "Ever since the financial crisis erupted in 2008, fingers have been pointing at ratings agencies.",
        "Well, today comes news that the U.S.",
        "government plans to sue the largest agency, Standard & Poor's for fraud.",
        "The case has to do with how the S&P rated mortgage-backed securities.",

        "It was confirmed by Standard & Poor's this afternoon.",
        "They said they have been told they're going to be sued.",
        "This has to do with the allegation that has been leveled against all of the rating agencies for several years now.",
        "These agencies essentially were in the business of rating those sophisticated mortgage-backed securities that were issued by investment banks and other parties.",
        "In essence, these were pools of mortgages that were collected and repackaged into bonds and then sold on the open market.",
        "And the complain has been that a lot of the underlying mortgages were a lot riskier than Standard & Poor's represented them as.",
        "And so, a lot of people who bought them lost money.",
        "The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission actually said the agencies were key enablers of the financial meltdown.",
        "And, by the way, the S&P isn't the only rating agency that has been accused of this.",
        "Some of the same complaints have been launched against Moody's and Fitch.",
        "It's not clear why they're not being named here and S&P is.",
        "But help us understand.",
        "Is the government contending that Standard & Poor's deliberately misrepresented the condition of these assets?",
        "It isn't really clear.",
        "I mean, this will be a civil suit and not a criminal suit.",
        "So, for the Justice Department, the burden of proof is going to be lower than it would be.",
        "I think they're surely going to argue that S&P didn't do its job.",
        "One of the main complaints against the rating agencies for a long time is that they have a basic conflict of interest in their business model."

        "They were asking for at least $8 billion, which would have more than wiped out McGraw-Hill's profits for the entire year.",
        "So, apparently, the government is now planning to file suit.",
        "And, by the way, this is the first suit by the government, by the federal government against any of the rating agencies for their conduct in the months leading up to the subprime crisis.",
