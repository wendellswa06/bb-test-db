        "And welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Hello, Neal.",
        "Good to be with you.",
        "Readers of Patrick O'Brian's novel \"\"Master and Commander\"\" will remember Jack Aubrey's improbable victory over a much larger Spanish vessel, a battle that is lifted directly from the life of Lord Cochrane.",
        "That's right.",
        "What is amazing about the \"\"Master and Commander\"\" novel, the first in the Patrick O'Brian series, is that every major incident in that novel is based on Lord Cochrane's life.",
        "And that battle - in fact, in the novel, the ship is called the Sophie.",
        "It's originally called the Speedy, and it fought a Spanish ship, something like three times bigger than the little brig sloop.",
        "By a series of cunning moves, actually captured the ship, which had four times as many crew, and it made Cochrane's reputation, really, and he then went on to do a series of amazing coastal raids across the Mediterranean.",
        "You're only 17.",
        "And the high point in his life before some of the low points we can get home to was a fire ship attack on an entire French fleet of the French - the West French Coast, when he actually led personally, in a sort of explosion vessel, which he then set far to and jumped into a little boat and rode away in it.",
        "It resulted the entire French fleet going aground.",
        "And for that, he was made a knight of the Bath and became a national hero.",
        "He also made and squandered enormous fortunes and prize money and got into amazing confrontations with his superiors, including his commander at that very battle.",
        "Well, he did.",
        "The trouble with Cochrane was he used to run these people that is his own worst enemy.",
        "He couldn't - he should have - when he should have kept his mouth shut, he didn't.",
        "And the problem with that particular fire ship attack was that he believed that his commander, somebody called Lord Gambier didn't support him and didn't send in a fleet, so that they could finish off the French."

        "And he then refused to endorse a vote of thanks in the house of parliament because he'd actually become an MP himself.",
        "And as a result, Lord Gambier insisted on having a court martial of himself in order to prove his innocence.",
        "And it was a complete stitch up.",
        "The naval high command just closed ranks and froze out Lord Cochrane and he subsequently got involved in a major stock exchange fraud in which he was found guilty, though I believe he was actually innocent of it.",
        "And the result of that, he was sent to prison and thrown out of the navy, serve his life from having been a major hero, to something he was in disgrace -without a job.",
        "And, again, readers of Patrick O'Brian's books will remember an incident quite close to that in one of his books, where Jack Aubrey is pilloried.",
        "But Cochrane himself, you think of him as this fire eating, you know, commander, you know, ready to charge, but a charmer, a shy man.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes, he was.",
        "What I find amazing is that his letters on his parliamentary speeches are very combative and quite, you know, using quite nasty language, really.",
        "But in fact, everybody who met him said that he was remarkably quiet, self-assured like some of those great sportsmen, you see who, you know, when you meet them, they're quite confident people, but when you get them on the sports field, you know, it's sort of whirlwind of action.",
        "And he was rather like that.",
        "He was - normally, when you met him, he didn't impress particularly apart from his great height and, of course, he had a lovely Scottish accent.",
        "But he did charm people very much and I find him a very endearing character.",
        "Though, you admit, a flawed character, a man who, as you said, made enemies when he did not have to, and a man who was obsessed with money.",
        "Yes.",
        "I - in a way, you can see the reason for this because he came from an ancient Scottish family.",
        "He was, in fact, he became the 10th Earl of Dundonald, even though he was called Lord Cochrane as a sort of courtesy title.",
        "And his father, who was sort of a mad inventor, squandered all the family money so that the house that they owned up in Scotland, the sort of family estate that have passed through generations of Cochranes - because the father went bankrupt, it was actually sold off.",
        "So Cochrane, as the eldest son, decided that he'd spend his life, really, making money out of prize money, and in other ways, in order to buy back the family home.",
        "And that was one of the reasons that sort of drove his obsession with making a fortune.",
        "We're talking with David Cordingly.",

        "And in a series of amazing actions, he captured an entire fortified seaport, captured of many Spanish ships, and was - virtually was on to overdrive in the Spanish out of Chile, and he is one of the sort of national heroes of Chile.",
        "And as your - person who's phoned in says, the many streets in Chile are named after Cochrane.",
        "And in fact, I passed on the waterfront in Valparaiso, the great port of Chile, an amazing great bronze statue to him.",
        "So in Chile and in Brazil, where he did more as the same thing, he was responsible for driving the Portuguese out of Brazil.",

        "Yes, that's right.",
        "Yes.",

        "Just as - in his early life as a member of parliament, he had fought on behalf of the common sailor, which have made him very unpopular with the admirals, who felt that the common sailor should be kept in his place."

        "So he was able to recover his reputation, and partly by writing very racy, autobiographies - he wrote up an autobiography about his time in South America.",

        "And as spectacular as many of his deeds of daring do were, as brilliant a commander as he was, you suggested, in fact, his literary legacy is probably more important than what he achieved in life.",

        "Unlike Nelson, who was born at the right time to be in a position of high command when the great, sort of, fleet actions took place, Cochrane never really took part in a major big sea battle between fleets.",
        "And so, you know, he didn't have a great reputation in the sort of history books.",
