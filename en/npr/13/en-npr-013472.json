        "We're doing a hatchet job on African-American people, and it just doesn't deal with skin color, also.",
        "Just this whole issue of what makes a black woman beautiful just in terms of, you know, her size and her physical essence.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We've got a problem with that, too, and that was something we didn't have, you know.",
        "I'm an actor, and I spent five years in L.A., and I would look at the pressure that African-American women who are in the industry are placed under, you know, to maintain a certain size, you know, and to do things to their hair and in terms of makeup, you know, to make themselves more acceptable, not just to whites, but also to black people."

        "And you know, it seems like you see, you know, more of that, or at least more emphasis on this unreal body type.",

        "And we had stories from, like, The Bluest Eye to the Ruby Bridges story.",
        "And from my chapter divisions, I decided to interview black girls and black women about their experiences from racism to basically their families.",
        "And we also talked about beauty and the standards of beauty that they felt were kind of imposed upon them kept coming up.",
        "And the stories these girls were telling I thought were really interesting, and things that me and my friends had gone through.",

        "Is that something that's troubled you personally, that you've been bothered by, something that you've struggled with?",

        "Yeah, I think in some ways, me and my friends have all kind of gone through certain things.",
        "And that's why I think the film kind of was a way to kind of just put it all out there for me, and it was a great experience for me to just make it.",
        "And just even sometimes, you know, you believe in certain stereotypes about my own people and stuff, like even when I was little, wanting to be like a princess or something and being told oh, no, you're black.",
        "You can't be a princess.",
        "Who told you that?",
        "The kids I played with in, like, school, and it's kind of, you know, it affects you, and you kind of somewhat almost believe it for a second.",

        "You know, they seemed to be fighting back in their own way, by being self-aware.",
        "Do you feel that they were exception, or do you think that they are typical of the kind of conversations young women are having, young African-American women are having with themselves and with each other?",
        "I feel it's a mixture, you know?",
        "They were kind of a mix themselves.",
        "I think by - when they were doing the film, they began talking about it and realizing standards and stuff they were giving, which they hadn't even realized before.",
        "And one - I remember one girl talking about, you know, trying to wear natural now and trying to kind of go that direction, and her mother now telling her oh stop that, you're starting to look African.",
        "And so I think some girls were kind of pushing toward a certain direction, but others, you know, they still - you know, they're still going to do certain standards and stuff, because that's what they think is going to be nice and accepted.",
        "Leonard Pitts and I were both struck by just how painful it was to watch this, to hear these girls talk in this way - to watch these children, you know, repeatedly, you know, reach for the white doll - to obviously feel, when they were asked to pick the doll that looked like them, to be so hesitant to do it.",
        "Was that hard for you to watch as you were filming it?",
        "Yeah, it was somewhat sad and frustrating.",
        "You know, I thought, too, like after 50 years, I wasn't expecting a huge change, but I thought maybe a few more black children would choose the black doll as their preference.",
        "But you know, it's still what they see.",
        "Like, even at 4 and 5 years old, you can still tell what America values and what it doesn't.",

        "Let's go to Kansas City, Missouri and Michael.",
        "Michael, what are your thoughts about this?",
        "Well, my initial thought was I think if you're going to have the conversation, it has to include just society at large, because certainly there's some things that we can do as a people to stop the perpetuation.",
        "But there's never been an equal playing field.",
        "There's never been dealing with all the hurt and all the pain that we've had to deal with that have contributed to how we think about ourselves.",
        "And so the conversation, I think, needs to include the broader community, as well, not just - not that we don't have some responsibility - but I think until we deal with racism and that whole systematic approach that America has to doing things - what's portrayed on TV and in the media - all that has to do with what our children see and why they come up with the things that they have.",
        "And certainly, a lot of work has to be done.",
        "Fifty years later, we're still having the same conversation, not just about this issue but about all kinds of issues where we think we should've made strides by now.",
        "If you were placing responsibility - I don't want to say blame - but if you were placing responsibility, how would you apportion it?"

        "Okay.",
        "We've always been pitted against each other, even those of us who can say we've had some level of success, that success has always been at the price, sometimes, of leaving our culture and leaving our people and not identifying with where we came from.",
        "Okay.",
        "What about Mr. Pitts' point, though - Leonard Pitt's point - that a lot of the people who are engaging in this are, you know, practitioners of a culture.",
        "They have a lot of cultural authority.",
        "They have a lot of authority and autonomy and that they're generating these images, you know, to get paid.",
        "It's there - it's on them.",
        "What would you say to that?",
        "One of the main ways to make sure paychecks go farther is to make sure working families don't get ripped off.",
        "(APPLAUSE)",
        "It's always about the bottom line.",
        "The bottom line is going to be the money.",
        "And if that's what they choose to use to get paid, there are some people that have that limited, you know, approach to whatever they're doing.",
        "All they care about is where the money is, and that's where the money is.",
        "Those videos and that type of music is what sells.",

        "But there are other entities and other cultural things in our community, I think, that can speak up and talk about more of the positive things, as well.",

        "All right, thank you.",
        "Kiri, I'm going to stick with you for a couple more minutes and then go back to Mr. Pitts, but what do you think about this conversation.",
        "I know you read Leonard Pitts' column, and you've hearing the discussion here.",
        "You know, what do you think?",
        "Do you think that some of the artists bear responsibility for the way the kids in your film reacted?"
