        "I agree that, you know - I personally feel that black people who are placed in, like, influential positions have a certain responsibility to kind of portray positive imagery to, like, our black youth.",
        "But then again, you know, they're kind of doing what they want, and that's not always the case that they're doing that.",
        "And I think some of these black, these media outlets that sometimes appear to be done by black people aren't always done by black people, and I think we have to look at who's controlling what's being put out.",

        "Actually, the ultimate people who are responsible are the people who buy it, because the entertainment industry is like any other business: It's a supply and demand.",
        "And if we, the people - black, white and otherwise - were not demanding these types of images, then the entertainment industry would not be supplying it.",
        "So there's something also to be said for, you know, why do we buy, as African-Americans, why do we so readily buy that which demeans us?",

        "We sort of left it there and never really followed that through, and I think we really need to indoctrinate our kids in that.",
        "Okay, thank you to both of our guests: Leonard Pitts, a nationally syndicated columnist, winner of the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary.",
        "He's also the author of the bestselling book, Becoming Dad: Black Men and the Journey to Fatherhood.",

        "On Sunday, an explosion in Zabul province in the southeastern part of the country killed four American soldiers.",
        "There are few stand-up battles in a campaign marked by assassinations, executions and ambushes, classic hit-and-run guerrilla tactics, but Taliban forces have suffered in counterinsurgency operations as well."
