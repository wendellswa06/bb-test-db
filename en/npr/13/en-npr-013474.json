        "(SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)",
        "They are unable, as you said earlier, to face the United States troops and other coalition troops in stand-up face-to-face battles.",
        "They tried that at the beginning of the fighting season which began in March when the snow melted in the passes of the mountains.",
        "They suffered some very, very heavy casualties in a number of face-to-face encounters, and began basically adopting these--as you described, these hit-and-run tactics, these guerrilla tactics, terrorist tactics where they are targeting government officials, moderate clerics, civilians suspected of being informers or people who have been cooperating with American or international reconstruction projects, and it's a campaign that has claimed an estimate--more than an estimated 1,000 Afghans, and at this point more than 40, close to 50 American troops since--at least by my count since this upsurge began in March.",
        "Guerrilla tactics require, at least according to classic theory, that the guerrillas be able to melt back into the local population.",
        "Are the Taliban able to do that with the cooperation, or are they forcing local villagers to go along?",
        "I think it's a question of both.",
        "I think that there are villages that are being coerced into providing food and shelter to the Taliban who come down from the mountains seeking local assistance, but I also have no doubt in my mind that there is also quite a bit of local sympathy for the Taliban, whether it be because of support for their very puritanical brand of Islam or tribal ties.",
        "The Taliban are all Pashtuns.",
        "They're from the majority ethnic community of Afghanistan, and so there are--there's an ethnicity between villagers and the Taliban.",
        "And you're absolutely right, they do melt back into the local villagers.",
        "When I was out with the troops for three days in Zabul province in one of the worst-hit areas of Zabul province, Deh Chopan, we could actually hear the Taliban talking on the radios--the Americans monitor them--and they're very, very close, and yet--well, during three days I was on patrol, they didn't find any in the searches of the villages that we were conducting.",
        "Let's bring another voice into this conversation.",
        "Here with us in Studio 3A is Gary Anderson, a retired colonel of the Marines and a frequent contributor to this program.",
        "He's just back from Afghanistan himself.",
        "Gary, always nice to have you on the program.",
        "Good to be here, Neal.",
        "You were there in Afghanistan.",
        "I wonder what you make of Jonathan's reporting.",
        "Yeah, I think the question of the Taliban has to be looked at in context.",
        "Yes, in--particularly in areas that are Pashtun in nature, you've got a--you know, a certain amount of tribal loyalty and a certain amount of this Afghan Arab concept of hospitality.",
        "If you're in my house, I'm gonna protect you.",
        "My cut on it is that by and large, the population of Afghanistan is tired of war.",
        "They--there is--the Taliban as a whole throughout the nation have worn out their welcome, and I don't believe that they're capable of launching a Tetlike offensive, Tet being the Vietnam offensive that was a coordinated, nationwide attack to disrupt the Americans in 1968.",
        "I think you're gonna see--I think you always see a seasonal uprise--upsurge in violence this time of year, but particularly coming close to the elections.",
        "You're gonna see a lot of attempt to disrupt the elections.",
        "The ability to do it in a coordinated manner I would question.",
        "So you're saying that the Taliban is largely confined to these Pashtun areas, these provinces along the Pakistani border, but not able to penetrate into the interior of the country?"

        "Yeah.",
        "I wouldn't say that they couldn't in small bands, but I don't think you're going to see the kind of national uprising that--I think I've seen some reports in Washington being afraid of that.",
        "I really think that right now they're an organization that's in disarray.",
        "A lot of the younger folks really would like to see a wider social agenda, a wider political agenda, and all they get from Mullah Omar and his leadership cadre is more Koran, and I think that's causing problems.",
        "Jonathan Landay, let me ask you, a Taliban spokesman has said over the past few days that the Taliban would avoid attacks on election day on polling stations and on civilians, but would still try to inflict casualties on American and Afghan troops leading up to the elections.",
        "What does that say about their tactics?",
        "I mean, last time they vowed to thwart the elections and failed spectacularly.",
        "I think that what you're seeing is a very smart enemy that knows how to adjust and knows how to preserve themselves.",
        "I don't think there's any question--I agree that there's no question that they're capable of launching a Tetlike offensive of the kind that they launched back in 1994 to--and rolled over most of this country, and I don't even think that that is, in fact, what their goal is.",
        "I think my reading of what's going on is that this is a group who has rearmed, has got new money from al-Qaeda, according to both American and Afghan officials, and I believe that what they're trying to do, perhaps, is learn from Iraq and tie the United States down, not just in one country, Iraq, but in two countries, Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "And it's--and taking--and they're taking a very long view of this in that they understand that the longer they tie us down here, the more that they can bleed the United States military, the more that they pump up opposition at home to continue military involvement overseas.",
        "And beyond that, it provides them with extremely good propaganda in that they can, in the propaganda disseminated by jihad--by global jihadists, they're able to accuse the United States of not occupying just one Muslim country, but two.",
        "And so I think that their decision not to attack polling stations and not to attack civilians is precisely that.",
        "That they understand that they're not gonna be able to disrupt the elections.",
        "They weren't able to disrupt the presidential elections.",
        "But my question--my question is whether or not that's in fact what they really intend.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Let's get some listeners involved in the conversation: (800) 989-8255, (800) 989-TALK.",
        "And we'll go to Manny, Manny calling us from Louisville, Kentucky.",
        "Hello?",
        "Hi, Manny.",
        "You're on the air.",
        "You don't need to be a mad genius to know that it's a pretty bad deal if you're borrowing $500 and you have to pay back $1,000 in interest.",
        "Yes.",
        "I want to say we can put names, al-Qaeda, insurgent in Iraq, Taliban in Afghanistan, all these names, but the bottom line, we are trying to finding an ideology telling anybody if you wrap yourself in some explosive and go kill any non-Muslim people, you are gonna go to the garden and have 72 womens and wine and milk and all that.",
        "You cannot fight this kind of ideology with the way we are doing.",
        "I think we are gonna have more people killed and--from our soldiers and others, and I don't personally beli--I also want to say we are helping that.",
        "Musharraf is happy that this thing is going on.",
        "He is getting money from us every day.",

        "So we are really feeding onto that system both ways for those who wants to be martyr and martyrs and kill themselves and kill others, and at the same time--given that opportunity, at the same time give them also the finance and--directly and indirectly.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Let's avoid some of the tactical questions about suicide bombings and that sort of thing, but what about this ideological issue, Gary Anderson?",
        "Well, I think that when you talk to Afghans, they will tell you that you'll probably not likely see a lot of Afghans strapping bombs on themselves.",
        "Been, far as we know, two successful suicide bombings this spring, both of them pretty much tied to foreign fighters sneaking through.",
        "Very, very hard for the Arab foreign fighters to infiltrate the way they have in Iraq because--simply because they don't speak the language, they're soldiers...",

        "I do think you will see an attempt, perhaps by al-Qaeda and the Taliban, to sneak through a couple of bombers to attack an American or Allied target to cause a really big headline-grabbing event.",
        "I think that's something you can expect to try to see them do.",

        "And one thing I don't hear is any blame being put on American conduct of the war in Afghanistan.",
        "I recommend the book \"\"Black Hawk Down,\"\" by Mark Bowden, talking about the incident in Somalia in 1993.",
        "And in there you can see the reasoning--some of the reasoning why a once-friendly group of people will, after a while, turn against Americans, and I think a lot of it has to do with our overwhelming use of force and power.",
        "For instance, in Afghanistan, bombing villages when we think there is, you know, a bad guy there, killing innocent people, and if you do that long enough, month after month, you start turning the population against Americans.",
        "I mean, if your family numbers are being killed for no good reason by a foreign power, I can see why the Afghans are turning to the Taliban.",
        "Excuse me, Phil.",
        "Let me put that to Jonathan Landay.",
        "Have American military tactics where you were in Zabul province, were they heavy-handed?",
        "Not at all.",
        "The Americans go out of their way to try and observe cultural sensitivities here in that when they do a search of a compound--because Afghans live in extended families in very large compounds--they will ask permission first from the head of the compound, and then have them go with them, accompany them, and have Afghan troops go with them, as well, to search some of the more sensitive parts of the compound like women's quarters."

        "However, that said, there are instances, and I've witnessed--I witnessed some, where that doesn't happen, where the Americans have gone in to a compound without the Afghans and without permission and swept it, as well as when they come to a compound that is locked, they will--and no one can produce a key, they will, then, blast the locks off with shotguns and go into the compounds.",
        "Now I have to definitely mention the fact that there have been Taliban--there are Taliban who do hide in these compounds, and there have been Americans who have been killed, surprising Taliban living--or hiding out in rooms of compounds, but--during one of the patrols that I went on.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And that's a - that's a possibility in that the technology, you know, relies on cameras, sensors and radar.",
        "So, I mean, if you understand, like, the way this happened, the, you know, the radar that's coming from the car could have likely gone under this, you know, tall tractor trailer.",
        "And the camera didn't see because of the contrast.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And there's a sense that these cameras aren't, you know, developed quite enough to be able to, you know, make these real-world decisions.",
        "And the catcher?",
        "What do you call the catcher?",
        "The Americans like to try and meet with all of the village elders in these very, very remote villages up in the mountains and try to explain their presence there and what they are doing there and I witnessed one scene where the village elder said, `OK, we understand that, but President Karzai'--that's President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan--`had told us we--everybody must respect all religions and yet the Americans came in to our mosques today with their boots on, and when they go into our compounds, they smash the locks, and they smash the odors and they smash our storage chests, not even the Taliban do that.",
        "And, therefore, if you take those--you know, those incidents, and you couple them with the fact that there have been civilians killed by mistake in American strikes against the Taliban, it's my feeling that they're--they do contribute in these very rural areas to sympathy--do tend to pump up sympathy for the Taliban.",
