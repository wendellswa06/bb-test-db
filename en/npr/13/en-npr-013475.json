        "And the rest of the country, which is basically divided between the minorities of Afghanistan--the Tajiks, the Uzbeks and the Hazaras, and so you're getting this ethnic divide again here, which I also believe is part of the Taliban tactic, that is, to drive a wedge, once again, between the ethnic groups while you still have very, very, very serious tensions that are--still have--that accumulated over 30 years of civil war, a lot of it between these ethnic groups.",
        "Sectarian division...",

        "Right.",
        "No, that's OK, and I--and, actually, it's very interesting that you should say that because, again, it's another parallel that I see between Afghanistan and what the Taliban are doing and what's happening in Iraq."

        "And one other very important thought here and that is you asked me why perhaps the Taliban decided not to attack polling stations and try and disrupt the election.",
        "And that may be because that they had--that there are quite a number of former Taliban who have--participating in government amnesty program who are running for office.",
        "And it suddenly occurred to a colleague of mine today that what you might see happen is the development of a political wing, so to speak, of the Taliban, working, or at least sympathetic to the Taliban, inside the tent, so to speak, pushing the kind of Islamic agenda that the Taliban would like to see and have a military wing operating in the south and the east at the same time, pushing the same kind of agenda.",
        "We've seen it before in many, many countries.",
        "Look at what happened in Northern Ireland where you had the IRA, the military wing, and Sinn Fein, the political wing, of the same movement.",
        "And that, I think, if there's another long-term threat here, and there are many long-term threats, not quite as serious as the Taliban, or as serious as the narcotics problem, but that might be it.",

        "Awesome.",
        "Awesome.",

        "Then you have the rest of Zabul, which are these awesome mountains and steep defiles, steep valleys, where you have only one or two--one entrance into the valley and one exit.",
        "Mountains towering over 10,000 feet, and our troops engage in these mountains every day.",
        "We did a lot of walking.",

        "In fact, a lot of members of the unit that I was with had served in Iraq and said that this here in Afghanistan--serving in Afghanistan was much, much more difficult because in Iraq, at least, they said, they got to ride in vehicles, in Humvees, whereas, here, they are doing these marches in 98-, 99-degree heat, very high altitudes, carrying full combat gear, up and down these mountains, and it's quite a challenge that they're facing.",
        "Jason, thanks very much for the phone call.",
        "We got a little far afield but the poppies, but we appreciate the phone call anyway.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "Actually, I had one more question, as far as the Taliban and politics.",
        "If you keep it very, very quick.",
        "You got it.",
        "Now I understood that the Taliban and al-Qaeda was actually a list of people that went to Osama's medical care center so it could be pretty simple for someone to have gone in there and, you know, be classified as an al-Qaeda member and then skate off scot-free, and, yeah, join politics, so I think that is something we should all be concerned about.",
        "OK, Jason, thanks very much for the call.",
