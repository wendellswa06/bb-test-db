        "Well, you know - you know, people are afraid of driverless cars and - but, you know, there was also a time when people were afraid of riding in elevators.",

        "Yeah.",
        "And that's one of the things when we first designed the card, was instead of just putting Manatee County numbers, we extended the reach to other surrounding areas with hopes that they would be able to help someone.",
        "Why did you come up with that idea for the cards in the first place?",
        "It was an idea that, after running so many overdose calls, we just - we felt the need to do something.",
