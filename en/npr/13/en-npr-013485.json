        "Different tissues are different as well.",
        "Why is there no good data?",
        "Why are there no good studies about that?",
        "We have a good amount of animal data.",
        "Human data, though, is much more limited.",
        "Well, it's hard to do high-level studies.",
        "Frankly, it's a newer technique as far as some of the contemporary techniques have only been around for a couple years.",
        "Studies are costly, and I think we've identified now what the important variables are, and now we need to do those studies.",
        "We simply need to collect careful data on our patients.",
        "As Dr. Lehman mentioned, they're being used a fair amount, and that's probably fine, they're safe, but I would just advocate that we carefully study those patients in whom we use this and really look at what we're putting into the patients so that we can truly understand what is effective, what is not, what parts are effective, to really start to have a more refined understanding of this whole area.",
        "Dr.",
        "Lehman, is it ethical to do these things on people if you can't say to them, you know, this is going to work?",
        "Well, I think, first of all, it's ethical if you explain exactly what the technology is, what you're doing, what the expectations are, and you're very, very honest with the information that's out there.",
        "So yes, I think it's ethical.",
        "And in Bartolo Colon's case, and in many athletes' cases, there's really not a whole lot out there for a 37-year-old pitcher who's pretty much done.",
        "So if this is your only shot and the one thing that may make a difference, rotator cuff surgery on a 37-year-old pitcher or any pitcher is probably not going to work all that well.",
        "So I think yes, it's ethical.",
        "And I think as - there are sort of two things.",
        "One is Dr. Rodeo is right, the basic science research has to be done.",
        "And then I think we need to do clinical research, and that is double-blind studies looking at these patients, the human people, and saying are they really any better than our conventional rotator cuff repairs.",
        "My personal opinion is that they are, and I think our results are better since we've been doing it, but again, that's - what I say isn't really science until we've studied it in a true study.",
        "Dr.",

        "There was some - the - baseball is investigating and interested in it not because it might be an illegal procedure, but possibly there was the use of human growth hormone, which is a banned substance in baseball.",
        "Why would that be mixed into this cocktail of what's happening?",
        "What would be the advantage of that if it was at all used?",
        "Well, I think growth hormone in general, you know, people - athletes use, people have used for years, athletes have used for years.",

        "Yeah.",

        "I mean, the rationale to use it would be, you know, HGH has a really positive effect on cell - basic cell physiology, cell proliferation, matrix synthesis.",
        "It could actually help stimulate the cells you inject.",
        "Certainly, HGH, we know by itself could have a positive effect.",
        "So - but at the same time, it's a banned substance.",
        "So I don't know the details in Bartolo Colon's case, but it's a banned substance.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And so, you know, and it makes hard to interpret the effect of any cell therapy if you also have another factor that may have contributed or lead to the positive result."

        "That just wouldn't be scientifically based.",
        "If you have cancer and you were to take that cell line and inject it into the shoulder, yes, you're going to have some kind of transfer of the cancer cells.",
        "But to take a bone marrow aspirate in a healthy athlete, which is a normal cell line, and then a PRP blood product, I really don't think there's any risk at all for causing cancer or creating an aberrant cell line.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I could say that the issue comes up with very, very undifferentiated, you know, very primitive cells, that that risk is there.",
