        "Yet Fannie and Freddie carry the government guarantee, they're supposed to do good things for the housing market.",
        "And to some extent everybody feels they let us down.",
        "Fannie and Freddie were set up decades ago to encourage home-ownership by making loans more widely available.",
        "They provide money to lenders by buying up mortgages, keeping some, and bundling others for sale to investors.",
        "Although both were private, for-profit companies, it was generally understood the government would back up Fannie and Freddie if they got into trouble, and that's just what happened two years ago, when the government took over the companies, leaving taxpayers with a very big bill.",
        "There's probably enough finger-pointing to go everywhere.",
        "That's Michael Berman, incoming chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association.",
        "His group is proposing to replace Fannie and Freddie with new private companies that would take over the job of bundling mortgages for sale to investors.",
        "For a fee those bundles would still be backed by the federal government.",
        "But unlike Fannie and Freddie, the bundling companies would not be.",
        "And there'd be strict limits on the kinds of loans they could handle.",
        "It would be a conservative lending environment with respect to the government involvement.",
        "The key is to make sure that you have these kinds of classic, historically proven products like a 30-year mortgage, 15-year mortgage, that would be there through all times of the economy, including the kind of stress that we have today.",
        "One question at today's conference is how big a role the government should play in that effort.",
        "Consumer advocate Mike Calhoun of the Center for Responsible Lending says until their recent problems, Fannie and Freddie did a lot of good, popularizing the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, for example.",
        "We need to be careful, the proverbial don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.",
        "Calhoun and other consumer advocates say Fannie and Freddie were simply following Wall Street's bad private sector example when they began chasing the profits in riskier loans.",
        "Calhoun says the government is already cracking down on the most dangerous kinds of mortgages, as part of its financial overhaul passed by Congress last month.",
        "So if you'd had those standards in place before this last mortgage and financial crisis, we wouldn't have gone down that path."

        "Because the banks in Europe weren't lending to each other, we had what was known as a European liquidity crisis.",
        "And if you know much about crises, liquidity crises are the worst crises you can possibly have.",

        "And that brought about calls for reform, which were quite genuine but also somewhat politically motivated, where VA health care, which is the largest example of government-run health care in the country, became kind of a proxy battle for people in Congress who love the idea of government health care against people who hate the idea of government-run health care.",
        "There's been a lot of effort made to improve veterans' care, and this is a bipartisan issue.",

        "What does it mean for the VA system?",
        "So again, in response to this scandal in 2014, Congress passed a law called the Veterans' Choice Act.",
        "They wanted to get something set up quick but, as a result, it's been a real mixed bag.",
        "It was a system so that veterans, if they had been waiting too long or if they lived too far from a VA, they could just go out to a private doctor get their care, and the VA would pay for it.",
