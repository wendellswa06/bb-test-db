        "No, we knew they were there.",
        "We have colleagues in India who originally discovered these deposits.",
        "They occur in huge, open-pit mines that are used to mine lignite, which is like a semi-fossilized coal.",
        "And they had discovered that amber occurred there.",
        "However, when my team joined their team and a German team from the University of Bonn, all got together, we started collecting the amber in huge amounts and screening through it and finding a tremendous wealth of insects and other life.",
        "Well, you brought in a couple of examples.",
        "And I have to say that this amber doesn't look like the picture of amber I have in my mind.",
        "That's right.",
        "It's not a real commercially viable type of amber.",
        "It's pretty dirty, and in fact, it's actually kind of sticky on the inside, whereas, like, Baltic amber or Dominican amber is beautiful, smooth, lustrous.",
        "And it reflects a chemical difference.",
        "So how do you get the things inside out to study them?",
        "Well, this amber from Western India is actually very distinctive.",
        "You can actually dissolve this amber, and you can extract the insects and other things entirely from them, whereas the other kinds of amber, like Baltic amber or Dominican amber, you can't do that.",
        "It's not soluble.",
        "Wow.",
        "But what we actually do is we do it the hard way and the old-fashioned way.",
        "We actually trim through the piece of amber, looking to see who's home, and polish and grind it and just look for the little insects."

        "It tells us a lot about the origins of the Asian fauna.",
        "And this particular deposit, I find probably the most interesting aspect of it is that the resin, the amber, was actually formed from a type of tree called dipterocarps.",
        "And today, these types of trees are the dominant tree in Southeast Asia.",
        "They really form tropical forest.",
        "They are the 80 percent of the trees in a tropical forest in Southeast Asia can be dipterocarps.",
        "And there had been some controversy about the age of tropical forests.",
        "And this is a unique discovery in terms of helping to date the age of tropical forests.",
        "So set the scene a little bit for us.",
        "Fifty million years ago, what did this part of India look like?",
        "I mean, if you've got big trees and something that grows only in tropical forests, presumably you've got a tropical forest.",
        "That's exactly it.",
        "The point being that tropical forests are very ancient ecosystems.",
        "And what else was there?",
        "I mean, you've got all these creatures.",
        "I'm presuming the larger animals weren't trapped.",
        "But what would this place have looked like?",
        "It would look actually if you looked up close, and you looked at the insects, I mean the forest itself would probably look very much to a tropical forest if you walk through a trail, a forest trail in Borneo.",
        "It would look pretty similar to that.",
        "You know, there's always money to be made somewhere, and some people exploit it.",
        "But if you looked up close, you wouldn't recognize necessarily a lot of the insects.",
        "They would be a lot more primitive than ones you'd see today, and they would actually have they would look fairly exotic.",
        "Really?",
        "So tell us about some of the guys you found so far."

        "Well, for example, we found actually quite a diversity of highly social insects, like certain kinds of termites, bees and ants.",

        "Baltic amber is about 42 million years old.",

        "And when we find these bloated females, unquestionably they contain blood.",
