        "Yeah, I mean, if you Google amber, you'll - you might get some references on there.",
        "I mean, there's a lot of insect references for identification.",
        "And there are some good general references on amber, life in amber in general.",
        "So and sometimes it can be very misleading.",
        "You know, very often I get collectors coming to me, saying oh, boy, we found this incredible thing, and it turns out to be some sort of misshapen piece of dirt that looks like something.",

        "Hi.",
        "Yeah, it's my understanding there's the theory of the evolution of wings in insects is still kind of unknown.",
        "I was wondering if you expect to find any specimens in the sample that might help elucidate where that which theory might be correct or...",
        "No, not in this amber because this is way too young.",
        "It's likely that insects evolved their wings about 400- to maybe 380-million years ago, about 400-million years ago, I'd say.",
        "And this is a little more than one-tenth the age of that.",
        "So it's far too young for that.",
        "Okay, good question, though, Elijah.",

        "My question today is regarding the deposit of amber.",
        "I was just curious, like, how large is the deposit?",
        "And how long do you think it would have taken for that much sap to accumulate to create that size of a deposit?",
        "My colleague asks, how would you say in Dutch the infield fly rule is in effect in this play?",
        "That's a good question.",
        "It's a huge deposit.",
        "The mines we're working again are these huge lignite mines.",
        "It's like semi-fossilized coal, and it's used for incineration.",
        "They burn it to generate electricity.",
        "And they cover many, many hundreds of acres each.",
        "And the ones we're working in are 20, 30 kilometers apart, but it's the exact same deposit, and it probably extends for many dozens of miles all around.",
        "So we're talking hundreds of square miles."

        "And the forest, we know that today, dipterocarps, the trees, the kind of trees that produce this amber, produce huge quantities of resin.",
        "In fact, it's tapped, and it's sold as dammar.",
        "Dammar is the type of finish or varnish that you put on paintings or on violins and things like that.",
        "So these forests produce a large amount of resin, and they're very large trees.",
        "They get to be huge.",
        "I estimate, actually, that about 10 percent of the energy produced in these gargantuan electric plants that's burned is actually fossil resin.",
        "And so how long I'm sorry, I didn't mean were you going to ask that, Gail?",
        "Well, yeah, I was just curious: How long would it have taken to accumulate and amass that size of a deposit?",
        "Well, the deposit itself is only a few million years old.",
        "And the amber is concentrated in a few little strata, some thin strata.",
        "So it actually was fairly quick.",

        "So you're saying this goes beyond this case.",
        "I mean, Alexander Litvinenko was the former Russian spy, and this was about a decade ago.",
        "You also have Nikolai Glushkov, who was a Putin critic living in Britain who died under suspicious circumstances this week.",

        "Well, I think you have to see a pattern here.",
        "And if you think of the gravity of what's been done here, this is military-grade nerve agent of a kind that is essentially banned under the convention on chemical weapons being used in the streets of an English country town, putting at risk all sorts of other people, as well.",
        "We also have a British police officer who's seriously in hospital, having gone as a first responder to this incident and, you know, widespread concern about the level of potential contamination.",

        "Because the bloodstream of Europe, the money which was flowing around from bank to bank to bank had more or less seized up.",

        "And if banks can't roll over their debts, then there's no financial system anymore and we have a major global crisis, which makes the first one look like nothing.",

        "All you need to do is basically what the central banks did today and you can push them off indefinitely, pretty much.",
        "So they're easy to treat, but if left untreated, they can be fatal in no time.",
        "So what can we expect these central banks to do a month from now, six months from now or a year from now?",
        "So the idea is that now that the central banks are lending freely, the individual commercial banks will start lending to each other again.",
        "And, of course, once they start lending to each other, the central banks don't need to do this anymore and they can quietly step back and say, oh, well, we saved the day and now we can go back and not bother with this kind of thing anymore.",
        "But if the commercial banks don't start lending to each other again, then this kind of program is going to have to continue to exist more or less indefinitely.",
        "Indefinitely until the financial crisis is over?",
        "Exactly.",
        "Well, how will ordinary consumers feel the effects of this, Felix?",
        "They won't.",
        "Ideally, they won't feel anything at all because their bank used to borrow from a different bank and now it borrows from the central bank and there's no real difference to them.",
        "This is a very much a sort of international financial plumbing thing that's going on here.",
        "It's not something which affects you or me.",
        "So why does it have such a big impact on the markets?",
        "Because without international financial plumbing, there are no markets.",
        "Without banks being able to move money around, the whole concept of markets ceases to have a lot of meaning and everything just grinds to a chaotic and rather devastating halt."
