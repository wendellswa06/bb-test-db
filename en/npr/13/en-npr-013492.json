        "And he said he thought the election was about leadership, paying attention to what people are saying.",
        "And when you don't listen, he says, when you don't take into account people's concerns, they will respond.",
        "I wonder if when you look at surveys on health care, if those words might be turned right against him.",
        "Most people favor a public option, for example, a government option for health insurance, and Republicans are dead set against it.",
        "Well, you know, I made a living for about 24 years reading polls.",
        "And I can tell you you have to be very careful, because polls that test hypotheticals - would you like a helicopter in your backyard that'll take you to work every day in four minutes - you can get a very good poll number.",
        "So I've seen the public option tested every way.",
        "The problem with testing the public option is people don't really know what it is.",
        "It's a theoretical idea right now.",
        "I think what the country would really like to see is the squabbling ending, the ideological dogma be turned down a few notches, and Republicans and Democrats work together to fix the economy and to do something to make health insurance more affordable and more accessible for more people.",
        "And the historic test now, after these setbacks, for the president: Will he grab the leadership to try to force that?",
        "I think he could get a lot of credit in the country.",

        "But is it a revolution?",
        "James DeFronzo, who wrote the book \"\"Revolutions and Revolutionary Movements,\"\" thinks it's still too early to tell.",
        "You have to have some great structural, institutional change for an uprising to eventually be legitimately called a revolution in terms of its outcomes.",
        "DeFronzo thinks Libya may get there.",
        "But Shadi Hamid, director of research at the Brookings Doha Center, thinks it's more than that.",
        "He says Libya is, in fact, the first true Arab revolution, more so than Tunisia or even Egypt, because in Libya, every element of the previous regime is collapsing.",
        "What's different about Libya is here, for the first time, it will actually be the rebels and revolutionaries who will govern their new country in the post-Gadhafi era.",
        "And they're operating with a blank slate; they don't have to worry about the old regime structures.",
        "They can really start anew.",
        "I think there really is the potential here for something quite promising."

        "I mean, not having that backbone comes with its own problems, it seems like.",

        "So, really, it's building something from nothing.",
        "So I think there, there's a very big upside, but there's also potentially a very big downside.",
        "Will it be hard for the Arab world to embrace Libya as a true revolution given how much military support Libyans received from the U.S., from NATO, from the West?",
        "First of all, it was the Libyans themselves who requested international support.",
        "It wasn't as if this was a Western imposition.",
        "But also, they did this themselves.",
        "There were no boots on the ground.",
        "They thought this themselves.",
        "And it's really remarkable if you look at what the rebel council was able to do just in the span of six months, so I think that they should be given credit for doing this largely on their own with some external help.",

        "There will be some expulsions, I'm sure, of some of the Russian security agents in the U.K.",
        "And I think she will announce that we will pursue what you have done in the U.S., the Magnitsky Act, with greater powers to seize assets of those concerned with human rights abuses.",
        "And then I think that we will take our case to our NATO allies to make the point that this is something of much wider concern.",
        "And we perhaps need to reframe how we see Russia as an international actor if they can't give an adequate explanation of this.",
        "Is that enough?",
        "I mean, I know the British government has been accused of dragging its feet at moments like this."

        "Like many abortion rights opponents, replacing the late Justice Antonin Scalia with another conservative judge was a top goal for Dannenfelser, who served on an advisory group Trump called his pro-life coalition.",
