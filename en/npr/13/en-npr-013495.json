        "You're talking, of course, about Hunter Thompson, who died earlier this year.",
        "That's right.",
        "And I remember a quote attributed to Frank Mankiewicz, who was the McGovern campaign manager in '72 who wrote about Thompson's accounts of that campaign, that it was the least factually accurate but certainly the most true account of that particular campaign.",
        "(Soundbite of chuckling)",
        "Yeah.",
        "Thompson--the accuracy of Hunter's work is always something that people debate, in terms of his technical documentary accuracy.",
        "My belief is that you can pursue this form of journalism and still stick to the kind of documentary accuracy that is involved in traditional journalism, yet at the same time, there is room for abuse in this, as there is in anything else."

        "You also talk about how one of the progenitors of this style, George Orwell, in \"\"Road to Wigan Pier\"\" and other books--he, it turned out, fictionalized some of his stories.",

        "I believed that it all happened as it did, and as a reporter I read it and see no reason why one couldn't stick to things, actually, as they happened and still have an equally compelling story.",

        "But the truth is that most personal journalism is a blend of memoir, of reporting and essay, and it is a blending of all those legitimate forms into a single form, in and of itself.",
        "And so, you know, in \"\"The Beholder's Eye,\"\" we have war reporter Scott Anderson writing a wonderful piece about, essentially, what he has learned from his own wartime reporting experiences, and he uses as a vehicle his own immersion in a particular setting, and there's a lot of digression around that, or covering other years of reporting experiences.",
