        "And a lot of these men are still extremely armed with weapons that range from RPGs to aircraft weaponry, and those arms are not back in the hands of authorities.",
        "So the security situation, obviously much more difficult in Libya.",

        "Really, it was dubbed into Arabic and is very - considered very insulting in Islam.",
        "So it's a great opportunity for groups, militant Islamist groups, to take advantage of the situation and attack in the way they did yesterday.",
        "It was Secretary of State Clinton who said this morning that Americans - this was - she said this is a small, savage group, not to be confused with the Libyan government or the Libyan people.",
