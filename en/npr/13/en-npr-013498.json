        "North Korea has disabled much of its key plutonium-producing facilities at Yongbyon.",
        "At the moment those talks are bogged down over how the U.S.",

        "And Pyongyang has resisted divulging its uranium enrichment activities and whether its shared nuclear technology with others, especially with Syria.",

        "But I'm not convinced that the North Koreans are really serious about denuclearization.",
        "And I worry that that's a risky move, that you set yourself up for failure for accepting a nuclear North Korea at the end, when I think that'd be extremely dangerous for the security and stability of the whole region.",

        "Much clearer than the Bush administration as to what the ultimate destination is.",
        "What type of relationship does the United States want to have with North Korea?",
        "And to make that as clear as possible, including all the benefits that would accrue to Pyongyang if they went down this path, that's something that the Bush administration never really made clear because there was so much ambivalence within the administration about the whole idea of talking to the North.",
        "And that's one advantage the Obama administration may have over its predecessor, there is likely to be much less discord within the administration about engaging North Korea.",
        "John Wolfsthal believes that will increase the likelihood of a successful diplomatic process.",

        "I cannot describe it as normal, but I think it's also true to say that many areas of Baghdad are much better now than they were six months ago.",
        "There are areas in Baghdad that have returned to normality or something approximating normality.",
        "It's a gradual process.",
        "Ambassador Ryan Crocker, in testifying at long distance from Baghdad before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said today the one word that sums up the atmosphere in Iraq today in the neighborhoods of the nation is fear, he said."
