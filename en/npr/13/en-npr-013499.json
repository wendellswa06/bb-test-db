        "What do you say to an American who's listening and following the news who says, we went over there on some very bad intelligence, it hasn't worked out the way our leaders said it would, the time pressures on our military and the time pressures on your political leaders do not square, we're going to run out of strength before you've got enough of a reconciliation going, and it might be best for Iraqis as well for Americans to just get out of there?",

        "The price will be a destabilized Middle East, rampant international terrorism, which is bound to visit you here at home sooner or later.",
        "So some clear thinking has to be made about the price of these decisions.",
