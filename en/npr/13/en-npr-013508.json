        "Basically it's up to the judge, yes.",
        "What the government says is that this alleged attempt to tamper with witnesses is a violation of Manafort's release conditions that have allowed him to live basically under what's called home confinement.",
        "The government says anything short of detention - so jail time - won't guarantee that he won't violate federal law again by, say, attempting to tamper with witnesses.",
        "And it's worth remembering that this is not the first time that prosecutors have complained about Manafort's behavior since he was charged.",
        "Early on in the case, they said that they had intercepted emails showing that Manafort was helping write an opinion piece to try to get - to try to influence views of his actions in the lobbying work that he was doing in Ukraine, and that was running afoul of a gag order that the judge had in this case.",
        "All right.",
        "So last question.",
        "Sort of a big one, but, in the course of our conversation, I don't think you've said the word Russia, which is the central question in the Mueller investigation.",
        "So put this development with Manafort into that broader context for us.",
        "Well, Manafort's - the charges related to Manafort relate to his lobbying work in Ukraine, but that falls within the parameters of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.",
        "What this does is potentially increase the pressure on Manafort and could really ramp up the pressure if the judge decides that Manafort should await trial in jail.",
        "His trial is currently scheduled for the fall.",
        "Now, the prospect of awaiting trial in jail is not something that anyone relishes.",
        "Manafort matters because he was the campaign chair for a key period of the Trump campaign.",
        "If you recall, he took part in key moments like the meeting in Trump Tower with the Russian lawyer offering dirt on Clinton.",
        "So Manafort may have information that is of interest to Mueller's team, and this would increase the pressure and perhaps get him to decide to cooperate.",
        "NPR's Ryan Lucas.",
        "Thank you.",
        "For days, President Trump has refused to back away from a policy of splitting families who have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.",
        "Today that changed.",
        "Trump signed an executive order ending the policy.",
        "Here he is at a White House signing ceremony today.",

        "It's about keeping families together while at the same time being sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border.",
        "And border security will be equal if not greater than previously.",

        "It sure has.",
        "All right, so details.",
        "What is - what exactly is in this executive order?",
        "Well, I've been reading through it, and I can tell you it says that it is the policy of the administration to rigorously enforce immigration law but also to maintain family unity.",
        "And it doesn't end the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy of prosecuting anyone caught crossing the border illegally that was announced by the administration in April and is of course what led to families being detained and separated.",
        "So this executive order today keeps that in place, but it does allow families to be detained together.",
        "And I should say there are some caveats.",
        "It says where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources.",
        "And they can't be detained together if there's concern the parent would pose a risk to the child.",
        "It calls on federal agency heads to help provide housing when appropriate.",
        "But beyond that, Mary Louise, there's not a lot of detail about where these families will be housed or how they'll be prosecuted.",
        "Details still to be worked out.",
        "Do we know, Sarah, what prompted this change of heart?",
        "Well, what we do know is there's been more reporting coming out from the facilities where children are kept - these images of children corralled behind fences, pictures of crying children.",
        "And when President Trump signed the executive order today, he said he didn't like what he was hearing about.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "So we're going to have strong - very strong borders, but we're going to keep the families together.",
        "I didn't like the sight or the feeling of families being separated.",
        "And not only that, we know public opinion polls suggest a majority of voters oppose family separation.",
        "There's been a groundswell of opposition from a wide range of groups, including many in the president's evangelical base, reports that his daughter Ivanka and first lady Melania Trump expressed concern about this.",
        "And a White House official told us today that Melania Trump pressed the president to end family separation.",
        "So there's been mounting pressure to stop this.",
        "Again, this comes after days - comes after weeks of the administration insisting that the law required them to separate families.",
        "So..."

        "What is true, though, is that Congress has failed repeatedly to pass more comprehensive immigration legislation despite many calls for it over many years.",

        "All right, I've also got a copy of the president's order here with me.",
