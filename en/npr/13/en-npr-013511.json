        "What's interesting is that there are those analysts who are watching from outside and inside Iran who think that there could become a more intense power struggle for power in Iran between the hardline right-wingers that have consolidated themselves around President Ahmadinejad, who has been in office for about a year and a half, and what they call more traditionalists or conservatives, but not radical conservatives, around the supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Khamenei.",
        "And there's no precedent for this; that is, the Assembly of Experts constitutionally can choose a supreme religious leader and choose to remove him.",
        "This is never been done in the Islamic Republic of Iran, but it's not out of the realm of constitutional possibility.",
        "And there are some who think that there maybe some hardline on the right who want to do that.",
        "Well, how much power does he wield compared to Ahmadinejad, the president?",
        "He wields far more power than Ahmadinejad.",
        "Although he is far less known internationally, and even less known domestically.",
        "He works more quietly as a political leader, but he holds much more power.",
        "And part of the potential struggle around the Assembly of Experts is that Ahmadinejad and the much more hardline clerics that support him want more power.",
        "They want more power for the president, because they're not satisfied with Ali Khamenei's more traditionalist and more careful pragmatic decisions.",
        "And when it comes to negotiating with Iran, what is the United States to do?",
        "Negotiate officially with the president, and then unofficially with Khamenei?",
        "This is a very difficult problem to solve, because when the United States talks about engagement with Iran, it's not always entirely clear who to engage with.",
        "It would be normal to go to the president and the president's apparatus, the foreign ministry.",
        "But knowing that there are other centers of power, it poses in an especially difficult problem for the United States, to know who to talk to, and to feel confident that when things are agreed with that interlocutor, that that stands for the position of the Iranian government, because it doesn't always.",
        "And Mike, obviously you get a lot more information when you're on the ground in Iran.",
        "But what are the potential outcomes of the election?",
        "Well, I can think of two.",
        "If more pragmatic conservatives maintain control of the Assembly Of Experts, then it seems that Ali Khamenei's position is preserved.",
        "They delivered somewhat of a rebuff to the hard right wing, and it might mean greater concensus and perhaps the greater ability to respond to the United States, to take more moderate policies vis-à-vis Iraq, and maybe to go more carefully on the nuclear issue, which has been so controversial between Iran and the United States.",
        "On the other hand, if the hardline right wing gains control of the Assembly of Experts, this will bolster Ahmadinejad and the Ayatollahs that back him, and then you could see in Iran maybe more defiant on the international stage, more confident of its more conservative positions and a more difficult nation to deal with.",
        "NPR's Mike Shuster, thank you."
