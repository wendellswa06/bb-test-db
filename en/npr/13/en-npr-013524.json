        "These are individuals who are very committed to their life of crime and expanding their domination to whatever sectors in the community they can reach, whether it be the prison community or at large, in cities, counties and states.",
        "And is this the best way to deal with that?",
        "I think at this particular time, it is about the only way, to be honest with you, that we have found that we're able to manage a degree of their criminal activity, is this type of security housing unit.",
        "Yet you've seen how people live in these conditions, and people do go crazy in there.",
        "Well, you know, I beg to differ on that point.",
        "The Madrid lawsuit that was before the federal courts did not indicate that the facility itself contributed to mental illness.",
        "Rather what it did indicate, or state very clearly, was that if you had someone who was mentally ill and because of their mental illness was, in fact, involved in a lot of problems, behavioral problems, that the environment in the security housing unit could exacerbate that.",
        "As a result of that, the federal court, Judge Henderson, ruled that what we would have to do is two things.",
        "One, those inmates that were diagnosed with a serious mental illness could not be housed in that particular security housing unit, had to be placed in a different area of the institution and provided psychiatric services."

        "And so we have a cadre of psychologists and licensed clinical social workers that are assigned specifically to the security housing unit who make rounds, like a doctor would at hospitals, interviewing the men, talking to the men - also, the training of correctional staff to be able to identify, from a rudimentary perspective, when an inmate may be having some problems and make those immediate referrals.",

        "I never asked about it.",
        "You don't question the superintendent.",

        "That point, it - the point that you're making, if you look at it on the surface, that's correct.",
        "One of the things that you have to take in consideration, though, is that we have a long history in managing prison gangs in the state of California.",
        "In the past, we have tried to have the gang members, in a sense, spread out through the original 12 institutions.",

        "What we do know is that now that we have concentrated them at Pelican Bay State Prison and also at Corcoran State Prison that, basically, what has happened is we've been able to better manage their criminal activities, so we have had a positive impact.",

        "But I think that's more of a direct consequence of growth in the inmate population.",

        "So anything that we give to the inmate and they use, they find creative ways of altering them to be able to commit their criminal activities.",

        "For those inmates that do have a mental illness, we do get them treatment, but the treatment is not very good treatment, and that's always been my concern as a clinician.",
