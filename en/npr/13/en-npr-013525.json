        "Well, I notice when the guys first get transferred in, the adjustment period is critical, because some of the guys, once they first get in there, before they adjust, they do go into acting out behaviors because this is the only way they know how to get their needs met, and so they will act out, a lot of them, when they first get in.",
        "So a lot of times, I just try to get back with the guys and observe them.",
        "And if I do notice that they're going to - I think they're decompensating that bad, I'll get the psychiatrist involved.",
        "And if we need medication, medication is ordered at that point.",
        "Laura Sullivan, how typical is Tom's experience?",
        "Well, you know, it's interesting because New Jersey is one of the least restrictive isolation units in the country.",
        "They allow televisions.",
        "They allow some of the yard to be sort of group yard through different cages so they can talk a little bit to each other.",
        "But they also allow telephones, and because of that and because of working on this story, a number of inmates often call me from the New Jersey isolation ward.",
        "And a lot of them talk about - and this is something I found in a number of other states, as well - this real us versus them mentality that takes place between the officers and the inmates.",
        "And because of that, because there's such a separation between the two and because there's such an animosity, actually, between, there's - at Pelican Bay, I saw nothing but respect from the officers to the inmates, but there was definitely a line.",
        "And because of that, a lot of the inmates say that they see the clinical psychologist as part of the prison system, and they're afraid to talk to them.",
        "They're afraid to say anything to them.",
        "They're afraid that they're part of the enemy.",
        "And, I think, in the end that that's - that really hurts them because it takes away the one actual resource that's given to them.",
        "Yeah, I kind of agree with that us against them dichotomy that goes on.",
        "As a therapist, it's, part of my clinical work is making sure I remove myself as not being seen as working for DOC but also being able to be an agent for these guys that I work with.",
        "But, however, there's also that thing that how DOC sees me.",
        "Am I taking the side of the inmate?",
        "Which is an interesting position for me to be in.",
        "Yeah.",
        "DOC, Department of Corrections, I assume.",
        "Yes.",
        "One other point I just want to make.",
        "When guys do get into (unintelligible) in New Jersey, they don't have those privileges first.",
        "There's no TVs and all that.",
        "Those are kind of like incentives to work on themselves to get those privileges back while they're in (unintelligible) and they behave correctly."

        "Things like access to TV and things like that.",
        "I think that the Department of Corrections is, in fact, looking at things like incentives for security housing units.",
        "We're looking at an interim step, what we call behavior modification unit, where it's a combination of incentives and work programs, education programs that will allow those inmates coming out of security housing units to begin to adapt and begin to make some changes.",
        "I think that what New Jersey is taking about is a little bit different than what we have, because inmates in the security housing unit already have televisions, they already have access to a DVD or a CD player - I'm sorry, not DVD, I meant CD player.",
        "So, they have appliances that they can have in their cells.",
        "And we run full education programs.",

        "People in these security housing units or Supermax prisons are placed in an environment where they have been wrenched from their social setting and from social connections.",
        "And after time, they begin not only to suffer in this experience or as a result of this experience, but they begin to deteriorate.",
        "They lose control of their emotions at times.",

        "Well, it's certainly not typical.",
        "You know, there are a small - very, very small percentage of people who - in part because the chaos of the larger prison system is very difficult for them to deal with and adjust to and adapt to - find that, for at least brief periods of time when they're placed in solitary confinement or isolation, that they can find solitude.",
        "The problem is that oftentimes changes are taking place in them that they're not aware of and for many, many other people this kind of enforced isolation is a very painful experience.",
        "Four and a half years is a very long time for somebody to be in solitary confinement and so I'm surprised that the caller didn't notice adverse, or negative, changes in himself once released.",
        "But, as you know, many people are kept in solitary confinement for even much longer than that, and they begin to adjust and adapt to that isolation in ways that really impedes their ability to interact with other people once their released.",
        "And Laura, you did an interview with a man who, well, could almost be the epitome of what Craig Haney's talking about.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "He spent - I mean, he just spends all of his time now alone.",
