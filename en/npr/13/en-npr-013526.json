        "Gangs are a very real problem in prisons, not just in California, but around the country.",

        "Well, yes gangs are a very serious problem and ironically Lieutenant Perez also conceded that the gang problem has intensified over the same period of time during which we have resorted increasingly to the use of these solitary or super max units.",
        "There is no evidence to suggest that these units are effective in eradicating or even limiting the gang problem in prisons in the United States.",
        "They're a short term solution.",
        "They provide a relatively short term and simple, but I think in the long run ill-advised, apparent solution to the problem.",
        "Because you take people who are identified as gang members or leaders and you remove them from the mainline population.",
        "Unfortunately, that leaves a series of other problems in its wake.",
        "Those gang leaders who are concentrated in these isolation units then have very little in their life to think about or care about except for the gang.",
        "And so, they're left in their cells 23 hours a day, nothing to look forward to, nothing to work towards, and their gang allegiance - from everything that my research suggests - intensifies rather than lessens.",
        "In addition, you've done nothing to address the problem - the various problems in the forces in the larger prison system, in the mainline prison from which that person was taken that led to the creation of the gangs in the first place.",
        "Gangs don't emerge in a vacuum.",
        "They have come about and our prisons are plagued with them for reasons.",
        "Those reasons have largely to do with overcrowding and idleness and a lack of productive activity in the prison system.",
        "Super max prisons and isolation do nothing to address those problems.",
        "And so what has happened is that we have taken gang leaders and members and put them in theses units, other people have stepped forward in those mainline prisons to take their place, the gangs have multiplied, they have gotten stronger and more numerous, and we are now faced with a gang problem that is worse in the year 2006 than it was in 1970, 1972 or 3 when I first began to study these issues.",

        "I think - I'm trying to think how to articulate this.",
        "A huge part of the problem is that there seems to be too much - the corrections officers enjoy using the solitary confinement rules to punishment the prisoners - prisoners in solitary confinement or even in the general population.",
        "If you don't let a prisoner read his legal papers, you don't let a prisoner get any mail.",
        "You don't let him look at a newspaper.",
        "You don't let him watch the news to see does the outside world even still exist.",
        "It seems to me that we've got to be able to come up with something else, perhaps a segmented, slightly more secure version of the general population where you can keep Group A segregated from Group B, if you must.",
        "But this solitary confinement, the way it's practiced now, and the corrections industry in general seems to exist solely for the torment - or solely for the pleasure that the corrections officers get from tormenting their prisoners."

        "And he thought, I wonder if there's a way where I can just get a handle on this gang problem and get a handle on the behavior.",

        "The courts throughout all these years have agreed on a number of occasions that this punishment - and one of the cases said that it bordered on inhuman behavior.",
        "However, all the courts have deferred to the states so far, saying that the states know best how to incarcerate inmates and that it is up to the states to decide.",
        "And one final question to you, Craig Haney.",
        "There are a lot of men who are going to be coming out of these solitary confinement situations - as we've said, many of them for many years.",
        "Are there programs to help them reintegrate back into a world that they haven't experienced, sometimes for 20 years?",
        "Well, unfortunately, Neal, there are very few of these kinds of programs.",
        "These transitional or step-down programs are critical given the psychological assaults on people who are in solitary confinement that we've been talking about.",
        "Obviously, people need an opportunity to ease back into society or ease back into an environment where they have more interaction with people.",
        "There are very few of these programs in operation throughout the United States.",
        "And, you know, I should note that not everybody who is coming out of a solitary confinement unit is a gang member or has been placed in solitary because of gang affiliations."
