        "He writes what really sticks out in his mind was the end of the night.",

        "But you'll have to pay for the phone separately, which means it might be expensive.",
        "Yeah, and when we say expensive, we're talking maybe $500 if you were to buy it without a phone package.",
        "That is correct.",
        "So it could be as much as $500 to actually just buy this phone - which is something Google wanted to do because Google wants to make it possible for people to buy a device without having to sign up with a carrier.",
        "Google clearly is trying to start a trend that would separate devices from carriers.",
        "For example, people are upset that you have to sign up with AT&T to get an iPhone.",

        "Hmm.",
        "�which is a tablet computer that everybody is expecting Apple to announce by the end of January.",
        "And this is essentially - a tablet computer is something where you have a screen and you use a sort of, you know, touch-point pen.",
        "And you can navigate around, and it will have 3D images.",
        "And everybody's talking about this new iSlate as the second coming.",
