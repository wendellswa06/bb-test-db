        "Well, Facebook decided to use software to automatically zap any link to that offensive article unless the person who posted it put a caption that was critical of it, OK?",

        "Since that time, it's down to six, six minutes of coverage per week.",
        "So we've gone down from 27 to six and it was like a light was switched off.",

        "So do you think that the decline in coverage is based largely on economics?",
        "Well, you know, I'd like to believe so, and the LA Times foreign editor would certainly have us believe that economics is at the heart and there's no question newspapers are in trouble.",
        "But when you look at the decline in coverage of Iraq, it's not just remote coverage, foreign coverage, that's failing to get the airtime or the print space.",

        "It's not just the cost of sending the reporters, it's also the cost of doing business in a war zone.",
        "And in fact in some articles, journalists have said, Well, I don't know, is it worth cutting back on other foreign coverage to cover the war?",
        "Yeah, I'd still complain that that doesn't account for the failure to do good reporting about what happens to U.S.",

        "You know, it goes back to what happened to our news industry, where if our news division doesn't make a profit, it's considered a failure.",
        "Yet there is a responsibility on the part of our media to cover these critical stories, there are choices being made to send 319 people to Beijing and keep barely half a dozen in Iraq, and then there are a whole lot of other choices being made, too.",
        "It's not just about money.",
        "Andrew, let me get...",
        "Yes, up until last September, which was the breaking point that I talked about, there was enormous coverage.",
        "They were swallowing those costs for years.",
        "In fact, 2004, 2005, 2006 you could argue that it actually was more dangerous in Baghdad then than it is now.",
        "So the cost of security and stuff, that was greater then than it is now.",
        "But it's only now that the cutback in coverage has happened.",
        "So, they were spending an awful lot of money on an unpopular story for year after year after year, and then they just suddenly stopped doing it.",
        "And I will remind once again there is a difference between what the big dominant media are doing and the amount of news time that is going to Iraq in the networks and Andrew's reporting.",
        "You know, two minutes per network per week is what we're getting today.",
        "Less than three percent of the news hole, when it was 23 percent last fall.",
        "At that level, we're seeing the change.",
        "At the level of local newspapers covering what's happening to their local troops coming home, there's a very different picture, so we have another set of choices being made about what stories are we in the power media going to pick up and run with in addition to all this stuff about where are we going to deploy our people.",
        "Let me jump in and ask Andrew, where is the news coverage going?",
        "I mean since what you do is really look at the networks and parse out, you know, what individual topics they cover, often you look at the guests.",
