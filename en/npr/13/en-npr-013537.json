        "Yes, well what you said in your introduction is absolutely right.",
        "You hit the nail on the head there.",
        "But the extent to which you're right, I think you really underestimated it.",
        "First of all, my database happens to go back comparing this election cycle to the previous five election cycles.",
        "And the campaign coverage for the first half of 2008, January through June, exceeded each other cycle by an order of magnitude.",
        "Let's put it this way, the campaign coverage for this race, 2008, is greater than the campaign coverage for 2000 and 2004 combined.",
        "That's how newsworthy this election cycle has been.",
        "So there's a lot where you can say actually the campaign coverage has just taken the oxygen out of all other coverage on the national level.",
        "Not just Iraq, but all other stories.",
        "There is one other story that has survived and actually thrived in the current news environment and that is the story on the economy.",
        "You know, if you add together gasoline prices, food prices, housing prices, stock prices, unemployment, all of those stories all added together and we are on a pace this year in 2008 to have the highest level of economy coverage on the network newscasts in the last two decades.",
        "The previous high was in the recession of 1990 and this is more - this economy is more newsworthy than the economy was in the recession of 1990.",
        "Do you think that's a bad thing, though?",
        "I mean, the economy, if you had to say what was on people's minds I would guesstimate that the economy is first, you know, whether your wallet is in trouble and then the presidential election, and Iraq far after.",
        "Isn't a matter of giving people what...?",
        "Absolutely, you know, we can talk about - we can deplore or be critical of the networks for pulling back their resources in the coverage of Iraq, and that's one statement, which - I mean, it's a true statement and I think they have overdone their pullback.",
        "But you can't criticize them for saying, and as a consequence of pulling back they've resorted to fluff.",
        "But you can say that there is a connection between the two, as that excellent public editor of the Sacramento Bee reported in the end of March.",
        "You know this country is spending - we taxpayers are spending twelve and a half billion a month, or nearly 5,000 dollars a second on this deployment in Iraq.",
        "That isn't unrelated to the economic picture.",
        "So again, if media wanted to integrate these stories, give people the big picture from which they can make sense of their world, they could.",
        "They're not doing it.",
        "And also, it's true to say that one of the major issues in the presidential campaign is, what should our policy be in Iraq?",
        "So, you know, the Iraq story is being covered indirectly through the prism of campaign coverage.",
        "And there's hardly a campaign event where some protester doesn't show up.",
        "So, again if, you wanted to put that into the story, you could.",
        "Let me pull out a little bit from what we've been talking about, and ask each of you to give me a little bit of perspective.",
        "Do you think that the news media that all of us are a part of in some way will be equipped to continue coverage of this war, as it extends indefinitely, but certainly for the coming year - couple years?",
        "Laura?",
        "I think we're equipped, we've got people on the ground we can talk to via Skype.",
        "We've got people we can read the blogs of, and distribute what they're saying.",
        "We've got reporters, like the photographer who was recently kicked out of Iraq for showing the photograph of a dead Marine whose photograph we could put front and center."

        "I think we have the means, and we're increasingly developing contacts in the region that we can use.",

        "Yes, I think, you know, we talk about Iraq, but actually what's newsworthy about Iraq is the Iraq war, and there's a whole lot of policies with regard to Iraq that are going to be much harder for the news media, especially the video and television news media to cover.",

        "What should the oil - should the oil leases to be given to multinational firms, or should the oil industry stay nationalized in Iraq?",
        "You know, the internal politics in Iraq, stuff like that, where there isn't any blood on the screen, it's much harder for video news to cover.",

        "They don't sunset.",
        "And also, the pre-Patriot Act powers could be interpreted very, very broadly.",
        "So The USA Freedom Act is not perfect, but by actually introducing those transparency reforms, it addresses the real concerns that a lot of civil libertarians have.",
        "So I think that, frankly, people in this debate on both sides of it are just confused about what's really at stake.",

        "So, the frustrating thing is that Rand Paul could take a very simple, straightforward, coherent position, which is that ISIS is their fight.",
        "It's not our fight.",
        "It's not our concern.",
        "We shouldn't be there.",

        "He's saying that, well, no, in fact, we should be involved in the fight against ISIS.",
        "But then he's saying that, well, it should involve Arab troops, not U.S.",
        "troops.",
        "Well, the Iraqi government is fielding a lot of Arab troops.",
        "And, so that, you know, they would fight rather than U.S.",
        "troops, we gave them arms.",
        "But in this statement, he's saying that, well, that's a terrible thing.",
        "We gave them all these arms willy-nilly.",
        "But, you know, again, if you're saying we ought to fight ISIS, if you're saying that we ought to care, then it's either Arab troops, proxies that are going to fight that war with, presumably, U.S.",
        "arms, or it's going to be us fighting them directly.",
        "So I think that, actually, Rand Paul's found himself in this weird muddle.",
        "He's trying to be too clever by half, and it means that he's just, you know, offering a less-clear distinction for the kind of libertarian voters who normally who have lived liked him, but he's also not appealing to the kind of hawkish, traditional GOP voter.",
        "So I don't what he's trying to do here.",
        "Meanwhile, Suzy Khimm, I mean, this is going to be a problem for Democrats, right?",
        "I don't see this ISIS question going away.",
        "Yeah, and I think it's one reason that, I think, Democrats are kind of relieved that this debate isn't one that is being had out on the floor of Congress right now.",
        "This is something that President Obama has really wanted, is to have Congress formally authorize the war against ISIS.",
        "I think, privately at least, many folks are sort of relieved to see the fact that this isn't something that is going to be hashed out in that kind of way.",
        "I mean, the reality is that things aren't going well - very well in the fight against ISIS.",
        "We saw the fall of Ramadi a few weeks ago.",
        "That's an understatement.",
        "(Laughter) And I think, you know, the reality is we're sort of seeing that the shortcomings and the limitations in terms of the Obama administration's own strategy there in terms of committing airpower and airstrikes, but saying that he's sort of drawing a line, that there aren't going to be troops on the ground.",
        "So I think that that does put Democrats in a difficult position, which it's clear that the administration's strategy at this point doesn't seem to be enough, yet folks on both sides, I think, are very reluctant in terms of actually moving forward and committing ground troops.",
        "And this matters because, of course, it seems like something that's going to come up in 2016.",
        "And this week, we had another several people jump into the race - Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders making it official in Burlington, Vt.",
        "You had former Senator Rick Santorum, former New York Governor George Pataki.",
        "I hear O'Malley is on the way.",
        "Lindsey Graham might announce in the coming week.",
        "In the last minute, Reihan, any of those do you think we should keep an eye on, right?",
        "Well, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley are interesting because, in a way, if you ask me, a candidate - a Democratic candidate who could really take off right now would be a candidate who speaks intelligently and in a compelling way about racial justice, given the Democratic coalition.",
        "And I don't think either of those candidates is well-placed to do that.",
        "On the Republican side, you know, Rick Santorum has a lot of problems, a lot of challenges, but he is talking about things like raising the minimum wage - an idea that, you know, while I might have objections to it, is actually pretty popular among GOP primary voters.",
        "And, actually, there's no one else who's kind of zag-ing while everyone else is zig-ing in this way.",
        "So, you know, he might wind up being relevant in the discussion.",
        "George Pataki, in contrast, is a guy who is endorsed by the teachers unions and other, you know, big public-sector unions.",
        "So I don't see him having much of a future in Republican politics.",
        "That's all the time we have for now.",
        "But with many, many more announcements on the way, I hope we will get to talk more about it.",
