        "Turns out we all do it in a similar way.",
        "I'm talking about development.",
        "For years, scientists new very little about the process of development.",
        "They knew how it started with the meeting of sperm and egg; but how that one fertilized egg grew into a million celled or trillion celled organism was somewhat of a mystery, the black box of biology sort to speak.",
        "Well, new technologies developed in the last 20 years or so have allowed scientists to see what's happening in that black box.",
        "And they found that development in wildly different organisms is remarkably similar.",
        "By looking at the relatively small number of genes that control development, biologists say they can learn a lot about evolution.",
        "This new branch of biology even has the catchy title, which I've been using because I like to say it, Evo-Devo, for Evolutionary Developmental Biology.",
        "And joining me now to talk more about it is my guest Sean B.",

        "Why is this a new field of endeavor?",
        "Well, as you mentioned in the last 20 years we finally got a peak inside the black box of embryos.",
        "And I guess let me start with an analogy.",
        "If you consider the construction of a building what would it look like to us if we didn't see the workers and the machinery putting that together?",
        "It would look as though the building assembled itself or was put there by some magical force.",
        "Now that we can see the workers and the machinery, now we understand how things are put together.",
        "And now that we understand the making of an individual building, some particular species, we understand how differences in the way those workers and machinery put things together give you the different kinds of buildings that we see.",
        "In this case the different kinds of buildings that are different kinds of animals we see in the animal kingdom.",
        "Ah, now I meant to invite our listeners to join this conversation.",
        "The number is 800-989-8255; that's 800-989-TALK.",
        "So okay.",
        "So you talk about a molecular tool kit for building, I mean, what exactly are we talking about there?",
        "Well, a small fraction of all the genes we have or any other animal has, are really devoted to organ building and body building.",
        "With the rest of the genes really carrying out basic physiological tasks like getting nutrients in and flushing things out or the specialized jobs of the types of cells we have, like those fore carrying oxygen or for fighting off invaders and things like this.",
        "But the building, the putting your backbone in place, deciding the number of vertebrae, the number of ribs, where the hands are going to go, how many digits, where do the eyes go, how many there will be, the color of fur or skin or scales or feathers.",
        "These are the tool kit genes.",
        "They are shaping the size, the number and the color of bodies and body parts.",
        "So if these, if this idea that there's a relatively small tool kit that builds everything up from the same sort of set of principles.",
        "If that's the new idea what did people used to think?",
        "They used to think that really there was entirely different genetic recipe for different forms of organisms.",
        "It was an intuitive bias that we just didn't see the connection between say something like a tiny fruit fly and a magnificent human.",
        "Our expectations were that there would be entirely different rules and entirely different materials being used in assembling the bodies of these different animals.",
        "So how does this idea square with you know what Darwin was talking about, about how different species evolve?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Now, does that suggest… Well first of all, it appeared in the Vatican Newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, is that official?"

        "So now, you have many Africans that want to take advantage of traditional medicine, but they don't want to acknowledge the roots.",
        "So the roots, as I'm saying, is understand your relationship with ancestors in terms of ancestors being a part of the community.",
        "The use of divination - on the surface, I mean, we've seen different things, maybe on TV or someone is throwing bones or caraway shells and then makes a pronouncement.",
        "But divination is creating a space where you have objects that have a metaphorical representation with respect to elements of a person's life.",
        "Divination is something that takes training.",
        "And as of all cultures, of course, there's herbal medicine and understanding of diet.",
        "But the fundamental premise with African culture is linking everything back, with God and the ancestors being at the central core.",
        "We did an interview with someone who is a spiritual leader in one of the many traditional African spiritual practices.",
        "And what you're talking about sounds, in many ways, more like spirituality than medicine.",
        "Do you see yourself practicing both, or how, I mean...?",
        "Well, I mean, I'm a regular doc.",
        "So I practice a number of disciplines.",
        "But by bringing spirituality into what you're doing, that helps you in terms of being more effective with people.",
        "The difficulty in this country, I guess with respect to African-Americans incorporating more traditional African medicine, because traditional African medicine doesn't, in many respects, make that distinction between God and the medicine that they work with, you know, with plants and herbs, right?",
        "African-Americans here have been trained to think that the God they worship is different than the God that's worshipped by indigenous Africans.",
        "So, as a result - and they've been trained to, you know, look down on things that are African, you know, so, we'll talk, we'll use words like voodoo or witchdoctor.",
        "So part of it is just a mindset.",
        "But spirituality - how can you be a healer without embracing some aspects of the spirit?",
        "You can't.",
        "So there's a real distinction between practicing medicine, the dispension of drugs, making a diagnosis and actually working to heal people."

        "Well, I think we're at an interesting crossroads, because modern medicine has had to acknowledge that there are other forms of medicine because of the way people are spending their dollar.",
        "People spend more money seeing alternative practitioners than they do in seeing their primary care doctors.",
