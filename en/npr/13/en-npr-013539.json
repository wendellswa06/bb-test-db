        "Some of the latest criticisms come from Holly Petraeus, the wife of CIA director and former General David Petraeus.",
        "She works at the Consumer Financial Protection Agency, and her job is to protect service members from financial abuse.",
        "We spoke to her to find out more about the issue.",
        "Holly, good morning.",
        "Good morning.",
        "In a recent op-ed that you did for The New York Times, you wrote that for-profit colleges see service members, military service members as nothing more than dollars signs in uniform.",
        "Can you tell me what you meant by that?",
        "Well, there's a real incentive for for-profits to see them that way because of something called the 90/10 rule, which says that for-profit colleges can only get 90 percent of their money from Title IV education funds, and the 10 percent has to come from somewhere else.",
        "But the fact is that military tuition assistance and the GI Bill are not Title IV education funds, so they end up in the 10 percent category, which means for every service member that a for-profit college can sign up, that then gives them the ability to sign up nine other people who are using Title IV funds.",
        "It's a bit of a complicated formula.",
        "I want to make sure I understand it correctly.",
        "So for-profit colleges, the law was going to try and make sure they weren't getting all of their money in the form of federal dollars, and so they have to get at least 10 percent of their money from somewhere else, not the Department of Education.",
        "And they seem to have found a loophole, here.",
        "If they can recruit a lot of members of the military who are returning and using this GI Bill money to get college degrees, that helps them reach their 10 percent of non-Department of Education money.",
        "Exactly.",
        "I suppose one of the challenges for people returning from the battlefield - I mean Iraq, Afghanistan - you don't have a lot of time to dig in and research your options for once you get back.",
        "No.",
        "And I think there's two different things at play, here.",
        "When you're on active duty, for promotion, you really need to have some college under your belt - better still, a degree.",
        "So active duty service members are really looking for a college that can quickly kind of give them that education, and for-profits have definitely seen a niche there and offered convenience, military affinity and online education.",
        "But the question is: When they come to getting out of the service, will those courses that they took translate into a college afterwards, or translate into something that makes them attractive to an employer?",
        "And the case often is not.",
        "One of the things that you pointed out in your article that seemed most alarming was that some of these schools were actually going to military bases and doing recruiting in places where veterans were being treated for brain injury, traumatic brain injury?",
        "Yeah.",
        "There was certainly a very egregious case of that, where a recruiter did go to a wounded warrior barracks and basically signed up the folks there, despite the fact that some of them did have brain injury and really didn't have the cognitive skills, frankly, at that point to be successful at school."

        "We should say, I guess, that these schools are not doing anything illegal.",
        "No, they aren't.",
        "It's aggressive, but it's not illegal.",
        "And so tell us what you think needs to change to protect these veterans and these service members coming home?",
        "They definitely need to investigate the colleges that they're going to take courses from to be sure they are getting quality.",
        "And also, frankly, as long as the military education money is in the 10-percent category, I think the very aggressive chasing after service members is going to continue.",

        "He got a bounce out of his Democratic convention.",
        "In fact, a day ago, he was up to 50 percent of the vote, with an eight point lead over John McCain.",
        "Now, that is back down to a six point lead, so I would suspect that, if McCain is going to get a bounce, and we suspect he will based on history, it's going to be reflected over the next several days."

        "Well, we didn't see any immediate effects.",

        "And in terms of affecting the overall race, that is, you know, McCain getting some kind of giant bounce out of his announcement, we didn't see it at all.",
        "In fact, if anything, Obama kept and expanded his lead slightly.",
        "So she didn't affect the overall structure of the race one bit.",
        "We did do some internal analysis with our large samples, and we were able to determine that Republican women look like they shifted a little more towards McCain.",
        "By that, I mean that he gained five or six points.",
        "He already had 80 percent, but it went even higher.",
        "So I think, in the short term, she may have helped solidify the Republican base, which I think was one of the goals of selecting her, but so far, we haven't seen any major impact on the numbers.",
        "Well, what about independents, that's another goal, is to win over independents or swing voters.",
        "What about that?",
        "That's right.",
        "We looked at it carefully, and prior to the announcement, independent women - white independent women - we black out blacks and Hispanics because they're very strong towards Obama and really don't vary by gender, but white independent women are very much on the fence.",
        "They've been breaking about even between Obama and McCain.",
        "So we suspect that they would be most vulnerable to a push, say, by a selection of the female vice president.",
        "But we didn't see any change there specific to gender.",
        "Where we did see the change was Republican women, as I mentioned, becoming stronger in their support for McCain.",
        "Now, have you polled the former Hillary supporters, who didn't like Obama initially and said they were voting for McCain, where they stand now?",
        "We did.",
        "It got a lot of press because our pre-Democratic convention poll showed that only 70 percent, seven out of ten Hillary Democrats, former Hillary Clinton supporters, said they were going to vote for Obama.",
        "An amazing 16 percent told us they were going to vote for McCain, and 14 percent said they were undecided.",
        "So we went back in over the weekend and looked at our data, and sure enough, it did look like the Democratic convention brought some of them back home.",
        "Now, 81 percent are voting for Obama, and a higher percent of those than before say they're committed to Obama.",
        "So we did have a jump-up, for Hillary voters are less likely to be defectors than they were prior to the convention, but that still leaves about 19 percent who are not willing to tell a pollster they're going to vote for Obama.",
        "These are Democrats who tell us they supported Hillary Clinton earlier this year, and 19 percent still say they're either going to vote for McCain or they're undecided.",
        "But that's shrinking.",
        "That was 30 percent prior to the Democratic convention.",
        "So all of the focus on Senator Clinton and the fact that she very verbally says I'm supporting Barack Obama now, and the prominence given to her and her husband at the convention seem to at least have had some of the desired impact for the Democrats.",
        "And did you ask them what they thought of Sarah Palin?"

        "Well, on a contextual basis, a relative basis, the two things stand out.",
        "Fewer people were able to get any comment about Sarah Palin than previous vice presidents, and, second, more people said she was unqualified or not qualified to be president.",

        "And, in fact, on a racial basis, it was just as positive as the reaction was to Joe Biden's selection by Obama the week before.",
