        "You still have to have something that says, Okay, what's controlling the tool kit to come up with the different form?",
        "Exactly, the operating instructions.",
        "Right.",
        "So what we were expecting was that the genes themselves were changing.",
        "And we've been looking at genes and the genetic code for 40 years.",
        "And the expectation was with it sort of the inventory of tools used for building different animals would be different.",
        "But really what makes animals different, what makes us different from apes and apes different from other mammals, etcetera, is how the tool kit is used.",
        "Those operating instructions are also encoded in DNA, but they've been in a part of the DNA that we haven't spent much time.",
        "It is much harder to decode and decipher and this is really one of the current problems in biology is deciphering what I refer to as the dark matter of the gene gnome; the parts that have been harder to see but really have wired in there the instructions for how the tool kit is used.",
        "Right.",
        "And so it seems as if since this what you call dark matter has been a relatively new object of attention in the genetic world.",
        "In fact we don't really know very much about the control mechanisms yet.",
        "No we don't.",
        "I don't want to say that we're you know lost, it's simply, it's much harder to study and we learn about it sort of piece by piece.",
        "The great thing about the genetic code is that we can read the genetic code of anything from a bacteria to a whale.",
        "It's the same code across all kingdoms.",
        "But the code for building bodies and how that's wired in is unique to each species.",
        "And so deciphering that code is a much tougher informational problem.",
        "Okay why don't we let our listeners join in on this, because I just find it, I find it an interesting concept and I wonder well before I ask, I mean is it gaining wide acceptance?",
        "Has everybody said, Oh yes of course this has got to be it or are there still people saying, No, no this Evo-Devo is a fad and it's going to pass away?",
        "Well there maybe people who think it's a fad.",
        "I think everyone appreciate it.",
        "First of all understanding development was a huge quest for biology and it has great importance for example in the medical arena.",
        "So there has been tremendous solid progress in understanding the body building and organ building genes of everything from as I said fruit flies to humans."

        "Okay.",
        "My question is, okay in college in the early 90s when I was taking biology, we were taught the saying ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.",
        "Which basically means that human embryos and higher mammal embryos go through stages which resemble the stages of evolution; is one point where the embryo (unintelligible) and it looks like fish gills.",
        "There's other points where it looks very much like a chicken embryo and so you know they were saying that we kind of retraced the steps of evolution as we develop as embryos.",
        "And then I heard later that that had been totally disproven and they really weren't gill slits after all.",
        "So I wanted to see what Evo-Devo has to say about that debate.",

        "Great question.",
        "Well Evo-Devo gives us whole new ways of testing questions like that, because we have new ways of seeing the events that go on in embryos and asking, Well are there repertoires of genes that are being used that we know for example are used in fish in a particular way.",
        "How are they used in a mammal for example?",
        "And the reason why ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny has been, it's such a catchy phrase but, and you then know there's a lot of sort of extra jeopardy words in there.",
        "But the reason why it has lost favor is we understand that evolution chucks all sorts of pieces of the developmental program.",
        "And that it's not a strict recapitulation of evolutionary history at all.",
        "There's a whole parts of development that are missing when one compares organisms, because as organisms change lifestyles and adapt to new habitats and, for example come to land versus water, things become dispensable and some things do disappear.",
        "The other part of development that evolves a great deal are the very earliest steps in, for example, the making of eggs in the early events in an egg.",
        "That's also very closely tied to lifestyle.",
        "So it's misleading to think very strictly about ontogeny meaning development recapitulating phylogeny, meaning evolutionary history.",
        "We see bits and pieces of that which are very fascinating.",
        "The little while we have a tail or the features that we have that resemble those of our aquatic sis- our aquatic ancestors.",
        "But it's not a strict recapitulation so it's really something that we're urging not be taught.",
        "Okay, hey Chris thanks very much an interesting question.",

        "And obviously switches are switching on and off.",
        "If the, if the theory's right and there's this limited number of genes so there's some switch, switching going on.",
        "What makes the order work each time?",
        "I mean it seems like so much has to happen absolutely correctly to get from a two celled organism to an elephant.",
        "And you'd expect to have a lot of errors.",
        "Yeah, a lot does have to work right but nature's been working on this for 600 million years.",
        "So, and, and really worked out a lot of it in the first hundred million.",

        "So we know that the size and shape and color of, of characters that come out in various species do vary.",
        "We can see that among ourselves most easily if you just look at human faces, you can see that cheek structure and eye color and all sorts of features of the head are different; but between us, of course, we all belong to the human species.",
        "So all those differences are little variations in the process of development.",
        "So there is some tolerance in there.",
        "And the same sort of variation exists in other animal species.",
        "What natural selection plays with is that variation and if some of that variation is more useful than others, that's going to be favored as the form of those species and its descendants evolve.",
        "So you're right that there's an awful lot of switches, an awful lot of um, toggles that have to be thrown in the right order in the right timing so that things don't collapse.",
        "But that is what natural selection's really good at, which is preserving everything that works and allowing a little bit of tolerances into things to enable some variation.",

        "I just wanted to know if there's, if there's anything, and I've often thought that it would be similar to what, what triggered the development of genes and the expression of genes in the partial pressures within each cell of the chemistry that's found in the amniotic fluid in a developing embryo?",
        "Interesting."
