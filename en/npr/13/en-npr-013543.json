        "NPR political correspondent Mara Liasson is going to be joining us throughout the hour.",
        "Mara, thanks so much.",
        "Happy to be here.",
        "And could you start us off by talking about this whole issue of the 100 days?",
        "As we just said, this 100-day period has been marked and watched closely since FDR, but President Trump and some of his supporters have complained that it's arbitrary.",
        "Some of them have even said it's stupid.",
        "Does this 100 days marker matter?",
        "Well, it is arbitrary, it is stupid and it does matter because Donald Trump fell right into the 100-day trap.",
        "Not only did he campaign with a 100-day action plan - he made a lot of promises for what he'd do in his first 100 days - but since he's been in office he's been talking constantly about what he's accomplished in 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 90 days.",
        "And he is somebody who's pretty obsessed with his scorecard and his box office and his ratings.",
        "And he wants the first 100 days to be the most fabulous, incredible 100 days ever.",
        "And that - he's made it matter.",
        "Now, I think as a measurement or a scorecard or a report card for how a new president is doing a year would, I think, be a much more reasonable measurement than 100 days.",
        "Well, given that you said that he embraced the 100 days whether he liked it or not, what would you say has been his biggest accomplishment and what would you say has been his biggest setback?",
        "I mean, obviously, he pointed to the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.",
        "Well, that was really interesting because this is what Donald Trump does best.",
        "You heard him say for the first time ever we've confirmed a new justice in the first 100 days, the last time that happened was 136 years ago as if that was an incredible accomplishment.",
        "There was an opening on the Supreme Court that was kept open for him by Mitch McConnell.",
        "And yes, he confirmed Neil Gorsuch.",
        "This was one of the rare things that he farmed out, basically, to the Heritage Foundation, to Republicans who knew how to do this.",
        "This was a picture-perfect nomination process.",
        "They got him approved.",
        "But I guess I would say that was his greatest accomplishment.",

        "But how do you compare this period to that of his predecessors?",
        "Well, if the metric is legislation, which the White House complains bitterly about that and I think they have some points there, he didn't accomplish as much as his predecessors.",
        "They signed more bills.",

        "Yeah, that's right; there clearly is a division of opinion at the senior levels of the Catholic Church as to what exactly to make of the evolutionary theory.",
        "We could sort of wind the clock back to the mid 90's, when John Paul II said that evolution was more than a hypothesis.",
        "And this was seen in many quarters as the Catholic Church sort of making its peace with evolution.",
        "And that has never set well in some quarters, with many senior leaders who believe that, evolution is often misused by some people to exclude the idea of God.",
        "That is, if we can explain the origin of life and development of life through evolution then we don't need God.",
        "And this sort of, burst into public view last summer, when Cardinal Christoff Schoenbern of Vienna, who is one of the Church's leading theologians, he was a student of then, Father Ratsinger, back in the 70's, and a very close friend of Pope Benedict XXVI, published an op/ed piece in the New York Times, in which he said essentially that is that, you can't explain the universe without intelligent design, that evolution by itself is insufficient.",
        "And that unleashed a debate over what exactly, the Cardinal meant.",
        "That is, was he speaking as a scientist, saying that evolution is wrong and that intelligent design should be taught in the science classrooms?",
        "Or, was he speaking as a philosopher and theologian, saying that there has to be room for a God in any theory of the universe.",
        "And that was never clear.",
        "I think, what, the piece in L'Osservatore Romano, today, which was written by a Catholic scientist at the University of Bolognia is intended to do is draw a sharp distinction between science and theology.",
        "And say that at the level of science, the leading scientific theories should be what are taught in science classrooms.",
        "At the level of theology on the other hand, evolution should not be misused to rule out the idea of God.",
        "One of these is over whether the Pakistani government should now launch a military offensive into North Waziristan.",
        "That's the part of the tribal belt that's used as a haven for the Pakistani Taliban.",
        "And by going in there, to attempt to crush the militants - what you might call progressive Pakistanis, who see the rise of violent Islamist militancy in this country, as an existential threat to their society.",
        "A calling for that, but there doesn't appear to be political consensus among the politicians and generals."
