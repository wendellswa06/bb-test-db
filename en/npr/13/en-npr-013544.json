        "He makes the argument that intelligent design is not a scientific theory; it is a philosophical and theological theory.",
        "And as I say, that is certainly one position that very prominent people in and around the Vatican, such as George Coyne, an American who's the Director of the Vatican Observatory, that is certainly their point of view.",
        "I think people like Schoenbern, on the other hand, are very uncomfortable with issuing a kind of Vatican endorsement of evolution.",
        "Because they feel that's going to add impetus to those who want to say that, if evolution is correct, then we can exclude the idea of God because we don't need God to explain where life came from.",
        "And, of course, it gets into the debate here in this country where, those who support intelligent design have liked to think that the Catholic Church was among their supporters in this.",
        "Anyway, moving on to something else, next week we are expecting the first encyclical from the former Father Ratsinger, now Pope Benedict XVI.",
        "And he's chosen to write on the subject of love.",
        "Yeah, and you know I think the best sound bite way to sum this up is, this is Benedict XVI's version of compassionate conservatism.",
        "I mean basically, what he wants to argue is, and he makes this distinction between two ancient Greek words for love, Eros and Agape.",
        "And argues that much of the modern world, its conception of love is Eros, that is the kind of satisfaction of one's own desires.",
        "And he wants to say that, the Christian point of view is better expressed by Agape, which his this total surrender of the self for the good of the other.",
        "And ultimately what this is about is making the argument that, when Christianity says no to things, that is when it says no to gay marriage, when it says no to women priests, and on and on down the line, of positions that are often unpopular, associated with the Catholic Church and Specifically with this Pope.",
        "That, from his point of view it does so, in service of a higher good.",
        "That is, promoting the full development of the human person according to the plan laid out by God.",
        "So that, ultimately, he's wanting to argue that Christianity is not about control, it's not about power, it's not about fear, but it's about love.",
        "And, that is very much the heart of the argument he's trying to make.",
        "Now, to what extent he's successful in making that argument is of course, another question.",
        "John Allen thanks very much for being with us today.",
        "Appreciate your time.",
        "Always a pleasure.",

        "And if you follow the media much, you've heard those names.",
        "They're influential figures.",
        "In 1986, they were both young reporters.",
        "And that is when they created the satiric magazine Spy.",
        "Spy picked Trump as the embodiment of a crass age.",
        "The magazine has long since been shut down, but its jokes echo.",
        "Think about the presidential campaign in which Marco Rubio mocked Trump's hands, and Trump actually responded in last week's debate."
