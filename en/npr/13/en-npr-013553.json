        "The crux of our argument was that she brings - and people like her - bring a unique perspective and, as she said, better perspective.",
        "In other speeches, she made the case - she argued against a woman named Judge Miriam Cederbaum, who was saying we should try to transcend our identities.",
        "And Sotomayor said, no, we can't do that.",
        "That's impossible.",
        "She said we should aspire to do that, and sometimes we may still.",
        "Right.",
        "Right.",
        "But she said - but it was a - clearly a much stronger case for a sort of identity politics or a multicultural view.",
        "And that is -that's a legitimate point of view that a lot of people represent.",
        "The question will be whether these views, which I think are not out of the mainstream, but strong identity politics views - whether they are, in fact, tied to her decisions.",
        "And I think the strength she will have is that most of her decisions are apparently very narrowly decided and case specific.",
        "E.J., I'll get to you in just a second, but let's listen to how Judge Sotomayor spoke when she was introduced at the White House on Tuesday.",
        "She was talking about how the wealth of her experience has shaped her work as a judge.",
        "It has helped me to understand, respect and respond to the concerns and arguments of all litigants who appear before me, as well as to the views of my colleagues on the bench.",
        "I strive never to forget the real world consequences of my decisions on individuals, businesses and government.",
        "E.J., any particular words in there that jump out at you?",
        "I was struck, for example, by the fact that she included businesses in there.",
        "Right, no, exactly.",
        "And what's interesting is if you look at her decisions, she made a lot of pro-business decisions.",
        "BusinessWeek said she's a moderate on business issues.",
        "I think, in some ways, she is the anti-John Roberts.",
        "You know, when Barack Obama gave his speech explaining why he was against John Roberts, he said that Roberts is clearly qualified, but he seems always, in what he does, to side with the strong against the weak.",
        "And that's where the empathy comes in.",
        "But I think on this whole controversy, this most striking thing about her is that she's practiced her empathy from the middle of the road.",
        "Her - she is a very moderate judge, or if she's a liberal, a very moderate sort of liberal.",
        "And I think that's one of the reasons why - while some on the right have attacked her, most Republican Senators are holding their fire, because they know in their heart of hearts that she really is not going to be some kind of radical liberal.",
        "David Brooks, do you see it that way?",
        "Do you think that she - based on what you know of how she's ruled so far - almost 20 years on the federal branch - would she tip the direction of the court?"

        "This was the case of the New Haven firemen, some of whom studied - the dyslexic guy studied very hard for his test, passed the test, was denied a promotion because the results were not, according to the courts, race neutral.",
        "And this will be the test, whether she applied her identity politics, which comes out in the speeches, to a specific case, and frankly, to a case that appalls a lot of…",

        "White firefighters.",

        "But what's important about that case, also, is that the panel she was on decided it three nothing.",
        "This is not just Sonia Sotomayor out on her own.",
        "Seven judges on the panel ended up agreeing with that decision.",

        "There's a temperament issue, which doesn't seem to be going anywhere, but this is kind of politically explosive.",
        "There are a lot of people who are angry about discrimination, reverse discrimination.",
        "This is the one thing so far that could hang her up.",

        "Is she abrasive?",
        "Is she hostile?",
        "I was struck by something in The New York Times today, David, your paper, her fellow Second Circuit Court Judge Guido Calabrese said that these complaints about her are unfounded.",
        "And his quote was \"\"some lawyers just don't like to be questioned by a woman.",
        "It was sexist, plain and simple.\"\" Do you think there's a double standard here, E.J.?",
        "I do.",
        "I mean, if you look at Justice Scalia, he is a very tough questioner.",
        "When people look at that, they usually say, he's sharp, he's got a sense of humor.",
        "They don't - to sort of attack him in the way that she is being attacked in this case.",
        "You know, in a funny way, I think she may end up being somewhat more a liberal version of Sandra Day O'Connor because she is a stickler on the law, stickler on the fact.",
        "She doesn't bring some big philosophical agenda to this.",
        "That's why some liberals are disappointed in her.",
        "But it's also why I think she'll get confirmed with a lot of conservative votes, or at least a lot of Republican votes.",
        "I want to steer this to the economy for just a bit here, because we are in a week where we've seen Chrysler in bankruptcy court.",
