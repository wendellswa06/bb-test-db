        "Now, facing a downturn in the economy and stagnant state revenues, Schwarzenegger is promoting a new idea for an infusion of cash - leasing the California Lottery to private investors.",
        "Our lottery is a very valuable public asset but it does not nearly perform as well as in other states.",
        "We can double or triple the revenues from the lottery if we maintain ownership but lease it to the private sector to manage the sales.",
        "The discussion began when several investment banking firms pitched the idea to Schwarzenegger and his budget advisors.",
        "And he's not alone; six other states are also now considering plans to privatize their lotteries.",
        "California voters approved the creation of a lottery in 1984 based on a political campaign that promised major money for public schools.",
        "But today, the state's lottery only accounts for 2 percent of the money spent on K through 12 education.",
        "Early projections suggest that state could command an upfront payment to privatize the lottery of as much as $37 billion, or the state could demand annual payments of a few billion dollars a year.",
        "Either option could help ease California's financial problems.",
        "So far, Democrats have reacted skeptically to the idea.",
        "Don Perata, the president pro tem of the California State Senate says the governor seems to prefer budget gimmicks to actual budget balancing.",
        "These little mix and matches and we'll going to sell this off, we'll going to sell that off -we're about done with that now.",
        "And the question is when are we going to start rationalizing our system of capturing revenues and spending revenues in some kind of a rational way.",
        "And if a private company takes over the California lottery and successfully expands lottery revenues, that money is coming out of the economy somewhere else.",
        "Jean Ross of the non-profit California Budget Project says that could mean less sales tax revenues for the state.",
        "A dollar that somebody spends on a lottery ticket is a dollar that they're not spending on shoes for their child to wear to schools, gas to put in their car or local restaurant.",
        "Well, I like to present you with your flight certificate.",
        "(Soundbite of applause)",
        "If that wasn't enough, the labor union that represents lottery workers may fight the plan.",
        "At this point, there is no formal proposal to privatize the lottery but the idea does seem to ducktail with Schwarzenegger's philosophical preference for the private sector, a philosophy the governor discussed at length in a recent one-on-one interview.",
        "I am personally and so against government running things because we don't have the experts here.",
        "The private sector has the experts.",
        "The private sector also has the money."
