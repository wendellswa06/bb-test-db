        "A lot of explication in that movie, too.",
        "Yes, we noticed that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I'm just wondering if you think that the video games are going to move away from borrowing from Hollywood so much, because it seems to me that that's about 80 percent of video game stories.",

        "All right, thanks.",
        "I will say my personal belief in this is that I have a lot of fun with some of the big, Hollywood-style blockbuster games, which are very much interactive experiences where you feel like an action hero in a movie.",
        "Those are really fun.",
        "They can be really fine.",
        "Uncharted 2\"\" is, to me, an example of a game that does the Indiana Jones-style, you know, story as well as you can do it.",
        "But I also think those games are essentially a kind of creative dead end.",
        "And one of the people I talk to in my book is my favorite video game designer, a guy named Clint Hocking, who used to work for Ubisoft Montreal and now works for LucasArts.",
        "And I think Clint is just a real -a figure of real creative integrity in video games today.",
        "And he says, you know, basically, the problem with the Hollywood-style storytelling game is that we really already know how good that kind of story can be.",
        "We've seen it.",
        "We've seen really great Hollywood-style films.",
        "It is day six of anti-government protests in Iran, and the death toll there is rising.",
        "And Clint's passion and my passion is for a game that doesn't follow that model, a game that's not so much a story that pushes you through this maze in which you're confronted by an array of enemies that you have to defeat to move on and experience more of the story, but Clint's model is a kind of system through which, you know, through very cleverly placed baits by the author figure, the game creator, you wander through a world or a story that you create through your own actions and that gives you feeling of agency.",
        "And you sort of tell your own story through the medium of the game, and the story feels real and meaningful.",
        "Unfortunately, very few games have managed to do that really well, but my belief - and Clint's belief, I think - is that that is the most promising storytelling path that, you know, really sophisticated games, games that really have the opportunity to address something about, you know, life and art and the person playing them are really going to follow, to be to really achieve what I think this medium can do better than any other medium."
