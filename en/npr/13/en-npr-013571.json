        "And certainly the level that they're at now just opens up so many possibilities.",

        "And I know that you've also thought about a conundrum that I know Tom Bissell writes about in his book, whereas games really have to find a new level if they're going to hang onto the audiences that they've developed.",
        "Yes, and include and be more inclusive of global audiences as a whole, you know, really break down this barrier between what's a gamer and a non-gamer.",
        "We really think that a non-gamer is just someone who hasn't found a game that they've liked yet, which is very feasible because the emotional spectrum in video games has been relatively narrow.",
        "So we aim to make games that we think are maybe more relevant or thought-provoking.",
        "And, well, I know, Tom Bissell, to bring you back into the conversation, you write about a game called \"\"Braid,\"\" and Kellee Santiago, you've thought about that one, too - games that are different in purpose, really, than the familiar first-person shooter, the \"\"Wolfenstein\"\" scenario.",
        "Yes.",
        "And I think \"\"Braid\"\" is a great example because, like us, Jonathan Blow, the developer of \"\"Braid,\"\" was really empowered by the digital distribution, this ability that we now have to make our games and just make them available online, which takes down a huge barrier to development entry, which was having to manage buying disks and getting into stores and negotiating those deals.",
        "And so now there's a greater possibility of these games that are made by one or just a few people, and they have a very strong creative vision that comes through.",
        "And \"\"Braid\"\" is a good example, in that Jonathan's personality and his expression comes through.",
        "And I think every aspect of that game - the audio, the visuals, as well as the mechanics themselves - are intertwined extremely tightly.",
        "Tom, \"\"Braid\"\" is a kind of game, but also, Mr. Blow has some, I thought, interesting critiques of the industry as an industry.",
        "He does.",
        "You know, I agree with Kellee, and let me say that I adore your games, and really, it's a thrill to be on this show with you - that, you know, games can communicate all sorts of things: enchantment, self-disgust.",
        "You know, they can disturb.",
        "They can compel.",
        "But there's a kind of emotion that a game can communicate that is very hard to find an analog to in other media.",
        "And I think \"\"Flower\"\" does this.",
        "I think \"\"Braid\"\" does this.",
        "This new game that recently came out, \"\"Limbo,\"\" does this, which is this strange place somewhere between a fairy tale, you know, a more traditional game that has rules, something between visual art.",

        "You kind of are the system.",
        "And it's a real wonderful, like, feeling of merging that you have with the game, and it's very hard to call those things games.",
        "I would never call \"\"Flower\"\" a game so much as just an experience that you have.",
        "And it's one of the first games I take and show people when, you know, you want to get away from the more traditional kind of physical, confrontation-based model of game play and really show something - really show someone something that seems to work on a completely different, and I would say, you know, much more aesthetically interesting level - although I do love shooting things.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean, it's just - completely, it's when we're - when - one of the reasons that it gets so difficult to do experimental and new games is because you are simultaneously inventing a new language as you go.",

        "And a lot of this game, basically, got shut down because a lot of people viewed it as exploitative.",
        "But I read interviews with some of the marines themselves, and their point of view is that this is the medium in which they process, you know, their experience, that this seemed like the most natural medium for them to try to create, you know, sense from the senselessness of war.",
        "And it may have been an exploitative game.",
        "I wouldn't know.",

        "And new games like that from the old soundbites of \"\"Zelda\"\" and those things, no sound and just all text when the character is talking until you're engaged and you feel like you're someone listening not just a soundbite.",
