        "Tom Bissell, you write about voice acting as a craft and, indeed, an art.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think the early models, to use a lot of big name voice actors to do a lot of parts in games.",
        "But, you know, more and more, I'm seeing that some of the best performances recently in narrative game, narrative style, storytelling games that use voice actors are people that are may be not so well known.",
        "The lead voice actor in \"\"Red Dead Redemption\"\" - damn, whose name I'm forgetting - he turned in where I thought was just one of the most jaw-droppingly effecting video game vocal performances I've ever heard.",
        "I thought he was just magnificent.",
        "And I think a lot of movie actors used to just, you know, kind of roll into the studio, kind of hung over, looked - you know, read their lines and, you know, probably didn't want to work too hard because a lot of, you know, movie...",
        "The words on the script they saw were free money.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Free money words, yeah.",
        "And I think, you know, I think most game people have wised up to the fact that it's - really doesn't matter too figs if you've got a big name guy in your game, that you really want the person who's going to give it their all and give the best performance.",
        "From the designer's point of view, Kellee Santiago, well, \"\"Flower\"\" certainly doesn't rely a lot on voices.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah.",
        "We try to cut localization costs.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But I - to the caller's point, I agree that I think it's one of those aspects of the artistry of game making that we're seeing really evolve.",
        "And for acting, specifically, I could probably draw a comparison between when acting as a craft sort of shifted from theater into film and how you kind of have specific skills for film acting that are different than theater.",
        "And we're seeing, through video games with the voice over as well as the motion capture animations, these new acting skills evolve that feed into the final product."

        "Jane Hodgson was a very courageous obstetrician-gynecologist in St. Paul, Minnesota in the early 1970s.",
        "Before Roe she was a Mayo Clinic-trained doctor.",
        "And she decided to test, to challenge the Minnesota criminal abortion law.",
        "She had a patient who had contracted German measles very early in her pregnancy.",
        "And people my age might remember, before there were immunizations, that there were epidemics of German measles that swept through the country, and when it hit somebody early in pregnancy, it had a very high probability of causing serious birth defects.",
        "So this young woman who already had several children, as I recall, decided that she wanted an abortion.",
        "And Dr. Hodgson was willing to do it, did it, and then basically called the police and said come and get me.",
        "And they did.",
        "And they arrested her and they prosecuted her and she was convicted.",
        "And she was - she would have been sentenced.",
        "But at the time she was about to be sentenced, the Supreme Court decided Roe against Wade, of course legalizing abortion throughout the country.",
        "And so Dr. Hodgson was off the hook.",
        "But that case illustrates what the justices were considering as they looked at this case.",
        "It was the doctors whose - were dispensing what they thought was the best treatment for their patients; that's who they were most concerned about.",
        "Yes.",
        "And I should say, from the comments that my online column is running today attracted, I think some readers misunderstood me to say that women's rights is somehow divorced from the abortion question, and that's not at all what I was trying to say.",
        "What I was trying to say was in the minds of the justices, the seven middle-aged and elderly guys who formed the majority in Roe against Wade - it was a 7-2 decision - when you actually read the opinion, the voices of women, those voices were presented to the court."

        "There were briefs from feminists and women's groups and so on, but they're really not reflected in the opinion.",
        "The emphasis in the opinion is on the rights of doctors.",
        "And that's easy to understand because the court at that time, 1971, '72, '73, didn't really have a jurisprudence of women's rights.",
        "The court had yet to find that discrimination against women was a form of unconstitutional sex discrimination.",
        "So it's not surprising that that was not a frame through which they saw the abortion issue.",
        "And interesting, you note that coverage in the newspapers the next day, well, it wasn't - it was front-page news, but the death of Lyndon Johnson competed for the headlines.",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "And of course in New York, the New York legislature had legalized abortion in 1970 by a legislative vote.",
        "And so when the Supreme Court decision came down, it didn't change life on the ground in New York and the opinion was, you know, people don't - we look at it now through the lens through which we see the abortion controversy today.",
        "But that's actually not how it evolved.",
        "So Roe against Wade, of course, overturned a Texas law, a Texas law that made abortion a crime, and newspapers in Texas praised the decision.",
        "The companion case, Doe against Bolton, overturned Georgia law, Georgia abortion law, and newspapers in Georgia praised the decision.",
        "So, you know, one point I tried to make in the column is that the controversy that surrounds abortion today actually is something that's quite different from the debate that was going on at that time.",
        "And quite different and you suggest that consciously the Republican Party tried to stir opposition to Roe v.",
        "Wade as the northern counterpart of its southern strategy.",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "I mean the historical evidence on that is irrefutable.",
        "When - now, when we say try to stir controversy, of course there was controversy before the Supreme Court ruled.",
        "There was controversy that had absolutely nothing to do with the Supreme Court because reform had been stirring in various parts of the country.",
        "And even the slightest stirrings of reform, the mildest kinds of reform, not just repeal of the old laws but tweaking the old laws, engendered very concerted opposition from the Catholic Church hierarchy.",
        "And there was the formation of the National Rights to Life Committee and so on, so that there was a lot of pushback and conflict that had nothing to do with the court.",
        "So the kind of received notion that, oh, nothing was going on and then the Supreme Court ruled and we've had controversy ever since is really a distortion of what occurred.",
        "We have conflict, all kinds of conflict, and it doesn't mean that Supreme Court decisions or judicial decisions cause a special kind of conflict.",
        "We're talking with Linda Greenhouse, now a professor of law at Yale University Law School.",
        "You can find a link to her piece that ran in The New York Times on our website.",

        "And this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Another part of that backlash theory that you were writing about in your piece was that it shows up in the controversy that the court faces today in the decision on gay marriage, the idea that it was the court's imposition of abortion across the country that we would have been better off had it been decided by legislatures rather than by the court, and people draw an analogy to gay marriage.",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, certainly not my view of what happened after Roe against Wade.",
        "But the reason that the backlash narrative so-called that I'm trying to shed some light on and raise some serious questions about, the reason it's relevant today is that people either out of fear of what might happen if the courts rule in favor of same-sex marriage, or they wish some negative reaction would come from a court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, invoke what they assert happened as the result of Roe against Wade as a way of saying watch out, don't go there, don't turn to the courts.",
        "If you win in the courts you're going to lose to the public."

        "And what my view is and what I try to suggest in that column is, there's no one-size-fits-all response to court decisions or to social conflict over these kinds of issues that we can predict one thing that will happen.",
        "Each situation has its own costs and its own benefits.",
        "And the choice of whether to go to litigation, legislation, let events take their course, those all have to be evaluated on their own merits.",
        "There's not a kind of a slogan that one can invoke about what to do.",

        "And 70 percent of the people said no.",
