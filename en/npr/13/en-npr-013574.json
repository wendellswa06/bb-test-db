        "You know, one of them is from Proverbs, which says: The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is slave to the lender.",
        "And what does that mean?",
        "That means that when you're in debt, you are in bondage.",
        "And people who are listening right now who have credit card debt and student loan debt and medical debt and all kinds of debt, they know.",
        "They feel it.",
        "They feel it on their shoulders.",
        "They feel this bondage.",
        "And I tried to pick scriptures that will give you inspiration to get out of that bondage, to get you out of that position of being a slave.",

        "And it's interesting, people who have that entertainment as part of their budget and still have debt, I want you to shut this stuff down and concentrate on your debt.",
        "And instead of paying for stuff, I want you to also see how much money you have available to apply to your debt.",
        "Because when you stop spending for 21 days - I mean, the unnecessary spending - and then you look back months past where you've had all this money, you think, you know what?",
        "I do have enough money to attack this debt.",
        "You know what?",
        "I do have enough money to put in my kids' college fund if I stop eating out so much, if I - you know, maybe go to the movies once a month or every couple of months, or, you know, just stay at home and watch the movies that you have.",

        "My question is about how you start.",
        "We've talked about going all cash just to kind of keep an eye on things, but it's difficult to do once you're already using the credit card.",
        "And we don't run a balance every month, but we're using the cash kind of after we've already spent it.",
        "And so I'm just wondering how your expert recommends getting started if you're already using the credit card.",
        "You know, that's a great question.",

        "And one of it is you got to remove that plastic from your wallet because if it's in your wallet, you're going to use it.",
        "Right, Lindsey?",
        "That is right.",
        "But I'm curious, at the beginning, when your cash has already been used to pay your credit card, what do you do?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, that's why you're going to shut down all your spending except for the necessary spending.",
        "OK.",
        "You see why - you see, that's why I'm going there, because what you're doing is you're spending the cash already.",
