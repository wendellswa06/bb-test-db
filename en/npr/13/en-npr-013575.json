        "I also get high fees from ATMs because I don't belong to a typical bank.",
        "Would I still benefit?",
        "You will still benefit, because here's the thing: There have been several studies - and I'm not talking about some sort of, you know, obscure studies.",
        "I mean, you know, MIT did a study that shows that when you use plastic, even when you pay your bill off every month, you still spend more than when you use cash.",
        "So that $300 rental car that you got, listen.",
        "The credit card company knows you spent three or $4,000 more than would you have spent had you used cash.",
        "So I don't know.",
        "Three hundred versus three or $4,000, I'm going with the three or $4,000 in my bank account, you know?",
        "And so the thing is, I'm a very frugal person.",
        "And even when I use a credit card, I know that I'm going to buy that extra shirt that I wouldn't have bought if I just had that $20 in my wallet.",
        "And so I encourage those who are good stewards over their money, like the email person - and try to fast, and you will see that you still can save.",
        "And after the 21 days are done, what do you do next?",
        "Well, you know, I encourage you to get into a financial literacy program.",
        "And at the end of the book, I encourage you to do a 30-day spending journal.",
        "So for 30 days after you finish the fast and you're back spending, you know, keep track of what you're spending.",
        "And so there's some tips to kind of keep you on that road to prosperity.",
        "And when we do it in my group, we continue to have workshops on credit and debt and things like that.",
        "And if you're in real trouble, I really encourage you to find a group or an organization in your community that does financial literacy classes.",
        "So that will help you continue after you do the fast.",
        "We're about out of time.",
        "But I want to ask you, if you would come back again in 21 days.",
        "And some of our listeners might have tried out the fast, and we'll check in with them.",
        "I would love to do that.",
        "And if people go to the Washington Post Web site, washingtonpost.com, there's a link for YouTube videos.",
        "And so I'm asking people to post their Youtube videos of what they're doing to get through the fast.",

        "But it is across the country in a few cities.",

        "I think their response has been more or less the standard response, trying to disperse the protesters with water cannon and tear gas.",

        "Many of them - the government said that were not fired by the police but by armed protesters.",
        "But more or less, they have been trying to practice restraint."
