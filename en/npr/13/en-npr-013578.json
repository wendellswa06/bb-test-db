        "I am good and ready for the first letter.",
        "It comes from Michael Ellsworth(ph) in Chicago.",
        "He wrote in about your interview this week with two musicians from Sphinx.",
        "That's an organization that's trying to boost the numbers of blacks and Latinos in classical orchestras.",
        "And here is Aaron Dworkin, founder and president of Sphinx.",
        "(Soundbite of archived NPR interview)",
        "One of the reasons why the work that we do is so important is that nationally, it's a little over, you know, 1.5 percent of America's orchestras are African-American and, similarly, Latino.",
        "So it is very dramatic.",
        "And, unfortunately, most of those numbers have been static for many years."

        "Now, Farai, listen, Michael Ellsworth was upset about a phrase you used in that interview.",
        "And he wrote this: You refer to the lack of black and Latino players in symphonies as a lack of, quote, \"\"artists of color.\"\" But classical symphonies have a very large number of Asian players and Asians aren't white.",
        "You also failed to mention that classical auditions, unlike acting auditions, happen behind the curtain.",
        "Well, Michael, I admit I didn't know about the blind behind the curtain auditions.",
        "As for the phrase people of color, you raised a good point.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And moving on, last week in our Africa Update segment, we discussed a story about Israel, which is turning away new Sudanese refugees.",
        "The topic is particularly hot because among the Sudanese seeking refuge are people escaping the genocide in Darfur.",
        "But David Lerner(ph) heard that story in New York and he wrote: I was blown away last night to hear an American on your program, saying that because the USA turned away Jewish refugees during World War II who are subsequently slaughtered by the Nazis, Israel should take refugees from Darfur now.",
        "As Americans, presumably deeply upset by our country's callous action back then, shouldn't you be talking about what America should do now for Darfur refugees, or as African-Americans perhaps you'd talk about why Africans are killing each other and why other Africans aren't taking enough refugees or stopping the bloodshed.",
        "To focus blame for Darfur's refugee crisis on tiny Israel seems bizarre indeed.",
        "Well, David, we did follow up in this interview with a question about whether African-Americans should take on extra responsibility for Darfur, a question that a previous guest raised.",
        "But your point is a good one.",
        "And finally, we got a letter from Dan Bessy(ph) in Phoenix.",
        "Dan heard a story we did as part of our education series this month.",
        "And, Farai, you spoke with a parent and to educators about some of the ways that parents and teachers can work together to help children learn better.",
        "What about those areas where the parents aren't involved?",
        "My wife teaches at an inner-city school in Phoenix and she constantly struggles with students who have no desire to take part in class or do their homework.",
        "And she gets no help whatsoever from their parents or guardians.",
        "I applaud those programs that encourage parent participation.",
        "But some people simply don't care.",
        "How do teachers fight that battle?",
        "(Soundbite of music)",
        "Well, that's it for letters.",

        "And - so, it's kind of difficult emotionally for all of us to live in the same house at the same time.",
