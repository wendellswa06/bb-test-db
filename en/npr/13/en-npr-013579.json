        "And they did not even (unintelligible) - to see my 7 year old in bed - before going to bed crying because we cannot take this family vacation that was just, you know, like a 10-hour drive for the weekend.",
        "But we cannot afford that, and we realized that because, you know, we're paying 600 dollars a month in gas this summer and it was gut-wrenching to...",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, you have to...",
        "I can only imagine what that would - where were you planning to take the kids, Carlos?",
        "We were going to drive to San Antonio, you know, do the Riverwalk and Sea World and...",
        "And just for the weekend, but they were really looking forward to it?",
        "Yes, all year long.",
        "And - I don't know, Amy, is the idea of a staycation an option here?",
        "Well, I actually, if - Carlos, if you could, I think it would great if you and your wife can get together and think of a way to create that vacation a little bit at home.",
        "Maybe you can get some postcards or download some photographs of San Antonio, and sort of, kind of, decorate one of your rooms.",
        "You can do crafts.",
        "You know, maybe there are ways to have a little, special weekend that doesn't involve going so far away.",
        "And of course, I love the idea of sleeping outside.",
        "You know, kids love to sleep outside.",
        "So, if there's a night when you can even start out the night outside under the stars, that would probably be very special and memorable for them."

        "Long since my kids have grown up, but I remember many times when they would ask me for money or things that cost money, and I would respond to them in anger, and it was really, really - deep down inside, it was a sense of shame, a sense of embarrassment, and - that I didn't have the money to give them what they want, because I certainly did want to give them what they wanted.",
        "You know, but I could remember going to the county fair and saying, OK, we've got 50 dollars, and when 50 dollars is gone, we have to go home.",
        "And we went and my wife got sick, and the kids, you know, I wouldn't say they had a good time, because they saw papa and papa was not in a good mood, and...",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And first of all, I think it's really remarkable that Paul called in and shared his perspective, because I'm sure he's absolutely correct that it's a feeling of shame.",
        "And men especially, I think, don't know how to express that in a way that certainly kids can understand.",
        "And it's ironic, because a lot of us, we look back on our childhoods, and it's those frightening moments where something very benign sort of turns on a dime, and somebody explodes in anger, and that's what you remember from your trip to the carnival.",
        "You know, it's -that's the shame of it.",
        "And I just think that parents have to very, very honest with their kids, very honest, and just, you know, if you face this as a unit, as a tribe, as a group, even drawing kids in a little bit and not frightening them, but just letting them know that you're counting on them to help, I think that helps, because everybody's pulling together.",
        "Paul, thanks for the call."

        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "Things have changed a lot, and of course, because we're stressed out, we're both a lot shorter with her than we used to be.",

        "And you know, everything from - I mean, we are all getting less sleep because we're working late.",
        "She won't settle down until her dad can be home to read her her bedtime stories, and so she's getting less sleep.",
        "Her teacher has said that she's forgetful at school and doesn't concentrate as well.",
        "I mean, it trickles down to the littlest things, and she's just - it does.",
        "It just breaks your heart to see the way these things that are so beyond your control, you can imagine that for her it seems to be way beyond her control.",
        "So, it's been very frustrating."

        "And everybody's hungry and tired, and I know it's so hard with two working parents, and obviously, a 6-year-old is going to take this kind of transition pretty hard.",
        "So, I mean, the only thing I would urge, and I'm sure you - you're conscious of this is, to try and stabilize her situation as much as you can.",
        "For instance, with - if you can find just one steady babysitter, I think that would help a ton.",

        "You know, you can have a little drive-in movie.",
