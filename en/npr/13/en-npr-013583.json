        "The execution is scheduled for 12:01 AM next Tuesday.",
        "And is Governor Schwarzenegger at this point the last court of appeal, or is there any other process open to the Williams people?",
        "Well, he's--yeah, he would be the last process for Mr. Williams right now, however you never know if a new issue might be brought up in the federal courts.",
        "But his state appeals have run out and so have his federal appeals on all the issues that have come up so far.",

        "Well, Stanley Williams has never admitted to having committed the murders that he was convicted of.",
        "In his clemency petition, he maintains his innocence.",
        "The District Attorney's Office in Los Angeles says the evidence against him is overwhelming.",
        "So that's where it stands.",
        "I doubt the governor is gonna entertain much here in regards to his innocence or not, but in any event Stanley Williams still maintains that he's innocent.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "He has become a celebrity of sorts.",
        "A TV movie was made about his life after he seemingly changed in prison.",
        "Well, he--after many years in prison where he was kind of a bad actor, to say the least, he--in 1994 claims that he experienced some sort of redemption and over the last 11 years he's written some books that would--that purport to keep kids out of gangs.",
        "He's renounced his, you know, gang life, but he has not admitted any responsibility for these murders.",

        "Well, there have been two cases that have come to him.",
        "One, guy named Kevin Cooper who was convicted of killing a family in Chino in 1983.",
        "The governor in that case did not grant him a hearing.",
        "He just did a paper review of the Cooper case and decided to not grant him a hearing, not send the case to the Board of--what was then the Board of Prison Terms, and allowed the case to proceed toward execution.",
        "However, there were some evidentiary matters came up in the federal courts that are now being heard, and it was--Mr.",
        "Cooper got a stay and the US Supreme Court allowed that stay to stand.",
        "But the governor in that case was gonna--was prepared to allow that case to go to execution.",
        "There is another one involving a guy named Donald Beardsley who is accused of--or was convicted of murdering some people in the Bay Area, and in that case the governor allowed--or called for a Board of Prison Terms hearing for Mr. Beardsley, and in that matter the Board of Prison Terms issues a recommendation that generally is about a sentence or so.",
        "Their recommendation in that case was to allow the execution to proceed, and the governor did allow that execution to proceed, and Mr. Beardsley was executed.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And what about the family of the victims?",
        "Have they weighed in on this at all?",
        "Yeah, they have.",
        "They are very much one--the brother of one of the victims in this case I spoke to, and he was very much opposed to the governor even granting this hearing that he's gonna be presiding over on Thursday.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And the other issue, I guess, is this hearing that's gonna be held on Thursday seems exceptional.",
        "Is there--have there been suggestions that the celebrity surrounding Mr. Williams, is that the reason the governor is going to these extraordinary lengths?",
        "I haven't heard that, and I would doubt it, but I don't really know.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "Well, all I did was agree with the parole board's recommendation that his sentence be commuted from death penalty to life without parole; however, I had the authority to go ahead and have him executed, and I took it very seriously, and I canceled all my appointments for a week and had the various people involved come in and give me their view of the crime.",
        "So a hearing of the type that Governor Schwarzenegger is holding this week, that you don't think is extraordinary at all?",
