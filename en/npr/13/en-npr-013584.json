        "Thank you very much.",
        "You faced this question several times when you were governor.",
        "Can you tell us about the process, the kinds of things that you weighed?",
        "Well, let me just first tell you, it's obviously a very, very difficult decision, and it's also one that in many cases you don't ponder that much before it is, if you will, literally laid on your desk.",
        "I say it that way--you know, very few people actually run for office on the basis of their position on the death penalty or whatever, and my major thrust was about education and the environment, and it was something that I do as one of my constitutional duties, but not anything that I had gone into great, great thought about.",
        "And as it came about, there were three executions presented to me, two of which we did follow through with the execution, and one of which we commuted.",
        "And so this is one of the reasons, I think, a lot of people are now saying, you know, the execution is a final decision that can't be brought back if witnesses later recant or if we find some terrible mistake or we find DNA evidence or whatever it might be."

        "Amy, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Thank you.",
        "The factors, I think, are probably a little different in each case, but the bottom line that became very, very clear to me as I went through this agonizing process was that there had to be two really iron-clad rules.",
        "One is: Are we absolutely certain of guilt?",
        "No error or possibility for error whatsoever.",
        "And let me just say on that one, increasingly across the country I think the public's faith--I know my faith--has been shaken, that what may seem iron-clad is, in fact, iron-clad.",
        "You know, there were 14 people in recent years released from death row based on clear DNA evidence that said they didn't do it.",
        "Also, by the way, if 14 were released based on that evidence, it seems pretty certain to me that there were innocent people executed prior to this before we had the knowledge of DNA the way we do today.",
        "But in addition to that, the facts of the case, we've got to be absolutely certain that there's no bias in the system whatsoever, no racial bias, no procedural bias or anything of this type, you know.",
        "As you're probably aware, just yesterday Maryland did execute another individual, and while my great sympathy goes out for the family, because this was a horrendous crime, and I also know that it's difficult for any governor, including the incumbent governor, go through this, I am not at all sure that this case didn't run head-on into the second issue of being no bias.",
        "After numerous charges of racial and geographic bias in our system, I commissioned a study back in I think it was 2000.",
        "2002--I'm sorry--2002.",
        "And that study, among other things, found that the majority of the death sentences in Maryland were when a black male killed a white person in Baltimore County.",
        "Understand, Baltimore County is not a high crime area, and understand also most of the homicides are actually black on black, and yet if you fall into this pattern where a black killed a white in Baltimore County, chances are you're gonna be executed.",
        "Well, this gentleman who was just killed fell exactly into that pattern.",
        "Now that doesn't mean that he didn't commit the crime, and it doesn't mean that there's any less just terrible, terrible sympathy for the victim and her family and her grandchildren who were there at the time of the killing...",
        "Yes.",

        "And maybe should we be doing this at all?",
        "Hmm.",
        "At one point, you did say that these questions of bias would be mitigated since you, as governor, were reviewing the facts of every single case, and indeed you did go ahead with an execution.",
        "Yes.",
        "When you say went ahead with the first two.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yes.",
        "It was my thought that that would be sufficient to do it, to look and say, `Was this clear evidence and was there any hint of discrimination or anything of that type?",
        "At that time we were not aware of this pattern that the study that we requested so clearly brought out.",

        "We did so, and it was when it became clear to me what the major problem was, that I put a moratorium on all executions and recommended that we proceed with some type of corrections of the system or reconsider the whole question of the death penalty.",

        "I have to say if I was in the position as a governor to have to review one of these cases, one of the factors that I would have to weigh very heavily is how compelling the evidence is because, you know, they just did a program on \"\"Forum\"\" this morning about a number of death penalty convictions that have been overturned on, you know, more compelling DNA evidence in most cases.",
        "And it seems to me that we have to be very careful to only proceed in those cases where the evidence is clear enough that there hasn't been a mistake.",
        "Because otherwise we erode--you know, we erode confidence in the system, and it seems like too stiff a penalty."

        "Let me just say, I agree with what you're saying, and in fact on the case that I did commute to life in prison, it was not--it was absolutely clear to me that the person had committed the crime.",
        "Likely, yes, even probable, but it wasn't absolutely clear, and that is why I commuted it to life in prison.",
        "Likewise in Virginia, Governor Mark Warner, with a great deal of courage, by the way, just two days ago, three days ago did exactly the same thing and said that there just wasn't so clear a line that you could say with absolute certainty that this person committed the crime.",
        "And Gov...",
        "Now in our--in this particular case, though, that there's--the most recent case there's--or let me just go back for a second and say those 14 people who are on death row presumably in each of the different states where this took place, the same questions have been asked: Is this absolutely certain?",
        "It was asked by the judge.",
        "It was asked by the prosecutors.",
        "It was asked by the appeals courts.",
        "It was asked right up to the point, I suppose, of the governor.",
        "And in each case the evidence seemed to suggest, yes, that with certainty this is what happened.",
        "And now we know in 14 cases with certainty it did not happen.",
        "And so that's part of the reason I said even though we demand this clear standard, if we're going exe--have a system of execution, we must have it based on confidence that this crime was committed, and yet clearly in the past that confidence was not, I want to say, valid.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "Governor, you were governor of Maryland during the sniper cases, several of which happened in the state of Maryland, and the case is being--went first to the state of Virginia, I think in part because of the moratorium on the death penalty than in effect in Maryland.",
        "I believe that that was part of the thinking for the first assignment of the case.",
        "And did that give you pause at all?",
        "I mean, that's a case of such notoriety and, again, a case--well, it's easy to say from this vantage point, but the guilt or innocence doesn't seem to be a factor.",
        "No, it really didn't give me that much pause.",
        "I thought of some of the implications of that.",
        "I mean, what was clear to being done was to shop around a little bit to make what is the best chance of getting the death penalty.",
        "But I think the two fundamental standards ought to be there no matter what.",
        "Is this individual absolutely, with certainty, guilty?",
        "And since the trial going on, I won't try to prejudge that, but we've all read the newspapers and all.",
        "Sure.",
        "And then secondly, is there a bias in the system?",

        "I understand in the past--certainly Willie Horton's probably the most notorious example--these type of decisions have subsequent political implications, and I know for just as an illustration when Governor Warner, a very thoughtful, strong leader in Virginia, made the decision to commute that, there was pressure on him not to do so because, quote--as the press said, it might hurt his future possibilities as presidential candidate.",
