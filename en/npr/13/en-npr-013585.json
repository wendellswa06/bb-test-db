        "But those are not the--the politics of it are there, but I can tell you every person I know who's ever been involved in this, I have not seen anyone as governor directly responding or even being greatly influenced by the political thing.",

        "...so much changed in the national dialogue about what was going on there.",

        "Well, obviously it's very difficult under any circumstance and was there as well, and in the case when I did commute I indicated that, again, that a great deal of sympathy regardless of whether the person is guilty or not, the family had suffered that loss and that pain.",
        "It's a great deal of empathy and concern and sympathy, but their pain could not put the state in the position of saying we're going to execute even though there's even a possibility of a doubt--of a mistake being made here.",
        "And that's basically what I said.",
        "But let me also tell you that when I've talked with the families or representatives of families of victims, of people who've been brutally killed here, the word that I hear most often is not justice or even revenge or anything of this type.",
        "The word I heard most often is `closure'; they want closure.",
        "Now what has happened, unfortunately, is that in this country and in part because there is a recognition we could be making a mistake or the system be biased, but the actual implementation of the death penalty--that is, of killing someone--takes all across the country at least a decade.",
        "And very, very commonly 15 years, 20 years.",
        "And the pain and the agony that that victim's family goes through all this time because there's no closure--there is, I think, some merit to the argument that if found guilty a person be sentenced to life in prison without any possibility of parole whatsoever.",
        "And at that date then, at least for the victim's family, this has been brought to closure.",
        "It is the constant appeals and publicity about it, the rehashing of the evidence and so on that goes on for a decade, decade and a half, I think, that keeps so many of the victim's family in just absolute agony.",

        "Literary icon and social critic James Baldwin has inspired generations of writers since his death in 1987.",
        "But who inspired him?",
        "The answer to that question may be found in a new archive of the author's writings acquired by the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at The New York Public Library.",
        "The collection includes correspondence from Nina Simone, a handwritten screenplay about Malcolm X and notes on his first novel, \"\"Go Tell It On The Mountain.\"\" I spoke with the director of the Schomburg Center, Kevin Young.",
        "I asked him to name one item that was special to him.",
        "I mean, there are so many, but perhaps the most powerful thing that's in the exhibition we're showing for a few days here is his notes on Martin Luther King.",
        "And he wrote them 10 years after King's death.",
        "And it's just a really powerful, intimate moment where you get to see Baldwin in reflection but also Baldwin in the kinds of experiences that he would later then go on to try to dramatize in what became the recent film \"\"I'm Not Your Negro.\"\" So you really see the process of Baldwin's writing, his civil rights engagement, his interest in the word and then also the ways in which he was transforming his work.",
        "As you mentioned, there are a handful of documents on public display, but there are many restrictions on who will get to see the archive, mostly researchers and scholars.",
        "What do you think they can learn there that isn't already known about Baldwin?",
        "Well, there's about 30 linear feet of material, and only about less than a foot is restricted.",
        "So it's really a wide ranging array.",
        "You get to know his writing process up close, get to see the ways he goes from notes to novel.",
        "And also I think you get to see the wide breadth of his writing.",
        "You get to see everything from plays to screenplays to novels to nonfiction.",
        "Everything is there in many different forms, and I think that's really special.",
        "You're very familiar with the process of archives and working with artists and estates' families.",
        "And I understand that the letters between Baldwin and his closest friends are under, like, a 20-year seal.",
        "How common is that kind of restriction for this level of archive?",
        "I don't think it's uncommon.",
        "Material sometimes is kept private, and as long as we know when that ends, I think that's fine.",
        "Part of the archive always is discovery, and we're excited for other people to discover in the archive what's there.",
        "You know, you mentioned the Oscar-nominated documentary \"\"I Am Not Your Negro,\"\" and you have young writers today speaking about the influence of Baldwin, and it feels like he's having a cultural moment.",
        "Why do you think that is?",
        "I think because his writing is as relevant as ever.",
        "He seems both prophetic and also ever present.",
        "For me, who discovered him - I don't know - in my early 20s I think, he was really that and more.",
        "You know, he is also just a prose stylist.",
        "No one, I think, can write the way he does, and no one can hold our attention the way that he can, both on the page and you can see in that film.",
        "And I hope when we get the audio that we we're processing now, you can really tell his dramatic influence."

        "Now we keep hearing about how we're going to need to fix the levees, make the city more waterproof.",

        "Well, we certainly have to fix the levees.",
        "Without the levees, you'd have to abandon New Orleans completely and much of the coast.",
        "But I think the important point to begin a discussion about what went wrong is simply to answer the question of why New Orleans is below sea level to begin with?",
        "In all the recent coverage, the media seem to have uncritically accepted this really weird fact that the city of New Orleans is below sea level.",

        "Those huge earthen river dikes that have kept the city dry and inhabitable for 300 years have also created this giant bathtub that we now see full of water on TV.",
        "And that's because in every great river delta in the world, every great delta is shaped by two very unforgiving geological phenomenon.",
        "And the first involved flooding, and I think that's the one most people are familiar with.",
        "The annual repeated overflow of the sediment-rich Mississippi River water is what created Louisiana's whole--that whole ragged sole of the Louisiana boot by depositing these waterborne sediments and nutrients flowing down from two-thirds of America over the last 7,000 years.",
        "But the second major deltaic feature is something called subsidence or sinking.",
        "It's just a fancy geological term for sinking.",
        "Those same deposits of alluvial soil are extremely fine and unstable, and over time, they compact, they shrink in volume, and they sink.",
        "But historically along the Louisiana coast, new flooding and new deposits of sediment counterbalance the sinking and, in fact, led to net land building.",
        "But by putting these huge levees on the Mississippi River and channeling all that sediment-rich water right out into the deep water of the Gulf, we're just left with the subsidence, and that's why New Orleans is below sea level, and that's why so much of the coast has imploded and disappeared, especially in the last hundred years, and we basically created a water landing strip for Karina to slam into the city like an airplane flying into the World Trade Center.",
        "I mean, that's how we got this scale of calamity.",
        "Well, if we were to rebuild New Orleans, could we do it in a way that would incorporate the natural flooding of the rivers and the deposition of the silt again?",
        "Well, it's a great question, and the answer is, yes.",
        "It's a resounding yes.",
        "The governor of Louisiana, Kathleen Blanco, had said from the start that we can't just rebuild the city of New Orleans.",
        "We have to literally re-engineer the coast.",
        "And the good news is is that there's a plan to do it.",
        "There's a detailed restoration scheme that's been on the table since the 1990s that would re-engineer this coast.",
        "The plan is to build up to a dozen dam-like control structures right into the levees of the Mississippi, and these would then release the sediment-thick water into canals and pipelines that would surgically direct this, quote, unquote, \"\"liquid soil\"\" toward the barrier islands and out to the buffering marsh lands that need immediate restoration.",
        "And how many years would that take?",
        "Well, it depends on how you do it.",
        "The more--originally, the idea was to build these manmade rivers and canals that the water would flow out--fairly slowly out into these coastal areas.",
        "But in the last few years, engineers have become increasingly certain that they can engineer these giant pipelines that would--it would suck the particularly sediment-thick water off the bottom of the river and pump it directly out into the areas that need it the most.",
        "And I heard an engineer just the other day say that he could build a barrier island in a year that way.",
        "So we can do it.",
        "We can do it.",
        "It's going to take some time, but it's also going to take money.",
        "It's going to take about $14 billion, which used to seem like a lot of money.",
        "Right.",
        "But after Katrina hit, it sounds like nothing.",
        "It's basically the cost of the Big Dig in Boston or, you know, a month of military spending in Iraq.",
        "You could rebuild most of the coast of Louisiana."
