        "But would the barrier islands have afforded that much protection from Katrina?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "When the French first settled in that great crescent in the Mississippi River that later became known as New Orleans, when they first settled there 300 years ago, there was, between that point that became New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico, vast, dense hardwood forests.",
        "And after those forests, heading closer to the Gulf, there were vast freshwater marshes and swamps.",
        "And after those marshes, there were endless saltwater marshes.",
        "And then after those, there was a formidable network of broad and tall barrier islands.",
        "Fine.",
        "Good.",
        "I just find it's quite ironic that we have an environmentalist on, talking about rebuilding levees when, if you do any Google search on levee opposition, you will get countless articles about environmental groups opposing levees specifically in New Orleans.",
        "And I find this very, very ironic.",
        "Mike.",
        "Four celebrity judges sit in red super villain chairs with their backs turned to the stage, and then someone things.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"\"THE VOICE\"\")",
        "All of what I've just described is gone now.",
        "There are no forests between New Orleans and the Gulf.",
        "There are no freshwater marshes.",
        "There are just remnants of saltwater marshes, and there are just basically sand shoals, remnants of what used to be barrier islands.",
        "That is why Katrina hit with such force.",
        "If Katrina had landed 300, 200, even 50 years ago, you would not have seen the same damage.",
        "What we need to do is basically build and rebuild some speed bumps between the Gulf and the city of New Orleans.",
        "And we can do it.",
        "It's just the commitment--I mean, a lot of money's about to be spent right now, and I think a lot of it's going to be spent wisely and some of it may be spent unwisely.",
        "But what we have to make sure is that we don't spend--fix a single broken window or pick up a single piece of debris unless we simultaneously commit to this coastal plan to repair the coast.",
        "Would that include the coasts of Mississippi also, where Biloxi got wiped out?",
        "Is that something different going on there?",
        "That's something different going on there.",
        "You know, you could just look at the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama and say, `You know what?",
        "Gosh darn it.",
        "Maybe it just doesn't make a lot of sense to build houses on a beach line in the middle of a hurricane alley.",
        "But when you look at New Orleans, New Orleans has never been beachfront property.",
        "It has been a low-lying city surrounded by buffering marshes and insulated and protected by barrier islands.",
        "And it has made sense to live there.",
        "It has made sense to develop there.",
        "But as we've destroyed the wetlands through these levees, it increasingly is impossible to live there, as Katrina made clear."

        "So it would almost seem like until you've, quote, unquote, \"\"fixed\"\" New Orleans, and possibly in the way that you're suggesting, how could you tell people to go back and live there in a danger zone?",
        "Well...",
        "If this has happened once, we know it's going to happen again, I would...",
        "It could happen a week from now.",
        "That's the great question, and, you know, we've gotten lucky in the last few years.",
        "I mean, Katrina could have happened five years ago as well or even 10 years ago, and the situation is still extremely ripe for another hurricane like Katrina to hit.",
        "I think it's safe to say, though, it's unlikely that one of that caliber, moving in that direction, is going to come again anytime soon.",
        "But anything can happen.",
        "What we have to do in the meantime is immediately rebuild those levees, which, unfortunately, the city of New Orleans and the state and the Army Corps and the federal government all deserve blame for not having those levees high enough.",
        "We've got to rebuild the levees.",
        "We've got to make sure that even if a Category 4 strikes again, that we don't have overtopping from Pontchartrain.",
        "And we can do that very quickly.",
        "And in the meantime, we've got to rebuild the barrier islands and the wetlands.",
        "But you mentioned earlier the issue of global warming, which is another wild card that we absolutely have to address.",
        "Yeah, which would mean that other coastal cities are in trouble also.",
        "Yes.",
        "For me, you know, I and a handful of other journalists and elected officials and activists have been saying for years that, `Katrina is coming, Katrina is coming.",
        "We basically predicted that this would happen.",
        "Nothing that's happened in the last 10 days was, you know, unpredicted.",
        "There have been no surprises, none, including the refugees and the stranded poor in New Orleans.",
        "All this was predicted.",
        "And now I and a number of other observers are now saying with equal certainty that Katrina is coming to every coastal city in America unless we take seriously new warning signs.",
        "And those involve the issue of global climate change.",
        "You know, Katrina hit with so much force because there was virtually no land between it and the Gulf, and that's because the whole land platform of south Louisiana sank between two and three feet in the last hundred years because of the subsidence we talked about earlier.",
        "Now the Bush administration's own data, from its own agencies, in its own reports say that because of global climate change in this century, we will see between one and three feet of sea level rise worldwide.",
        "Now whether the land sinks three feet per century, as in New Orleans, or the sea level rises three feet per century, as in the rest of the world, you have the same problem.",
        "If you want to see what Shanghai, Gdansk, Poland, Bombay, India, and New York City are all going to be obsessively dealing with 50, 75, a hundred years from now, turn on your television and look at New Orleans, because that same sea level rise from global warming will wipe out barrier islands, destroy buffering wetlands and cause all kinds of problems to cities that are designed and built along the East Coast.",
        "So now we have a period to prepare for that before that might happen."

        "Human intervention along that coast basically created the landing strip for Katrina to land on New Orleans.",
        "And so your point is well-taken.",
        "We have interfered and intervened in the environment in south Louisiana.",
        "You know, this gets back to the law of unintended consequences.",
        "When the French first started throwing up levees 300 years ago to protect them from the Mississippi River, they did it for perfectly rational reasons.",
        "They didn't want their children to drown.",
        "They didn't want their crops inundated.",
        "They didn't want their property destroyed.",
        "At the same time, they had no intention of causing the barrier islands and the wetlands and the whole coast to implode, but it happened.",
        "Now we have New Orleans where it is now.",
        "We have two million people who live along the Louisiana coast now.",
        "We can't simply rip down the levees and let the river go wild.",

        "So how can we do the next best thing?",
        "And that is how can we try to live sustainably with the river?",
        "How can we mimic the natural flooding of the river and to get those sediment-rich waters into the coastal areas, especially in the spring when the river is really swollen from rainfall across two-thirds of America?",
        "When the river has a lot of surplus of water and which is the time of year it historically flooded, we can get a lot of that water out into these coastal areas without disrupting navigation processes.",
        "So we've got to figure out a way--a tricky way to live sustainably to let the river do as much as it did naturally, but guide it by human things.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The only other option is just rip down the levees, and no one's going to accept that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Why don't we call the Dutch in on this?",

        "And even though they're behind those seawalls, it's not a sustainable way to go forward in the future.",
        "Sooner or later, sea level rise and subsidence of that land will make that whole living arrangement in Holland unsustainable, believe me.",

        "They're not letting water into that, and it continues to subside.",
