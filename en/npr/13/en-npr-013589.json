        "Good to talk with you, Farai.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Hello, Farai.",
        "So, Mr. Kane, most people say that Charlie Rangel's push for a draft is political.",
        "It's about making a statement about who's serving in the war.",
        "And he and others may believe that it's disproportionately low-income youths and minorities who are bearing the brunt of the sacrifice.",
        "Do you agree?",
        "No, I think Congressman Rangel's heart is in the right place, but he has been misinformed by a pretty persistent myth.",
        "And maybe it's a bit of a Vietnam hangover that the troops that get stuck in the military are the less fortunate among us.",
        "But, you know, when I served it was part of the all-volunteer force.",
        "Of course, I've been out of the military for I think over 10 years now.",
        "But I was curious about this question and I wanted to go back and actually get demographic data.",
        "So we asked the Pentagon for information on all recruits in 2003, 2004, 2005 -the wartime recruits, and we actually compared them to '99 recruits.",
        "And so the findings were surprising on two levels.",
        "Well, what I don't think should happen is that we should exclude refugees.",
        "What I do think we should do is to adequately vet them.",
        "And so I think there's legitimate concern when people are saying we want to make sure that we have a secure situation so that we have genuine refugees, that we don't have people smuggled along who are attempting to harm us.",
        "That's a legitimate concern.",
        "And so I don't paint everyone who's worried here with a kind of xenophobic or racist brush, even though we do have - we do have a great deal of that going on in our rhetoric as well.",
        "Rabbi, what about you?",
        "Are you hearing from members of your congregation about this issue, and are you talking to them about it?",
        "And what are you saying?",
        "I am, actually.",
        "I would echo what the pastor said, although I might use somewhat different language in the sense that the first concession, obligation is to acknowledge that the threat is real and the vigilance has to be very high.",
        "But I would say that compassion has to be informed by fear, but it can't be controlled by panic.",
        "And that, unfortunately, is a little bit of what's happening now.",
        "And as a Jew, this cuts both ways because on the one hand, I'm aware of the fact that Syrian refugees come from a place where the level of anti-Semitism is almost unimaginably high, and so even refugees who don't have designs on doing bad things in the United States still carry with them a viral strain of anti-Semitism that, as a Jew, concerns me very much.",
        "On the other hand, I'm also aware of what happened when Jews were - if they were from Germany, they were thought of as spies or were thought of as communists, and boats were turned away and people perished.",
        "And so I have this sort of dual agenda of being very careful who we let into this country but also understanding that this is a country of immigrants, always has been.",
        "And it's unseemly and unethical for all these immigrants to say now that we're here and we're doing well, we're going to pull up the ladder from behind us and not let other people who are suffering in terror, fleeing, oppressed come in and join us."

        "Russell Moore, that raises a question for me about what is the kind of moral and ethical hierarchy at work here?",
        "I mean, often - we are often called upon to balance competing ethical claims, right?",
        "Right, right.",
        "So which one should prevail here, in your opinion?",
        "Well, I think we keep them in tension.",
        "Some of the rhetoric that's being used right now about giving ID badges to Muslim-American citizens or shutting down mosques, I mean, this sort of language is not an American value.",
        "And...",
        "Well, let me stop you there though...",
        "...It's really very scary.",
        "...Because some of the people who are using that rhetoric are people who see themselves as allied with your organization's values.",
        "I mean, it just is not a secret that many people who kind of identify with the evangelical tradition in the United States tend to be very attracted to the Republican Party right now for all kinds of reasons.",
        "Right.",
        "So what do you do?",
        "Well, before we're Americans, we're Christians.",
        "And so we have to be informed by a certain moral sense, which means that we need to speak up for moral principle and for gospel principle regardless of who that offends.",
        "And so we have to be the people who stand up and say look, vigilance is good and prudence is good.",
        "But a kind of irrational fear that leads itself to demagogic rhetoric is something that we have to say no - no, we're not going to go there."

        "This is Rabbi Wolpe.",

        "It is not just a rhetoric here.",
        "And the values that you deeply believe in, you take some risks for.",
        "That's part of what it means to believe in a value.",
        "And of course, it's easy to stand for your values at a time that everybody agrees with them and poses no risk, but this isn't that time.",
        "Rabbi, what do you see as your role right now?",
        "I see the role of a rabbi or a pastor in general sort of like the role of a quarterback who throws the ball a little bit ahead of the receiver - that is you want to make people run just a bit to catch up to the message that you offer.",
        "That's Rabbi David Wolpe.",
        "He leads the Sinai Temple in Los Angeles.",
        "Also with us, Russell Moore, he leads the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission for the Southern Baptist Convention.",
        "And I do want to mention for those who are interested that we spoke with Rabbi Wolpe in advance of the Sabbath.",

        "Thank you.",
        "Thank you.",
        "This is how a hiring process normally works - a hiring manager posts an opening, describes the ideal candidate and then come the resumes.",
        "After doing some interviews, the manager has to make a gut decision.",
        "Who's the best person for the job?",
        "Well, research shows that more often than not managers pick someone whose background is similar to theirs.",
        "Brenda Salinas of Texas Standard, a program produced by our member stations in the state, introduces us to someone who thinks that he knows how to get around that problem.",
        "Petar Vujosevic was just a regular guy who saw a big problem with the way the hiring system works.",
        "There is definitely room to improve how we view talent, how we screen talent, how we engage with talent and how we end up interviewing talent.",
        "By talent he means all the gifted young people he knew that weren't getting job interviews at technology companies because they didn't fit a certain idea of what a good job candidate looks like.",
        "They didn't graduate from college, they taught themselves to code or they had a strong accent.",

        "Right now we are able to do blind auditions for software engineering roles, design roles, marketing roles, communication roles and allow candidates that might on paper not be a good fit, prove that they actually are.",
        "So Vujosevic created a website called GapJumpers where employers post a job along with some sort of challenge, like create a webpage or write a social media strategy.",
        "To apply for the job, you just take on the challenge.",

        "Senate race.",

        "How many of you all here are leading a better life than did your parents, if you'd raise your hands?",
        "Well, that's everyone.",
        "How many of you all believe, truly believe, that your children will have better opportunities in life than you had?",
        "Far fewer put up their hands.",
        "Allen says the response here in the prosperous Washington suburbs is a bit more positive than in other, more economically hard pressed areas of the state, and that concern about the future is a cornerstone of his campaign.",
        "George Allen is a familiar figure to Virginia voters.",
        "He served four years as governor, six as senator, and appeared to be well on his way to a second senate term before he was derailed by his now infamous macaca moment.",
        "That was the slur he used to describe an Indian-American man who was taping one of his campaign appearances.",
        "That was more than five years ago.",
        "Now Allen is back, on the campaign trail, serving notice that he intends to tie his opponent next November, Tim Kaine to the man who will be at the top of the ticket next year, President Obama.",
        "He's been for this Obama stimulus that has not created the jobs they've promised, he has been for tax increases now in the midst of this weak economy, as he did as governor.",
        "He's for this health, this Obama care, which is such an impediment to hiring, and so I have a different vision.",
        "Allen's vision, encompasses traditional Republican themes - low taxes, and small government, except when it comes to defense spending.",
        "That's a key distinction in Virginia, home to the Pentagon, the CIA, several major military bases and a huge industry of national security contractors.",
        "All are highly reliant on continued federal spending on security, which by one estimate pumps some $57 billion a year into the state's economy.",
        "Kaine, who was at the same forum, is also aware of the importance of defense dollars, which is why he says Congress should let the Bush-era tax cuts for upper income taxpayers expire."
