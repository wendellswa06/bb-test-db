        "Before we slash defense past the point of no return, we ought to be talking about doing exactly what Congress promised, and I think what they should do is they should let the Bush cuts expire at the top end over 500,000 thousand a year.",
        "The reason I say that is if we make cuts and we're going to and I know how to do them, I did them as governor, we will effect middle and lower income people the most with the cuts.",
        "Kaine is also familiar to Virginia voters, he served as mayor of Richmond, and four years as governor.",
        "Most recently, he was President Obama's hand- picked chairman of the Democratic National Committee.",
        "Kaine was an early Obama supporter and the President pushed him to enter the Senate race when Jim Webb announced his retirement.",
        "Virginia political analyst Mark Rozell of George Mason University says those ties will be difficult for Kaine to shake.",
        "That will be one of the challenges for Tim Kaine, his very close association with a president who right now has relatively low approval ratings during a period of economic anxiety in the country.",
        "Most Democrats who have run successfully in Virginia have run as moderate conservatives and they have separated themselves very clearly from the national Democratic Party.",
        "Tim Kaine really can't do that.",
        "Kaine concedes his ties to the president will work both ways in the fall.",
        "People will make up their own mind.",
        "I mean I'm sure the fact that I worked closely with the president is something some people like and some people don't, but I've been in office for 17 years in Virginia as mayor and governor and I got a track record of my own, and I think people understand what that is.",
        "And all the female mosquitoes become mutants.",
        "They can't bite or spread malaria and, more importantly, can't lay eggs.",
        "So eventually the population dies out.",
        "We go after the mosquito because it's the mosquito that transmit malaria - no mosquito, no malaria.",
        "It's a very simple equation.",
        "One is we found that the educational level of wartime recruits is higher than civilian peers.",
        "They come from wealthier neighborhoods on average than their civilian peers, and that those two trends in particular are increasing.",
        "So you see more and more education.",
        "For example, the recruits of about 97 percent have a high school diploma, civilian peers 80 percent.",
        "It's a very high-qualified force and it ends up being insulting when people say we need to draft for social justice.",
        "The exact opposite is true."

        "I think that's a good way to put it.",
        "The military has great opportunities, and I think education is one of them.",
        "And so African-Americans have tended to want to join in the past, or have joined in high numbers.",

        "That is, are Army recruiters or Marine recruiters targeting urban areas or targeting high unemployment areas or targeting black areas?",
        "We couldn't find evidence of that.",
        "In fact, the 103-digit zip codes with the highest concentration of African-Americans are underrepresented, even though African-Americans themselves are over-represented in the Army and the rest of the services.",

        "Dorn, does this ring true to you, this analysis of the statistics?",

        "Farai, let me comment on Tim Kane's study, which is quite serviceable to fiscal analysis, and then get to the real issues here.",
        "Tim is absolutely correct that in a broad sense the military excludes the truly disadvantaged.",
        "But it also excludes the truly advantaged.",
        "And that is what leads me to get to Charlie Rangel's real point.",
        "His real point is about shared sacrifice, and that's not simply a matter of economic - of class or race.",

        "You know, Charlie comes from an old school.",
        "He was an old school of American values which says that all Americans should share the sacrifice of war.",
        "That doesn't mean that all Americans actually are involved in the fight, but it does mean that they play a role.",
        "We now have with the all-volunteer force a situation in which only a very small percentage of American men and women have that shared experience of military service."

        "But there is a third phrase called chicken hawks; those are the people who support war but somehow manage to use deferments to avoid actually serving in war.",
        "And certainly Vietnam was not equitable in that sense.",
        "Blacks were over-represented, and they were more heavily over-represented during the early days of the all-volunteer force.",
        "They're slightly over-represented now.",
        "African-Americans comprise 18 to 20 percent of the active force as opposed to about 13 percent of the enlistment-age cohorts, so that's slight over-representation.",
        "They're not over-represented in the combat arms, I should stress.",
        "And so I think Charles Rangel is aware of that and he's aware that the concern is not really the color or race of the people in the body bags coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "His concern I think is a broader one and a legitimate one about shared sacrifice - who's serving, but also who's paying for service.",

        "That is very tough on people who are trying to maintain a family life, trying to build their careers and so on.",
        "It is, however, and I go back to the study that you mentioned earlier, it is an extraordinarily fine force of well educated, highly motivated, and disciplined men and women.",
