        "What surprised you about the Mark Zuckerberg of today?",
        "I think he has come to grips with the fact that the first wave of public fascination with social media is ending.",
        "But he doesn't yet have an answer for what's going to follow.",
        "He doesn't know what it means to be more than just a tool that is put into the hands of the public, and then they decide what to do with it.",
        "He doesn't have answers to the questions of, how do we define the boundaries of free speech; how do we control the risks of contributing to violence?",
        "These are really hard problems.",

        "Does he have a grasp of that?",
        "He does now.",
        "It's been a very painful process to learn it.",
        "I think if you'd asked him this in October of 2016, right before the election, he would have said, look; it's up to national governments to protect their own institutions and protect their democracy.",
        "He's come to recognize that there is a unique responsibility that comes with having a platform that is larger than any country on Earth.",
        "And that means - and it's a slightly daunting prospect that the integrity and sanctity of elections around the world do now rest to some degree on the shoulders of Mark Zuckerberg and his employees at Facebook.",
        "And he does take that seriously.",
        "Are they ready?",
        "We won't know, to be blunt, until those elections happen.",
        "There have been a few elections this year in which they had been able to prevent the kind of rampant disinformation that was such a problem in 2016.",
        "They've taken down a couple of big information operations in the last few months.",
        "But they don't have a measurement system that helps them know before the fact.",

        "And Facebook's value dropped more than $100 billion in after-hours trading.",

        "So what happened?",

        "They didn't report as much revenue as Wall Street was expecting, and they had the lowest user growth since 2011.",
        "And this is key.",

        "So the company did actually see a 31 percent rise in profits from a year ago, which would be great for a lot of companies but not Facebook because it's been such a rocket ship of growth that that wasn't enough to keep Wall Street happy.",

        "All right.",
        "So tell me - what was the legal reasoning the Supreme Court used when they decided Roe v.",
        "Wade?",
        "It was basically that there was a right of privacy that made it possible for women to make the decision about whether to continue or terminate a pregnancy.",
        "And that has continued to be the focus of several Supreme Court decisions since then.",
        "What changed when that ruling was handed down in 1973?",
        "Well, for women, everything - because once the decision came down, it meant that doctors were then free to perform abortions legally and didn't have to be afraid they would be arrested for an illegal abortion.",
        "Back in 1992, the Supreme Court weighed a case, Planned Parenthood v.",
        "Casey, that might have overturned Roe v.",
        "Wade.",
        "Now, Justice Kennedy was the swing vote that prevented that.",
        "By your understanding, what were the legal principles that guided him in that case?",
        "Well, I think it was still the right to privacy.",
        "But in that case, no state law had made abortion illegal.",
        "It made it much more difficult, with conditions about what the room had to look like and what the - how wide the hallways had to be and all kinds of things.",
        "And Justice Kennedy basically said, no, Roe v.",
        "Wade makes abortion legal, and you can't do all these conditions, as Pennsylvania had done, that makes it impossible for access.",
        "How might Kavanaugh or the court change the way Roe v.",
        "Wade is interpreted?",
        "Well, my guess is that someone like Kavanaugh would write an opinion basically saying there is no right of privacy.",
        "The language is not in the Constitution, and so it doesn't really exist.",
        "It was made up by the justices at the time.",
        "There's also a possibility they would say, well, it still allows the states to legislate in whatever way they want to.",
        "But frankly, I have no idea what he might do, except I'm sure he'll be against Roe v.",
        "Wade.",
        "Well what do you make of the argument that this is a state's rights issue, that this should be decided by individual states?",
        "Under the court's decision, privacy is not meant to be a one-state deal.",
        "It's meant to be the basis for people living in all the United States.",
        "And it has been up to now."

        "And one of the ways that I persuaded him to make the sort of film we made is I said, look, I want this to be a film about you the man, not you the myth.",

        "In the second quarter, the company's growth slowed by 7 percent, and executives of Facebook say the company is going to continue to see a slower pace of growth for the rest of the year, in part because the company's going to give users more privacy setting options.",
        "And that means it may limit the kinds of ads that they can see.",
        "And in Europe, they've got this brand-new privacy law that allows users to completely opt out of sharing their data.",
        "And the second thing is that the company says it's going to spend more money on security.",
        "CEO Mark Zuckerberg says that's going to have an effect on profits.",

        "It collected data through a personality quiz they put up on the site.",
        "In the end, the firm was able to get personal information about some 87 million users.",
        "The third problem with the company is that it faces all the allegations about fake news going viral on the site.",
        "All that led to CEO Zuckerberg having to testify before Congress in April.",
        "And a lot of people praised his testimony, but it kept the spotlight on the problem.",
        "And while it didn't look like Congress was going to do anything right away, there was talk that Facebook had become too big.",
        "It doesn't face much competition.",
        "It could be a monopoly.",
