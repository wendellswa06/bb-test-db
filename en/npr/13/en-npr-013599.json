        "And our financial capabilities have been tremendously weakened.",

        "What's the American responsibility here on out?",
        "Well, on the positive side, I think it's shameful how few visas we've been giving to Iraqis.",
        "We should be educating the new generation of Iraqi students.",
        "Those who are enter - when this new government is formed, when it finishes in four years, those who are entering Baghdad University would have been eight years old when Saddam Hussein fell from power.",
        "And it's incumbent that we give them all the opportunities which they deserve.",
        "With regard to flooding them on - the country with money, I fully agree.",
        "And because of Iraqi corruption, most of that money, anyway, goes to American contractors.",
        "It doesn't go to Iraq.",
        "We should be more helping the Iraqis learn how to manage projects, manage that money that will come in through their own oil revenue.",
        "Is it fair to say that if violence continues to diminish, oil revenues should make it possible for Iraq to fund its own reconstruction?"

        "The General Federation of Iraqi Women was disbanded, and since then many women leaders have been targeted and killed.",
        "And as one of the major subtexts for going to war - women's human rights, that is - I'd like to ask the panelists what they think.",
        "Well, I know during - you know, for years after the invasion, the war, when there was almost a complete breakdown in civil society, women were raped and kidnapped, particularly, and, you know, bore the brunt of a lot of the sectarian violence that occurred.",
        "And there's been talk about, you know, bringing in more fundamental law into certain aspect of Iraqi society, which is usually not a good thing for women.",
        "So - I mean, I would defer to - I wouldnt presuppose to speak for Iraqi women, but, you know, it hasn't, I think, always been the best deal for them.",
        "Michael?",
        "Short answer, yes and no. If you go back to the 2000 - the year 2000 State Department Human Rights reports, you'll see that Saddam and specifically Saddam's Fedayeen was starting to target educated women, beheading several and so forth.",
        "Immediately after the war, David's absolutely correct, women were targeted.",
        "Women have started to emerge from this.",
        "Many more women are in parliament.",
