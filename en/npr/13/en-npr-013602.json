        "He's not flamboyant.",
        "He's very thoughtful, effective in a low-key manner, not boisterous, not arrogant but very firm.",
        "That low-key approach stands in contrast to the president's other new lawyer, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who has turned heads with a series of eyebrow-raising interviews with the media.",
        "Flood, in contrast, has kept his head down.",
        "He has made no media appearances since joining Trump's stable of lawyers last week.",

        "Instead, he's been meeting with other members of Trump's legal team to get up to speed.",
        "That under-the-radar approach comes as no surprise to Glen Donath, who worked with Flood on President Bill Clinton's legal team during Clinton's impeachment.",
        "I don't think you'll see Emmet taking any kind of a role in the press and trying to litigate this through press appearances and tweets and public statements.",
        "Flood's focus, Donath says, boils down to this.",
        "Emmet is a lawyer's lawyer who does his work either behind the scenes or in a court of law.",
        "Still, Flood's addition likely signals a more aggressive stance from the White House in its relationship with the Mueller investigation, particularly over executive privilege.",
        "A man who has had firsthand experience butting heads with Flood over White House prerogatives is Elliot Mincberg.",
        "He was a fierce defender of executive privilege and prerogative.",
        "Mincberg served as chief oversight counsel for the House Judiciary Committee when the panel was investigating the Bush administration's firing of U.S.",
        "attorneys.",
        "He says Flood dug in his heels and was unwilling to compromise on handing over certain executive materials the committee had voted to obtain, which is partly why, he says, Flood is a good hire for team Trump.",
        "I think it was a smart move, frankly, for the White House to add someone like Emmet Flood.",
        "And I think it suggests that the White House is - appears to now be in a mood to fight.",
        "Former colleagues say that Flood's views on presidential privilege and prerogatives are rooted in his past White House work.",
        "Flood was one of the key architects of the legal defense to the articles of impeachment against Clinton during the investigation of independent counsel Kenneth Starr.",
        "That experience also helped fuel his skepticism of special prosecutors with a wide-ranging mandate.",
        "Again, Donath."

        "Those of us who represented President Clinton became very sensitive to prosecutorial overreach, to the unique dangers presented by an independent counsel with roving jurisdiction and through partisan exercises that looked like efforts by the opposing party to try to replace the president that was properly elected.",
