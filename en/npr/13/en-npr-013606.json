        "A bit of troubling news for millions of people who hail rides or earn money using the Uber app.",
        "Yeah.",
        "There's been a massive hack of information about Uber riders and drivers.",
        "The hack happened about a year ago, but the company is only now disclosing it and the fact that company officials paid off the hackers to keep this whole thing quiet.",
        "Let's bring in NPR tech reporter Aarti Shahani, who's been following this story.",
        "Hi, Aarti.",
        "Hi.",
        "OK.",
        "So I've used Uber, and I'm just thinking, they've got my credit card info, they've got records of wherever I've been in their cars.",
        "Is that the kind of information the hackers got?",
        "No.",
        "In this case, Uber says it's not the information the hackers got.",
        "Not your trip history, not your bank account or Social Security number.",
        "For Uber passengers, what Uber says is that hackers got names, email addresses and mobile phone numbers.",
        "The group that is far worse off here are the Uber drivers, OK?",
        "Six-hundred-thousand of them in the U.S.",
        "got their full names as well as their full driver's license numbers stolen.",
        "That is very personal.",
        "And, you know, Uber drivers already feel like the company doesn't look out for them.",
        "It's something we've reported on.",
        "Uber promised to clean up its act, and yet here's another example of Uber not doing their drivers right.",
        "Why would Uber pay off the hackers to keep quiet about this?",
        "Well, it's a scandal.",
        "(Laughter).",
        "The man at Uber who is in charge of security, his name is Joe Sullivan.",
        "According to a source close to the company, Sullivan covered it up and actually paid the hackers $100,000 to delete the data and keep their mouth shut about it.",
        "This part is heartbreaking to a lot of security experts in Silicon Valley.",
        "Sullivan is someone who'd been considered to be a role model, a former federal prosecutor, you know, someone who was supposed to be a public servant in his past life.",
        "He hid this from regulators.",
        "And the timing isn't arbitrary, OK?",
        "Because while this is going down, Uber is actually negotiating with the Federal Trade Commission, the FTC, over claims that the company misled drivers in another way, about how much drivers could earn on the job and how the car-leasing program at Uber actually worked.",
        "The company had also just agreed to another FTC settlement - suit, rather, around consumer data.",
        "So there were incentives in house to keep things hush hush.",
        "Is part of the problem here also that the company was going through a leadership churn and all kinds of other unrelated problems like harassment and discrimination claims?",
        "Well, I mean, what you're saying is pointing to an issue of ongoing cultural problems at the company and a sort of approach to managing issues, which is sort of like a bull in a china shop, irrespective of what the rules actually are.",
        "And, you know, you could say that while Uber has really turned a corner because so much of its leadership has changed, right, there's a new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, and it didn't happen on his watch.",
        "In the blog post he published yesterday, he says he learned about the hack only recently.",
        "He is letting the authorities know about it, and he kicked out Sullivan and another employee involved in the cover up.",
        "You know, so that's sort of an indication of, OK, things are turning the corner."

        "But devoted a Bear fan, as I am, nobody has a hotter hand now than Aaron Rodgers and the Packers.",
        "And the three-point advantage the odds makers have given them seems even a little small to me.",
        "Now, that said, Uber still does have the former CEO, Travis Kalanick on their board.",
        "Travis is still trying to exercise influence over the company.",
        "And so, you know, in moments like this, I don't think it's fair to assume Uber is just going to get it right on its own because it's got a new CEO.",
        "You have to assume that it's the pressure from outside, whether it's from reporting or from regulators or from courts, that's going to help keep it honest.",

        "OK.",

        "Sylvia, what's happening where you are?",
        "Well, we are in a break now.",
        "The presiding judge at the tribunal in The Hague has been reading already, for about 45 minutes, a summary of the ruling.",
        "So far the court has found that yes, genocide was committed in Srebrenica and in six other municipalities in Bosnia.",
        "If you remember, Srebrenica was the town where some 8,000 Muslim men and boys were massacred in 1995.",
        "The other case Mladic is facing is for genocide, also accused for genocide, for the three-and-a-half-year long siege of Sarajevo.",
        "The prosecution premise is that Mladic was responsible for a campaign of ethnic cleansing aimed at creating a purely monoethnic Serbian state.",
        "And the court heard hundreds of witnesses, thousands of exhibits, and there were, you know, there's a lot of evidence.",
        "There were many video clips of Mladic giving orders to his troops to separate army-age men from their families before executing them and dumping their bodies in mass graves that were later uncovered across the region.",
        "Does he deny any of this?"
