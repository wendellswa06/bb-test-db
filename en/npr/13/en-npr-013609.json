        "We're talking with former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright about This American Moment.",
        "You're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "And let's get Zia(ph) on the line.",
        "Zia is calling from Glendale in Arizona.",
        "Hi.",
        "Actually, I am from Afghanistan, and my name is Zia.",
        "I'd like to say hello to you and to your guest, Madeleine Albright.",
        "I am a political scientist here in Arizona.",
        "Every time that I call back home in Afghanistan - and I have family that lives in Pakistan - this election means so much to them that the first thing - they don't ask how I am, they ask who's going to win the American election.",
        "I think this election means reforming the American policy and trying to introduce a new image of America to the world that America is a nation that supports democracy around the world.",
        "Unfortunately, in the last few years, I think that this true image of America hasn't been reflected truly.",
        "And I'd just like to make another statement that I think - I have been in Pakistan and I have been in Afghanistan, I have been in United States for a short while - I think Obama has a true understanding of war and terrorism and that two in safe haven as the terrorists in Pakistan.",
        "So I think that's the main reason that they have to be targeted here in order to defeat them.",
        "Interesting, Zia, do you think Senator Obama has experience of war and terrorism?",
        "Senator McCain went through a horrible experience in Vietnam during the war.",
        "He was a military aviator.",
        "He spent quite a number of years in the military and knows a great deal about war and about terrorism, too.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I understand.",
        "That's a great question.",
        "I'm just 22 years old, but I have been on the ground.",
        "What Obama says it's a true judgment, it's a true understanding of war on terrorism.",
        "But sometime, I mean, for example, in my class, your teachers that have great experience but they cannot make their strategy work better.",
        "But your other teachers, they don't have experienced much but they can make the student understand fully what they want the students to understand.",
        "So I think Obama's judgment and the way he will work out will be very effective.",
        "I mean, sometimes, people do have experience.",
        "It doesn't mean that experience will be fully practiced and will be fully effective and efficient.",
        "Secretary Albright, I wondered if you had a comment.",
        "Well, I think this very interesting comment from Zia, and he certainly comes from one of the most troubled parts of the world and a very important one to his own people and to the rest of the world.",
        "I think that what I find interesting about Senator Obama is that he has a 21st century approach to these kinds of problems, and he understands what creates terrorists, that, in fact, terrible conditions, and lack of a good educational system, and people being marginalized because they are poor.",
        "Those are all issues that provide very good recruiting ground for people who hate us.",
        "And I think that his sense that not only does there have to be some military action against al-Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden, but also that there has to be assistance in terms of developing educational opportunities for people in terms of helping on stabilizing the governments in those areas.",
        "Those are all part of fighting terrorism and that, I think, is what Zia is talking about, in terms of a full understanding of what we're dealing with instead of just thinking that military power alone will take care of the problem.",
        "Zia, thanks very much for the call and good luck to you.",
        "You're very welcome and I do appreciate it.",
        "And that's 100 percent true.",
        "I know the true knowledge on the ground.",
        "And that's - I think, if America chose Obama the president, it will change the whole face of America in the world and in America as well."
