        "He co-wrote the Broadway musical, \"\"Conquering Hero,\"\" which closed after just seven performances.",

        "A classic line; one constantly quoted by his friend, Mel Brooks, who went on to write \"\"The Producers,\"\" which famously features a lunatic musical built around Adolph Hitler.",
        "Larry Gelbart had much more success when he wrote the book for Stephen Sondheim's \"\"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\"\" in 1962, which brought Borscht Belt humor to ancient Rome, and it was a great fit.",
        "He moved to London then to escape religious freedom in America, he joked, but got called back in the '70s to help create \"\"M*A*S*H,\"\" the classic TV series that ran longer than the war in which it was set.",
        "For all those successes, the barber's son didn't need to work, at least for money.",
        "I need to write to find out what I'm thinking, Larry Gelbart said.",

        "I work on several things at once, then I'm never finished.",

        "But in December, when spurious reports winged around the Web that he had died of a massive stroke, he once again wrote his way out of pain with a one-liner.",

        "And the hearings next week on Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch will be no exception.",
        "But senators are likely to spend a lot of time on the nominee's views about federal regulations, on the environment, health and safety laws for workers, and laws on consumer rights and business.",

        "Essentially, this story is about a doctrine known as Chevron deference - no, don't turn this off.",
        "Give me a chance to explain.",
        "The Chevron decision is perhaps the most often cited case in American law.",
        "Decided unanimously in 1984, it established a general rule of deferring to an agency's reasonable interpretation of a statute.",
        "The idea is that in passing a law, Congress sets out broad provisions and tells agencies that have considerable expertise to establish rules for carrying out the law's mandates.",
        "In short, the agency is to fill in the details.",
        "Here's how the Chevron case came about.",
        "When the Reagan administration took office in the early 1980s, it adopted new and more permissive rules for air pollution by manufacturing plants.",
        "The Natural Resources Defense Council sued the EPA, then under the leadership of Anne Gorsuch, contending the agency had exceeded its authority.",
        "Recognize that name, Gorsuch?",
        "Yep, her son is the current Supreme Court nominee.",
        "Back then, the Supreme Court ultimately sided with the Reagan administration and Anne Gorsuch, declaring that where a statute is ambiguous, the court should defer to an agency's reasonable interpretation.",
        "Ironically, Judge Gorsuch has increasingly criticized that rule as an abdication of judicial responsibility.",
        "And in some of his dissenting and concurring opinions, he has called for reconsideration of the Chevron decision.",
        "It's one of the ways in which he is more conservative than the justice he's been nominated to succeed, the late Antonin Scalia.",
        "Scalia was generally an advocate of Chevron deference to agencies.",
        "His view was that agencies are at least politically accountable and judges are not.",
        "But as Case Western Reserve professor Jonathan Adler points out...",
        "Chevron can cut both ways.",
        "An agency may want Chevron deference when it wants to regulate more.",
        "But under the Trump administration, agencies will want to claim Chevron deference when they're trying to deregulate.",
        "And many Gorsuch defenders argue that having someone on the court less deferential to the agencies should reassure those who don't trust the Trump administration.",
        "Notre Dame law professor Jeffrey Pojanowski.",
        "It would be harder for a Trump administration to act independently when the law is unclear and the courts ultimately disagree with what their interpretation is.",
        "But Elliot Mincberg of the liberal People for the American Way argues Gorsuch himself is, quote, \"\"incredibly inconsistent\"\" - that he sides with agencies when they rule in favor of business and against agencies when they rule in favor of workers or consumers.",
        "Mincberg has looked at all of the Gorsuch dissents."

        "Any judge's dissents are particularly interesting because dissents are written essentially for yourself and express your point of view.",
        "And they show where you disagree with your own colleagues.",
        "And in Gorsuch's case, even though the 10th Circuit until fairly recently was a majority Republican circuit, Gorsuch is consistently to the right of even staunch conservatives.",
        "Perhaps no Gorsuch opinion sticks in the craw of liberals more than the so-called frozen trucker case.",
        "The trucker Alphonse Maddin was transporting cargo through Illinois when the brakes on his trailer froze.",
        "The temperature outside was 27 below zero.",

        "It's just not a word that a lot of people will associate with science, I'd say.",
        "But - so tell me why are you doing this?",
        "The idea is to really try to shift the public's perception of science, so that they don't see it as cold, and intimidating, and aloof, something that makes your head hurt, but rather something like great literature, music or art that enriches your life, that gives you a connection to your surroundings, that's hard to achieve in any other way.",
        "So, the point is to make science exciting and accessible, not watering it down, but really allow people to engage with the underlying ideas.",
        "Huh.",
        "And how did this idea come about?",
        "Well, I was asked to speak at the Genoa Science Festival.",
        "Europe has some of these science festivals.",
        "We don't.",
        "And I went there in 2005, together with Tracy Day, who's a broadcast journalist.",
        "And we stood in this square in this little town of Genoa, and science was kind of spilling out into the streets.",
        "People were so excited about it.",
        "There was electric sense of science in the atmosphere.",
        "And we stood there and said, wouldn't it be spectacular to do something like this in New York, where perhaps for a few days, science would become the headline, or science would be the main act.",
        "And people would be thinking about science, going to science, and really helping to shift science to the center of the public conversation.",
        "And they - we decided then to try to do it."

        "Our view is- or I should say, mine personally is, it is useful for kids in particular to blow things up, and to have sparks, and all that is good.",
        "But that is not really what the heart of science is.",
        "And it kind of limits your capacity to bring people in to science, if you limit it to bangs, and booms and things like that.",
        "So, we're really taking serious science - cosmology, quantum physics, neuroscience, sustainability, and creating programming that is really quite compelling, accessible and entertaining, but the science is really there in a significant way.",
        "So, there are kids' programs.",
        "I don't want to downplay that at all, but there's a broad-spectrum of adult programs where things don't blow up at all, but yet the programs are really quite wonderful.",
        "Give a couple of for instances.",
        "Well, last night I went to a program of ours, called Illuminating Genius.",
        "And the idea of the program is to bring together artists and neuroscientists, to try to have a conversation that teases out where creativity sits in the brain.",
        "Is it something that can be cultivated?",
        "Is it something that is obviously in the architecture of the brain?",
        "So, Bill T.",
        "Jones was there, Matthew Ritchie, neuroscientist Ramachandran was there, David Eagleman, another neuroscientist Nancy Andreasen, and yeah, Michael York did a performance piece to start it all off.",
        "And it was a real vibrant conversation at this interface between the creative arts, and neuroscientists were beginning to look in the brain with medical imaging devices, and beginning to get a sense of where that creative spark is.",
        "And who is coming?",
        "Who is your audience?",

        "So, we'll get a census of that shortly, but I have already spoken to a few of our data folks, and they have indicated that we are finding that kind of traction where people are saying, yeah, I didn't really think about science in those terms before, and it's really something that I would want to continue to pursue.",
