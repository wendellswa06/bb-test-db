        "Absolutely.",

        "Well, sir, it's a great question.",
        "And it all depends on what kind of impact one wants to have.",
        "I think at the level of the individual, if you're taking in science and making it into a part of your life, I think that's a start.",
        "If everybody were to do that, we would be in a completely different place in this country.",
        "So, I think that's the most important thing.",
        "But if one wants to have a broader impact, one of the great things that started happening lately in a variety of cities, are these cafe sciences.",
        "I don't know how much you are familiar with those, where scientists from universities or from research laboratories go to a local restaurant, of a bar, or pub, and sit there and just talk to people without PowerPoint, without visuals, about science.",
        "So, if you can organize that kind of a gathering in your community, it's the kind of thing where people would really just come out and experience science in a very informal way.",
        "I think that they're very effective.",
        "Great.",
        "Well, thanks.",
        "Those cafes, do they attract an audience?",
        "Have you gone to them?",
        "I have gone to them.",
        "I did one myself, a version of one down in Texas not too long ago, and they do attract a pretty broad audience, because it's not often that you have that kind of informal exchange with scientists.",
        "And I think it's something which people find very valuable.",
        "Was hard for you to sell this idea, to get the funding to do it, and to get it off the ground?",
        "Well, it's always a lot of work to get funding, as anybody in the non-profit sector knows all too well.",
        "But when we road tested this idea with university presidents, we went to Lee Bollinger at Columbia, John Sexton at NYU, Paul Nurse at Rockefeller, Matthew Goldstein at CUNY, George Campbell at Cooper Union, the universal reaction was this is such a really good idea.",
        "We can't believe it doesn't already exist in this country.",
        "We're in the century of science.",
        "How can we not have a gathering that celebrates science?",
        "I mean when you look at the film industry, there are like over a hundred film festivals throughout the United States every year, and not a single science festival.",
        "It kind of doesn't add up.",
        "It doesn't really make sense.",
        "So just about everybody we brought this idea to from the universities, to the cultural institutions, to the government.",
        "We went to New York City government's Dan Doctoroff.",
        "We told him about this idea, immediately said yes.",
        "This is something that has to happen, you know the state as well.",
        "So everybody really came behind it in a very strong way, and we're very happy about that.",
        "Huh.",
        "And what made you say you're willing to put aside your work in cosmology for a little while, to devote yourself to this.",
        "What makes it so important for you?",
        "Well, it is very important to me.",
        "I had no idea what I was getting myself into, which is probably a good thing when it comes to some projects, because it took a lot - much more time and more effort than I ever anticipated that it would.",
        "But I think, it's so critical to have a general public that is engaged with science."

        "So if you have a general public that isn't engaged with the science, then it can't really engage with the ideas, and make and form decisions.",

        "My - I'm very interested in theory, but my access is a little limited.",
        "First of all, did string theory come up at the festival?",
        "Ah.",

        "String theory is one approach to finding that unified theory, and there have been other approaches to put in together the big and the small gravity and quantum mechanics in the form of something called loop quantum gravity.",

        "So, the World Science Summit is a somewhat different character from the rest of the world-science-festival programming, in that it's not open to the general public.",
        "This was a closed door, invitation only gathering among some of the top scientists in the world, there are about 10 Nobel Laureates there, other leading scientists as well, together with leaders in business and government.",
        "In order to have a conversation in which science is really brought in at every level, to the ideas of how to make a decision about various policy issues.",

        "It was called Building a Better Brain, the issues surrounding how, for instance, brain-machine interface can really change the way in which we go about doing our everyday business.",

        "The first annual cup - first, I guess, every other year prize that has been set up in Norway, sort of Norway's answer to Sweden, which has the Noble Prizes.",
        "Well, tell me about the Kavli Prizes.",
        "So, the Kavli Prize, it comes from the vision of Fred Kavli, who has been enormously supportive to science in the last few years, setting wonderful institutes and a variety of universities, and the prizes are awarded in the fields of astrophysics, cosmology, and neuroscience, and in nanoscience, and each of the prizes is a million dollars, so it's a significant prize and the inaugural version of these prizes was announced at this World Science Summit on Wednesday.",
        "Huh.",
        "And in fact we have one of those prize winners with us joining us on the phone, Bruce is a winner of the 2008 Kavli Prize in nanoscience.",
