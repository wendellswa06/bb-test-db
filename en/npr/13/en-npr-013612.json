        "I think everyone knows that computers are more and more powerful, because the transistor is getting smaller every year, but at some point, that would change when the pieces of the transistor, the silicon itself, would begin to look and act more like a molecule rather than a semiconductor, just because the number of atoms is getting to be smaller and smaller.",
        "So the property of the material actually changes as it approaches some sort of atomic limits, is that what you're saying?",
        "Yes, that's right.",
        "So, it's basically -when it would behave more like a molecule, like a subject in chemistry, rather than a subject in physics.",
        "So, we tried to work out that transformation from chemistry to physics on the intellectual level, but also on a practical level, synthetic level actually, making these particles and using them as components for new materials, things of that sort.",
        "Yeah, so what can you do with them?",
        "Well, it's - the basis research is really unpredictable.",
        "And we were thinking all the time about transistor design, and you know, how to modify transistors, but the first application actually comes in biology.",
        "And these small particles emit light very well, just like semiconductor's an excellent emitter of light.",
        "We use light emitting diodes all the time.",
        "We have solid states, street lighting, that's just coming, you know, to be practical and so, these particles have now been used to image, to provide luminescent images for processes occurring inside the cell.",
        "I never thought of that, but people read the articles that we published, you know, and they made the connection.",
        "They had a problem to be solved and they understood that you know, this thing that we had discovered might be the solution and so that's now become an industry of - you know, to use widely in biological imaging.",
        "And tell us why your work was recognized.",
        "Well, there's a big effort right now to physical scientists of my sort to address the energy problem which is...",
        "I'm sorry, I need to interrupt you.",
        "We'll be right back after this short break."

        "Yes.",
        "One thing that's happening right now, is that people are trying to use quantum dots to design new types of solar cells.",
        "Electricity in this country is principally generated by the burning of coal, and that's quite cheap, but actually quite polluting to the atmosphere in terms of release of carbon dioxide.",
        "And a wonderful permanent solution that many people envisage on time scale of 50 years, is to replace this with solar electricity with solar cells.",
        "And we had solar cells now(ph) and they're made out of silicon, but they're actually quite expensive and that limits their use.",
        "And so there's a tremendous effort underway to find a way to make cheaper solar cells, that can be used everywhere.",
        "And the quantum dots may well turn out to be an integral part of this.",
        "And that research is going on right now in many laboratories, in many countries around the world.",
        "Huh.",
        "Well, that would certainly be a major accomplishment if you could make solar inexpensive and readily accessible."

        "Well, I think it was a recognition of an entire field of developmental neuroscience, and its relation to the way in which nerve cells form circuits that control behaviors in invertebrate organisms, and so, as you know the human brain contains many, many billions of nerve cells with thousands of different cell types, and in order to control any aspect of bodily function, these nerve cells have to wire themselves into networks or circuits that exhibit remarkable precision, and the precision of those circuits eventually ends up controlling the behavior.",
        "So we, as with many other people in the field, have been interested in how nerve cells become different, and how those differences, defined at a molecular level, enable those nerve cells or neurons to form selective circuits, and to understand the way in which the logic of circuit assembly and organization controls particular behavior.",
        "And what's the ultimate purpose of this?",
        "The ultimate purpose, I think, is to understand enough about the wiring of the nervous system not only to be able to explain normal aspects of behavior, but to understand pathologies of the nervous system, why some nerve cells degenerate in neurological disorders, why subtle differences in the wiring produce psychiatric diseases.",
        "And the only way forward in trying to approach those major issues is to understand the normal process with which one can then begin to tackle what has gone wrong in these disease states.",
        "Right.",
        "The other thing that people are always hopeful for is something that would approach the problem of spinal damage.",
        "Is that something you're thinking about as well?",
        "Yes, that's uppermost in our mind, in the sense that most of the studies we've done are focused on the spinal cord.",
        "And so the issue is, how after a motorcycle accident, when you severe the connections between the brain and the spinal cord, you can restore motor function.",
        "And over the last five to ten years, there have been really dramatic advances in understanding, not the process of regeneration, but the blocks to regeneration.",
        "So now scientists can begin in a systematic way to overcome those blocks and to gradually improve their prospects of recovery.",
        "That sounds like, obviously a much-desired goal, but it also sounds like it might be a ways off.",
        "It's a challenge.",
        "And so, even though over the last 10 to 20 years, there have really been profound advances in our understanding of the way the nervous system assembles and functions, we are still some way off from having a practical cure to the degenerative diseases or to spinal cord injury.",
        "But nevertheless, I think there's a sense of optimism in the field now that these are not impossible goals, and that with these systematic, rational approaches, within years, at most perhaps a decade or two, there will be rational solutions to some of these issues.",
        "I'd like to ask you what it was like to win a major new prize that no one had ever won before.",
        "How did you find out?",
        "How did you feel about it?",
        "The over-riding element I think was initially of surprise.",
        "We've found out, there was a phone call from the Norwegian Academy of Sciences at some anti-socially early hour on Wednesday morning.",
        "And things have been a bit of a blur since then.",
        "So, there's both surprise, delight, but also a sense that it's really an entire field or discipline of science that is being recognized, and because this is a new prize, I think perhaps it sets in some way, a precedent for the types of awards in neuroscience and nanoscience that Fred Kavli has been so visionary in trying to pursue."
