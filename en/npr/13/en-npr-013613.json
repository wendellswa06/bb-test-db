        "And Professor Brus, how about you?",
        "Do you have - what was your story about hearing about the prize?",
        "Well, it was 6:50 AM in the morning, and I was just getting out of bed when the phone call came, and it was quite a shock.",
        "You know, I had forgotten completely about the fact that this prize had existed, and all of Wednesday was a blur.",
        "And I learned for the first time what it is to stand in front of a live television camera, and to speak without a script or speak in any sort of a way.",
        "And you know, I would echo this point that I just represent the field.",
        "There are you know, many, many strong people that made independent contributions to this area of quantum dots and nanocrystals, and I sort of symbolize this field.",
        "But, I'm just one worker in the field.",
        "Mm.",
        "So, I guess - the prize is a million dollars.",

        "Yes.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Without a doubt.",
        "That's fantastic.",
        "And Dr. Jessell, a windfall like that must be something you think about a little bit before you decide what to do about it.",
        "But have you given it any thought at all?",
        "Given the events of the last couple of days, I can't really say that this has been upper most.",
        "And then again, I would just echo that I'm sharing this prize, and the added pleasure in this is that the two people I'm sharing it with, Sten Grillner from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, and Pasko Rakic from Yale, are colleagues who I've admired from many, many years.",
        "And although we haven't worked directly together, I think collectively, the types of problems we've been approaching have been similar in scope.",
        "So, it's a particular - it's a lot of fun to share this, or share the prospect of this with those two."

        "Well, it's at the heart of science.",
        "And one of the things that I always feel really disappointed about, is when I do encounter kids who think that science is simply the stuff that they learn in their class.",
        "The stuff that is in their textbook.",
        "Because we present the end product in the textbook.",

        "Science is the spectacular journey of discovery.",
        "This mysterious universe that we're trying to figure out, and it takes inspiration, it takes creativity, it takes familiarity with the underlying technical details, so that you can funnel that creativity through the right language for describing the universe.",

        "And I think it's a critical difference of people to understand, and I just wonder if you addressed that at these festivals.",
        "Yes, absolutely.",
        "It's a great point, and what we really try to do in a number of the programs is allow people to recognize how the technology that they are familiar with is actually based on fundamental science.",
        "So, there's a link there that can really get people excited about science because everybody has a cell phone or a personal computer.",
        "But how many people recognize that those devices work because of quantum physics?",
        "Quantum physics is what allows the integrated circuit to exist, and the integrated circuit is what allows the cell phone and the personal computer and all sorts of medical technology to exist.",
        "And when you say to someone, you have a quantum-mechanical device in your pocket, and when you push its buttons, you are manipulating the quantum-mechanical devices within it.",

        "People condemn science for it, which is just a quest for understanding the natural world, and asking those questions.",

        "So, I think, if the intent of the festival is to reach out not just to technicians and professionals in the field, but in fact people who have the important job of encouraging enthusiasm in science in the young, then it's really doing a marvelous job at achieving that.",
