        "Absolutely.",
        "Johnson was brilliant at leading legislations through the Congress, and he had such rich experience as a congressman and then Senate majority leader.",
        "And he understood what buttons had to be pushed in order to assure passage of major reform bills.",
        "Yet at the same time, if you rely in your experience to a degree that is overkill, that is you say, well, I know, I understand.",

        "Hillary Clinton, some would say, over the last two weeks, you could look at that as a character decision or you could say Hillary Clinton, over these two weeks, has shown enormous political resiliency - has been very crafty and has brought herself back into this race using what is a very long experience in politics.",

        "This has been studied across many fields.",
        "And 10 years is sort of a minimum time that you have to do something.",
        "After 10 years, however, there's very little correlation between expert performance and number of years that you've continued to do something beyond that mark.",
        "So what matters more is how much you practice in the kinds of deliberate practice you engaged in challenging yourself in new ways.",
        "So what's the downside of experience after 10 years?",

        "After 20 years, a regular driver who doesn't constantly challenge himself or practice driving techniques, which why would you, you've already gotten your license.",
        "Those people will check their mirrors less often.",

        "There's a group called the Institute of Advanced Motorists in Britain, and these are drivers who, you know, they're dedicated to their cars and to the practice of driving.",
        "And they were studied in comparison with regular drivers of 20 years experience.",
        "And they are much better.",

        "Yeah.",
