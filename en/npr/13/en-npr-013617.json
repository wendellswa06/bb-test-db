        "Yet the question would be, what do you learn, what kind of experience do you get as a vice president?",
        "Some would say that in many ways, that's less of an experience than the Senate and the House.",
        "Well, in fact, Robert, the vice presidency has not been a stepping-stone to the presidency.",
        "Okay.",
        "Maybe that's why.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "In the early 20th century Woodrow Wilson said there's nothing to say about the vice presidency.",
        "And after you said that, there's nothing more to say.",
        "It was pretty empty as an office, in which you learn terribly much.",
        "Presidents kept you at arm's length.",
        "You presided over the Senate, but John Adams said, it was the most insignificant office ever invented by the mind of man.",
        "Now, only in recent years has it become a much more significant office.",
        "And that has largely to do with the Cold War and the fact that presidents needed vice presidents to travel for them.",
        "And with presidential illness as you had with Dwight Eisenhower, you needed someone who is going to stand in and - so more recently vice presidents have become more important."

        "That is people make mistakes when they're too confident, too arrogant, when they don't really understand themselves.",
        "So it's not just knowledge of history or knowledge of the workings of government or even experience, but it also needs that next piece of self-awareness that gives you the capacity for wisdom.",
        "And I was struck by reading the autobiography of Mr. Obama that he had extraordinary experience of self-awareness, which will add a piece to his capacity for wisdom and therefore for judgment.",
        "Let's get our response for that from John Cloud.",
        "What do you think, John?",
        "Well, I will say that the notion of experience leading to overconfidence is it's not just about being overconfident.",
        "There's a notion called automaticity that happens when you're very practiced at doing something, you do it all almost automatically.",
        "In the case of this nurse, she walked in and she almost automatically instinctively looked up to see what medications were already on the line.",
        "The novice nurse did not do that.",
        "Obviously, you want someone who has those instinctive impulses to do the right thing.",
        "But they - because of the automaticity, something, you know, cognitively, you free up in your brain space to do other things like think about what you're going to have for dinner and maybe that's why you don't pick this chart up, so you know, it's really not...",

        "I mean, that, you know, it is not just the sheer number of years, and that's why Hillary Clinton is wrong about that.",
        "I must say, it must be painfully frustrating for her to think of herself having, you know, so much more experience than Barack Obama.",
        "And knowing that - thinking that voters aren't automatically with her on that, which is why she uses that word so often.",

        "Well, you have to understand that for a cleric that is a priest or a deacon in the Catholic Church to be dismissed from the clerical state or, in layman's terms, to be defrocked is, essentially, the death penalty.",
        "It is the most severe penalty that the church can impose.",

        "We should say that all of this comes on the eve of a keenly anticipated summit for presidents of bishops' conferences from all over the world and other senior church officials that will be opening in Rome on Thursday, precisely focused on those clerical sex abuse scandals and designed to sort of move the ball towards resolution.",
        "So, quite clearly, this is calculated by the pope and his Vatican team to sort of set the table for the discussion in that summit."
