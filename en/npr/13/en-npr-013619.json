        "On the other hand, saying but here is what my government's going to be.",
        "But I need to ask you about the context because so much of the violence has broken down on ethnic and tribal lines.",
        "Maybe the best way to ask you the question is if two months ago I were to ask you, is Kenya just keeping a lid on what could be simmering tribal violence?",
        "Would you say that it was?",
        "Well, I think that the violence that's occurred has taken a lot of people by surprise including many Kenyans.",
        "In some areas, it appears as if people were just very surprised by the results of the race and angry.",
        "And their burning and lootings sort of stemmed directly from that.",
        "In other areas, particularly in Western Kenya, it appears that there have been long simmering ethnic rivalries, ethnic resentments based on land issues that date back to, you know, Kenyan independence back in the early 60s, and that the election and results simply, you know, triggered some expression of those resentments and a very ugly expression of those resentments.",
        "And the last question I'll as you before we let you go, Gwen, to do more reporting for NPR, is today in the United States, Barack Obama, the presidential candidate, was supposed to have put in a call to the opposition leader urging him to stop the violence over there.",
        "Is that a known fact and what was the reaction?",
        "Well, you know, the news sort of came amid a whole flush of news, you know what I mean, you know, about the actual immediate issue at hand here.",
        "So, I mean, Mr. Obama's call was about five minutes long from my understanding.",
        "And in that call he urged Mr. Odinga, the challenger, to, you know, I mean, to go to the bargaining table without preconditions.",
        "Now that the situation seems to have deteriorated, I don't know if Mr. Obama is going to be back in touch with the challenger of Mr. Odinga.",
        "Although I have heard that Mr. Obama is trying to contact President Mwai Kibaki by telephone.",

        "Do you think the school wasn't touched because of luck, because of respect for the school, or because maybe it wasn't a clear symbol of one tribe or another?",

        "The people who work at the school are from all different ethnic communities, and the children who go to the school from all ethnic - different ethnic communities.",

        "The people fighting out on the streets wrecking havoc, looting, I would say, are 10,000 people or less, you know.",
        "So you have people who are neighbors from one ethnic community to the next who are actually not attacking each other.",
        "But there's a lot of young people who are unemployed and who feel their only say in Kenya is to vote and to have a chance in the democracy."
