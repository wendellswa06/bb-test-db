        "They've made claims that we know are lies, and when that happens time and time again, you get to the point where what they say doesn't really matter.",
        "OK, but don't all politicians lie?",
        "Not really, says Republican strategist Rick Tyler.",
        "This sounds sort of counterintuitive, but most politicians try not to lie because they fear they would get caught, and they couldn't suffer the burden of embarrassment.",
        "But credibility or the lack of it has never been a problem for Donald Trump.",
        "He's been using what he's called truthful hyperbole his whole life.",
        "It worked for him in business, in show business and as a candidate.",
        "But, says Tyler, being president is different.",
        "If the president gives his word to the American people or to legislatures or to a foreign power, everyone on every level has to know that he means what he says and he says what he means.",
        "Without credibility, Tyler says it will be harder for President Trump to sell his policies to voters, and as he visits foreign leaders in Europe and the Middle East next week, it could make it harder to get them to follow his lead.",
        "Or maybe it won't matter at all.",
        "John Feehery, another Republican strategist, says when Trump travels abroad, he will be received as any president of the United States would - as the most powerful man on the planet.",
        "And back home, says Feehery, Trump still has credibility with the people who count.",
        "I think the president still has a lot of credibility with the folks who brought him to the White House, the Trump voter, and the Republican base.",
        "Trump's overall approval ratings are at historic lows, but they're still strong with Republicans, voters, says Feehery, who are not fixated on what Trump said or didn't say about James Comey.",
        "Most Americans, you know - they don't want to see corruption from their political leaders.",
        "But you know, ultimately what they care most about is their own daily lives and what's happening to them.",

        "That may be true, but right now, Donald Trump and his credibility are caught up in a particular kind of Washington stuff, a criminal investigation by a special counsel where the president's word is going to be tested against the word of the man he fired for investigating his campaign's ties to Russia.",

        "Iowa has sent notice that the Republican nominee and the next president of the United States will not be chosen by the media.",
        "In a room full of hundreds of cheering supporters on the Iowa State Fairgrounds, Cruz repeated themes from his stump speech, taking on both the media and the Washington establishment.",
