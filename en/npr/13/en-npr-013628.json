        "But it was only at the beginning of the last century that an American president first ventured beyond the country's borders.",
        "It was a tradition that the president of the United States should stay home and govern the country during his term of office.",
        "And Theodore Roosevelt was the first person to break that tradition.",
        "That's historian and author Edmund Morris.",
        "The year was 1906 and Theodore Roosevelt, who Morris calls TR, made history when he traveled to Panama.",
        "Plagued by disease and construction mishaps, the Panama Canal project was floundering.",

        "Then after millions of dollars and man-hours were invested, progress was once again being made.",
        "The dirt was flying in TR's phrase, and he wanted to go down and see the dirt fly and work the steam shovels and have himself a good time and have himself a lot of press attention.",
        "Known for his rough rider frontier persona, Theodore Roosevelt embraced the caricature.",
        "Theodore Roosevelt was God's gift to the American press.",
        "His personality was outsized.",
        "Everything he did was flamboyant and funny and attention-getting and symbolic.",
        "Marching into the jungle, he stepped behind the controls of steam shovels digging through the soggy ground.",
        "Shutters snapped.",

        "This was itself an historic first.",
        "An actual bound book full of photographs of the Panama Canal and its construction and himself there.",

        "Obama is following the grand old tradition of leaving the country in order to attract headlines at a time when he was - when he himself is not doing very well at home.",
        "Whereas TR left the country at just about the height of his power and popularity in 1906.",
        "By going there and seeing the canal under construction, he was dramatizing to the world the fact that the United States was itself a world power and able to improve the commerce of the world.",
        "The president announced a multi-billion dollar assist to Africa to expand economic growth, investment and trade, parallel themes just over a century apart.",

        "Thanks for having me.",
        "Expectations are so high for this new national coalition, can it actually live up to them?",
        "For example, will more sophisticated weapons start flowing to rebel fighters now that their cause is represented by this broader group?",
        "Well, we definitely hope so.",
        "I mean, these are the promises that the international community has given repeatedly over and over again throughout the period that we've worked on this initiative.",

        "What is it that countries want to see from your group to proceed with arming the rebels more effectively?",
        "Well, it's all of the above, which puts us in a catch 22 situation.",
        "On one hand, they want us to create a highly functional, highly representative body that could, in a very dynamic way, represent the revolutionaries on the ground and make decisions on their behalf.",

        "Mr.",
        "Tabbara, let me see if I understand the dynamic that you and others there in Doha hope to see, which is that if you now gain political legitimacy, say, through the Egyptians recognizing the new group as the representative of the Syrian people and then new weapons being delivered to Syria under the auspices of this new group, would you then imagine that the groups that are fighting would say, well, these guys, the new national coalition must be the real deal because they've got the political legitimacy and the hardware to us.",
        "Therefore, we will now work with them and accept them as the sovereign authority?",

        "Is their continued participation in Syrian life welcome or is it time for a score settling against people who have supported the regime, even indirectly?",
