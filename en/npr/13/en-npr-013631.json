        "Last November, as Musharraf was imposing a state of emergency and lawyers were protesting in the streets, U.S.",
        "Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte told Congress the U.S.",
        "needs Pervez Musharraf.",
        "President Musharraf has been an indispensable ally in the global war on terrorism.",
        "Yesterday, after Musharraf resigned to avoid an impeachment process, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said he had the administration's deep gratitude for making, as she put it, the critical choice to join the fight against al-Qaida and the Taliban.",
        "But her spokesman, Robert Wood, suggested the U.S.",
        "is trying to move on.",
        "The war against extremism is bigger than any one person.",
        "What's important here is that we work with Pakistan to do what we can to root out these extremists and to prevent them from crossing the border into Afghanistan and carrying out attacks, and for attacking targets within Pakistan.",
        "I mean, this is a big fight, it's a long-term one, and it's much larger than any individual.",
        "Critics of the Bush administration's policy say that is a lesson that should have sunk in long ago.",
        "Teresita Schaffer of the Center for Strategic and International Studies says the U.S.",
        "did very little to promote its democracy agenda when it came to Pakistan and instead focused on President Bush's personal ties with Musharraf.",
        "I think they were making a mistake to personalize the relationship so heavily.",
        "The reality in Pakistan is that any government is going to want to keep a decent relationship with the United States if possible.",
        "But at the same time, the U.S.",
        "has made itself very controversial, partly because it stayed in visible support of Musharraf, even after the election had pretty much rejected him.",
        "Even in the war on terrorism, there were some questions about how much of an ally he really was to the U.S.",
        "Bob Grenier was the CIA station chief in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power in a coup, and he later ran the CIA's counterterrorism center here in the U.S.",
        "It's interesting, you know, how quickly we've turned nostalgic now in looking back over the Musharraf period because the constant refrain during most of that time was he isn't doing enough.",
        "Grenier, now managing director of the risk consulting firm Kroll, says Musharraf was a strong ally in fighting al-Qaida but was far more ambiguous in dealing with the resurgent Taliban, responsible for cross-border attacks in Afghanistan.",
        "He says the problem looking ahead is that the U.S.",
        "and the current Pakistani government have different priorities.",
        "They're concerned with homegrown extremists, and right now they are trying to reestablish the writ of their own government in fairly extensive areas of territory where essentially they have lost all control.",
        "So that's going to be priority number one for them."

        "It's a pleasure.",
        "The Iraqi Election Commission says that it can put together an election, print ballots, get them distributed, set up polling places and get that all done by late February, which is about a month after the election was originally set to take place.",
        "If the election goes well - that is to say, if there's not an Afghanistan-style political scandal or there's not violence associated with the election or the post-election period - that means that within 60 days, American troops could start withdrawing.",
        "General Ray Odierno, the top American commander in Iraq, told us a few weeks ago that he's comfortable with the idea of starting to withdraw his combat troops as late as May.",
        "If it went any later than that, it would pose significant headaches for getting people out of the country.",
        "Let me make sure I understand what you're talking about.",
        "The United States has a commitment to withdraw all its combat troops by when?",
        "By September.",
        "We're now looking at a number that's somewhere around 105,000, because there's been a certain amount of attrition, there's been a drawdown by simply not replacing people.",
        "After September, there will probably be as many as 50,000 troops who remain in a kind of advisory and training capacity.",
        "So we're looking at getting about 60,000 American troops out of the country in the period roughly from May through August.",
        "And that's a daunting task under any circumstances.",
        "But General Odierno thinks that that is a reasonable timeline.",
        "If the election were to go any later than that, then it would start to get pretty complicated.",
        "We're talking with NPR's Corey Flintoff, who is in Baghdad, where lawmakers have now approved a plan for national elections to be held early next year.",
        "And Corey, I'd like to know what delayed Iraqis as they debated the plan for this election over the last several weeks?",
        "Well, it's a bit like apportionment in the United States.",
        "The question was whether the various minorities in Iraq would get the apportionment that they felt they were entitled to.",
        "Tariq al-Hashimi, the vice president who is a Sunni Arab vetoed an original version of the law, because he felt that it didn't give adequate representation to Sunni Arabs.",
        "The Kurds in Iraq's north were also complaining that they didn't feel that they got enough seats.",
        "It sounds like this is another version of this classic debate we've heard about for years in Iraq, the division between Sunni Arabs, Shiite Arabs and Kurds.",
        "What is this decision to go forward with the election mean for those differences, if anything?",
        "Well, it seems to mean that people feel that they've gotten relatively fair numbers of seats in Parliament under this arrangement.",
        "The arrangement apportions these seats around the various provinces of Iraq, which are pretty divided along sectarian lines."

        "But we're seeing that the various political groupings are forming political alliances in advance of the election that are - that cross sectarian lines.",

        "Meaning that people are not purely dividing based on these three groups at the moment.",
        "Absolutely not.",
        "And the provincial elections that were held last January showed that non-sectarian secular candidates actually did fairly well.",
        "So it seems that they may not divide along the traditional lines, at least as much as they did in the 2005 election.",

        "E.J., the White House now projects the growth this year to be under two percent, nine percent unemployment next year.",
        "Have we reached a point where this is an acknowledgement of failure or defeat in trying to deal with the recession?",
        "I don't know about defeat yet, but if anyone doubted that we wasted the last eight months with our deficit obsession and if anyone doubted that the president needs to go very big next week in his jobs program, these numbers should solve it.",
        "Zero job growth, now that is not a headline President Obama wanted 14 months before the election.",
        "But more important, one American in six is either unemployed or underemployed.",
        "That's not a headline they wanted to see.",
        "I was really struck in today's jobs report, they noted that government employment continues to go down.",
        "Local government employment alone has lost 550,000 jobs since September of 2008.",
        "That's a lot of people who can't buy goods and services.",

        "The Republicans just think the stimulus didn't work and I doubt they're going to be very enthusiastic about anything more.",
        "One thing we've seen, though, from this month after month of this bad jobs numbers is this is not a quarter to quarter thing.",
        "This is a long term problem.",
        "We've got an economy with too much consumption, too little production, too much debt, too much financial manipulation, too much reliance on housing stock and so we should have - if the president's going to go big, he should go long term and have a plan that addresses some of the long term issues and not worry quarter to quarter.",
        "But talking about different narratives of unemployment, you wrote today in your column about Rick Perry, that his aim is to make government inconsequential in people's lives - that's his word, inconsequential - to pare back the state, to revive personal responsibility and initiative.",
        "Is that in effect saying, private sector unemployment is the problem, public sector unemployment's part of the solution, as far as he's concerned?",
        "David Shipley is the op-ed page editor of the New York Times.",
        "The page is 40 years old today, and the paper will have a special section about that on Sunday.",
        "We provide Pakistan with over a billion dollars a year to in a sense look the other way as we sort of selectively attack targets in Pakistani territory.",
        "Because the Pakistanis themselves admit that they don't have control over their own territory.",
        "So while they can never admit that they'd allow a foreign government to operate in Pakistan, in a sense they close their eyes and hold their ears when these kinds of attacks do take place.",
        "Cohen said the Bush administration's policy toward Pakistan was bankrupt and America's image there has suffered for it."

        "There are few places as valuable as that space opposite the editorial pages.",
        "So one of the things that's really worth celebrating this year is not just that the Times decided to open its pages to outside voices, but that it decided to put those voices in such a prominent spot."
