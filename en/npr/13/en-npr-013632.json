        "But not to belittle the first point: Before the op-ed page, when you read opinion, when you read acknowledged opinion in the New York Times, it was the editorials, or it was the New York Times columnists, period.",
        "Yes.",
        "And with the op-ed page, the paper invited all sorts of other voices into that.",
        "Yeah, which isn't surprising at the time.",
        "I mean, the page was the brainchild of John Oakes, who was the editorial page editor at the time, and Harrison Salisbury, who was the noted foreign correspondent.",
        "You know, late '60s, early '70s - tremendous, vibrant discussion in America and around the world.",
        "So it's not surprising that they thought, well, maybe we should open our pages to some of this debate.",
        "Okay, 40 years is a long time.",
        "What do you think were the Times op-ed pages' greatest hits?",
        "Oh, boy.",
        "You know, this past summer, my colleagues and I spent the summer pretty much putting together this special section that will come out on Sunday the 26th.",
        "Gem after gem after gem - some wildly insane stuff.",
        "There was an early dialogue that Harrison Salisbury ran, between a man who wrote in sort of bemoaning the effects of women's lib because he suddenly had to do a tremendous amount of housework - and then his son wrote two weeks later, saying that his dad was completely wrong and actually a lazy guy, and the piece was an utter fabrication.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "So there is stuff like that.",
        "At the same time, you have Ronald Reagan in 1970, writing about welfare.",
        "You have really, a remarkable piece by Jimmy Carter that was published two days after Nixon left office, that essentially presages his campaign because it was all about government openness."

        "So you have stuff like that throughout the years, leading up to Joe Wilson's essay about searching for uranium in Niger, that we published a couple of years ago.",
        "Which involved his wife, Valerie Plame, and led to her being outed as a CIA agent.",
        "Correct.",
        "As you said, what was very important about this page was its location in the paper.",
        "Nowadays, the Internet unpacks, un-makes-up - whatever the opposite of make up the paper is - the newspaper, and disassembles it.",
        "How does the page fare in an age when it isn't assembled in one place?",
        "That's such an excellent question because if you read the early years of op-ed, the page is incredibly loud.",
        "It is...",
        "Loud?",
        "Loud.",
        "There is parody.",
        "There is satire.",
        "There is full-throated argument in the way that you just wouldn't see today.",
        "And I think in some measure, you have that because the world was so much quieter then.",
        "Loudness really stood out.",
        "People often ask me, you know, why isn't the page louder today?",
        "And I feel in some way that what we can offer is a quieter space for considered discussion because lord knows, there's a tremendous amount of loudness out there right now.",
        "And the quiet space, combined with all being in one place, Robert, I think is one of the things that we can offer.",
        "What you're reminding - or what you're telling some young people for the first time is, in 1970, there was a perceived shortage of opinion in the media.",
        "Yes."

        "His narrative, which may take him to the White House, by the way, is that over the last several decades and maybe going back to 1900, government has grown.",
        "It's taken resources out of the wealth-creating parts of the economy into the non-wealth creating parts of the economy.",
        "I think there's some truth to that.",
        "But if you're gonna rebuild human capital, if you're gonna create a production-oriented economy, if you're going to repair the social fabric, you need to do more than get government out of the way.",
        "So I think his narrative is very partial, but it is a strong narrative, which may help him politically.",
        "I think it's a very weak narrative.",
        "The notion that spending on education doesn't grow the economy and isn't productive, helping people go to college, helping people retire so they can buy goods and services, helping people have health care, these are productive investments.",
        "And guess what?",
        "I think most Americans think they are consequential, not inconsequential.",
        "There is a radical individualism that Rick Perry is selling that I think is very different from traditional American individualism, which accepts that we want our personal freedoms, but we accept that there are things we do in common better or well or we have to do them in common.",
        "And so I think if Rick Perry wins the nomination, we are in for one of the great philosophical debates since 1964 when Barry Goldwater ran.",
        "I would just say that if this long stagnation widens the range of the political possible, people are going to be upset with tinkering, you could go left with big spending or go right, as Rick Perry is..."

        "I do agree, by the way, if unemployment is really bad, even Rick Perry can get elected president of the United States.",

        "What does Mitt Romney say about this?",
        "What's his answer to Rick Perry's narrative?",
        "Well, right now, it's a very bad answer, which is that he's been in government too long and you should go with the guy who's in the private sector.",
        "I think the smart, the very daring attack, as a colleague of E.J.'s, Bill Galston, wrote is to defend Social Security, defend the New Deal.",

        "If Mitt Romney said, hey, I'm for scaling back government, but I'm not for scaling back Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, that would be popular.",

        "That was outrageous.",
        "That's never happened before, that Speaker Boehner did that.",
        "It does seem that there may have been a - some kind of lack of consultation by the White House.",
