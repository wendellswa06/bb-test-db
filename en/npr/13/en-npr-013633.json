        "So our position is very clear on that matter.",
        "And we should just clarify.",

        "And we've watched American presidents or candidates who had a lot of experience not necessarily be great presidents.",
        "So I think to draw the absolute definitive judgment here that only that is the determining factor is a mistake.",

        "That's more than half the total cases you filed against the Trump administration.",
        "Why has this become the No. 1 issue for you?",
        "You mentioned concern about civilian casualties, and I'd like to ask you about that, because we heard from Defense Secretary Robert Gates saying today that this question about civilian casualties seems to be buying into Moammar Gadhafi's claims that there have been civilian casualties.",
        "He called those outright lies.",
        "Well, you know, we hope these are lies, but every time there is a military action, as I said, even if it's a legal military action and even if this action is conducted within the Security Council resolution, we tend always to express our concern about civilian casualties.",

        "But apart from sending that verbal message, would it be important for the legitimacy of this to have more of an Arab imprint?",
        "The issue is not having Arab military participation or not, it's a matter of decision that goes to each and every state alone.",
        "But the firm commitment of the Arab League and its members to support the main ideas of this resolution are, I think, extremely important, legitimate elements within this resolution.",
        "Would there be, Mr. Hitti, Arab League members who would be fearful that the tables could also be turned on them, in other words, that a Western military campaign could be in their backyard next?",
        "Well, there could be some feeling with some, but I think the Libyan situation is kind of unique because of how the Libyan regime has been acting in terms of the resort to all kinds of violent means against its own population."
