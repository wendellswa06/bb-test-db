        "Democrats, government watchdog groups and the Obama administration are worried that political front groups, those ambiguously named organizations like Americans for America, that they will explode in number and ad space.",
        "So, force companies to take responsibility for the ads they fund, says the proposed law.",
        "But the bill also exempts some groups, those that are longstanding, get less than 15 percent of their income from corporations and have more than 500,000 donors or dues-paying members.",
        "The rationale is that groups like this, say The Sierra Club, are not conduits for hidden spending by corporations anyway.",
        "But the exemption wasn't written for The Sierra Club.",
        "It was written for the National Rifle Association.",
        "Democrats knew they couldn't pass this bill if the NRA opposed it.",
        "So they secured an agreement: Exempt the NRA, and it wouldn't oppose or support the bill.",
        "But somewhat ironically, that led to the Republicans' main line of attack against the Disclose Act, that it slashes into the First Amendment freedom of speech, creating two separate classes of political speech.",
        "California Republican Dan Lungren spoke directly to the American people.",
        "This is your First Amendment.",
        "It's not my First Amendment.",

        "Some people are more equal than others.",
        "Lungren brought to the floor a list of dozens and dozens of political groups that oppose this legislation, some of which traditionally support Democrats, to which Maryland's Chris Van Hollen responded:",
        "It's no surprise that you have lots of organizations on the right and the left, love what they stand for or hate what they stand for, that are opposing this bill because they don't want voters to know who is funding their ads."

        "And that's why we've had success in our DACA litigation against the Trump administration because we had a strong legal case.",
        "It was your case that got the program reinstituted.",
        "That's correct.",
        "I know close to 200,000 of those DACA recipients have now actually reapplied and been able to do so because of that.",

        "What would you say to Americans who argue that these issues should be decided at the ballot box, not in the courtroom?",
        "I mean, there's an argument that a president who wins an election should be able to pursue his agenda without having his hands and feet tied with lawsuits.",
        "How do you respond to that?",
        "The courts will let you know if there's a political issue versus a legal issue.",
        "The reason we have victories is not because these are political issues that should be decided at a ballot box.",
        "It's because they raise real legal issues.",
        "And the courts are right to get involved.",
        "We should not have had a policy that said people could be provided education on a separate but equal basis because we knew that separate was not equal.",
        "Without the court stepping in to say that kind of politics doesn't have a place in a democracy, we'd have a far worse society.",

        "But, you know, this was unmistakably real life for millions of Nepali's who are desperate for a safe roof over their head.",
        "Many of these people, who have been too terrified to sleep in their own homes last night, congregated in a series of mini tent-cities around Kathmandu.",
        "And one of them was in the vast (unintelligible) field.",
        "And when the aftershock struck, I didn't feel it right away.",

        "And they were shouting \"\"it's coming.\"\" And they began running for their lives all over again.",
        "And, you know, just as it struck, I was talking to a woman who was literally erecting a poll over this colored material to fashion a tent.",
        "She said there wasn't a whole lot of damage at her house, but she wasn't taking any chances.",
        "I was thrown off balance by this thing.",
        "It was so powerful, and it made me think about a headline that I had read which was The Himalayas are Angry.",
        "So Julie, as best as you have been able to assess, what is the condition of Kathmandu?",
        "Well, you know, sporadically you can see scenes where building seem to have just crumbled to the ground in this earthquake which was the worst in 80 years.",
        "The central high school in Kathmandu, which was built in 1910, was severely damaged, as was the Army hospital.",
        "It sits across from this playing field with these huge bleachers.",
        "And that's where many of these people - in that neighborhood in central Kathmandu - exiled themselves.",
        "You know, one orthopedic specialist at the trauma center - Rachel, that's the only trauma center in the entire country - said it was just stretched beyond limits.",
        "It had just opened a few months ago, and it really wasn't ready to accommodate all of these people who need surgery - head wounds, amputations, internal injuries.",
        "There were lots of broken bones turning up.",
        "But this doctor, Dr. Dipendra Pandey, told me this shocking statistic - that 60 percent of the patients in the adjacent BIT Hospital, an old structure, chose to get up and check themselves out and go out into the open air across the field, rather than recuperate in a bed in fear of another attack.",
