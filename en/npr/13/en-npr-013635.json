        "I was reading about a concept car that VW came out with some years back that got 282 miles per gallon.",
        "And it did it in large part, I guess, by aerodynamic design and really shifting around materials - and also the look of the car, doing away, for example, with any outside mirrors because those create drag and reduce efficiency.",

        "When Chevrolet developed the Chevy Volt that's going to be coming late next year - what they call a range-extended electric vehicle, which means it's an electric car that has a gas engine on board.",
        "But when they did the concept car, it was very slab-sided, it was very creased, it was very angular and aggressive.",
        "When they put the concept car in the wind tunnel, they realized that they would've gotten better numbers from its aerodynamic efficiency if they put it in backwards.",
        "So they had to redo the entire shell.",
        "They did it so that it's much more slippery now, and they're realizing that that aerodynamic efficiency has a much bigger impact on the car's overall efficiency than the actual weight of the vehicle.",
        "If they're making cars that are lighter to try to meet these standards as well, make them more efficient, there are concerns, then, about safety.",
        "What about that, how do the carmakers balance safety standards with these fuel efficiency standards?",
        "Well, that's a really big challenge right now because the thing that Americans have always demanded is increasing safety standards.",
        "And as you increase those safety standards, you're adding more stuff to the car.",
        "You're either adding air bags, you're adding door beams, you're adding - what recently just passed was a stronger roof-crush standard.",
        "Now they have to make the roof stronger for a rollover protection.",
        "All of that adds weight to the car.",
        "And that weight goes against lightening the car and then making it more fuel efficient.",
        "So, that balance has to be struck.",
        "And there's ways you can do that, either through optimization of the actual materials or lightweight materials.",
        "But the lightweight materials are expensive, and those are going to come at a cost to the consumer.",
        "But do those prices eventually come down - I mean, as they're used more, and they become more accepted?"
