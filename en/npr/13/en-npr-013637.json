        "But I think this weekend, when there was a very weak admission from the Saudis about what happened and, as you noted, some questions about their claims about what happened, the effort has shifted from showing that it was a premeditated murder by a professional team who came to Istanbul to providing possibly in Erdogan's remarks tomorrow more evidence of a direct link of these operations to MBS himself, which then would put further pressure on Trump in terms of his response.",

        "I think Turkish prosecutors are likely to come forward with their case in the next couple of days.",
        "What was particularly interesting in Turkey was there was an initial assumption early last week that perhaps what Erdogan was looking for was a financial bailout from the Saudis given the financial crisis that we've had in Turkey.",
        "But that attitude really started to shift in the latter part of the week with an increasing sense that this was being targeted at weakening MBS himself.",

        "It was interesting what you wrote about Google, that their mission statement, to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful, which, you say, could be, you know, a lot of gas-baggery if it didn't seem that they were actually trying to do it.",
        "Well, because I didn't think, you know, at age 29, that I was necessarily ready for it.",
