        "What President Obama appears to be steering towards is middle ground - a troop increase, but perhaps not all 40,000, something more in the range of 10,000 or 20,000 new troops.",
        "As for the overall strategy, the Obama administration is apparently considering narrowing the mission in Afghanistan, focusing more tightly on al-Qaida and downgrading the emphasis on the Taliban.",
        "These two ideas work in tandem.",
        "If you redefine a mission and narrow it, then you need fewer troops and other resources to get the job done.",
        "Depending on where you sit this could look like smart politics or it could look like a compromise that tries too hard to please everyone.",
        "There are ways to do middle ground which make sense.",

        "Now, he says there's a danger to not going all in and giving military commanders the resources they say they need to win.",
        "Halfway measures, which may be politically more sellable, may only postpone the inevitable hard decisions and make them harder to do when you get there.",
        "That's a point echoed in General McChrystal's own assessment of the war.",
        "McChrystal writes that, quote, \"\"failure to provide adequate resources risks a longer conflict, greater casualties, higher overall costs and, ultimately, a critical loss of public support.\"\" Of course, if President Obama ends up redefining the mission to one that needs fewer resources, that may mitigate some of the military's concerns.",
        "And going with a low or mid-level option on troops now doesn't rule out adding more forces down the road, says Mark Moyar, a counterinsurgency expert at the Marine Corps University.",
        "But, Moyar says that's less than ideal from General McChrystal's point of view.",
        "The thing is it takes quite a while to actually get these people over there once they're approved.",
        "So, I think he does really see a sense of urgency to get it done now.",
        "There's also a sense of urgency about the announcement of a new strategy.",
        "Defense Secretary Robert Gates has said this will be among the most important decisions Mr. Obama will make as president, and he needs to take the time to get it right, which is well and good, says Bruce Riedel.",
        "There's a delicate line between rethinking and dithering.",
        "And that's the line that I think the president needs, above all, to avoid.",
        "Here's another way of looking at it: In his assessment of the war, General McChrystal said he saw a 12-month window, that after 12 months it might no longer be possible to defeat the insurgency.",
        "That report was dated August 30th.",
        "We're now inside 11 months and counting."
