        "I think that - you know I think that there a lot of lower pay guys who are, you know, for contracts who are taking - because in other words, you're getting it from somewhere, and this - the money that they're getting paid now is coming from last year.",

        "Well, yeah, but are the fans going to be there?",
        "Because I'm hearing that the NFL, NBA, major league baseball fans, they're worried that - the clubs are worried because people - season ticket holders who keep thing - whole thing going they may not be re-upping the way they've been in the past.",
        "And that's when you will see - you will see the effect of that next year.",

        "If it works for college basketball, why in the world can it not work for college football?",
        "You just hit - you just - the nerve - You know, I mean, I hate it.",
        "That's why I can't look at college football.",
        "We've had this conversation before.",
        "I can't look at college football because it's a farce.",
        "The way the NCAA Men's Basketball and Women's Basketball Tournament is conducted is the way it's supposed to be.",
        "At the end of April you - you know, when the - one team walks off for the National Championship, we'll all be satisfied that you know what, the best team won, you know.",
