        "Well, Professor Lewis, when you think about solutions, you've mention some very good ones for individuals, but what about the whole idea of diversity training?",
        "It's something that some people go to a company and they're kind of compelled to go through some kind of training, other people, it'll never come up.",
        "But what do you think of the whole idea of what diversity training is, and whether or not it's effective?",
        "Well, I think diversity training in its original context out of this multiculturalism movement, in which everyone comes in and explores their differences and agrees to be happy to be different, doesn't actually help us move that far along in the workplace.",
        "Instead, I like the models of people like Carmen Van Kerckhove with New Demographic, or Rashawn Ray with Engaged Diversity, where people start with discussing who they are and how those identities matter for privilege and power.",
        "If we're talking about differences at work, we have to really recognize that some people have more of an ability to be who they are openly, and other people have less.",
        "And how can we reshape the conversation not to just concentrate on difference, but differences in power, privilege and the potential to create a collaborative space.",
        "How would you rate your own experience?",
        "Meaning, you're a professor, and academia can be very politicized, but it's also a place where, you know, these discussions are not considered totally out of the blue.",
        "How would you rate the kind of conversations that go on in the context in which you operate?",
        "I think for many people, it'd be hard to believe that academia struggles with the same issues.",
        "It's a workplace environment.",
        "Just because people maybe professionals, it doesn't mean that they're necessarily use to dealing with these issues.",
        "So one of the first things I have to recognize as a young African-American male is that I'm often elected to be a role model, or serve on committees of diversity requirements.",
        "What is important for me is to make sure to hold back and not jump at every opportunity that's provided.",
        "Because in spaces that have historically not included people who or African-American, the institution can be very excited to have you present and wants you to do work.",
        "But those additional burdens of work can also prohibit me from doing my primary job of researching and educating students.",
        "So it sounds like there is - you know, the idea of the black man's burden as it translates to the workplace.",
        "Like, a lot of black folks who I know - and not just black folks, but people who have identities that are not the most common at their workplace - say, well, why should I do all the work of educating people?",
        "Right.",
        "And it's very important that we as individuals recognize that there are entire firms and groups who work on making sure that these issues can actually be discussed in productive manners.",
        "So my job is to educate people on race, but it's not my job to coach my colleagues on being anti-racist, anti-sexist or overly hetero-normative, or working against hetero-normativity.",
        "You have to create the space to make your contribution, but also knowing to step back.",
        "Because taking that burden too far will mean that you probably won't be successful as your own job, as you attempt to educate your colleagues.",
        "All right.",
        "Thank you so much.",
        "Thanks for having me.",

        "L'Heureux Lewis, assistant professor of sociology and black studied at the City College of New York, and he joined us from NPR studios in New York.",

        "The busiest ports in the country are right here in the backyard of our studio.",
        "The ports of Long Beach in Los Angeles see roughly 16 million containers every year carrying everything from toilet paper to pickup trucks.",
        "Somebody has to unload and coordinate all that cargo, and it's not always a man.",
        "I've got Clovijean Good sitting with me here in the studio.",
        "She's a member of Southern California's Local 94 of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union.",

        "So take me back to 1984, when you first became what's called a longshoreman casual.",
        "What does that mean?",
        "A longshore casual, that's part-time work in the industry.",
        "When they have a overflow of work, they have to hire part-time workers.",

        "My father was a young man who became a longshoreman in the early '60s.",
        "And as we all know back in the early '60s, African-Americans was not given the opportunities as other different nationalities.",
        "So he was one of the first men that had to take on that struggle and had to fight for his rights to be able to be a skilled longshoreman.",
