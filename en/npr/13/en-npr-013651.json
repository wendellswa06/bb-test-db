        "I think we're likely to make up ground by growing faster economically.",
        "And I would point to the last couple of quarters, where in anticipation of this tax cut and in reaction to the deregulation of the economy, we've seen 3 percent growth for two quarters in a row.",

        "You know, first of all, thank you for mentioning that, and thanks for the focus on that.",
        "In this particular case, I just don't think, you know, we're likely to have the impact that was suggested - that is, that we'll see growing inequality.",
        "Actually, you know, our experience is a rising tide, you know, really does raise all boats.",
        "And in this case, I think faster economic growth is good for every single American - More job opportunity, higher wages, a better chance to keep jobs in this country by equalizing the playing field, so to speak, between American companies and foreign companies.",
        "So at the end of the day, this will actually rebound to the advantage of the American people.",
        "Well, maybe in the aggregate, but what about specific?",
        "For example, I also want to note if you don't mind my mentioning that you have two graduate degrees.",
