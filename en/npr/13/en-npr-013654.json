        "So it's a real competitive race, and as things go along this way, we're not going to win it.",
        "Given the scenario of the budget being flat and actually suffering now because of inflation - as Bill mentioned - Mike, can you now drill down and let's talk about some specific research projects that might be in danger of being cancelled at these lower funding levels?",
        "Oh, sure.",
        "There's - what I'll do is to talk about the national facilities that the Department of Energy operates.",
        "These laboratories are open to researchers from around the world, from around the United States, and people who are in various government agencies - they carry out research in materials; they carry out research in biomedicine; it's right across the board.",
        "And there's an awful lot of basic science that is done, which doesn't have, necessarily, any immediate payoff.",
        "Last year, for example, the relativistic heavy ion collider - a big, big machine, a ring that is located at Brookhaven National Laboratory - was going to have to be mothballed at just the time that it was beginning to produce very, very dramatic scientific results, because they didn't have the money to operate it.",
        "A philanthropist stepped in and saved them last year, but if this current budget continues with a continue resolution, that machine will be turned off.",
        "Another large machine at Fermi National Laboratory - the Tevatron, which is exploring very basic physics - would also be turned off, at least for part of the year.",
        "Another facility that is just about to come on - which is in Tennessee, called the Spallation Neutron Source, in which we've just finished investing $1.4 billion, incidentally, a machine that was completed on time and on budget, just ready to go - and it would not be able to start.",
        "That would reduce its capacity and essentially extend the - we make a down payment on the construction of it, and then we can't use it.",
        "It's a foolish expenditure of money in that respect.",
        "That's at Oak Ridge?",
        "That's at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.",
        "Another example, we have a commitment to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor - it's an international project - we would not be able to participate in this thing to the full extent that we said we would.",
        "This is a fusion energy machine.",
        "And I could go on and on with major cuts in X- ray light sources, which industry and pharmaceutical companies rely very heavily on.",
        "These would all suffer major reductions.",
        "In the last analysis, the estimates are that several thousand scientists would lose their jobs."

        "Bill, many of these projects are funded by scientific agencies in the government, like the National Science Foundation.",

        "They are losing - they are, you know, because of inflation, they're experiencing these cuts.",
        "But in the case of NSF, they were slated for a $400 million increase in this current fiscal year.",
        "That's not going to materialize.",
        "And so, across the nation, all these universities, you know, excellent schools that were planning and bending over backwards to prepare themselves for these new NSF programs.",

        "Right.",
        "They are but their line is - and I think it's sincere - is that they inherited a nightmare - this budget.",
        "The last - the Republican- controlled Congress didn't do due diligence on this budget and they can't patch it together.",
        "They're so overwhelmed with the current business, with the any day now - a new budget that the president will present for '08 - and they say we don't have the manpower and the time to handle two budgets at once.",

        "This is not a partisan issue at all.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "That was one of the - I mean people - you know, scientists can cry wolf like anybody else, right?",
        "But what's unusual about this period right now is that there was a huge consensus, especially for the physical sciences, that things were out of whack and we needed to do some serious rebalancing.",
        "Everybody was on board and then nothing happened.",
        "And you talked to guys like the - the head of Brookhaven or the head of Fermilab in Illinois - and they're just shaking their heads.",
        "They just - they can't believe it.",
        "All right.",
        "We're going to take a short break, stop shaking our heads, come back, talk more with Bill Broad and Michael Lubell, take your questions.",
        "Talking about science budget cuts in this fiscal 2007 budget, which started last October in case you can't keep track of budgets and how they happen.",
