        "The best way to visualize, sort of, the large scale structure of the dark matter - see how it affects the universe as a whole - is by a technique called gravitational lensing.",

        "Yeah.",

        "That's why it doesn't shine.",
        "It didn't even reflect light.",
        "But it does interact through its - through gravity.",
        "And so, all the ways of seeing or inferring that there must be some dark matter, adding at the books, is from its gravitational effects on other things.",
        "Now, if it doesn't interact with the particles that we normally have around us, but it does interact with gravity.",
        "I had this thought - maybe, I'm totally off about it - could it be that the particles that carry gravity be in the dark matter realm - which we don't know what that stuff is yet, right, - instead of the normal matter realm.",
        "And perhaps, that's why we're finding it so hard to find particles that carry gravity?",
        "The two questions are sort of inextricably linked, in that dark matter was first postulated in say - in the 1933 by Fritz Zwicky.",
        "And he was doing his, adding up his books on these spiral galaxies, which were - which are spinning way too fast to be held together by the gravity of just the stars that they contained.",
        "He totaled the amount of mass in the stars - found these galaxies would fly apart if it weren't for the dark for - some additional dark matter.",
        "And so he postulated the idea that, well, yeah, okay.",
        "There must be some dark matter there that we can't see, but is sort of acting as a gravitational glue to hold these galaxies together.",
        "But equally, people have suggested that it's not the amount of matter or the amount of mass that's wrong in these galaxies.",
        "That's sure the laws of gravity that we've got wrong.",
        "And people have suggested various, different, alternative theories to Einstein's general relativity, which is the best theory of gravity that we have at the moment.",
        "Now, there'll be a lot of works too, because, I mean, Einstein was a very clever guy, and we got to make a lot of things match with these new predictions of what the gravity might be.",
        "And they're having a lot of difficulty with these latest results, particularly from the bullet cluster that it seems even when if gravity is wrong, then there is some - then, they need some dark matter there as well.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Described what we'll see when we'll look at the map that you've created.",
        "It's very interesting map.",
        "So yeah.",
        "The first thing that strikes me about looking at this map is actually that there are enormous voids.",
        "There are these vast regions of space in which there's absolutely nothing at all.",
        "But then, sort of, around these voids is a crisscrossing network of strings of dark matter, very long and relatively thin strings of this mysterious dark substance.",
        "And that forms a scaffolding, crucially, in which the ordinary that everything that we know and can touch and feel, in fact, everything that science sort of knows about basically.",
        "All these ordinary matter that falls into the dark matter scaffolding is later construct and built up into their, into galaxies and stars and planets that we find ourselves in today.",
        "Is it trapped by those strings?",
        "It's - well, yeah.",
        "And in fact, it's - they're both gravitationally attracted to each other, so over time, they just - and it fall together.",
        "And importantly, the dark matter has this sort of initial lead-time over the ordinary matter.",
        "It starts collapsing into these structures very early on in the universe, when everything else was just a fairly smooth soup.",
        "So the dark matter collapsed first, and then, sort of, by its own gravity, pulled in the ordinary matter, and helped concentrate into the kind of densities where begin to form stars."

        "So you can see clumps of dark matter wherever there are clumps of galaxies, for example?",

        "We have a very little idea what this substance is, even though it completely dominates the massive, or the budget of matter, in the universe.",
