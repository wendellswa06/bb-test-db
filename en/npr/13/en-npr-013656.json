        "It's now about the most exciting way of seeing it under - on very large scales, of tracing out this sort of filamentary distribution of matter on the very largest scales in the universe, that really given its overall evolution.",
        "It's not as useful as finding it nearest.",
        "And you know, there are other astronomical techniques for finding it nearest.",
        "For example, there's micro lensing in our own galaxy, and they can also look at the way that the stars are rotating very quickly around the black hole at the center of that galaxy.",
        "But there are ways to see things that are invisible, nearer to us.",
        "But then, of course, particle physics and particle accelerators have a very important role to play in actually getting, sort of, you know, some physical stuff in a laboratory.",
        "Does the dark matter tend to counteract the dark energy, the repulsive force?",
        "Yeah.",

        "And the mass of the dark matter is trying to put it all back together, just like the mass of the Earth pulls an apple back down to the Earth.",
        "The dark energy is an even more mysterious and, you know, another step on from that that.",
        "It acts as sort of some strange, anti-gravity (unintelligible), which is actually accelerating the expansion of the universe and making the whole thing happen faster.",
        "It's a giant, you know, tug-of-war.",
        "Earlier this hour, we were talking about science funding, and I think we should point out that your data for this map comes from the Hubble space telescope.",
        "And right now, looks like the latest news this week is that the Hubble is saved.",
