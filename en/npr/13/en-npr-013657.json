        "This is NEWS AND NOTES.",
        "I'm Farai Chideya.",
        "If you're just joining us, we've been talking economics with reporter Keith Reed.",
        "Keith welcome back and let's talk about basically how this all boils down for people on a individual level.",
        "You do a few different things, including blogging on BET finance page.",
        "You've got a blog called \"\"Dollar Out of Fifteen Cents\"\" and on Friday, you gave us your take on an article that compared how people are paying for their mortgages and their credit cards.",
        "What's the story?",
        "Well this was a story that was in Friday's USA Today that was written by Kathy Chu(ph).",
        "And essentially what the story says is that there's been a shift.",
        "The historical norm is that when you have people who are behind on bills, the first thing that they are going to pay for obviously is going to be what?",
        "If you - you're going to pay for your rent because you need a place to live.",
        "And what's happened is, and this is potentially a very, very bad sign for the economy and probably a sign of how desperate people are getting.",
        "A lot of people are now paying for their credit card bills faster than they are paying for their mortgage.",
        "So I'm 30 days late on both, which one do I pay?",
        "Well the credit card bill is cheaper and I need that credit card to be able to go out and buy food because I don't have the cash.",
        "I'm going to pay the credit card bill as opposed to the mortgage.",
        "Now what are the implications of that?",
        "Because I mean, people, we all make good and bad choices in this world.",
        "Is this a good or a bad choice for people who are doing that?",
        "I think anyway you look at it, it's a bad choice.",
        "I mean for somebody who is in that desperate situation, we all know desperate times lead to desperate measures.",
        "But if you step back and think about it, I mean, what happens is, if someone puts off paying for, paying for their mortgage, puts themselves at greater jeopardy for going into foreclosure, well what is it that brought us to this point that we're at in the economy?",
        "It is foreclosures, it's housing.",
        "To have the risk of even more people being out there in foreclosure, in default on heir mortgages because they've chosen to pay another, smaller bill, because they don't have the cash to be able to stay in that house, that potentially keeps the housing downturn and the overall economic downturn going on longer than it needs to.",
        "So it's a very, very bad sign.",
        "When people start using what should be their backup plan as their first line of defense, what happens once they run out of that credit?",
        "I mean what happens when you reach the end of the road, particularly from the standpoint that bankruptcy law has changed over the past few years.",
        "If you're someone who has kind of played things out as long as you can and you've maxed out all your cards, you can't get any additional credit, what's the next step?",
        "You know, I think you just hit on what the real problem is here, is that eventually that credit does run out.",
        "And so many people have been using credit.",
        "I think this is really emblematic of some of the things that we saw - the housing market, again, being the thing that started this big problem.",
        "But if you step back from it, it wasn't just the housing market, it was credit.",
        "People were getting mortgages that were actually bigger than the actual value of the house.",
        "If you went out and bought a house that was $130,000.",
        "You took out $170,000 loan.",
        "So you got a little bit cash on top of that.",
        "And people were spending that cash and that kept the economy going.",
        "Well, now it's all coming through.",
        "You can't borrow any more on the house.",
        "You can't refinance the house any more.",
        "So what do you do?",
        "You turn to your credit card and rates on cards have been coming down because of some of the action that the Fed has been taking.",
        "So the credit is still plentiful and so what do you do?",
        "You don't have the cash.",
        "You go out and max out the card.",
        "Now you are in a very tough situation because A, you can't borrow anymore, because you're maxed out on your credit card and your mortgage is in default.",
        "Well what happens?",
        "Then you start to see that cold(ph) that the housing market had moving to other sectors of the economy.",
        "And if you looked at what happened - we talked earlier about what's going on, on Wall Street, look at what's happened.",
        "It's moved from housing stocks, from manufacturing stocks, into the financial services sector.",
        "That really, really scares investors because these companies that issue credit cards are now having the same problems collecting on those bills that the mortgage lenders were having.",
        "So as you look at these findings, it is a challenge to the system, because some people say if you start providing compensation of any sort, you're going to undermine the system of altruism that we have now."

        "So, there are a lot of different things that you hear over time about how to carry yourself in the world financially.",
        "One of them is have an emergency pot of money that can get you through you know, I've heard three months, three months of expenses, some people say six months.",
        "Other is, pay off all your credit card bills.",
        "So if you're in a position where you're really, you've spun out the rope in terms of overextending yourself with credit and you get a little extra money.",
        "Should you save it for an emergency fund or should you pay off your bills if you can only do one?",
        "If you can only do one, I think the way you have to go is, you've got to start to put a little bit away for that rainy day because you still have to, you still have to be able to live.",
        "The unfortunate thing again is that that puts your credit at risk.",

        "You still have to have a place to live.",
        "So if you're in that absolute, positive, dire situation, then I think you err on the side of taking care of yourself so that you're in a position to go out and get another job, to work another, to have the lights on for another day and be able to bring in some more income to start to take care of those bills.",
        "But the big thing is, live within your means.",
        "If you're not in a position where you've over extended yourself, don't get in that position.",

        "What about the upside?",
        "At times of trouble, there are always people who make money because they either find a service for the people who are in trouble or a way to buy things at a cut rate like homes that have gone through foreclosure.",
        "Who is in a position to make money during this very difficult time?",

        "If you are renting a place and you've got some money saved up and you've got enough to make a down payment, interest rates are lower than they've been in probably the last three or four years.",
        "Right now if you can go out - and there are houses, I went to look at a home here in Cincinnati, that unfortunately it's a short sale, meaning that the person is selling the place for less than it's worth.",
        "But it would be a great deal for me or anybody who decide they want to buy the place, because it's you know, that asset is sitting out there and they have to take some money for it, otherwise they are going to end up in foreclosure.",
        "The bank wants out and the borrower wants out.",
        "So if you're renting and you've got some cash to put down a down payment, your credit's good, it's a really good time for you.",
