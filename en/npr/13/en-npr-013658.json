        "It's only fair that I should get a portion of the proceeds.",
        "While I feel very comfortable with this disposition after death, giving organs and tissue while alive does not add value in making my life better.",
        "Some financial consideration would give me incentive to go through the inconvenience and possible risks.",
        "Very fair points.",
        "And I think when I talked to Dr. Youngner from Case Western for the post and the reporting that I did around this, he mentioned just this issue, that, you know, the person who's giving the organ doesn't get a real benefit.",
        "But up and down the chain through the health care system, the doctors are paid, the hospital is paid, and clearly the recipient gets a major benefit.",
        "Would it be so wrong?",
        "Is it wrong to exclude entirely any form of benefit to the person who's going to make this sacrifice?",
        "Tangible benefit.",

        "So let's not ruin that.",
        "But what about this other piece?",
        "We're talking with Scott Hensley, the host of Shots, NPR's health blog.",
        "And joining us now from member station WCPN in Cleveland is Dr. Stuart Youngner, professor of bioethics, psychiatry and cognitive science at Case Western Reserve University, also chair of the Department of Bioethics at the school of medicine there.",
        "Good of you to be with us today.",
        "It's good to be here.",
        "And I read in Scott Hensley's blog that - in his post that, over the course of the years, the continued and indeed growing shortage has forced you to reconsider some of these issues.",
        "Well, I'm not sure it's the shortage that's forced me to reconsider it, because I think there are still some things we wouldn't do to eliminate the shortage.",
        "But I teach bioethics, and many of my students have written papers about this issue.",
        "It's one that seems very interesting to them.",
        "And I've noticed that a majority of them are in favor of some form of regulated market in organs.",
        "And I traditionally haven't been in favor of that, but their arguments seem very convincing to me.",
        "And not that we're necessarily ready to do it, because as you indicated, this is a very delicate balance, and you could tip things so that you actually turned off altruistic donation.",
        "So it's one of these things that would have to be an experiment, and perhaps a perilous one."

        "But that's a utilitarian argument - you know, in other words, will it work to get more organs.",
        "Another question is: Even if it did - for instance, would we say, well, we could get more organs if we went to another people - another country and killed people to get them, that would work.",
        "But that would be unacceptable.",
        "Many people feel that paying for organs is unacceptable in almost the same way, that it is some kind of a fundamental violation of human dignity, a profanation of the body, that it cheapens human life in some way to attach a monetary value to a human body part.",
        "And that argument has been, I think, very, very powerful over the years, but isn't as powerful - at least in my observation - to the young people.",
        "And I think that the survey that you've conducted supports that notion, too, that it's somehow a more acceptable thing for young people.",
        "Yes.",
        "And I think in the interview that you gave to Scott Hensley, you said those are all valid concerns.",
        "So are concerns about people's lives that are being lost from the shortage of organs.",

        "Exactly.",
        "And I think that what happens in societies, and culture in general, is that as time goes by and society evolves and there new needs and new relationships, that we reconsider our moral categories.",
        "A great example of that - it's a parallel example, not the same issue, of course - is gay marriage, where the attitudes are changing, and they're changing fastest among young people because they're experiencing a society where people are out of the closet, where they see that there aren't - don't seem to be terrible harms to being gay or to being in a gay relationship.",
        "We don't have a similar experience with selling organs, but we do have an experience with selling blood or blood products.",
        "And as you indicated, the market is the metaphor in the United States these days, for so many things.",
        "And in organ transplantation specifically, there are lots of people making money.",
        "And there are lots of people - which isn't bad.",
        "I think if they stop making money, the organ transplantation enterprise would come to an end.",
        "We're motivated by making money.",
        "That's something that we've accepted as an integral part of our economic and political system.",
        "But why are the families excluded from that, or the donors themselves from living donation?",
        "Why are they excluded?",
        "And interesting, Scott Hensley, you did ask the people you questioned, the 3,000 you questioned in the survey about their age and income and other factors, and there was a variant in terms of - by age.",
        "Right, support for compensation declined as people - among older people, particularly among the group that was 65 and up.",
        "And with education, there was generally more support for it - a higher education, more support."

        "But I'm in strong favor of being able to pay donors, I don't think directly from the recipient, but just like plasma kind of goes through an in-between, the hospital, and it should be picked up by the insurance.",
        "Medicare, for example, which covers most end-stage renal disease, they'll pay for dialysis, which is roughly $70,000 a year, give or take, a transplant's going to call them $110,000, $130,000, something like that.",

        "And one of the things you asked in the survey, Scott Hensley, was who ought to pay for this.",
        "That's right, and Doug's got company here because almost three-quarters of the people who were in favor of some form of compensation thought that it should come from the insurance companies.",
        "And then the lowest proportion thought that it should come from the organ recipients.",
        "That was less than 40 percent.",
        "So the strong majority was in favor of some sort of insurance payment, and the least support was for the organ recipients themselves making some kind of compensation.",
        "(Soundbite of \"\"Love Underground\"\")",
        "Right, and I think there are very, very few people who advocate just an open, raw market to deal with this, where, let's say, donors could make patients bid for their organs.",
        "Regulated markets are a much more attractive alternative, where you have a fixed fee that people are going to get or payment that they're going to get, and that it's provided by a third party, which is either the government or an insurance company.",
        "And, of course, with kidneys, Medicare does pay for organ transplant and dialysis, and people have done analyses that show over the long run, paying some amount of money, and I can't remember exactly how much it is, would actually be a cost savings for Medicare or whoever the payer is, if they're also willing to pay for dialysis.",
        "The other question, you know, if you're talking about markets, is what does it take to get people to sell them.",
        "How much do you have to pay?",
        "And we really don't know that.",
        "It - there have been states that have given financial incentives, which are defined differently than payments, so they're - it's more, let's say, a token of appreciation, paying travel costs, paying for funeral expenses, and they don't - there are a couple states that have done that.",
        "It doesn't seem to have made much of a difference.",

        "Would it be $2,000?",
        "Would it be $20,000?",

        "So let's say you started with $10,000 in a controlled market, and it didn't do much, then maybe you'd feel you have to go up, and at some point it wouldn't be cost effective.",
        "The other thing I want to point out, I reviewed some statistics on the UNOS website this morning before I came in.",
        "And the rate of organ donation without incentives has actually dropped two percent since 2005.",
        "The waiting list has increased 23 percent during that period.",
        "So we are in kind of a pickle.",
        "And lots of things have been tried in the last six years, say, since the period I'm talking about.",
        "The organ procurement organizations have tried lots of best practices and ways of getting people to, you know, to be more likely to donate.",
        "We have new forms of getting organs after cardiac death rather than just from brain death, which has been the traditional source.",
        "And we're taking organs that are sometimes referred to as marginal, from older people or people who aren't as healthy, that we didn't used to do before.",
        "So we're kind of desperate.",
        "But despite those things, the rate of donation has not gone up, and I think that's worrisome.",
        "And there is a worry that if you started saying OK, we're going to pay for them, maybe that would backfire.",
        "I think there's - I think there's good evidence that we've - you know, giving organs and organ transplantation is a relatively new thing, and it changed - it hadn't been dealt with before."
