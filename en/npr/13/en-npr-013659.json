        "Will it become a situation where those who can pay get a transplant, where those from poor backgrounds are left to die?",

        "You know, it made it much, much easier.",
        "And so, you know, obviously, you know, finding an altruistic motivation is really important, but I happen to be between jobs, and all my expenses were covered for the marrow donation.",
        "But there are hidden expenses.",
        "You know, like if I've been employed, I might have missed some, you know, some hours at work.",
