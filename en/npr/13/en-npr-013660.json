        "David, always nice to have you on the program.",
        "Hi, Neal.",
        "Do we know how many people are actually being monitored by the NSA or who they are?",
        "No, not really.",
        "We've seen figures of hundreds, maybe a thousand.",
        "I think what little we know is that the president described it in his Saturday radio address as persons with clear links or known links to al-Qaeda.",
        "Now that doesn't sound like tens of thousands of people, and when the president describes it that way, it sounds rather reasonable to me, at least going that far.",
        "That is, suppose you had a phone or a computer of somebody who was an al-Qaeda operative in Afghanistan, and there were 20 phone numbers in that computer or in that phone.",
        "It would sound sort of reasonable to say, `Hey, if those people are in the US, let's keep an eye on them.",
        "Let's eavesdrop on their communications back and forth to Afghanistan.",
        "And so if that's what it is, it sounds like at least it's in the ballpark of what you might consider a reasonable search.",
        "Yet if you found those numbers in a suspect computer, surely you could go to the FISA court, the Foreign Intelligence Security Act court, which is secret, which is--as somebody said, has received something like 19,000 requests over the past many years and rejected five--and see if you could get a court order to do that.",
        "I think so, Neal.",
        "I think that's the way most people would think of it is: Why not go to this secret court inside the Justice Department?",
        "The answer may lie on the meaning of that phrase `clear links' or `known links,' because FISA sort of says, `You have to have some good evidence, probable cause that this person is an--part of al-Qaeda, it says international terrorist organization.",
        "Some lawyer said to me over the weekend that this may turn on just that, that is that they had scores of phone numbers, but they could have been a pizza parlor in Detroit.",
        "They didn't know who was on the other end of that phone.",
        "They didn't know.",
        "They couldn't go to the FISA court and say--I'm making this us, 'cause I think this may be the problem--that they weren't able to go to the FISA court and say, `We have evidence, probable cause that this person is affiliated with al-Qaeda.",
        "All we have is this list of phone numbers.",
        "And so they wanted to track and eavesdrop on all those phone numbers to see if they could pick up anything.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Now the president says that he has legal authority derived from the Constitution to do this.",
        "I think legal scholars are in some dispute.",
        "Yes.",
        "I think when you get to the legal side of this, the president's argument gets a whole lot weaker.",
        "As you said, he said today and he said on Saturday that, `I have the authority under the Constitution to do it as commander in chief.",
        "That's not a strict constructionist reading of the Constitution.",
        "The Constitution says, `Congress shall write the laws, the president shall faithfully execute the laws.",
        "There's no proviso that says the president can ignore the laws, can go on his own and do what he wants.",
        "There is a phrase that says, `In times of war, the president, as the commander in chief of the armed forces'--but even though many presidents have asserted it, there's no constitutional provision that says, hey, the president can just basically ignore the laws and do what he thinks is necessary and good to protect the nation's security.",
        "The president cited another source, though, and that was the law passed by Congress after the attacks of 9/11 in which they authorized the president to go ahead and use any force he saw necessary to attack the problem of terrorism.",
        "Yes, and that's a better argument because it's a little more constrained, and it says, `use all necessary force to pursue, to arrest all those persons who planned and plotted or harbored the people who planned and plotted the 9/11 attacks.",
        "So you could--the president's lawyers could say, `We thought there were people in the United States who had harbored or helped plan those attacks and that's what we're going after.'"

        "I think the weakness of that argument, though, is that you'd have to assume that Congress, without knowing it, had basically repealed all the limits in FISA and that the president and his lawyers didn't get around to telling them, `Hey, by the way, Congress, we want you to know that we interpret what you've just passed as repealing all the limits in FISA.",
        "And that's sort of a strange way to make the laws.",
        "The Congress makes the law and they debate the Patriot Act, but there's this secret provision that says, `We actually can ignore parts of those laws.'",
        "And just for clarification, the FISA Act, as I read it anyway, says there are ways to tap somebody's phone without really telling them anything, to do it in secret, and these are the ways, and these are the only ways you can do it.",
        "...paid propaganda in Iraq.",
        "Yes, there's several provisions in the law that said, `If you're going to conduct electronic surveillance, it has to be done under this statute, and you have to come to the court and get a warrant, or go to another court and get a criminal warrant,' but that's basically it.",
        "You have to go to the FISA court or to a criminal court and get a warrant, and that's the only way you can tap a phone.",

        "Yes.",
        "I have a question.",
        "What difference does it make if--I guess my question is when they--are they using any of this information to prosecute people or is this general information to find suspected terrorists?",
        "It seems to me that, you know, it would be tossed out in court if it came down to prosecution, so using this as a general information tool is not necessarily a bad idea.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "David Savage, the president was asked about any specific cases he could point to today where this information did stop a bomb.",
        "He said he couldn't discuss that; that would give away too much information to those who are enemies.",
        "Yes, that's right, and I think Mark's point is correct, too, which is that the notion of FISA is that you get this foreign intelligence information as a matter of--you know, the old notion was tracking Soviet spies.",
        "You know, we didn't want the government wiretapping people in the United States.",
        "On the other hand, if they were Soviet spies living in Washington, you'd want the government to track them.",
        "So the notion was the FISA information did not go into criminal prosecutions because it was not done under the Fourth Amendment, but it could be useful information for, as the president said, detecting, preventing, exposing--if there were these so-called sleeper cells in the United States, the government would certainly want to know that.",
        "And the remedy for spies was mostly expulsion, persona non grata, sent home.",
        "That's right.",
        "It was not a criminal prosecution in the United States.",
        "It was to get that information because the information was necessary to protect the national security."

        "Yes, absolutely right, and that's how this difficulty came up.",
        "You know, the Fourth Amendment has this provision that said, `No unreasonable searches.",
        "The government needs a warrant based on probable cause if they're going to wiretap you.",
        "And then the--and then--but the presidents in the '60s and '70s always maintained, `Well, I have this special authority to protect the national security'--again, my Soviet spy example--and then we knew that that authority was abused.",
        "They were tapping Martin Luther King's phone.",
        "They were tapping the phones of Vietnam protesters.",

        "I do.",
        "We have to keep in mind that what al-Qaeda is trying to get nuclear devices, biological weapons that could wipe out millions of people and totally wipe out major cities, and in order to get the information to stop one of these plots, we need to move so quickly that the FISA Act simply does not do the trick, even under the emergency provisions of the FISA Act.",

        "Now obviously we don't know how the Supreme Court would rule on this, but it clearly--every legal authority in town has already weighed in on this and not raised any objection, including the FISA court, including Justice Department, including the NSA's inspector general, something that the media didn't--hasn't picked up on very much.",
