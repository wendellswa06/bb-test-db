        "Yes, I'm not sure I understand the argument, why that there couldn't be some sort of independent check on this.",
        "As Ron was discussing this, I think most people would think it's reasonable for the intelligence agency to keep track of people with any links to al-Qaeda.",
        "But I don't understand why, if you were to get a phone number on Saturday afternoon and you have reason to believe it's a call coming from Afghanistan to San Diego to somebody who's in the United States or the other way around, and the NSA says, `We need to listen to this because this is a call going to an al-Qaeda person we know in Afghanistan,' why couldn't you have a system where you'd go back to the FISA court on Monday and say, `We listened to the call, this was the reason, this was the justification,' and then have--the whole notion of the Fourth Amendment and FISA is to have an independent, neutral magistrate look at the evidence, look at the rules and presumably say, `Yes, that was a justified interception.",
        "And that's all it requires.",
        "Nothing more than that.",
        "I think that's a good point, and I think the reasons is that the Bush administration saw what happened with the Patriot Act, which provides, in my opinion, you know, very mild changes, and yet that's become a huge political football, and so they simply didn't want to take a chance that, you know, going to Congress on this issue would impede their ability to stop the next attack.",
        "This was four years ago that this first went through, Ron Kessler, and obviously the president's political standing four years ago was considerably higher than it is today when the Patriot Act is being so...",
        "Yes, we don't know anything other than the few lines the president has said, and your caller is quite right.",
        "There's a large element of what he said that basically just says, `Trust us.",
        "I'm trying to protect the national security.",
        "But certainly there's no written guidelines for this program that I'm aware of or no public discussion about how many people were--how many calls were tapped or anything like that.",
        "It is--he's quite right to say, as one of your earlier callers said, we may know a lot about this program five years from now.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Aziz Huq, so without knowing that information, we clearly don't know beyond, `Trust me.'",
        "Yeah.",
        "Look at, you know, what the Patriot Act does and look at what's happened to it.",
        "The Patriot Act simply says if a judge of the FISA court authorizes an intercept of a terrorist's conversations, then that should apply to any phone that that guy is using, whether it's a cell phone or a disposable cell phone or a fax or a pay phone, which is, of course, what they do.",
        "They don't just sit at home on their own residence phone, and yet there was opposition to that.",
        "Obviously by the time you get a new FISA warrant for a new phone, which may not even know the number for, the guy is gone.",
        "So that's one major improvement in the Patriot Act, and yet that has been objected to.",
        "And the other one was simply sharing information between the criminal side and the intelligence side of the FBI and the rest of the...",
        "But to be fair, Ron Kessler, there's a lot of other things in the Patriot Act that people object to, including the so-called library provision and the increasing use of national security letters...",
        "Well ...(unintelligible).",
        "...and there are reasons that people are raising questions in the Senate.",
        "But I submit to you that it's based on a lot of hocus-pocus.",
        "The library provision actually has never been used, despite all this controversy, and keep in mind that the 9/11 hijackers were using computers in libraries to avoid detection, and all the FBI wants to do is to be able to intercept those e-mails if they use computers in libraries.",
        "They don't want to read, you know--they don't want to find out what people are reading.",
        "They don't want to see if you're reading classics or mysteries or whatever.",
        "They're trying to stop the next attack.",
        "And again, no abuse has been found, and yet that's been a huge rallying cry, especially among librarians who seem to think that, you know, the FBI has nothing better to do than to snoop on people's reading habits."

        "How do those relate to this debate?",
        "That's right, Neal.",
        "The Church Committee was a Senate committee in 1975 to 1976 that looked at the gamut of intelligence agencies--the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, which is the agency that we've been talking about today--and tracked the kind of activities that they'd been engaged in during the gamut of the Cold War.",
        "Now what they found with regard to the NSA was that that NSA had been engaged in domestic spying.",
        "It had been looking at communications of American citizens far beyond their core mission of intelligence activities.",
        "They'd been looking at the activities of anti-war protesters.",
        "They'd been looking at journalists.",
        "They'd been looking at peace activists engaged in domestic activities protected by the First Amendment.",
        "They'd also been collaborating with other law enforcement agencies--for example, narcotics agencies--in putting into play the electronic surveillance that the NSA has in criminal investigations where it wouldn't ordinarily or constitutionally be available."

        "And there are obviously echoes in this, but clearly this is a much more limited program, or at least on the basis of what we know now, what President Bush has been talking about over the past few days, a much more limited program than what the Church Committee was looking into.",
        "Well, I think it's a little early to say how limited or expansive the present NSA program is.",
        "And bear in mind that the Church Committee investigation was triggered by newspaper reports, again in The New York Times, of a relatively limited set of some would say overreaches.",
        "And that was a story by Seymour Hersh in 1973.",
        "So I think the only way we will know how limited or expansive what the NSA has been doing, what an agency called CIFA, which is part of the Defense Department--Walter Pincus at The Washington Post has been reporting on.",
        "We're only gonna know how expansive or limited these programs are if Congress engages in the sort of serious oversight that we haven't really seen in the last few years.",

        "Hi.",
        "Hello there.",
        "Hi.",
        "I'm very concerned about this, because it seems to me that we've got a president who's using the circular logic of saying that, `I'm going to protect you, and in order to protect you, I need some extra powers, and I'm going to exercise these extra powers in a way that might appear to be in conflict with the Constitution, but it's so important that I exercise these that you don't need to know, and there should be no oversight over what I'm doing.",
        "And it--as your caller--as your guest was saying, we don't know the extent of it because we can't access the information.",
        "And my question is--or my concern is really how far can this go?",
        "If we can use this kind of circular reasoning to justify wiretapping certain kinds of phone calls of our citizenry, how--you know, what else can we do?",
        "What other constitutional safeguards can be circumvented simply by saying essentially, `Trust us, we know better than you?'",
        "Well, two questions.",
        "I'm gonna ask Aziz Huq about that broader point but, David Savage, the president said intercepting calls or e-mails by people with known links to al-Qaeda or their associates, but do we know--again, we don't know who they are, we don't know how many there are.",
        "We don't know beyond that if anybody has looked into those names and said, `Well, yes, I agree that this person is probably linked to al-Qaeda.'",
        "Can I make one more point?",
        "I think that's right.",
        "And I think that if one goes back to the Constitution, which the caller I think rightly identifies as, at the end of the day, the governing framework for national intelligence policy, the people who drafted the Constitution could well have put into that document a provision that allowed the president or his subordinates to act in this relatively unconstrained fashion if confronted with an emergency.",
        "And they had a theory of that kind in John Locke's theory of the prerogative power, they were aware of that, and they chose not to do that.",
        "And they chose not to do that very deliberately.",
        "So the Constitution doesn't contain this sort of escape hatch that the president is invoking for the very good reason that your caller pointed out, that there isn't a limit to such an escape hatch.",
        "There's not a line that you can draw in the constitutional sand that distinguishes the rights that we can trade away from the rights that we can't."
