        "The Shiite alliance that dominates the current government has won nearly 60 percent of the votes in Baghdad province.",
        "Final results, final tallies, will not be available for probably a couple of weeks.",

        "He's with us here in Studio 3A.",
        "Tom, good to see you.",
        "Thanks, Neal.",
        "What do we know about the decision to hold back this story in the first place?",
        "Well, we don't know very much because The New York Times, in an attempt to be transparent about the story, said that they had the story a year ago and that the government had asked them to not publish it.",
        "They had agreed at that time to do so and that they had spent the intervening year doing additional reporting.",
        "Not much more than that was said by The Times."

        "We do know that they had the story before the election.",
        "It's not unusual for news organizations within about a two-week zone before an Election Day to say, `Let's not drop a bomb on an election,' within that tight time period because when a story like this breaks, there's a sorting out-period that often has to occur, and that's what we're engaged in now.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "We don't know, however, whether that was part of The Times' thinking or not.",
        "We also know that one of the principal authors of the piece, Tim Reason, was on a book leave and was gone from The Times for part of this year--most of it, I believe.",
        "He came back a couple of weeks ago.",
        "And there's some--there has been some reporting, but I don't know if this has been confirmed or is correct, that some of this may be in the book that he's just completed.",
        "Which is due out in January.",
        "And the other thing that we do know is that the story ran on the day that the Senate was going to vote on the Patriot Act, and that when the story ran, what happened was a lot of senators said, `Wait a second.",
        "We need to sort this out,' and approval of the Patriot Act was deferred and didn't happen.",
        "And so the impact of the story was in some ways greater because the short-time window that they had before the act was approved.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But we don't know whether any of those aspects of timing were coincidence or not.",
        "No, we don't.",
        "And, you know, I think there's a real push in journalism these days for news organizations to become more transparent, more explanatory, about their decision making.",
        "And The Times here could have done what I think 10 or 15 years ago would have been (technical difficulties) and simply run the story, not indicate anything about the fact of having had it long ago or any discussions with the government.",
        "And actually, we wouldn't be having this conversation and people would be lining up on one side or the other of whether this was a good thing to have disclosed.",
        "But what they did was give a little bit of transparency, but not very much and so once again, here we are discussing the internal policies and politics of The New York Times.",
        "Well, there's also the president's insertion into this.",
        "On Saturday during his radio address, he was critical of the news media for disclosing this story even after sitting on it for more than a year.",
        "Today at his news conference, he seemed to be more critical of whoever it was told The Times about this.",
        "He said it was a shameful act to disclose this sort of information without mentioning whether it was shameful or not to publish it.",
        "Now, you know, one of the things that I think is important to understand is that when a news organization has a story of most--you know, of most types, we're in the business of trying to figure out whether the story is true or not.",
        "And then once we've verified it, we put it in the newspaper or put it on the air.",
        "When national security is involved, there is an added burden for journalism, and that is to decide whether it is appropriate to publish or whether the consequences of publishing would be harmful, which is the argument about national security that the president has made."

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Is this in the public interest, or is it inappropriate for the news organizations to have leaked?",
        "The reality is that if you do something in government that people in government don't like, they will leak it to the newspapers and to radio stations and to TV stations.",
        "That is a fact of life in Washington, it's a fact of life in most state capitals and I'm shocked that the president would be shocked by that.",
