        "Yeah.",
        "Hi.",
        "I can't be - I can't say enough thank you to you and the screener for getting me through, because I have chills, literally, right now, down my back, because I've got a lot of similarities with your guest.",
        "I played at Yale Field for four years until - '87 to '91.",
        "I was a pitcher at Yale.",
        "And then my senior year, job locked up on Wall Street because I knew I couldn't go any farther with the baseball, which was my childhood dream.",
        "But I wanted to just set it down and move on with my life.",
        "And I had two little lymph nodes sticking out of my neck.",
        "And long story short, day after graduation, the team nurse had - prior month or two - assured me it was mono, and then they ruled out everything else.",
        "So this is all in preparation of that transition.",
        "So this spectrum is going to become available, and people want to bid on it to create new advanced wireless opportunities or wireless services.",
        "And I - my father - it was just a haunted day.",
        "I drove up the night after graduation parties and hats in the air and all that fun stuff.",
        "And my father and I, in a very cold, lonely morning, drove up to Yale-New Haven Hospital, and I just - they brought me down on a table.",
        "And then, you know, a couple of days later after the biopsy, it was Hodgkin's lymphoma.",
        "And then luckily, it was stage one, but it's the most rare cell type.",
        "So subsequent years, I worked on Wall Street and got all the toxic treatments, including a bone marrow transplant eventually, and had to work full time, for most of it, until the bone marrow transplant.",
        "And here's the real funny part - and I'll be very brief because I know you got to get other people.",
        "But I knew the mortgage derivatives I was trading for my firm - I won't mention - in 1995, six, seven were being manipulated in the computer model.",
        "And so I kept a file because I knew I was going to get - going for a bone marrow transplant.",
        "And if I survived it, I was going to come back, get my last bonus, and then turn it in - the stuff into the FCC and the General Counsel, my firm.",
        "Long story short, after that, the firm paid back $110 million, and I just wanted anonymity and I resigned after my last bonus and opened up a landscape nursery in Connecticut.",
        "So it's been a tough journey.",
        "And a couple of things your guest touched me on - and I'd love to get his feedback on one thing that might really help me - is, one, how he gets up every day.",
        "And he didn't say it in these words, but when he was playing and even now today, he gets up and it's like a clean slate.",
        "And he tries to run through that brick wall, whatever challenge he's facing that day.",
        "And I had my couple bouts of depression, because I put off the grieving after the four problems with it, and it hit me hard.",
        "But I'm on my feet, and - I wound up getting married and I, too, have twin girls or twins - girls, a twin six years old.",
        "Unfortunately, because my disability, the long-term effects from all the toxic treatments have sort of got me down a little bit.",
        "Well, let's ask Ben Petrick how...",
        "Yeah, go ahead.",
        "I'm sorry.",
        "...he gets through that wall in the morning.",
        "I should explain, by the way, Yale Field where Scott pitched, Ben Petrick played there as a member of the New Haven Ravens.",
        "That was the home field for the AA Easter League team there.",
        "But, Ben Petrick, go ahead.",
        "Hey, you know, like I was saying with the previous caller.",
        "You know, we all have our tough days, and there's no doubt that I have days where, you know, I get up and my first thought is, oh, man.",
        "Do I have to do this again today?",
        "So, like, there's no doubt that's there.",
        "But I think, you know, there's just something inside me that I try to keep on the positive, you know?",
        "Like, I mean, it can be difficult, no doubt, at times.",
        "And as long as I don't focus my main thoughts on those negative feelings and the negative what-ifs and, well, that stuff, and I try to turn myself to positive.",
        "I just tell me, well, to kind of get through it.",
        "And, I mean, and I know this is - that what I have is an incurable disease and I know it can (unintelligible) tough times ahead, but I don't want to focus on that because that just will then make me kind of down or something.",
        "I try to really focus my attention with positive things and the things that I can control and, I mean, not to (unintelligible) go do it.",
        "And I think my faith has been key, in as far as, you know, realizing that I'm - I just thought there's a higher power that's going to take care of me no matter if that's good or bad, whatever, and just (unintelligible) on that.",
        "So, that's all I have to say."

        "So they knew that that maybe-too-high $7,000 price would be out in the public as of January 1.",
