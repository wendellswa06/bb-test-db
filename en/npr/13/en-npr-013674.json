        "Ben Stiller gave Rob one of these new Sony DV hand cams.",

        "It was an incredible explosion for us and it coincided with our first huge, gigantic professional failure.",
        "That pilot never aired.",
        "But they started making Handycam shorts just to make each other laugh.",
        "Soon they were throwing parties where their friends would share their own shorts.",
        "In the era before YouTube, those parties outgrew the living rooms where they began and moved to bigger venues.",
        "Schrab says their agents push them to be more selective with what was screened.",
        "Because there were ones that were 15 minutes long and that were just awful, just really terrible.",
        "And...",
        "So there's no way we are going to start saying what's best and what's not...",
        "Yeah.",

        "They wanted to pass that responsibility onto someone they can trust.",
        "So Rob said, what if we put the audience in charge?",
        "Channel 101 is a democracy where the audience votes.",
        "Of the 10 shows that screen, only five make the cut to return the next month.",
        "That kind of rejection is familiar to Brenan Campbell, who began submitting to 101 and getting rejected again and again, while he still lived in Indiana.",
        "It's really brutal - you get rejected a lot, the audience might not vote to back.",
        "And I think that really helps people who are selling real TV shows and working in the industry, because you get so used to rejection, you're immune to it after a while.",
        "The rejection is a rite of passage.",
        "And after the show, everyone gathers on the roof of the movie theater to celebrate or soften the blow.",
        "That's the secret sauce of Channel 101: Anything goes and it's okay to fall flat on your face.",
        "The rest of the comedy nerds and film freaks in the not-quite-secret club will be waiting for you afterwards, ready to see what you cook up next.",

        "So there is a fair amount of cooperation going on in fighting the war on terror.",

        "embassy staff, a position that typically affords diplomatic immunity.",
        "But the revelation that Davis is also CIA confirms the deepest suspicions of many Pakistanis, who questioned what a diplomat was doing in a dodgy area of Lahore when he fatally shot two men after he said they threatened him with a gun.",
        "There's nothing at all that's illegitimate about the angst and the anguish and the fear in Pakistan.",
        "Columnist Mosharraf Zaidi says Davis represents the thin edge of a so- called covert war - a war that includes, for example, the CIA drone missile program.",

        "There's a covert war going on, and neither country is in a position to embrace that and to be transparent about that.",
        "And if you can't be transparent about something and people are dying, in the obfuscation and in the lack of that transparency, you have a real, serious public policy problem.",

        "...has presented Pakistan the chance to recalibrate its strategic calculation, which until now had been configured against India.",

        "Saddiqa says the worst-case scenario for Davis is that he is tried in Pakistan, convicted on murder charges, and sentenced to death.",
        "But despite the soured relations between the powerful intelligence communities of both countries, Saddiqa says she expects a compromise."

        "So - but to answer your question, yeah, the preparedness efforts have focused on construction and design of safe buildings and safe infrastructure, because even if we could predict earthquakes, the - our buildings, our infrastructure would still have to withstand them.",
        "So that's really the key to safety.",
        "And to address your point, which is that there are low-hazard areas, that that's not saying that an earthquake won't happen there, it does seem that certain parts of the country may be more ready to accept the fact that an earthquake might occur and to prepare for that, whereas other parts of the country, I would say where I am right now on the East Coast, we tend not to think that an earthquake's going to come here.",
        "So perhaps that part of the country would be less willing to put in the time, effort and cost, I guess, involved in truly getting ready for an earthquake.",
        "Is that right?",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "And it is - it's fair to acknowledge that is a balance.",
        "It's an investment in resilience, and that has to be weighed against other needs and interests.",
        "But the awareness of earthquake hazard and the preparedness has really been driven by the earthquakes that we've seen in this country's short history, and it's short to a geologist.",
        "So in Northern California, where they had a quite large earthquake in 1868 on the Hayward fault, the earthquake preparedness started quite early for the U.S.",
        "The hazard in Southern California was debated through the '20s quite heatedly, until the 1933 Long Beach earthquake put the debate to rest, and the preparedness efforts got started here.",
        "If you go to the Pacific Northwest, when I was in graduate school, which wasn't quite the Dark Ages, there was debate about whether that was an active earthquake zone, whether the subduction that you have in that region could generate large earthquakes or not.",
        "And we - since then, it's clear that it can, it does - every few hundred years you get an earthquake about as big as the recent earthquake in Japan."

        "Now, I'm wondering: In terms of risk assessment, it's a risky job in the sense that it's hard to get people to listen - or is it hard to get people to listen or even to follow the advice of risk assessors like yourself?",
        "I would say that despite fairly large efforts by organizations, including FEMA and the Red Cross, to get the American public more prepared for a range of events, that we still as a country have not achieved the level of preparedness that we should be at to be more resilient to particularly large events.",
        "There's probably several different reasons for this.",
        "One of the major ones is that people do not perceive the efficacy of spending money on doing things like preparing a disaster supply kit, particularly when they're marginally economic already and this represents a large expenditure of money compared to their daily needs.",
