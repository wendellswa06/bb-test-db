        "So do you feel much better prepared now to deal with the possibility of an emergency happening in your community, that you could help out, that you could do something about it?",
        "Yeah, absolutely, and I've always thought I was good in emergencies, but boy, the things you learn in this that you don't think about, techniques for light search and rescue, and if you come across a building that's had a fire or something like that and you're the first one on the scene - just all kinds of detailed information that you wouldn't think of otherwise.",
        "All right, thanks so much, Giovanni.",
        "Susan Hough, I wanted to ask you before you have to go: You know, in getting people to sort of take recommendations about getting - preparing for emergencies, I think people make a distinction between mandatory and recommended.",
        "And you know, you can recommend that somebody retrofit their house, for example, for an earthquake.",
        "But unless it's mandatory, they may not do it, right?",
        "Right, and that is - it's a tough economic problem.",
        "It's a complicated world.",
        "People have financial pressures.",
        "And so mandatory retrofitting is a difficult concept to think about.",
        "And it isn't generally done.",
        "So there is some legislation within limited cities.",
        "For the most part, it is a matter of making recommendations that property owners can act on or not.",

        "But then you have to weigh into that how likely is that to occur because as you heard Susan say a little bit earlier, you know, you have to make an economic decision, a decision for preference, the opportunity cost.",
        "If you do one thing, you may not be able to do another, and you need to weigh those things in order to finally make a decision how to allocate resources, and that's not just money.",

        "Sure, I'd be glad to take a crack at that.",
        "Well, as you heard at the top of the hour, you heard Susan say at point, when you asked her could more things be done, and she said: A lot more than can be done.",
        "Should it be done?",
        "And you heard what Mr. Sorenson said about preparedness, that we're not, you know, where we should be at.",
        "Well, compared to what?",
        "I mean, the thing is that unless you look at what likelihood the outcome is and your tolerance for that, it changes.",
        "So in many engineering settings, for instance in aerospace, they will look at what the various range of things that could go wrong, you know, the failure of a hydraulic pump or the failure of an engine or a bird strike, you know, hitting the cockpit.",
        "And then they look at what would it cost to make that risk - it never goes totally away but get it down, you know, substantially.",
        "In some cases, you can actually remove it, versus what else can't you do.",

        "In other cases, it's not.",
        "In health care, traditionally when decisions have been made on an organizational level, often there's not a formal what would be called a risk matrix, where they look at the severity, grading the severity of what could happen, that is a patient dies or they're injured and permanently disabled or temporarily disabled or inconvenienced, that could be the spectrum, versus how likely is that to happen, how many times would this particular hospital see that happen within a year and weigh it that way.",

        "Does the efficacy of the drug outweigh the risk of the drug?",
        "And I think a lot, at times, before a drug is approved, not enough testing is done, or the manufacturers are often guilty of being able to downplay the extremely rare events that they saw emerge during clinical trials.",
        "All right, Jackie.",
        "Let me see.",

        "Yes, and, well, I think what the caller had asked or related to us was a good point, and that is the fact that a decision has to be made.",
        "Now, I think it's not very productive to say: Was there a case where a manufacturer downplayed or falsified information?",
        "That would be a crime.",
        "People commit crimes.",
        "That's not the real thing you should be discussing.",
        "If you have criteria that, say, one in, you know, a thousand patients could be harmed, if you weigh that against -suppose that means for one in thousand you hurt, you saved 500 lives.",
        "Let's just suppose that was it theoretically.",
        "I think any rational person, if given the calculus of here is a drug, and we could cure 500 people, but we'll kill one, and if we do nothing, those 500 would die, I think any rational person would say: Yes, we're going to kill one with the drug to save 500 lives.",
        "I mean, that's the decision that needs to be made, whereas if you do nothing, you can be passive, but to not decide is to decide.",
        "If you decide you want to do nothing because of the risk of some bad thing happening, and then you condemn 500 people to die, is that really a prudent choice?",
        "And I think those are the kinds of things that need to be talked about.",
        "So even if it was one in 1,000 die, if you save 500 lives, overall, depending on how you do the numbers, I'm giving an outlandish example, that would be clear.",
        "That would be a fine decision, in my mind and I think in most rational people's minds.",
        "Does that make sense?",
        "Yeah, that makes sense.",
        "And I want to bring John Sorensen back into the conversation because I think what might be something that is - applies to both, say a medical - the potential for a medical disaster and also the potential that you might have in a disaster that would involve people needing to flee from a natural disaster, for instance."
