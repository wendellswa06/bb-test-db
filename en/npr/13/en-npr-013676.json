        "Is the psychology involved, that's involved with the people, and that is: How do you get people to really think in these terms when it just doesn't seem likely to ever happen to them, John Sorensen?",
        "I mean, the psychology of expecting the worst, it seems like that's part of the challenge of your job is making people understand these things really can happen, and you really do need to be ready for it.",
        "Yeah, I think it's basic human nature to say, first of all, this will never happen to me and then second of all, if it does, I can't believe it's happening to me.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And so we think that public education plays a much secondary role to getting effective warning messages out when something is suspected like approaching tornado, or something is suspected that the science behind the drug testing is incorrect.",
        "And then, you know, people become very information hungry, and they want to know details about the facts and what they should do.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, something that was interesting in Japan and that part of Japan, it was a part of the world that was familiar, is familiar with earthquakes and tsunamis, even, and to some extent people knew they needed to go to high ground.",
        "But even still, they weren't ready for what really happened.",
        "So it's that psychology of truly being able to be prepared for the worst is -it's a tough one to get at, James Bagian, I think.",
        "Well, I guess, the question is - you know, I don't think we can say necessarily that what was done in Japan in preparation was wrong.",
        "If you look at the probabilities and you thought the forecasts were valid, it might have been a decision to say if we hit the one in 10,000 year tsunami, that we're going to take that risk because the investment we would have made otherwise in the intervening 10,000 years, it wouldn't be worth it.",
        "If we, you know, diverted funds to making a huge seawall, let's say, or moving the population elsewhere, and because we use our funds in that way rather than build hospitals, feed the hungry et cetera, many more would die over a 10,000-year period or whatever that period happened to be, it might not be a rational point.",
        "I guess, the thing I would come back to is about really being prepared.",
        "That's where the decision comes into risk.",
        "How do you communicate it to your population, to the people to things that they can understand?"

        "I mean, people fly on airliners every day.",

        "People drive their cars every day and don't think they're going to be killed as they drive home.",
        "Those are risks they take.",
        "And if, you know, tell people, for instance - and I don't know this is exactly the way it would come out - but if you said, you know, you could drive a car for a thousand years, and your likelihood of being hurt by a tsunami is even less than that, would people spend much time being prepared, and is it even appropriate to do that?",
        "And I think that's the kind of discussion that needs to be had in the cold lighted day before the disaster occurs, so people can make that rational decision, not when the emotions are running high when people are actually hurt.",
        "And I think Mr. Sorensen made an excellent point about education.",
        "Education, while necessary, is far from sufficient.",
        "Many studies have shown that when you just try to educate people without then incorporating that into the design about how you design your cities or whatever the issue happens to be - a nuclear reactor, how it's built - education is not enough.",
        "You have to make actual physical, tangible changes.",
        "And if you don't, the preparation will not be that worthwhile.",
        "Yes.",

        "My construction company is always taking into account risk assessment, earthquakes, flood damage, so on and so forth.",
        "One thing that I'm responsible for is their information, and the company does not seem to spend any energy or money or attention to information data retention.",
        "why do people start to take into account their data - the information aspect.",
        "I'm asked to restore information when, for example, if a meteor were to hit one of our sites and all our data is just gone.",
        "But I rarely ever hear anything about that when it comes to earthquakes or the tsunami in Japan.",
        "So, I know a lot of data was lost, and I'm just curious to know if anyone is taking that into consideration, and if there's been a dollar and cents applied to it.",
        "Well, let me ask John Sorensen to respond to that.",
        "Thanks so much for your call.",
        "John Sorensen?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think what you're talking about is the - overall is the redundancy of systems, and be it a redundant transportation system or a redundant data system, what do you do when one system fails, and do you have another system that can serve its same function?",
        "And I don't - I think, from a cost benefit perspective, a lot of times, companies or governments decide redundancy is just far too more expensive and are willing to take the risk that something will take out one of the systems.",
        "All right.",

        "I work with businesses that are small, medium sized businesses in Georgia, helping them prepare for emergencies.",
        "And one of the challenges we've seen, especially in the smaller business side, is that through the past few years, most of their focus has been on simply just surviving so they really haven't internalized the need to do this on a voluntary basis.",
        "We do see, with the new Public Law 110-53 that has come out with a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission to develop a voluntary private sector preparedness accreditation certification that potentially, then, the message is going to move from more of a fear-based need to do this, to potentially more of an incentive base.",
        "And we're already seeing some regulatory requirements that day cares(ph) have to have an emergency plan before they are licensed.",
        "So somewhat moving more from the voluntary to some regulatory, but, again, just kind of building that awareness that the need - to have that plan in place regardless of the size.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks so much for your call, Mark.",
        "James Bagian, what was your reaction to what Mark was talking about there?",
        "Well, I think, you know, any of those kinds of things, especially when they're voluntary, they're just that.",
        "It's certainly worth while to make people aware that there are hazards out there, they might want to defend against.",
        "But, once again, it comes back to one of the things, I believe, you said at the top of the hour, and that is how safe is safe, how safe do you want to be.",
        "And until you try to put some numbers to that, it makes the decision that people make very arbitrary and inconsistent.",
        "So as much as you can, and it's not always easy, you need to try to relate it to, you know, what percent of the time and fractional percent of the time are you willing to have a bad thing happen and what is it cost to mitigate that risk versus other things?",
        "So an example, I think John Sorensen said, or one of the callers said about, you know, an asteroid hitting his data center.",
        "If you want to go against that risk, that's something to look at.",
        "You would weigh and say is it - if I'm only to do one, would I protect against an asteroid or a tsunami?",
        "So then, you'll make a decision, which one was it.",
        "But I think often those decisions don't come up.",
        "I would go in slightly other areas about when you do analysis of risk, they do things called failure mode and effect analysis - where you look at the various modes that could cause a failure and decide what the effect would be and is it worth mitigating?"

        "Food and Drug Administration and in the U.K., their version of the FDA became concern about reports that there might be some lengths between these drugs and - that these drug might actually cause suicide, so they started looking into it.",
        "They didn't find that but they did find an increase in suicidal ideation, that means suicidal thoughts.",
        "And the presumption was if people is thinking about it more or even starting with the behaviors like making some failed attempts, that this drugs could be linked and they all put warning label on them.",
        "So this increase in suicidal ideation was for children, right?",
        "So hence the warnings on these.",
