        "He took over Haiti in 1971 as the youngest head of state of anywhere in the world, at the age of 19 after his father died, and continued the legacy of his father, if somewhat less cruel than - and less mystic than his father's rule - certainly perpetuated the reign of terror and of course the pillaging that characterized Duvalier's reign in the country.",

        "Air Force took Baby Doc to - with his wife - actually, he was married at the time - out of Haiti.",
        "He was taken into France in what was actually a kind of a difficult situation, because Baby Doc was not granted formal exile in France.",
        "He was confined to the south of France to a 30-mile radius.",
        "And the French never officially gave him exile status which would have allowed him certain latitudes that he didn't enjoy.",
        "Some people, though, might say that restricted to a 30-mile area in the south of France, there have been more serious penalties imposed on former dictators who are accused of, not only looting the treasury, but human rights abuses, including large-scale murder.",
        "Well, actually some people say that Aristide - I'm sorry.",
        "That's some mistake - that Duvalier actually had what many consider would be the most luxurious exile in the world.",
