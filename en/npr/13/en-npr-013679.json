        "There is another exiled Haitian president, Jean-Claude Aristide, and is he talking about coming back too?",
        "That is one story that everybody is expecting, or the one issue that everybody is wondering about.",
        "The State Department spokesman, PJ Crowley, said that they had no knowledge that Aristide would be making such a statement or no - they weren't pursuing that angle of the story.",
        "But certainly it has percolated that - or people have begun, you know, in the whole conspiracy theory type of scenario - because there is so little knowledge that we have about why Duvalier returned - that perhaps Aristide might be - if Duvalier were to be allowed in Haiti and without any type of justice or without any type of criminal prosecution, that it might be safer for Aristide to plan such a return.",
        "But nothing concrete has been said, and Aristide has not made any public statements to this regard.",
        "And could either of them play a positive role?",
        "Would either be accepted as sort of a savior from the past?",
        "I see they're very difficult.",
        "Haiti - these gentlemen, to the extent that they do represent the past and where Haiti is coming from, they also represent extremely polarizing tensions and periods of extreme ingovernability(ph) in Haiti, a country that is now trying to grapple with the results of a certain election and trying to move forward in a certain sense.",
        "It would not - it would be very difficult to see the extent to which any of these gentlemen can bring the types of institutional strengths and procedures that Haiti needs to move forward.",
        "We're getting a lot of questions about this - we just have a minute or so left, and I thought I'd followed it up.",
        "But, was there a deal that while he lived in France, as long as he was not involved in Haitian politics, he would no be prosecuted?",
        "To the extent of my knowledge, I don't think so.",
        "Then why didn't the French go after him?",
        "That is a question that many people have been asking themselves.",
        "I think it was a matter of the French simply allowing this man to stay there as long as he as you say - as long as he confined himself to a perimeter.",
        "He did not participate in public life or in public activities, so he certainly was kept out of the scene.",
        "His current companion, is actually the daughter of a former Haitian president, so certainly ties to the community and ties to Haiti were there.",
        "But why wasn't this pursued any further is, of course, a story to be told, it's just that those elements are surfacing now."

        "Right now, we're estimating that there are about 40,000 elephants being killed a year.",
        "And there's only 400,000 left in Africa, so that's a tenth of the population a year.",

        "They falsify shipping documents, for example.",
        "They hide ivory in shipping containers.",
        "They send the ivory to multiple ports before its final destination.",
        "At the University of Washington, Wasser developed a way to use DNA in tusks to tell what part of Africa the elephants lived in.",
        "Now he's using the technique to home in on the cartels.",
        "Wasser analyzed DNA from tusks that were seized by customs officials.",
        "He noticed that smugglers often separate the two tusks that come from a single elephant and ship them separately, presumably to make it harder to track where they came from.",
        "But Wasser found a pattern.",
        "The two shipments with matching tusks pass through a common port.",
        "They were shipped close together in time, and they showed high overlap in the genetically determined origins of the tusks.",
        "So these three characteristics suggest that the same major trafficking cartel was actually responsible for shipping both of the shipments.",
        "Wasser says wildlife authorities rarely get enough evidence to identify the big players.",
        "Often it's their smaller suppliers who get caught with only as much ivory as they can carry.",
        "Those convictions are well down the smuggling pyramid and don't do much to stem the trade.",
        "His technique aims higher."
