        "And looking at some of the artifacts here, there's a piece as an obvious contrast, there are shackles there that are obviously symbols of enslavement.",
        "Tell me about this piece.",
        "We often find very little material remains of enslavement.",
        "But what's powerful about this is this is a shackle from a ship that actually transported slaves on the middle passage.",
        "Wow.",
        "So, part of why we collect this is to be able to humanize that great tragedy.",
        "Whether you look at this and realize that one person was kept in this for weeks as he or she was brought from Africa to the new world, it suddenly makes this real and it inspires you to be amazed at the resiliency of the people that went through this.",
        "And you just look at these U-shaped rusted shackles and you could just think of the depravity.",
        "That's right.",
        "When - I mean, you say that there are very few artifacts remaining from this period of time.",
        "Why is that?",
        "I think there are a couple things.",
        "First of all, during the period of enslavement in the United States, a lot of the clothing, the shoes, were really not of the highest quality.",
        "So these things sort of disappeared, were reused...",
        "Disintegrated.",
        "...and just disintegrated.",
        "The same thing with the slave cabins.",
        "Many of them became tenant farmer's homes and sharecropper's homes, so pieces got changed and exchanged.",

        "And maybe people didn't want to remember that time.",
        "Well, I think the other issue is it is really such a challenge to get people today to want to talk about the period of enslavement and remember.",
        "And so what you find are many African-Americans who initially want to say the key is to focus on freedom, not enslavement.",
        "And then for others, there are people who feel this is a period of embarrassment.",
        "And so for me, what I hope happens is that somebody sees this and realizes the strength of somebody who survived that, who then tried to keep family, culture and soul together.",
        "And in some ways, while this is a symbol of shame and pain, it's also a symbol of resiliency.",
        "And Lonnie Bunch, I should take this opportunity to let our listeners know that they can see all of these artifacts that we're talking about at our Web site, which is npr.org.",
        "There's a book that I'm looking at here among the artifacts that you brought, and it's a book, I understand, that was donated in honor of you.",

        "Over here, this is a photo album that was put together by a congregational minister named Keith Jones who lived in Wethersfield, Connecticut.",

        "Just like a driver's license - and this is my Wyoming driver's license - just like a driver's license, the Thune amendment is a license for self-defense across state lines.",
        "It means with this license, my Concealed Carry License from Wyoming, I will not be limited to Wyoming.",
        "Because what you find in here - these are mainly cabinet cards, late 19th, early 20th century - and what they document is a kind of African-American middle class that was invisible to most people.",
        "So, he would turn the pages and I would sit there and think, my God, it would be wonderful to have this stuff, to have it in a museum.",
        "And my surprise is that when he passed away, I went up to visit his family and they said he wanted to make sure this came to the Smithsonian.",
        "And so...",
        "These are, I should describe, these are portraits, mainly portraits of African-Americans in suits, in coats, babies in these beautiful gowns."

        "Absolutely fascinating.",
        "There's one more piece you brought, and I've been waiting for this until the end of the night.",

        "Under the Thune amendment, people from those states with virtually no standards for concealed carry or no requirement to prove that you know how to use gun, those people could visit states where they've established standards for the safety of their residents, and under the Thune amendment, legally carry a gun.",
