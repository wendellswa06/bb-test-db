        "The issue of values was by many accounts the defining issue in the last election, 2004.",

        "I've been trying to gauge that, Alex.",
        "I would suspect that there are those within, say, the more separatistic wing of the big umbrella of evangelicalism - among the fundamentalists, that is - who might be turned off by this.",
        "But I still think that's a small percentage.",
        "You know, it's not just an issue of how are people going to vote.",
        "It's how much are they willing to work for a party or a candidate even?",
        "It's the passion factor.",
        "And this scandal may influence some folks on the passion factor.",
        "But I'm not sure that is as big a issue as is the perception by some within conservative ranks that the president ran on the values issues and then wasn't willing to push them.",
        "Are you saying that this Congressman Foley problem in some way you think may be perceived as a reflection of a reluctance to push values issues on the part of either President Bush or the Republican Party?",
        "Or is it that people who are motivated by those issues are looking to other questions.",
        "I think it's probably other questions, although you make an interesting argument, that the whole willingness of the Republican leadership to address this question in their own ranks raises leadership issues.",
        "Look, I give Mr. Hastert a break here and say he did what he probably should have done, but evangelicals are committed to societal reform, and there are other issues that may impact their vote, but I'm not sure this one will.",
        "What are the other issues?",
        "It doesn't make the Republicans look good.",
        "But that's obvious, on the face of it.",
        "What are the issues that you think might either elevate or depress the vote this year?",
        "Well, the obvious national issue is the war in Iraq.",
        "There's no question about that.",
        "College students, denominational executives here and other cities around the country, passers - that's the one national issue."

        "Would there be an evangelical view or position on the war in Iraq?",
        "Very interesting question.",
        "The National Association of Evangelicals that represents a constituency of some 30 million, and it's probably half of the evangelicals in America, never took a position on the war.",
        "We were very clear not to do so.",
        "Early this spring the polls said that 65 percent of evangelicals, thereabout, supported the president's policies on Iraq, and I noted that with the general public that support has drifted downward.",
        "And there are those - I've run into college students here on campus who say they are upset of the conduct of the war, probably not the decision to go into the war, but the conduct and how it's been managed that say they're going to vote Democrat as a result.",
        "I think it's a protest vote.",
        "But I don't think the issue long-term bodes well for the Republicans unless they can turn around the situation on the ground in Iraq, which of course is obvious to all us, a civil war to one degree or another.",

        "could gene doping also be a wedge that if we allow it in sports, people will say, hey, I want that for other things that are not sport-related?",
        "Out before his audiences, though, Stone confesses it was endings exactly like his that prompted him to begin writing.",
        "I think that what we do need in Afghanistan is a more effective counter-insurgency strategy, meaning it can't just be about the military action.",
        "You also need a much more sharply defined and robust international civilian effort, so that when a village is liberated - as Musacala was - from the Taliban and the NATO forces come in, they are quickly followed by international humanitarian relief and by economic programs so that the people of Afghanistan can see that there's hope in the NATO and Afghan government's efforts."

        "Well, when you saw this, did you think maybe it's a trial balloon, maybe China's...",
        "I certainly think that that's a possibility.",
        "China has done that many times in the past, that middle-ranking or lower-ranking official has floated a trial balloon to see what the reaction would be to that kind of statement, because then the higher-ranking officials can always come out and say, no, that that was not what was really meant, or no, that's not official policy.",
