        "But the idea is that the tools that have been developed over the past some years to carry out gene therapy - that is, introducing genes into people to correct disease traits - those same techniques can, in principle, be used - theoretically be used to modify traits in human beings that have nothing to do with disease necessarily but then have to do with athletic ability like muscle strength and muscle power and endurance and the way we make and utilize metabolic energy and so on.",
        "Genes regulate those traits.",
        "We know many of those genes and we now have, through the successes of the gene therapy, we have an inkling, at least, of how we might be able to modify some of them.",

        "Well, that was a man named Thomas Springsteen, who already had been involved in some doping issues with the Turin Olympic games, I think.",
        "And he was found by the German authorities to be on the Internet trying to obtain something called Repoxygen, which was a gene therapy material being developed by a British company.",
        "This material was intended to produce erythropoietin, EPO.",
        "And we know, of course, that's a very popular drug of choice or gene or material of choice, particularly in an endurance sport.",
        "It's highly abused in some kinds of sport.",
        "Its used - it has been used historically as the hormone itself, but of course we know the gene that produces it and it's been possible to put that gene into a virus, a disabled virus, that acts as a - kind of a moving van to put that gene into cells.",
        "That material was intended to treat people with chronic kidney disease and with cancers, people who are unable to make good amounts of blood themselves.",
        "So it stimulates blood production, presumably in patients.",
        "And Springsteen is not a clinician and not a scientist but an athletic coach, so he was trying to get this material, and one can only assume that he was trying to get it to apply to athletes in order to increase their blood production and their endurance.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "We don't know if that wound up in any real athletes, but it's quite clear that the world of sport is very much aware of what's going on in gene therapy, keeping tabs on it.",
        "Much of it is published material.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "The use of EPO as a drug or as a gene, the effects would be seen in elevated levels of blood production, and so you would test for exactly the same thing.",
        "But the World Anti-Doping Agency is aware that the kinds of tests that would be required for gene doping would be different kinds of tests.",
        "And so they have a research program very actively looking at the development of those tests.",
        "It's a different kind of testing paradigm, but initial results from a lot of the studies at WADA seem to indicate that those kinds of molecular genetic-based tests are feasible and results are looking promising.",
        "So, the truth is that while we don't have a validated test now for any gene doping applications, those tests are coming.",

        "And the more the cheaters kind of modify their methods and invent new ways of avoiding testing, the more clever the regulators and the testers have to be to develop new tests.",
        "I mean, the tests are modifications of the classical ones for the drugs that we all know: steroids and stimulants and depressants and things of that sort, and agents that mask stimulants and depressants.",

        "I think it's fair to say that the level of expertise that might be required to apply gene therapy kinds of approaches to sport, the level of expertise is not enormously high that there are many thousands of people, kind of at graduate-school level, who could carry out the production of these materials.",

        "They will do things with the hope of cashing in quickly on the pressures that -responding to the pressures and the glories of sports.",

        "Well, I think that's right.",

        "I think all primitive societies have some kind of competition, athletic competition.",
        "And so there's something really basic about sport that one really needs to honor.",
