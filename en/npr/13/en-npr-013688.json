        "But the destruction of the youngest monk's temple and the assassination of their beloved grand master forces the boys to rely on their individual strengths and consider how they'll survive in the wider world.",

        "And they don't know anyone.",
        "They don't--they've never been outside the temple, and they have to go somewhere, so each is tasked with uncovering the secrets of their past, as each is an orphan and had been adopted and raised together as brothers.",
        "I was an orphan, and I spent 15 years looking for my birth mother, and I started looking for her a sixth time in conjunction with writing this series.",
        "After he began writing, though, the adoption laws changed in his home state, Michigan.",
        "Six months later, Jeff Stone was embraced by his mother, and a little after that, his father.",
        "It was a fairy-tale ending.",
        "All right.",
        "I'll tell you a little bit about me, just a little bit, and then tell you about the series.",
        "I didn't actually read too many books growing up, but if I did read, it was usually fantasy, and in a lot of fantasy stories you have these main characters who are orphans and are searching for their pasts, and at the end of the book, they find, you know, their roots, and then the book ends, and as an adoptee, that used to drive me crazy, because, you know, that'd really be the beginning of your adventure.",
        "Stone tells the assembled youngsters that his favorite way to explain his books is through kung fu demonstrations, and he asks for volunteers.",
        "The teens in the audience look on with interest, but they're too cool to raise their hands.",
        "But a dimpled 10-year-old named Nathan gamely comes to the front of the room.",
        "Want to come up here?",
        "And Stone shows him the difference between, well, crouching tiger, darting monkey and dragon-style kung fu, where energy is released in a big, snaky hiss.",
        "You ready?",
        "Together, forward...",

        "Well, you're exactly right.",
        "It's more than just words.",
        "On Saturday, when the funeral was held here, there were about 75 people that attended the burial, and at least half of those were Amish people actually coming from the same families who had lost their children less than a week before, and they greeted, personally, the widow of the killer, greeted the three children, and it was just a very touching and moving moment.",
        "And as you indicated, there is a fund set up to receive contributions that will help the family of the killer, in addition to a number of funds that have been set up by the Amish.",
        "So this isn't just theoretical forgiveness or a few nice words, but this is really operationalized in very practical ways here by these unusual people.",

        "Well, the Amish certainly would've also forgiven him if he would still be living.",
        "If he would've been imprisoned, I'm sure they would've made some efforts to visit him.",
        "But they do have what is often called in religious circles a two kingdom theology, where they don't receive - they don't assume responsibility for meting out justice.",
        "In a sense, they would say, well, it's our responsibility to forgive, but it's up to the police and the system of justice to deal with punishment and so on.",

        "They don't hold public office.",
        "They don't assume a lot of responsibility for civic order.",

        "We have an e-mail here from John in Idaho, who writes, Please stop saying that the Amish forgive and forget.",
        "There is a difference between forgiving and forgetting.",

        "This is especially true if the target of your anger has died.",

        "If someone in the Amish community transgresses a regulation of the church - let's say they go out and buy an automobile - and then if the person comes to the church and repents and asks forgiveness and confesses this purchase of the automobile, the Amish would say we're going to forgive and we're going to forget that.",
