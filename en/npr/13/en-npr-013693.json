        "But clearly now the government has said that they will honor valid advance paroles on DACA.",
        "But they will not renew, or they will not issue any more advance paroles.",

        "Well, my answer is really that it depends, and I know - you know, because each case is so different.",

        "That was the wrong thing to do.",
        "Well, President Trump, in removing DACA, has now exposed those young dreamers to deportation.",

        "He was a DREAMer.",
        "And because of DACA, he got married.",

        "He's got a wife and lives in western Ohio and is doing very well.",
        "And he's one of the people that will be affected by the cancellation of DACA.",
        "How could he still be affected by that?",
        "I mean wouldn't his marriage supersede whatever his status had been when he was covered by DACA?",
        "No.",
        "The answer to that is because he did not last enter the country lawfully, he's ineligible to get a green card inside the United States.",
        "So because he's married to a U.S.",
        "citizen, he is eligible to apply for a green card even though he's undocumented.",

        "consulate.",
        "And the problem he's got is that once he does that, they're going to tell him, well, you may be eligible for the green card, so come back and see us in 10 years because since you were in the United States without documents for over a year, you're barred from coming back to the United States for another decade.",
        "And I suppose in that situation, he could have a Skype relationship with his wife and child, but I don't think that that would be people's first choice.",
        "And that dilemma presents itself to him the moment that his most recent DACA certification expires, the moment that that two-year term ends."
