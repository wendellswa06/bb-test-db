        "You seemed very attuned to the flavors in your culture, as you were growing up as a child.",
        "Can you give us the range of the kinds of flavors that were making these impressions on you?",
        "Well, if you take all the range of American and European flavors, and let's say European and American flavors go from A to Z.",
        "Now, add 20 more on the left of A and 20 more on the right of Z, and that's what India is.",
        "There are these lovely ephemeral foods that you mention in the book, foods that only appear during certain seasons.",
        "There's the monsoon mushrooms...",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "...and then the particular juicy mango.",
        "Oh, right.",
        "The mangos - now the mango is of course to Indians are the king of fruit, and we wait for them.",
        "You only get them when God's hitting the Earth with the sun in a desperate way and everything is baked and hot and you can't go out, and then the mango comes to cheer you up.",
        "And we'd all - as kids we'd all - for the summers we'd go to the hills, to the Himalayas Mountains, and when we would go on picnics, we would take these sucking mangoes with us.",
        "And if you - always there was some kind of water where we were, very cold streams, because we're in the tallest mountains in the world - and we'd find a little place, and in the little rounded pebbles and rocks we would put the mangoes in like a little nest of eggs, and they'd be sitting there cooling while we had the rest of our meal.",
        "And all the time we'd be thinking at the end of the meal, it'll be these mangoes.",
        "So then the meal would end, and we'd all run to the mangos, and each child would pick up a mango.",
        "And then you had to squeeze it, squeeze it all round so it would get soft.",
        "And then when it was all nicely squeezed, you would take the very top off as if opening the little faucet, as it were and then put it to your mouth and squeeze, and it would come shooting in this lovely cold mango juice."

        "It's both.",
        "It's definitely both.",

        "It's the association.",
        "Being with a huge family where you know everyone and you're comfortable and you're happy, you're really happy having them, so it becomes associated with a certain kind of happiness, I guess.",
        "Now, in your own family, you were very accustomed to a wide range of influences.",
        "There was traditional Hindu cooking as well as a Muslim influence, and then the British influence.",
        "That's right.",
        "The Muslim influence was of course the strongest, because Delhi was the capital of a Muslim country, practically, even though the Muslims were in the minority, but they were ruling a majority of India since about the 13th century, till the 19th century.",
        "And my ancestors worked in the Muslim courts and they ran the Muslim courts, so they picked up the etiquette of the Muslim courts, which was wonderful, but it involved eating meat.",
        "That was very much a part of the Muslim tradition.",
        "Not that it wasn't Hindu as well, but the way we cooked it was very much in the Muslim tradition.",
        "But then the women were very often vegetarian in my family.",
        "My grandmother was vegetarian, and they kept up the very Hindu side of the family.",
        "And then after independence, we got all the refugees from what became Pakistan, the Hindus that fled, and with them they brought what everyone associates with India, which I didn't even know about at that time, and that's tandoori cooking.",
        "Tandoori chicken.",
        "Exactly.",
        "At the age of 13 or 14, to me it was an absolutely exotic thing.",
        "I'd never had it before, and it came with the refugees who brought their ovens, their clay ovens, with them.",
        "Now, this happened after partition, when Pakistan and India became two countries."

        "And then I started writing letters to my mother, and she would send me these rather vague recipes - a little bit of this, a little bit of that and put it all together.",
