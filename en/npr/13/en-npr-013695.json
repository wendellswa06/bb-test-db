        "Let's start with you, Mr. Luttwak.",
        "You're among the 50 percent who believe it's time to get out of Iraq.",
        "Why?",
        "Well, when I originally said we should disengage, that's not exactly the same thing as leaving the country.",
        "Disengage means stop patrolling, stop checkpoints, withdraw to remote desert bases, have no contact with the population but stand behind the government and prevent foreign elements from entering the country.",
        "Embark as an invasion of Iraq or something.",
        "So Mr. Kaplan, what is your take on getting out of the daily lives of the people of Iraq?",

        "I spent time in a town last month called Tel Afir where American forces did try to withdraw and when they did, the town literally came apart at the seams.",
        "Shiia and Sunni tribes began waging war with one another.",
        "And then the American forces reoccupied the town and now they largely operate as a buffer, and I think if we're speaking purely in terms of an insurgency, the answer would be, as Edward suggests, to have a much lighter footprint in Iraq.",
        "But I think when you're dealing with what can only be described as an incipient civil war, I think the answer is to have a more visible presence.",
        "I find this quite difficult to understand.",
        "Now we have 37,500 policemen in New York City.",
        "The population in New York City is smaller, it's somewhat less hostile than in Iraq, and therefore if you believe that American troops should become a Middle Eastern constabulary, to keep Iraqis one from another, then you should also immediately add that we need at least half a million troops in Iraq.",
        "We never had even one-fifth of the rightful strength we needed to control the country.",
        "And it's really very unfair, actually.",
        "It's unfair, because, you know, you're exposing the Iraqis to lawlessness, and lawlessness, for most people, is worse than dictatorial oppression."

        "Mr. Kaplan?",
        "The fact is, we all know there are not enough troops in Iraq, but I fail to see how reducing troop strength still further, as both Edward and indeed the Bush Administration argue, can help alleviate the problem.",
        "Now, we've had no choice but to largely withdraw from the political arena.",
        "Similarly, we've had no choice but to withdraw simply because we've run out of money from the infrastructure arena and there nothing works.",

        "can do to prepare Iraqis to handle this growing, what some have called, civil war?",
        "Well, the cultural structure in Iraq is such that when they drew the border of this thing called Iraq, which was done, as you know, fairly carelessly by Winston Churchill after the First World War, when they drew the border they put together these groups without any thought about them ever ruling themselves by consensus and democracy, and this is the situation that was inherited by the monarchy and then by Saddam Hussein.",
        "Saddam Hussein was perhaps unnecessarily harsh, but there is no doubt in my mind that if you want to have law and order in a place called Iraq, you have to have a fairly oppressive dictatorship, and...",

        "No, I do not.",
        "We know that if we withdraw, there will be 100 percent chance of catastrophe.",
        "If we stay, I've, I'd say our odds of producing some form of stable government, the odds are probably about 40 percent.",

        "Now you're saying there's probably only a 40 percent chance of success.",
