        "Now, I realize I'm somewhat eluding your question, but the fact is, had I know three years ago what was to come, would I have been as enthusiastic about the prospect of liberating Iraq?",

        "And so we can actually do actuarial risk assessment based on past historical events to create a mathematical statement of probability that some sex offenders are, in fact, very dangerous.",
        "I may be wrong but my general impression is that, in fact, it's very hard for sex offenders to get over these urges and that there's a general sense that they are likely to repeat these crimes.",

        "We do have to do a much better job, in my view, of dealing with those dangerous sex offenders who come back into the community.",
        "Today we either lock sex offenders up for a long period of time or simply dump them into the community subject to minimal information control: primarily a duty to register with the police and community notification when appropriate.",
        "But if a sex offender does not comply, is there someone following up after their prison sentence has been served, saying, `Did we get a note back from the state registry saying, indeed, this person registered?'",
