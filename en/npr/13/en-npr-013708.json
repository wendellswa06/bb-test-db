        "And they also feel that they had some sort of promise from the U.S.",
        "about 20 years ago that that policy would be removed, and the fact that it is still enforced casts a pall on the spirit of the new warming of relations between the two countries, so that was sort of a dagger that I thought was quite surprising from the Cuban official today.",

        "Principally, they say, you know, lifting the embargo.",
        "And also, one main sticking point for the Cubans is that they're still on the U.S.",
        "list of for state-sponsored terrorism.",
