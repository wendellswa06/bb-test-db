        "It's going to be interesting to see whether Obama sticks, as he has so far, with the SEC nominee and with the Treasury nominee, or if he picks somebody else.",
        "Many people are willing to give him a pass on both of them, even though I think that if they were in some other administration, they would not be given a pass just because people are in a celebratory mood, and they'd like to give Obama a pass on everything.",
        "But I don't think they should because he has to be taken to task just to make sure that the people around him do a better job on everything else they do.",

        "What do you - what do the both of you expect from Gibbs, and what do you know about him?",
        "Well, from what I've seen of him, he has - he probably has the - one of the key qualities you're going to want in this spokesman is that he seems to have the complete confidence of the president-elect, of the soon-to-be president.",
        "And from what I understand, he is somebody who is going to be in the room when the important questions and when the important decisions are made.",
        "And if you really want to have a high-quality spokesperson, you're going to want somebody who's going to be there when the decisions are made, so he knows exactly what the formulations are, and he can then translate that into the public voice.",
        "It certainly sounds like that's the way it should go.",
        "Is that how you would expect it, Mary?",
        "Right.",

        "Scott McLellan did not have it in the Bush administration, for example.",
        "Right.",
        "And so I think that that's a terrible job to have if you do not have the president's support, and if you are not in the meetings, so that you know what's going on in the meetings, and Gibbs seems to have that access."
