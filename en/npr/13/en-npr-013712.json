        "In the case of the several red lines that we have drawn, you have a real problem because in order to enforce a red line, number one, you need clarity of circumstance.",
        "You have to agree that something has happened.",
        "Number two, you'd need credibility of response.",
        "Whatever happened should be tied to a clear and measurable response, in this case by the United States.",
        "And finally, you really do need believability, that in the end, in this case the president of the United States is prepared to intervene seriously.",
        "And frankly, where red lines have now been used both in terms of Syria and Iran, I'm afraid that there's an absence of clarity, and there's also an absence of credibility.",
        "And I think overall the one cautionary note and tale about red lines is don't lay them down unless you're prepared to actually enforce them.",
        "Because if you don't, then what is - what purports to be a way to strengthen American resolve and credibility ends up weakening it.",
        "And I'm afraid even though I don't have solutions to either the Syrian or the Iranian problem - easy ones - that that's precisely what's happening in both cases.",
        "Well, again, we're not sure quite what happened in Syria with the chemical weapon or whether it was a chemical weapon or not.",
        "But nevertheless, once the president does issue one of these red lines - to mix metaphors, red lines in the sand, as they're sometimes called, is there a committee that gets to work saying OK, if they do it, we do X, Y or Z?",
        "Well, if only life worked that way, as a sort of linear progression inside the government.",
        "Let's be clear.",
        "The president has said repeatedly - he said it again in the presence of the Israeli prime minister - that Assad has lost authority, credibility, legitimacy to lead.",
        "He said two years ago.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And yet these statements - the gap between these statements and our capacity to produce the outcomes that the president desires is enormous.",
        "And I fear, in the case of Syria, for example, it's absolutely clear to me - and I'm not critical of the president; others are - that he is extremely deliberate, careful and risk averse when it comes to committing American military forces, setting up a no-fly zone, let alone - or even, frankly, arming the opposition, which he's been very reluctant to do.",
        "So when he says today that there will be accountability if chemical weapons are transferred or used or loosed, the real question is: what does he mean?",
        "And I think his answer, by presidential standards - and again, I know it was off the cuff - was a bit rambling.",
        "In fact, it is kind of the opposite of red lines.",
        "It's, well, we'll survey the situation.",
        "We'll check all the facts, and then we'll get back to you.",

        "On Iran there's a similar problem because the U.S.",

        "That's the Israeli argument.",
        "So even in the case of Iran, the whole discussion of red lines has become, I'm afraid, more harmful than positive.",
        "And when red lines turn pink, Neal, which is essentially what's happening, or they basically disappear, the credibility of the United States is undermined.",

        "There was a clear ultimatum, or I guess you could use the word red line.",
        "The Iraqis evaluated and digested it, either believed that the Americans weren't serious or somehow they would become somehow lost in the desert, chose to ignore it, and the Bush administration basically delivered.",
        "There was another part of that meeting which we've never heard precisely about, and that was - there was no doubt, by the way, at that time that Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons and that if he used them in that conflict, terrible things would ensue.",
        "Yes.",
        "And as we know, the Iraqis, Saddam, did deploy them and the consequences of that deployment were never accounted for.",

        "I'm not arguing for war.",

        "You know, I think there's probably been a long discussion among members of this administration from the beginning about being careful with language.",
        "I think the president confused rhetoric and action for the first couple years of his administration, particularly on an issue like the Israeli-Palestinian problem, and he clearly sent a much different signal and tone today about reconciling what is real with what he would hope to achieve.",
        "But I, you know, I think you also have an administration, Neal, that I think has created a foreign policy which it believes is well-suited at least to the needs and requirements of the American public.",
        "It is not Barack Obama's mission in life to get America into new and potentially open-ended Middle Eastern conflicts.",
        "Then why does he draw red lines?",
        "Well, I think that the answer to that is he is trying to find a balance between doing nothing and acquiescing in something he does not want to acquiesce in on one hand, and overdoing it.",
        "And I think he somehow hopes that during the course of the next six to eight months, through the pressure of sanctions and the inducements of a serious diplomatic process, somehow war could be averted and a negotiated settlement on the issue of the enrichment of uranium in exchange for easing up and potentially over time eliminating sanctions on Iran can somehow be worked out.",
        "I do not believe Barack Obama wants to go to war with Iran.",
        "I think he understands the consequences in the absence of an end-state(ph).",
        "But I also have a sense that he does not want to be the American president on whose watch Iran acquires a deliverable nuclear weapon.",
        "So he's balancing, he's hoping, and he's trying to create some additional space on the part of the Israelis to give him time to pursue every conceivable option to marshal the support of the international community and to leave no stone unturned if in fact at the end of the road the result is going to be a projection of American military power against those Iranian nuclear sites.",
