        "You've got like kind of a pastry, a jelly doughnut sort of thing?",
        "You know, I actually right now am using it in the form of a ravioli.",
        "So it looks just like a ravioli.",
        "You bite into it and it's full of beer.",
        "Meaning that there's a liquid center to it?",
        "It is a liquid center.",
        "And so if you don't bite it carefully, you end up with beer on your shirt.",
        "You will.",
        "And the alcohol content of this is - well, it's beer.",

        "Nope, no permanent injury.",
        "Just a few burns here and there.",
        "So how did you successfully fry this liquid?",
        "You know, it was trial and error, and finally - I'd even consulted with a food scientist.",
        "She couldn't help me figure out a way to do it.",
        "It was ultimately something my four-and-a-half-year-old son was doing that made me think, you know, I can try that.",

        "Being a fried food is not a requirement, but nobody's made it into the finals without a fried food.",
        "Now, you said this is just for concessionaires, meaning you were a concessionaire at the Texas State Fair, correct?",

        "And I just was like, shocked to hear the word obese related to me.",
        "Fifteen years, countless failed diets and another 100 pounds later...",
        "And now I'm morbidly obese.",
        "And it's just overwhelming.",
        "Every day is a struggle with the little things, like chafing on her inner thighs or tying her shoes; and with the biggies, like love.",
        "With bright eyes and high cheekbones, Curtis is as pretty as she is engaging and witty.",
        "And she's totally into kids and family, but totally down on the idea of ever getting back into dating.",
        "It's not like I can fix myself and be done.",
        "If you lose the weight, you're still stuck with the stretch marks, the extra skin, the toll that you've taken on your body already.",
        "And I'm probably still not going to be excited about getting naked with somebody."
