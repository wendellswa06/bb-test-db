        "In order to be elected as president, of course, he reached out to a much larger base than just the supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood from which he hails.",

        "And he did that by supporting repressive laws that were being discussed to pass.",

        "He was only looking out to that small base of the Muslim Brotherhood.",

        "Well, at this stage, there's been a promise of a new technocratic government, of early elections and that, you know, there's no date set for any of that.",
        "And it's really important to note that the winners of what's been happening the last few days are not necessarily the Egyptian people, certainly not the youth that led to this groundswell that went out and actually were able to topple a sitting president.",
        "The winners are, in one sense, the deposed president, who's now being portrayed as a martyr.",
        "I mean, he's a winner on one side and the other side is the military, which all their sins of the past - you know, the violence against other protesters in the past - you know, they get a clean slate for that.",
