        "But here's why the findings already raise red flags.",
        "The researchers found that almost 6 percent of the soldiers in those classes reported they had been struck in the head.",
        "And they were suffering symptoms that the Pentagon says signal mild traumatic brain injuries.",
        "The soldiers were confused, disoriented; and they were nauseous.",

        "He didn't work on this new study on concussions, but we told him the findings.",
        "And Dromerick says they raise a troubling scenario.",
        "Say, a soldier gets a mild traumatic brain injury in combatives class here in the United States Then he or she goes to Iraq or Afghanistan, and they get another concussion in an explosion.",
        "Just like those football quarterbacks seem to get more and more vulnerable, as they get more and more concussions - they get slower, they're more likely to get tackled - the same thing can happen in the military situation; where a person's response times are slowed, their reasoning may not be as good.",
        "So they are just more vulnerable to add on injuries.",
        "Dromerick says remember, more than a million civilians in the U.S.",
        "get concussions every year, doing things like riding bicycles or playing soccer.",
        "And most of them appear to recover.",
        "He says on the other hand, some don't recover.",
        "So if soldiers go to war after they've suffered concussions in training, and they don't realize they have cognitive damage, they could put their whole unit at risk.",
        "If there's a soldier - a war fighter - on the battlefield, members of their unit need to be able to count on them accomplishing the role that they have in that particular unit.",
