        "TransCanada originally proposed running the XL pipeline through the Sandhills of northern Nebraska.",
        "It's one of the most delicate ecosystems in the country, right above the massive Ogallala aquifer.",
        "And that's where TransCanada ran into a ragtag coalition of environmentalists, cattle ranchers, Republicans and Democrats who stood in the way.",
        "Test, one, two, three, four five.",
        "Producer Brent Baughman and I traveled to Oklahoma and to Nebraska last week to find out more.",
        "Our first stop was to the office of the governor, Dave Heineman, a Republican.",
        "And where do you recommend we eat in Nebraska?",
        "You should go to a steak house.",
        "Beef.",
        "Beef.",
        "It's what's for dinner.",
        "I had beef for lunch.",

        "Nebraska is the third largest cattle state in the country.",
        "And a few years ago, it was small-scale cattle ranchers who began to raise concerns over the route of Keystone XL.",
        "Now, all pipelines, even the most advanced like TransCanada's, eventually leak.",
        "And cattle ranchers fear that a leak along the Keystone XL pipeline could devastate the Ogallala aquifer.",
        "It's one of the largest aquifers in America and a primary water source for farmers and ranchers in seven states who raise cattle, wheat and corn.",
        "Governor Heineman sided with the ranchers in the Sandhills.",
        "So last August, he wrote a letter to President Obama, asking him to deny TransCanada a permit to build Keystone XL.",
        "When I wrote that letter, we were trying to get their attention to say, look, we don't want it to go through the Sandhills.",
        "And probably, the only option at that time was to deny the permit if we had to go that far.",
        "Heineman now says President Obama should have approved the pipeline, but conditionally.",
        "The condition that it wouldn't run through the Sandhills.",
        "When you've got an 8.3 percent unemployment rate in America, and we're trying to have energy independence, to me, this was a no-brainer.",
        "We should have moved forward with the project.",
        "And all he has to do is decide, is it in the national interest or not?",
        "Now, supporters of the pipeline argue more oil from Canada means the U.S.",
        "would rely less on oil from places like Venezuela and Saudi Arabia.",
        "And TransCanada says the pipeline will create 20,000 direct jobs and thousands more related ones.",
        "Those figures are disputed by opponents.",
        "We'll talk more about that tomorrow.",
        "But what the company didn't expect was a man named Randy Thompson, now the most famous rancher in Nebraska.",
        "Welcome to Nebraska.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Thank you.",
        "We're glad to be here."

        "That's one to be butchered.",
        "Four years ago, Thompson was contacted by an agency representing TransCanada.",
        "I just got a call one day on a clear blue sky.",
        "And that call?",
        "He just said, well, there's a pipeline proposed and it would possibly come across your land and wondering if we could have permission to come on and do some surveying.",
        "TransCanada wanted Thompson and all affected landowners to sign over the rights to part of their land in order to build the pipeline.",
        "Randy Thompson was offered $9,000.",
        "But he wasn't interested, so the company started to get aggressive.",
        "And in 2010, TransCanada sent a letter to his mother who co-owned that land with him.",
        "At the time, my mom was 92 years old and she got this letter, you know, that says: You are, by now, aware that TransCanada Keystone pipeline is constructing and will operate on 1,833-mile crude oil pipeline.",
        "The letter goes on to read that if he refused to cooperate...",
        "Keystone will use eminent domain to acquire the easement."

        "The letter suggests the pipeline project had been approved.",
        "Thompson was stunned that a foreign company could potentially take over his land.",
        "But TransCanada official Robert Jones says the company was simply following normal procedure.",
        "The Keystone pipeline system was under construction in 2010.",
        "We were absolutely considering the precedent in the past, anticipating a presidential permit shortly.",
        "What bothered Thompson and other cattle ranchers in Nebraska was the tone of the letter.",
        "He felt it was unnecessarily aggressive.",
        "But, in fact, similar letters sent to other landowners had the opposite effect.",
        "I had a neighbor told me, said, these guys are way too big.",
        "He said, there's no need to fight them.",

        "Inside the cockpit, two surveyors working on behalf of TransCanada.",
        "The chopper terrified Luebbe's cattle and caused a stampede that sent them into a barbed-wire fence, leaving some of the cows bloodied.",

        "And they saw that?",

        "And like Randy Thompson, she got hooked up with a liberal group called Bold Nebraska, a group that made it its mission to stop the Keystone XL pipeline.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So essentially, this is Bold Nebraska's office.",
        "From the upper floor of a small building in downtown Lincoln, Jane Kleeb heads up Bold Nebraska.",
        "And for some of us, you know, early on, maybe it was we were opposed to it to the Sandhills and the aquifer.",
        "But as we've seen TransCanada's behavior to landowners, we don't trust them.",
        "For now, Randy Thompson, Sue Luebbe and other opponents of Keystone XL have won.",
        "TransCanada now says it will submit a new proposal to the U.S.",
