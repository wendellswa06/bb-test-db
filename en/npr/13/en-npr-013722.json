        "Before we move on to that central issue, and there are others to talk about as we'll be previewing this week's activities, just getting back to this case, again, both sides in this dispute seem to say, look, we want the court to settle this now.",

        "You know, the Obama administration and the states, as you said, have a common view on this, which is there's a lot planning required for the new health care law, and the administration wanted to clear up the constitutional questions and go ahead with regulations and planning.",
        "And the state officials said the same thing, that we really need an answer in 2012 on the constitutionality before we go ahead with all the planning.",
        "So both sides had a stake in saying, you, Supreme Court, go ahead decide the question.",
        "But there's also a legal question that all judges have to consider, which is if the law says you as a judge shouldn't decide a question, you don't have the jurisdiction or the authority to decide it, they have to actually consider that first, even if nobody wants to raise the issue.",
        "So some judges in the lower courts actually threw out a challenge based on the Anti-Injunction Act.",

        "And even if the law may not say it's a tax, it sure looks like a tax.",

        "And they say this law went too far because, as Paul Clement likes to say, the healthy 30-year-old guy who's sitting in his living room, the government's reaching into his living room and saying you must buy a product that you don't want.",
        "And they say the Constitution doesn't allow that.",
        "The administration's argument is essentially since the 1930s, the Supreme Court has said that the Congress has very broad power to regulate anything that is commercial and economic.",
        "The last time the Supreme Court struck down a major federal regulatory law on the grounds that Congress didn't have the power to pass it was in 1936.",
        "So there's a lot of law that says anything that's commercial and economic, Congress can regulate it, and their argument is Congress was trying to regulate the national market in health insurance.",
        "And the only way to do that - and ensure that anybody could get coverage, even if they had a pre-existing condition - the only way to do that was to require that everyone participate, because if it were otherwise, I could say or you could say or anybody could say, well, I'm healthy, I'm not going to buy insurance.",

        "Even with my pre – and insurance can't work that way.",
        "And it can't work that way.",
        "Nevertheless, that doesn't mean the Constitution works that way.",
        "Well, that would be the decision that says - I mean, it is possible that the five justices might say you can regulate commerce, but we've never allowed the government to force somebody to buy a product.",
        "I think that's unlikely, possible but unlikely.",
        "I just think that there's an awful lot of law on the books that says Congress has very broad power once it's at commercial market.",
