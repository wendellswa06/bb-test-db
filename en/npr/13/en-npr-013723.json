        "Press reports, and studies, suggested the thousands of soldiers who suffered concussions had trouble thinking and using judgment and remembering.",
        "And Army researchers wanted to develop a reliable test that can diagnose these injuries.",
        "So last summer, they went to Fort Hood and a few other bases, to try to find soldiers who had concussions so they could try out different tests.",

        "Harvey Watson says, just watch soldiers doing the punch and clench drill, and you'll see why some soldiers get concussions.",
        "The punch and clench drill is one of the basic training sessions, if you will, in early combatives training.",
        "Watson is a psychologist and a retired colonel.",
        "He's doing field research for this Army study.",
        "He says when you start the punch and clench drill, two soldiers face each other on a mat.",
        "One wears a pair of boxing gloves.",
        "And the other has no gloves, but has to defend him or herself against the person that punches.",
        "The defender is supposed to learn how to pin the attacker's arms - or clench them - before the attacker can hurt him.",
        "But Watson says when the trainer shouts, \"\"Begin!\"\" some students get pummeled."
