        "…the volume of firing that occurred by different officers, do you think the NYPD made the right move?",
        "Well, it's difficult to say at this early juncture in terms of where were the officers positioned.",
        "My understanding is that a total of five officers fired 20 rounds, and so that would be four apiece.",
        "Or, it might be that one officer fired a number, you know, large number of rounds and the other four officers just fired, you know, one or perhaps two.",
        "It's difficult to say at this early juncture whether any particular officer's decision was correct.",
        "And that's an important point for people to remember is that each individual officer is going to be held accountable for his or her conduct regarding pulling the trigger.",
        "What about what is sometimes called suicide-by-cop…",
        "Right.",
        "…when an individual taunts officers or asks for them to shoot him - in this case, there was some indication that the young man who was shot and killed asks officers to shoot him - how can officers deal with a situation like that where the person in question may not be making rational judgments or may, in fact, at the moment, seem to want to be harmed?",
        "Unfortunately, sometimes police officers have no options.",
        "Sometimes, in suicidal situations dealing with suicidal suspects, police officers can slow things down, get the appropriate negotiators there, get an appropriate negotiation's protocol set up, have less-lethal munitions, use them to try to knock the person down.",
        "This is provided that they don't have a firearm, by the way.",
        "Police officers cannot be expected to use less-lethal weapon where he gets an individual who is presenting a firearm or who they believe is presenting a firearm, because that puts them at a disadvantage to the point where they may have to forfeit their life to try to save the life of the individual who's going through this mental health crisis.",
        "And nobody can reasonably expect the police to do that.",
        "However, if the police can slow things down, if they can get appropriate assets on site, they might be able to talk the person down or use some other tactic.",
        "And, in fact, oftentimes, that's the case.",
        "Another thing people have to understand is, unfortunately, sometimes people who are suicidal will actually commit homicide or attempt to commit homicide in order to get the police to shoot them.",
        "There have been cases around the country where people have tried to get police to shoot them.",
        "The police haven't shot.",
        "And then what they end up doing is they actually shoot somebody and figure, well, if I start shooting people, then the police are going to have to shoot me.",
        "And so suicide-by-cop, you know, is a very real phenomenon and is a very tough one for the police to deal with."

        "And another thing that's tough for police to deal with when it comes to suicidal individuals, is police officers don't sign up to shoot people who are emotionally disturbed.",
        "They sign up to protect the society.",
        "And they believe if they're going to use deadly force, it's going to be against the bad guy - a bank robber, a murderer, something like that.",
        "And when they shoot somebody who is mentally disturbed, this is something that is very, very difficult in officers.",
        "And you mentioned my book at the outset, there are several stories in there of police officers shooting suicidal individuals, and it took quite a toll on them.",
        "Is race a factor when it comes to the shootings, either in terms of misunderstandings between the officers and the person who they're confronting or any number of factors just race play into it?",
        "Unidentified Man #5 (Actor): (As character) Just chill, bro.",
        "It is possible than in given shootings that race may be a factor.",
        "But when we look around the country, that the vast, vast majority of police shootings that do go down, race doesn't appear to be a determining factor.",
        "One of the points of evidence for this is that when you put black police officers in high-crime areas that unfortunately tend to also have high numbers of minorities in the population, they are no less likely to shoot than our white officers getting the sorts of assignments that police officers have to work, which suggests quite strongly then that it is the circumstances that officers face rather than their race that is determining factor about deciding to pull the trigger in any given circumstance.",
        "Knowing what you do now about the big picture, if you were able to go back in time to that moment where you were confronted with a suspect stabbing your partner, would you do anything differently?",
        "The only thing I would do quite honestly is I would have shot him sooner.",
        "I tried to take the knife away.",
        "I wasn't able to take the knife away, and during that time, believe it or not, he actually stabbed me on my duty belt or actually on an ammo pouch I had on my duty belt.",
        "And so, you know, I gave him a chance, I tried to take the knife away and he repaid me by trying to murder me.",
        "And if I would have shot him sooner, that never would have happened and it would have ended the situation sooner, and I would have protected my partner, his name was Dennis(ph) - I would have protected Dennis' life a little bit sooner.",

        "Well, back in 2008, the FAA instituted a new set of regulations for a new category of aircraft.",
        "They used to be registered as ultralights, and now they are registered as sports light aircraft.",
        "And there are a bunch of rules with them, and one of the regulations is that you cannot fly a sports light aircraft for hire.",
        "And, of course, we have three pilots that do this.",
        "We have maintained that our pilots are paid for a long list of activities and volunteer their time for flying, but...",
        "This is open to debate.",
        "It's open debate.",
        "All regulations are open to interpretation, and so that's where we are.",
        "FAA has not grounded us, though.",

        "We don't want to fly in violation of the rules.",
        "We want to be good citizens if we can, but we're working now with the FAA to hopefully get a waiver for this regulation.",
        "Of course it wasn't written to curtail wildlife re-introduction.",
        "It was written for other purposes, but the rule stands, and, in fact, that's probably why the waiver option is available."

        "Let us get back, though, to the larger issue of this migration route and the, well, just remarkable process that you folks use to imprint the birds with the idea that they should follow an ultralight aircraft.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's a convoluted project.",
        "It started way back in 1988 when Bill Lishman was the first person to ever fly with birds, and then I joined him in 1993 when we came back with the first migration of Canada geese to see if it was possible, and it's evolved now to help re-introduce an endangered species.",
        "The problem, of course, is that, back in the 1940s, there were only 15 whooping cranes.",
        "That's all that existed in the world.",
        "They migrated from Northern Canada all the way down to Texas.",
        "And, of course, in Texas there's continued development pressure, and the spill that happened in the Gulf could threaten their habitat.",
        "So that's a very precarious situation even though the flock now has grown to - I think the last count was 278 birds.",
        "So we're trying to establish a separate flock that's not subject to the same threats, independent one migrating from Wisconsin to Florida.",
        "But the problem is whooping cranes learn a migration route by following their parents.",
        "It's passed from one generation to the next, and the last birds in the Eastern flyway were wiped out in the 1800s.",
        "So that migration route is also lost.",
        "It was lost until we discovered this method of actually using ultralight aircraft to teach them.",
        "And the method depends on the bird's instinct to imprint on the first creature it sees when it's born.",
        "We believe there's a very compelling case that Google is abusing its dominant position in search to stifle competition and to extend its control over how information and commerce flows over the Internet.",
        "Basically, yeah.",
        "Whooping cranes are hatched in the nest, in a marsh on the ground, basically, and they leave the nest almost immediately and follow their parents out to forage for food.",
        "And if they don't follow their parents, they're lost.",
        "So that natural instinct to imprint is there, and we just substitute parent for pilot and make sure they imprint on us."

        "And the pilot, in this case, wears what I've heard described as a baggy bird suit.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Basically, we're trying to make sure these birds aren't familiar with humans.",
        "You know, a whooping crane is 5 feet tall and has a sharp beak and will defend itself if it feels threatened.",
        "So if you were to raise the birds just in normally dressed humans, talking in front of them, they would - when they're released into the wild, they would think humans is where the food comes from, so they would land next to them.",
        "So we isolate them.",
        "They don't - they - by the time our birds arrive in Florida, they will never - have never seen a normally dressed person.",
        "They would have never been close to a car or tractor, or they will - never heard a human voice.",
        "So once they're released, those things are unfamiliar with them and they are afraid of them, and they are actually wild birds.",
        "So how do you - and you have been in that bird suit - how do you act around the birds?",
        "Well, basically, you - the bag - the big baggy costume covers us head to toe.",

        "If you would just stop talking and listen for a while, you are allowed into their social structure, and we're just part of that structure.",
        "And I'm told that indeed that player, the MP3 player, yes, it's got whooping crane calls on it so they learn to hear those, but it's also mixed in there is the sound of the engine so they'd learn to like that too.",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "When the chick first starts to hatch, when they punch a whole in the egg, it's called pipping, and it can take a number of hours, thereafter, to finally hatch.",
        "And that's when the parents starts communicating with the chicks.",
        "So we play a recording of an adult bird call, and that's what called a brood call.",
        "And, basically, it means, you know, I'm OK.",
        "Everything is all right.",
        "We're here.",
        "And it's calming for the bird.",
        "And we also play a recording of the aircraft engine to get them used to it, so that they're familiar with that sound.",
        "It's not something that frightens them.",
        "When they're about, maybe, a week or so old, we actually introduce the real aircraft and they get familiar with the shape and the sight and the sound of that.",
        "And then a little later on, we use what's called a circle pen.",
        "We have a pen that's about 30 feet in diameter, 2 feet high.",
        "We put the chick on the inside, the aircraft on the outside.",
        "Then we taxi around the perimeter.",
        "And we use a puppet that looks like an adult, and we can pull a trigger in that puppet and it will dispense mealworms.",
        "So we tap on the ground, the chick comes over to find the food.",
        "We move the aircraft ahead and the chick follows the puppet again, and eventually the chick will be following us.",
        "So it's a long, slow process.",
        "It takes a huge number of hours, seven days a week.",
        "But once the birds are - all this takes place at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland, where they have the largest captive flock of whooping cranes, and that's where the eggs are produced.",
        "When the birds are roughly 40 days of age or 50 days of age, we transport them in containers by private aircraft to Wisconsin.",
        "We spend the entire summer working with them.",
        "That's where they learn to fly and get conditioned to follow our aircraft.",
        "And then in October we start the migration.",
        "It usually takes us about three months to get all the way down to Florida.",
        "We monitor the birds over the winter.",
        "And then in the spring, they make the return migration on their own.",
        "And from then on, they're wild birds.",
        "Each year, we add a new generation, hoping to build the flock up to the point where it'll be self-sustaining."
