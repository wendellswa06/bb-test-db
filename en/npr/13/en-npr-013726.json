        "And therefore, should something terrible happen to that flock in Texas, there will be a backup.",
        "Exactly.",
        "It won't be the end of whooping cranes.",
        "We're talking with Joe Duff, co-founder and CEO of Operation Migration.",
        "If you got questions about the human assistance provided to whooping cranes, to learn their route on migration, give us a call: 800-989-8255.",
        "Email: talk@npr.org.",
        "And we'll start with Zack.",
        "And Zack is on the line from Iowa City.",
        "Hello.",
        "I - this is super fascinating.",
        "I wanted to ask how you choose the route?",
        "And, you know, most migrating birds have to stop and rest, and I wonder how you manage that.",
        "Do you have to find an airstrip near a marsh or near someplace where they can rest?",
        "Or can you land on an airstrip and then somehow take the birds further away?",
        "I wanted to ask about the resting places, but also bring out the topic of the awesome and interesting efforts to save species that are on the brink of extinction.",
        "But to couple that list, habitat restoration because if you save the species but they don't have a place to live, it's kind of a lost cause.",
        "So I'd love to hear your thoughts on that too.",
        "All right.",
        "Zack, thanks very much.",
        "Well, the first question is the migration and how we choose it.",
        "Basically, we're using a historic whooping crane migration.",
        "We know not the exact route, but we know they were in all the states that we pass through.",
        "And the wild whooping cranes are soaring birds.",
        "They may take off in one of those days with lots of fluffy clouds and thermal.",
        "They fly like a hawk or an eagle.",
        "They'll climb up on a warm column of air without expending any energy.",
        "They glide to the next one, and they can cover two or 300 miles that way.",
        "We don't have the capacity to fly that way.",
        "We don't have the fuel range.",
        "We don't have the ability to soar the way they do, so we fly in the very calm air of first thing in the morning.",
        "And as we plow through the air, our aircraft creates a wake in the air much the way a boat would and the birds learn to fly on that wake.",
        "So our lead bird maybe only inches from the wingtip, and they soar along getting a free ride that way.",
        "That can only happen when the air is calm.",
        "As soon as, you know, the winds start to pick up midday, then the wing bounces around too much.",
        "The birds can't follow it.",
        "In order to follow us, they have to move away from the wing.",
        "That means they have to flap fly and they get tired.",
        "So we only get maybe an hour or two the first thing in the morning.",
        "And birds fly around 38 miles an hour, so we can get maybe 50 to 100 miles on a good day.",
        "And at each stopover site, we have most of them around private property.",
        "People know we're coming.",
        "They've opened their homes and their property to us.",
        "We have an area that's isolated where we can put the pen, and we tend them for the rest of the day and then go the next the day if the weather allows.",
        "On average, to cover the 1,285 miles from Wisconsin to Florida, takes us about 25 flying days, but it may take us upwards of 100 days to get those 25 flying days.",
        "So that's the process.",
        "Now, in the way back, of course, they can make it in a much shorter time when they're flying their own, so...",
        "Because bad weather, you can't fly at all."

        "Yes, sir.",
        "The type of aircraft we fly used to be called ultralight aircraft.",
        "And there's a new regulation out, started in 2008 called the light-sport category.",
        "And that's the category our aircraft fit in, and the rules that go along with that category say that you cannot fly an aircraft like that for hire, and you cannot fly an aircraft like that for the furtherance of a business.",
        "And, of course, Operation Migration as a non-profit is a business.",
        "So as we said earlier, the rules are open to interpretation.",
        "We felt that we were compliant with the rules, but the FAA responded to a complaint and they have to investigate, and so they are doing that.",
        "They are working closely with us, hopefully, to issue a waiver exempting us from those rules because of the benefit that it has to the American people.",
        "We're reintroducing an endangered species.",
        "We're promoting conservation of wetland habitat.",

        "Why don't we pause there, Leslie, and let him get an answer to the first two.",
        "OK.",
        "Well, a whooping crane is the tallest bird in North America.",
        "It's about 5 feet tall.",
        "It has a 7 foot wingspan.",
        "If you've seen sandhill cranes - there's two kinds of cranes in North America and we have - coincidentally the most plentiful, which is the sandhill crane and the most endangered, which is the whooping crane.",
        "The sandhill crane is kind of gray all over.",
        "Usually, a whooping crane is pure white.",
        "It has black primary feathers and a red patch on its forehead, so it's a very distinctive-looking bird and what we call the white ghost of the wetlands.",
        "And the - what happened to the original flock?",
        "Well, you know, back in the 1940s, a conservation isn't what it is now, you know?",
        "People didn't realize that, you know, our grandparents and our great grandparents thought that everything out there was theirs for the harvesting.",
        "And we now have a better understanding of conservation and natural resources.",
        "So, you know, back in the 1800s when they discovered that many birds were endangered, a lot of museums sent out trappers to get the last example so they'd have some.",
        "So, it's just the whole concept that conservation has changed now and the, you know, the hunting regulations have come in.",
        "And, in fact, hunters are probably one of the biggest conservationists of all.",
        "The taxes they pay on hunting licenses and ammunition is what funds most of the conservation projects out there.",
        "So it's just a change of attitude, but basically, it was lost of habitat and overhunting before there were regulations, back when, you know, you needed to hunt for food.",
        "Leslie, you have time for one more.",
        "Oh, oh, good.",
        "I was going to ask how did these regulations affect the previous migration, and I guess it's going to - when is this exemption going to be issued by the, you know, the next migration.",
        "And last and just real quickly, I'd like to get some more information for my daughter's class because they're studying environment and ecology and habitat and all that other stuff.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Leslie.",
        "Well, as far that when this is going to happen, we don't know.",
        "The normal process, first, an exemption is 120 days.",
        "We're hoping the FAA will speed that up.",
        "We've got a lot of support out there and people are calling in and asking them to speed the process.",
        "But I think they're working hard.",
        "Hey, I believe they realize that this rule was not written to stop an endangered species re-introduction program, and we're just trying to find a way to word an exemption so...",
