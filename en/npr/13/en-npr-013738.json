        "At the moment, from the contradictory explanations that have been given of the dismissals, and the e-mail that was published last night that still contradicts prior accounts - can you square that simply with a communications problem or innocent mismanagement, or do you suspect people were trying to get away with telling Congress less than Congress wanted to know?",
        "Well, if they were, then people need to be sanctioned for it.",
