        "Well, for thousands of years, the howl of coyotes could only be heard in their original habitat, the American Southwest, where they were held in check by wolves and other predators and viewed by many of their Native American neighbors as a deity.",
        "That changed with the arrival of European-American settlers in the early 1800s.",
        "Coyotes and wolves took the opportunity to expand their diet to livestock.",
        "And for decades, the federal government actively encouraged the extermination of predators.",
        "That policy pushed wolves to the brink of extinction, but the wily coyote managed to thrive and spread pretty much everywhere.",
        "To this day, the government hires hunters to manage coyote populations and protect livestock in many states.",
        "And around 70 years ago, ranchers started to host coyote-hunting competitions.",
        "My grandfather's generation said we need to get rid of the predator, whether we poison it on a ranch or whether we go out and kill it as part of a killing contest.",
        "That's the kind of mentality and culture that we're up against.",

        "Trump reiterated his campaign promises to cut taxes, rollback regulations, repeal Obamacare and renegotiate trade agreements.",
        "In recent days, he's been alternating between these thank you rallies and meetings with his new Cabinet nominees, many of whom are wealthy businesspeople or retired military.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "You know, the media was saying, the people that are negotiating your trade deals are very rich.",
        "I said, but isn't that what we want?",
        "(CHEERING)",
        "And they said, why is it that the people protecting our border are generals?",
        "Because that's what we want.",

        "Trump gloated a bit at the rally about being named Time magazine's Person of the Year, though he said he prefers the old title, Man of the Year.",

        "Mostly traveling out to rural parts of the community, asking people to vote - to register to vote, to participate in various programs, to deal with the business of building organization, to assure folks that we were there to mainly expose ourselves as much as possible to as many people as possible.",
