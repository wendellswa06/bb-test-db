        "The feud between Italy and one of the most prestigious American museums has taken a new turn.",
        "Yesterday, the Getty Museum here in Los Angeles announced it will return 26 antiquities that museum officials believe were removed from Italy illegally.",
        "NPR's Elizabeth Blair reports.",
        "Among the objects the Getty is returning to Italy are an almost 5-foot Roman statue of Apollo and an elaborate marble piece in the shape of two mythological griffins attacking a fallen doe.",
        "In the 26 objects we're returning there are some absolute extraordinary works of art there.",
        "Michael Brand is the director of the Getty Museum.",
        "He says that as a result of meetings with the Italian Ministry of Culture over the past year, the Getty believed the return would lead to a more reciprocal relationship.",
        "But those talks failed.",
        "It was agreed that when the 26 objects went back there would be a number of long term loans in return and also collaboration on a number of projects.",
        "It would seem that that's not going to happen.",
        "But, since we've done our research and we believe those 26 objects should go back - which is why we signed the agreement October the 5th - I believe it's the correct thing to do to send them back.",
        "But there are still more than 20 artifacts the Italians want returned from the Getty, including a limestone statue of a goddess thought to be Aphrodite and a bronze statue of a victorious youth, often referred to as the Getty Bronze.",
        "Michael Brand says they are still researching the origins of the goddess, but that the Italians have no legal claim over the Bronze.",
        "We believe we have clear title.",
        "You know, it's had a long history.",
        "It was found in international waters.",
        "And even during the year, the Italians on a number of occasions admitted to us that they had no legal title, no legal claim to the object.",
        "Earlier this year, two other institutions - Boston's Museum of Fine Arts and the Metropolitan Museum of Art - returned objects to Italy.",
        "In both of those cases, the Italians agreed to future loans and other collaborations.",
        "The Getty hasn't been able to come to a similar accord.",
        "Not helping matters, one of its curators, Marion True, is currently on trial in Rome for trafficking in stolen art.",
        "Maxwell Anderson is head of the Indianapolis Museum of Art and a former president of the Association of Art Museum Directors.",
        "He believes of all the museums with questionable antiquities the Getty has been singled out."

        "I suppose the Getty makes a convenient foil by virtue of its extraordinary wealth and the fact that it has a past - in the 1970s and early ‘80s - of behaving with less than exemplary standards.",
        "But, I think that all changed, ironically, under Marion True's tenure as curator and under John Walsh as director.",
        "Oh, sure.",
        "I remember integrating the public park in Canton and the white man coming over to me and said, boy, I'd like to buy you a Coke.",

        "Years later I was working in Scott County, Mississippi, a neighboring county.",
        "And there were cross burnings, shootings, a lot of violence in the area where I was working because the parents there had chosen to send their kids to the previously all-white schools.",
        "And I called the FBI, which I had no trust or faith in because they did not describe themselves as a law enforcement agency.",
        "And they said, oh, you better come in right away.",
        "And when I arrived in Jackson, I was met in the hall by an agent from Boston who told me that there was a contract out on my life and began to recount for me certain incidences that had occurred very recently that only - that they would have known only if there was a mole or a plant within the clan group in that area.",
        "And - so we knew that there were people who, given the chance, would do violence to us.",

        "Well, to answer the first part, enthusiastically, yes.",

        "It's far from perfect.",
        "Many of the goals are still far from being realized.",
        "But there's no question that the Deep South is much more a part of the United States than it was in the 1960s and before then.",
        "The - to speak of an alliance between communities is perhaps a little much.",
        "It's very complicated.",
        "But there was a coming together in time and place in which the memories and the experience of the Jewish community and the overall concerns about what America should be so closely into line with the goals of the civil rights movement.",
        "And that was a coming together.",
        "There were a lot of factors that changed all this.",
        "Israel became a factor because many African-Americans, particularly the young people's snick felt that Israel was part of the colonialist regime that they were trying to fight.",
        "This was the period in which African countries were finally overcoming colonialism and becoming independent.",
        "There were a number of factors that caused friction not harmony.",
        "And I think that caused a lot of individuals to take lessons out of this that they might not have found on other - in other situations.",
        "But yes, there was a parting, the circumstances of the two communities changed considerably.",
        "But the Jews still celebrate Passover every year.",
        "The basic value system is still intact.",
        "Well, Mr. Bromberg, we're going to have to end it there.",
        "Thank you so much."

        "I mean, that's what this deal was designed to stop and what the deal had stopped.",
