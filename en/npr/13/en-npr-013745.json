        "You think that's likely or unlikely?",
        "No, I don't think Iran is now going to suddenly rush for a nuclear weapons capability.",
        "Actually, Iran probably feels it's in a pretty strong position with the United States isolated, and they wouldn't want to squander that by doing anything that would put the spotlight on them.",
        "So I suspect they'll use the initial period just to try to divide this international coalition that had come together to pressure them in the past.",
        "But look; over time, Iran is unlikely to carry on with all of the constraints that it signed up to, really reversing - dismantling centrifuges, shipping out low-enriched uranium - in exchange for getting nothing, not getting the economic relief that was at the heart of the deal.",
        "So I don't think Iran is going to rush for a nuclear weapons capability, but it will probably start to gradually and slowly expand its capacity as it was doing in pretty much every single year over the past two decades while we had sanctions in place and while we didn't have a deal in place.",
        "And that's what creates that sort of ticking clock towards a weapons capability that the deal froze for a very long time, which is now gone.",
        "There are built-in delays here.",
        "Renewed U.S.",
        "sanctions won't bite for a few months.",
        "Is there some wiggle room, some possibility that negotiations continue and that this is a smart negotiating strategy because it shows that the U.S.",
        "is willing to take a very firm line?",
        "Yeah.",
        "If you believe that even in the absence of international support, somehow just the threat of the U.S.",
        "acting alone will bring the Iranians, you know, to their knees or to reconsider and come back and agree to a better deal, then yes, I think that's a long shot.",
        "You know, speaking as someone who participated in these negotiations, if we thought that it would have been possible to do everything that President Trump would like - constrain Iranian regional behavior, have inspections that could go onto Iranian military bases immediately, include ballistic missiles, have the deal lasts forever - of course that would have been terrific.",
        "But it just wasn't possible.",
        "Our allies wouldn't have supported it, and Iran wouldn't have agreed to it.",
        "And we would have had no deal at all, and that's kind of where we are now.",
        "What might be the impact of today's move on U.S.",
        "credibility?",
        "The U.S.",
        "entered this deal.",
        "The U.S.",
        "has now broken this deal.",
        "Will that be seen as breaking America's word?",
        "Well, it is breaking America's word.",
        "So, you know, that's obviously relevant for the negotiations that are about to take place with North Korea.",
        "And what's also relevant for that - you know, I think the Trump administration would say this shows how tough we are, and now we're going to potentially get a better deal with North Korea.",
        "Do you have a Web site we can look at it?",
        "Sure.",
        "Oh, well, I mean, to look at pictures..."

        "Absolutely.",
        "Look at everybody who may think differently than you and try to learn from them.",

        "Everything factors into why people approach problems and try to solve problems in a certain manner.",
        "And I think the most important thing we can do is view differences of opinion as strengths to be harnessed and not weaknesses to be criticized.",
        "And I look forward very much to working with all my colleagues, Democrat and Republican alike.",
        "And that's, I think, the most important thing, is tone and civility and demeanor and treating everybody with respect and watching the words you use and wanting to learn from people, wanting to work with people from all parts of the country and all walks of life.",
        "You were one of a handful of Republicans, as we said, that went against the party on Thursday and voted for legislation to end the government shutdown.",
        "What were some of the factors in your decision there?",
        "Well, I think it's the most basic job of any elected official, including a member of Congress, is to fund our government.",
        "You know, I can tell you firsthand, Michel.",
        "I lived through the government shutdown of 2013 as an FBI agent.",
        "I was a supervisor.",
        "We had to make incredibly tough decisions on designating essential versus non-essential police.",
        "Support employees that are incredibly important to the ongoing investigative process were furloughed, and it was incredibly disruptive.",
        "I thought it jeopardized our national security.",
        "And I will always vote to fund the government.",
        "And I - you know, as important as these debates are on a lot of critical issues - and they're certainly important - government shutdowns are not the venue where we should be debating and discussing these things.",
        "I think we need to fund our agencies.",
        "We need to make sure that these people, many of whom are living paycheck to paycheck - the air traffic controllers, Customs and Border Protection, Border Patrol, Coast Guard, my colleagues at the FBI - these people have very important jobs to do, and we have to fund them, and we have to support them.",
        "Just to clarify, do you take issue with the border wall itself?",
        "Because a number of your colleagues have gone so far as to call it stupid or just ineffective.",
        "Or is it you just disagree fundamentally with using this tactic to - as a negotiating tool?",
        "Well, No. 1, I don't like the term border wall because I think it conjures up images of a brick and mortar structure across all 800 or so miles of the southern border.",
        "I think that when we talk about securing our border, we need to defer to the experts - CBP, the Coast Guard, the Border Patrol - who will tell you that, depending on the sector of the border, depending on the terrain, different things are needed.",
        "Many stretches require technology like infrared and heat sensors and motion detectors and infrared.",
        "Some stretches require physical barriers which slow down the - you know, the drug runners, the drug cartels, the MS-13 gang members, whoever it may be - and give the Border Patrol additional time to interdict.",
        "But it's really specific to the terrain and the sector.",
        "But, more importantly, Michel, I don't think that any one issue like this should be the cause of a government shutdown because government shutdowns are incredibly costly.",
        "They're incredibly inefficient.",
        "It's not the way to govern.",
        "There's no reason why, and it makes zero sense that in the name of border security we should be defunding CBP, Border Patrol and the Coast Guard, who are the three entities responsible for securing our border."

        "Yeah.",

        "And if what they're reading in this is that President Trump isn't even prepared to accept a deal that prevents a nuclear weapon and wants more from what we got out of the Iran deal, I think Kim Jong Un must be wondering if there's really any realistic prospect of dealing successfully with this administration.",
        "May I circle back to where we began, which is your just personal take on this?",

        "This would all be good for the United States.",
        "But it's highly unlikely to happen.",

        "But by withdrawing from the deal today, he actually sunset the entire agreement immediately.",
