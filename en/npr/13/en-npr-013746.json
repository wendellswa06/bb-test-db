        "It's a pleasure to be here, Ira.",
        "Tell us about your flash of genius.",
        "Well, you explained it pretty well.",
        "I'd like to be able to say that, well, I was deriving some equations and I figured out some theorem that would tell me how to do this.",
        "But no, it was my toy that I experienced as a child that really was the basis of a discovery, not something that we use to spin the discovery afterwards.",
        "Tell us what happened, where you were, how you said, boom, that's an Etch-A-Sketch.",
        "Well, even that was kind of circuitous.",
        "I was actually going to a conference that was at the same time as the World Cup in Germany, and there was about a two-week gap between the end of the conference and the final of the World Cup.",
        "My brother had gotten me, for about four birthday presents combined, a ticket to the final, and I had to spend about two weeks in Germany, basically, and justify my existence there, so I visited a lot of labs.",
        "And one of them was my then-to-be future collaborator Jochen Mannhart, and he was describing to me some of the really astounding results that they had discovered, where you take two materials that are normally insulating - one rather thick and the other one exceedingly thin - putting them together and they were able to make the interface, the reach in between those two materials, switch between a metal and an insulator.",
        "So, they could make it either conduct electricity or be a good insulator.",
        "And that was - when I heard about that, that's instantly when I began to think about the Etch-A-Sketch.",
        "And so, well, that began our collaboration, which, you know, ended up in this phone call.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And so, take us further on that idea.",
        "You have this sandwich and how would you sketch it?",
        "What would you do with that?",
        "Right.",
        "So, the - well, the way that the Etch-A-Sketch works is - literally, the analogy works well.",
        "It's actually - there's a fine powder of aluminum encased in a - with a top glass surface.",
        "And the idea is that you - that the aluminum naturally sticks to the surface, and it's - it looks grayish, and then when you scrape it with a sharp probe, it looks clear or darker.",
        "And so, the same thing is happening in our system, we have a very sharp metal probe that's basically part of an atomic-force microscope, and we move across the top surface of this material, and we apply voltage to this, which is either positive or negative.",
        "And as you said, if it's positive, we end up making a wire at the interface, so below the surface by about 1.2 nanometers.",
        "And then if we reverse the sign of the voltage, we can erase it.",
        "So, what was really surprising was how small of structures that we were able to make.",
        "So, you could actually physically, like the Etch-A-Sketch, you can move the probe back and forth and make a line, a conducting line, like, a conducting wire out of it?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Let's - if someone else has created this, I would like to see it.",
        "But the builder and inventor behind this - behind Poop and Paddle is Adam Katzman.",
        "And it's a boat that's also a toilet.",
        "It's mostly a toilet, sort of like a floating outhouse.",
        "But because it's a boat, there's no sewage pipes coming out of the outhouse, right?",
        "So you need to do something with that waste.",
        "And what he's built is this constructed wetlands that sort of encircles or fences in the outhouse, and then it's all on the water.",
        "And there are oars.",
        "And it's neat."

        "And the way it works is that gravity - it's a gravity-fed system, and so the waste goes out of this marine toilet.",

        "He read books.",
