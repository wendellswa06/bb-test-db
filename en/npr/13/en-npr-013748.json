        "Talking about nanotechnology with Jeremy Levy on Talk of the Nation: Science Friday from NPR News.",
        "You know, you talk about an electronic probe, a microscope, for some of the folks - Bunny on tweet - our Twitters are coming in and saying, you know, it sounds what you're doing more like a plotter, you know?",
        "You draw an architecture, and its goes out and plots, you know, a whole big design on the surface.",
        "It's very much like that, of course, but smaller.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And yeah.",
        "So, basically, we can use, actually, the same kinds of plotting packages that are used for much bigger circuits, but we use them with our microscope.",
        "And can you - and you can make - can you make a circuit like that by just plotting it?",
        "Yes, and that's literally what we do.",
        "And when we made the transistor, we sort of consciously tried to make something that was as simple as possible, three lines.",
        "It's hard to imagine something that's simpler than that and yet acts as a transistor.",
        "Is this very expensive, this stuff?",
        "Very expensive?",
        "Well...",
        "To make?",
        "The - I mean, the costs are - it's hard to compare it, for example, with a chip that is the result of 50 years of technological innovation."

        "Right.",
        "But let's say, the substrates, the - that - so, the sort of big part of the material that (unintelligible) is - can be actually pretty expensive, but it may be possible to grow those materials on silicon.",
        "So, actually, one of the things that we may be trying to do research on in the future is to see whether we can integrate this capability, these oxide hetero structures on silicon and put them on big silicon wafers, and that would make them a lot more cost-effective.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So, you'd create sort of as hybrid?",
        "Exactly.",
        "Yeah.",
        "As you say, one of the big challenges is you have this tiny thing, how do you put the leads on it to get the stuff in and out?",

        "And so I'll certainly be pleasantly surprised if it's evident that there's a lot more police and troops on the streets, but you know, in order for them to do that, they're going to have to take them from somewhere else, and I don't know how they're going to quite pull that off.",
        "You've been writing recently about the Iraqi security forces and the various problems, infiltrations by militias and questions of trust of these forces.",
        "In your view are they ready for an operation like this?",
        "It depends on what you ask them to do.",
        "What we've seen here in the past several months is you have the police department, which in Iraq is 130,000 now, I think, they're approaching - police and what they call special police, which are kind of paramilitary guys.",
        "That's mostly a Shiite force.",
        "Over the past six, eight months, really over the past year, there's been a lot of really hardcore operations by these guys in which it's pretty clear a lot of civilians, Sunni civilians, predominantly in Sunni neighborhoods, have been killed, kidnapped, tortured, disappeared, put in jails that nobody knows about and forgotten about.",
        "That they can do.",
        "I mean I think the question is, is whether they can do it in a disciplined way and in a precise way, where they don't end up alienating, you know, half the population."
