        "He was very, very certain of his rightness in everything.",
        "He did away with long, rambling conferences where all the justices would debate and discuss their opinions and turn them into these very sort of streamlined affairs, because he just felt very confident that nobody's debating would change anyone's mind.",

        "I mean, when he started out as--people used to call him the Lone Ranger, and he was the lone dissenter in this very liberal court.",
        "And if you look at the sort of arc of his career, things that he was advocating then are now sort of the law of the land, primarily the notion of states' rights, that states have dignity and that the federal government can't trammel them; the notion that states can be immune from suit from their own citizens; the notion that the Constitution needs to be construed strictly, read the way the framers intended it, doing away with a lot of what he saw as the sort of civil rights excesses from the Warren court.",
        "All of those things that we now see in our legal landscape are really the thumbprint of William H.",

        "Rehnquist was much more of the view that judges are, you know, essentially very wise.",
        "And, in fact, as you say, over and over again in his career, he made rulings that kind of conflicted with what you would expect him to have thought, only because, in the end, what he was constantly gunning for was the primacy of the Supreme Court.",

        "You know, history will decide that far better than I could.",
        "But I think in terms of someone who had an absolute unquestionable influence on the court, there's no doubt in my mind that he is up there with some of the great ones in history--Warren and Marshall--in terms of taking a court that was one thing and steering it inexorably in a completely different direction, and doing that always with an eye toward history and an eye toward the sort of larger role of court in the view of the public and in the view of government.",
