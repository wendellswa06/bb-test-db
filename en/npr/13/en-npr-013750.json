        "At least this morning.",
        "We'll see how long it lasts.",
        "But you know, yesterday was a really crazy day.",
        "The day before was pretty bad too; markets falling, markets rising, lots of volatility.",
        "It's all rooted - it's not that all these people know something that you and I don't happen to know.",
        "It's that nobody knows what's going on.",
        "We know that there's a problem, that certain banks have a problem with subprime mortgages, that they invested too heavily in all these mortgages to Americans with bad credit, and that a lot of those mortgages are defaulting and so these banks are seeing some of their assets freeze.",
        "That's not the problem.",
        "The problem is we don't know how many other banks, how many other companies, how many other hedge funds and pension funds are also invested.",
        "So there's sort of this ticking time bomb mysterious thing out there.",
        "And investors hate mystery like that.",
        "They don't like having no idea how to assess the risks of the markets.",
        "So they respond very rapidly to lots of little rumors and just gut panicky feelings.",
        "So some reassurance seems to help quell that fear.",
        "Well, does this mean, Adam, then the Fed won't cut the other rate - its benchmark rate, the Federal funds rate?",
        "Pretty much everyone today was writing about it saying, no, they're definitely going to have to cut that benchmark rate, that key rate that we think of, you know, the rate that our credit cards are tied into, the adjustable mortgages are tied into, the rate that really changes all of our lives.",
        "The Fed doesn't want to.",
        "There's a lot of risk in doing that.",
        "In fact, there is an argument that a lot of people are saying that the whole crisis right now is caused by the fact that Alan Greenspan back in 1998, when there was a very similar financial crisis, lowered interest rates and created this feeling among investors that, hey, no matter how bad things get, the Fed's always going to come in and bail us out, they'll always save the day, and that that created an environment that encouraged banks and others to lend these subprime mortgages, to lend to people who they probably shouldn't have been lending to.",
        "So there's a fear that if the Fed does that again now, which frankly, they probably will, it'll short term be a benefit, but long term could just reinforce some really bad behavior.",
        "Okay.",
        "What I don't understand is that - you mentioned this earlier, this all started because of high credit risk, Americans beginning to default on their subprime loans.",
        "How does that spread into a crisis around the world?",
        "Well, here's what we don't know.",
        "We don't know if the subprime mortgage problem in the U.S.",
        "is a symptom or a cause.",
        "But either way, what we - it seems that credit is shrinking from world markets.",
        "Meaning anybody anywhere in the world who needs money is having a harder time getting money.",
        "So that means more companies are going to go bankrupt, even entire countries could start defaulting.",
        "It's a scary situation.",
        "Okay.",
        "We will be following it here at NPR.",

        "There's a new study by the Education Department that reported on Friday that children in public schools generally performed as well or better in reading and math than comparable children in private schools.",
        "And the only exception was in 8th grade reading where the private school counterparts fared better.",
        "So, Jeff, I guess I'll start with you.",
        "Are you surprised by these findings?",
        "Well, I'm absolutely not surprised.",
        "It just makes me reflect back to a couple of weeks ago when I was invited out to several private schools to lecture on the nature of my writing and the plays that I've written and how they can become involved in those things.",
        "And I just kind of had to giggle to myself.",
        "And I said here's a public school kid from south Nashville who's being brought to teach these private school kids.",
        "So I've always known that public education is comparable, in some cases better, than private school education, because it depends on the teachers and focus that's there.",
        "I think this report is going to shed some new light on people's perceptions out there, especially on the conservative right, that private schools are much better for our children."

        "He emphasized the caveat, an overall comparison of the two types of schools is of modest utility.",
        "We're not just for public schools or private schools, we're for good schools.",

        "Well, the whole thing is politicized.",
        "First of all, I'm sure the Education Department was blindsided by this report coming from the National Center for Education Statistics, which I know very well from when I used to run federal education programs in some time past.",
        "They are a bunch of statisticians and researchers who are career people and this put this together.",
        "And I think the department probably hoped it was going to come out and show that private schools are better, because that's their policy agenda.",
        "And then when it didn't show that, they decided to bury it and send it out on trash day in the press so nobody would notice but.",
        "But it got noticed.",
        "We got to get Jeff back in here, because what you said...",
        "But I need to chime in on that.",
        "Also, contrary to what Jeff said, I think that conservatives who believe in Christian schools and who believe in fundamentalist schools and all that, whether or not the schools are any good, they still will be saying that they're good because, you know, the parents choose them and this is what we want.",
        "Also, there are many, many, many public schools that are very good.",
        "There are many that are crappy and we know where they are.",
        "Usually poor kids and kids of color who are poor are the ones who end up - and poor whites - go to them.",
        "So that I think public schools are as good or better, we all know this, than private schools if you put them all together en masse.",
        "But in general, schools are not doing what they should be doing for the people who need the help the most, whether they're private or public.",

        "A study also came out about a month or two ago showing that of these students who graduated from CPS, only 22 percent are going to go on and earn a college degree in at least six years.",

        "So is it more a question of pedagogy?",
        "Is it more a question of maybe you we're teaching totally the wrong things?",
        "Maybe the curriculum we have is dating back a century and we need to totally change what we do and give kids skills like financial literacy and computer literacy.",

        "It's having to get rid of them.",

        "Teaching is not, from my perspective, a profession at all.",
        "Teaching is a calling.",
        "You want people who are called to work with your kids, and that's where the argument comes in.",
        "Because you have people who seek certification and they say certification teaches you how to work with kids and it teaches you how to manage classes and how to do lesson planning and that kind of thing.",
        "But in reality, there's some people who spend time out in the real world who decide that they now feel called to teach and they want to help educate kids.",
        "And they have to get into a special program to help them transition to that.",
