        "I wanted to throw back to another point Dr. Berry made.",
        "When I was in Montgomery, Alabama working for a while, in almost every neighborhood I saw private schools all over the place.",
        "And I asked one of the local leaders what that was all about and he said, well, you realize after integration these schools just popped up everywhere.",
        "Here in the South, we're seeing an increase in the call for charter, private, and even home-schools especially.",
        "Let's be real here, because without even in the case of the study statistics that back it up, what's the real impetus for the push for alternative education these days?",
        "People want their kids to go to school with and around people who share their values, act, look like them, or live with them.",
        "And we're growing away from pluralism in American education and closer toward at least some form of chosen segregation.",
        "I think the teacher certification issue puts it on the forefront.",
        "Why do you want to go and work in an inner city school, even if you're called to teach, if you have a private school that's offering six times what you're getting paid and a plush environment with a small classroom size?",
        "These are issues that are going to continue to pop up, and it's going to be a challenge to overcome.",
        "All right.",
        "Farai, let me tell you something about the certified teachers on this issue.",
        "In Illinois, The Education Trust came out with a survey showing that in the poor school districts where they're teaching minority students, that's where the certified - that's where you have the teachers with less experience or these uncertified teachers.",
        "And they documented that it was the teachers with more experience who were going to suburban school districts.",
        "And so basically, in essence, bad teachers coming to poor school districts and better teachers going to suburban school districts.",
        "And the question that's been put to those leaders is, okay, what are you going to do about it?",
        "Our kids are getting what has been described as the worst teachers.",
        "This is not denigrating teachers across the board, but it's based upon experience.",
        "It's based upon the ability to teach.",
        "And so you have people that are trying to pay, trying to offer bonuses, they're trying to do signing bonuses, they're trying all kinds of ways to entice people, and so you're having bidding wars.",
        "And I'm telling you right now, the school district with high property taxes are going to always win bidding wars.",
        "It's as simple as that.",
        "And so even if you base it upon money, you're still going to have the inequity.",
        "Well, you know, I - I mean, you talk about teaching is a calling, and I have to say that my own mother, she turned down more money to go teach in the county because she wanted to teach in our own neighborhood school.",
        "But we only have four and a half minutes left, and I want to transition to - because we could go on about this.",
        "I love the topic of education, and all of you are so well-versed, but...",
        "Oh, we'll do it again, maybe, huh?",
        "Yes.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Well this is actually something that connects, the Voting Rights Act.",
        "Because, of course, voting statistics are linked to education statistics.",
        "The more educated you are, the more likely you are to vote.",
        "So we have the Voting Rights Act that was reauthorized last week.",
        "No, no, no, Farai, that's a - if I may jump in here."

        "And so, again, black leadership is having to lead this fight and carry this battle in the House, in the Senate, to force the president to sign it, and again, Hispanic Latinos have been sitting on the sidelines operating as freeloaders doing nothing, or not enough to make sure this gets passed.",
