        "Well, give me an example of what was over the top?",
        "Well, a couple of them.",
        "First of all, there's a scene in the movie where we see a series of headlights of various numbers of trucks that are driving up a hill, then as you get to the top of the hill, it's almost a scene out of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.",
        "And at that point, you see these dump trucks pulling up to this football sized hole of about 35 feet in depth, dumping bodies out of the back of a dump truck.",
        "And these are human bodies, of course.",
        "And then you see a bulldozer in there basically putting dirt over the top of them.",
        "That would never happen like that.",
        "Even though we will have issues around mortuary science aspects and corpse management, none of us anticipate that.",
        "That's enough, I think, to turn people over to think, Oh, my God.",
        "How bad this could be.",
        "One other scene is at the very end of the movie where there's now this anticipated second wave of the pandemic.",
        "In this case, it's occurring in Angola, Africa and you see the CDC personnel coming on-site, and by the time the picture turns around through a hut and then into the village itself, you see these hundreds of bodies lying there on the ground, blood covered as if they all died, leaving people at the very end of the movie with the sense that the second wave was going to wipe out humankind.",
        "Neither of those are true or even possible.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But the movie scenario itself, which is - let me give a brief synopsis.",
        "An American businessman is infected in Hong Kong, and after a drink at the airport bar, he flies back to Richmond, Virginia.",
        "Makes it to his son's little league game before he starts exhibiting any symptoms and that's - and that's - by then he's spread the virus in all of those places.",
        "Realistic scenario?",
        "That's realistic in the sense that, as we know with influenza, one is infectious for up to a day before you actually have symptoms.",
        "The part about how much the transmission would have occurred at the bar from the napkin and the olive that was touched and so forth is more speculative.",
        "Clearly, the primary mechanism for transmitting influenza virus is really close contact, in terms of three or four feet away and breathing.",
        "We also believe that, of course, aerosols or additional air transmission, which could be many feet away, can also occur.",
        "But, on a whole, that is a realistic issue and one, again, that would score more the thumbs up perspective in that, as we saw with SARS and we have with so many other respiratorally transmitted infectious agents.",
        "We live in this age today of global travel, and viruses do not respect geographic boundaries or time zones.",
        "And, in this case, an exotic disease of some other area of the world will very quickly go around the world, and that is a concern we have with influenza."

        "Yeah, and if I could jump in at this moment…",
        "Sure.",
        "…certainly the brief scenes of wild birds or migratory birds taking flight, you know, leaves the public with this impression that that's the most likely way that this very highly pathogenic or deadly form is going to spread around the world.",
        "But, in fact, you know, most likely, it's going to - if it becomes very infectious and can spread from person-to-person, it's going to be where the disease is located now and then it might end up coming - or most likely come with humans in an airplane to here, and not with a few wild birds that are most likely going to die along their migration route.",
        "Well, we kept hearing that this is - you know, wild birds are the likely vectors of spreading the flu around.",
        "Well, wild birds are the natural host of the normal avian influenza viruses, which don't cause mortality and don't cause effects in people.",
        "And what has been happening over - I mean, this has been circulating in poultry for the last seven years and has not really gotten into wild birds coming to North America; so it's had seven years of opportunity to do that.",
        "It looks like it's spilled over into some wild birds in China about a year ago and spread, at least regionally.",
        "We found it in Mongolia in wild birds in an expedition.",
        "But we can't link it really clearly to migratory birds in these outbreaks in Africa and other places.",
        "It doesn't seem to persist, so what we're speculating, or the most probable thing that's going on, is the illegal movement, the smuggling of poultry or contaminated equipment is moving it around and then infecting wild birds locally or regionally; and then it tends to go away.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY.",

        "So we're not seeing migratory birds bringing it back to Europe from Africa now.",
        "There's no evidence that migratory birds took it to Africa.",
        "And the likelihood of it coming to the U.S.",
        "in wild birds is slim.",
        "So there's still that, what Dr. Osterholm was just saying, that global transport allows a rapid mechanism so airplanes and shipping of materials.",
        "So maybe it will come into North America with some shipments and, once again, infect wild birds, or maybe it will come in as a human disease on an airplane with a passenger; or maybe illegal smuggled goods into South America and get established there.",
        "We don't know what direction it might come now with global transport.",
        "Ira, I think one of the really important points here, and I think Dr. Karesh is really hitting on it is, is that the public remains quite confused about what we're talking about here, i.e. the bird flu and then this idea of a pandemic.",
        "And I think it's really important to distinguish what's happening now is largely a disease of birds, as Billy pointed out, primarily in the domestic poultry world with some spill over into the wild birds."

        "What we're concerned about from a human pandemic is at the point where that virus continues to change genetically, whether it's through a mutation or re-assortment, which is not significant to the public's mind.",
        "It's just that the virus changes and then it becomes a person-to-person transmitted agent.",
        "And then, at that point, it's kind of that old idea: it's about the birds, but it's no longer about the birds.",
        "And I think that's an important message, is that we're not at that threshold yet.",
        "What we're concerned about is getting to that threshold of where it then would become a person-to-person transmitted agent.",
        "So, right now, this issue of the birds, while it's very important, it's not the threat right now of everyone around the world becoming infected, even in if the virus should make it here to the United States.",

        "I think people really do need to understand that there's two somewhat separate issues.",
        "And one is, trying to control or prevent this disease before it turns into a human pandemic form, which would be eradicating the disease in poultry.",
        "And then, some really good planning and preparedness in case it does happen and it gets into people and starts traveling around the world.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Let's talk a bit in - a little bit - few minutes we have before the break, and we'll continue after the break, about the phase-two plan that the administration came up with last week.",
        "Michael, can you sort of summarize that for us, what the good points and the shortcomings were?",
        "Well, the plan really is a living document.",
        "And I wouldn't want anyone to think, after hearing about it today, that this is the final plan.",
        "I look at where our federal government was 18 to 24 months ago, and I - it's the old adage, you creep, you walk, you run.",
        "And I think we're walking at a much faster pace; 18 to 24 months ago, we were hardly creeping.",
        "But the plan really begins to draw into place a whole series of preparedness activities that have to be conducted at the federal level, at the state and local level, involving the private sector, involving vaccine use, involving healthcare.",
        "But there's a long ways to go yet.",
        "One of the things that the plan doesn't provide, for example, is resources.",
        "And that was not the intent of the plan.",
        "That's obviously the Executive Branch and the Congress getting together.",
        "But we're still putting a lot of our preparedness activities together on a shoestring.",
        "When I say that, putting a billion dollars into flu vaccine is a lot of money on one hand.",
        "On the other hand, when you look at the potential impact of the pandemic of influenza tomorrow - which would be, in a worldwide basis, in the trillions of dollars - it's that idea of, you know, what do you pay as insurance or whatever?"

        "Department of Agriculture and the state associations and also private industry are very on top of this; so they have good diagnostics, they have good training, they have very quick response.",

        "So they found it in chickens and then in a person.",
        "So every one of those human infections that comes from a chicken is another opportunity for this virus to get established in people, to mutate or change or reform itself to become deadly in humans.",
        "So, there's that upstream approach: If we can eliminate that contact with the disease between people and chickens, we're going to reduce the risk of a pandemic.",
        "So it's like pulling cards out of a deck and finally getting the ace of spades.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So we really want to reduce the infection in birds and understand more about how wild birds might be moving it around.",
