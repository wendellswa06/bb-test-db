        "And then the other tract is really get geared up and, as Dr. Osterholm was just saying, the plan has really come along in the U.S., which is beautiful, but that's not the signal for everybody to go back to sleep and become complacent.",
        "We still have a lot of work to do and it's a serious issue.",
        "Let's talk about what the federal government needs to do to curb the spread of the disease.",
        "Do you have to really clamp down on the borders and watch birds that come into this country?",
        "Absolutely.",

        "And that doesn't cause a big disease in humans, but it cost over a $100 million of taxpayer dollars to control it.",
        "And that was just a few birds slipping through the border there between Mexico and California.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So - and the whole world needs to be geared up for this.",
        "So, once again, we see the migratory bird things as almost a red herring that you almost focus on too much and ignore border patrols and good port security.",
        "And that's more likely how it's going to spread around the world.",
        "I had seen some news articles that birds isolated, you know, in -quarantined in airports, were found to have them - birds coming in, you know, in luggage.",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "That's happened in Europe twice.",
        "In Belgium, they found infected wild birds being smuggled and also birds legally imported to England…",
        "Right.",
        "…were tested and quarantined.",
        "So if it's being done legally, we'll have a good chance - the USDA quarantine system, once again, is very good and they'll probably pick it up."

        "For example, there was a sense that, in fact, H5N1 would not be a problem in migratory or wild birds, given the long history of infection in southeast Asia, meaning of at least five to seven years duration, where it was more widespread.",
        "And then, all of a sudden, as Dr. Karesh indicated, we saw this flare up in China early last year.",

        "Well, I wish you great luck with it and I can't wait to take a look at it.",

        "And I think the truth is, is that clearly as it's been laid out, poultry played a very important role.",
        "And there's much more movement of poultry around the world than anyone has ever understood, even to those poorest of countries, like in Africa.",
        "But I think at the same time, while there have been predictions made how migratory birds are bringing it to the United States - and now we're seeing less infection in Europe, and there's some question here - I would worry that we swing too far the other way now and say, well, migratory birds don't play any role.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And I think what this is really calling for is much more in the way of support for understanding about bird viruses, in general.",
        "And what do we know about how they move, how they don't move, what might be candidate species that would carry this virus and not show symptoms for those that might show symptoms, but survive those that would die.",
        "And one of the things the public's asking us right now is for more information about what role birds play.",
        "And I think we need to really support much more in the way of research.",
        "And I think some of the work that Dr. Karesh and others have done is really been important.",
        "And, frankly, they need a lot more support right now, so that we can better understand this and help give the public a sense of what's going on.",
        "Dr. Karesh?",
        "I certainly appreciate that plug there.",
        "And we understand - you know, what we have learned from over the last 30 or 40 years of avian influenza and poultry is there's multiple routes of this disease spreading.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And all of those have to be addressed simultaneously.",
        "So what Mike was just saying about a balanced approached is really essential.",
        "Because if we just ignore one - focus on two or three routes of spread and ignore one, we're not going to accomplish anything."
