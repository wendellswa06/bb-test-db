        "Well, first of all, I want to congratulate Dr. Emanuel.",
        "I think it was a very thoughtful, courageous, and wise piece of work.",
        "And I think it really goes to the heart of an issue that very few people understand, in terms of our current pandemic preparedness.",
        "On a worldwide basis today, we can make enough vaccine on an annual flu season basis to basically vaccinate about 300 million people.",
        "That's all the pipes, the plumbing, the machines, the factories that we have to make vaccine.",
        "We just can't make a lot more.",
        "We're working to try to make somewhat more, but it's not going to be a lot more.",
        "Well, along comes the H5N1 Virus, which, again, we don't know will be the next pandemic strain.",
        "But if it were, we find that it takes much more vaccine dose to actually protect someone using even our current vaccine, which, again - just remind people, we're working with the current strain of the flu virus, H5N1.",
        "If it were to become the pandemic strain, it would undergo more changes, and we would have to basically start all over again, in a sense, to actually make the pandemic vaccine at the time that that virus change occurred.",
        "We expect the principles of how it grows and how it is accepted in people to be about the same.",
        "So we need much more of the vaccine dose to vaccinate people; anywhere from six to 12 times as much.",
        "We've learned in recent weeks that also the yields in growing this virus in chicken eggs has been much below that of what we'd normally expect to see with age three and two; anywhere from only 10 to 50 percent of the growth.",
        "When you add up those two sets of numbers, we will be very fortunate on a worldwide basis if, in the first year of a pandemic, we'll have enough vaccine to vaccinate 25 to 40 million people worldwide out of 6.5 billion.",
        "So this idea of allocation is not just a money issue, and I think that what Dr. Emanuel's work is doing is it's forcing us now to say, what are we going to do with this very precious resource that will be in extreme short supply under a very, very emotionally challenging time?",
        "We need to think about that now.",
        "So I--I think his work was very important.",
        "And I really applaud it being out there.",
        "And I think that we need to take it to heart and look carefully at what we're going to do with this limited amount of vaccine.",
        "Can I emphasize on one point there?",
        "Sure.",
        "Sure.",
        "There's a lot of people say, well, you know we don't need so much planning now or discussion now about who to allocate.",
        "We'll look at who's getting sick and who's dying from the vaccine and then we'll make plans based upon what's happening.",
        "I think that's - you know, a lot of times us ethicists are accused of being unrealistic.",
        "I think that's very unrealistic.",
        "If we really have a pandemic, it is going to be pandemonium in the country.",
        "And communication is going to be difficult.",
        "Furthermore, people have to accept the grounds on which you're allocating as legitimate, as acceptable.",
        "They have to have debated it and discussed it beforehand, and you're not going to be able to change it at the last minute, informing every state health department and then down to every county where they're distributing it.",
        "You have to have a plan that is widely implemented, that is widely known, accepted by the public, accepted by the people who are going to implement it.",
        "This can't be something you change at the very last minute, as if you have perfect communication and you're dealing with five or ten people.",
        "So I think the debate now is going to be very important.",
        "And I think what we've just heard also emphasizes that, you know, in the United States we only have one production facility for flu vaccine.",
        "That doesn't seem adequate in my - I think in most people's view, if you actually ask them.",
        "Does that seem like a reasonable precaution to take for this potential?"

        "Let me remind everybody that this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.",
        "I'm talking - yeah but what are the options for, you know, for getting more production?",
        "You seem to be saying we could do more production if we really wanted to?",
        "Well, let me just add, first of all, what we're using right now for our production capacity is really a 1950s technology with one additional improvement upon it.",
        "And the NIH is now funding a number of different groups to look at, what we call, a next level technology.",
        "Growing basically the same kind of virus in cell cultures so it could grow more of it.",
        "And what one of the issues, though, that we all have to come to grips with, is that ability to create a new bullet is only part of the solution - that magic bullet.",
        "It's also you have to have the gun to fire it from.",
        "And today we do not have the worldwide vaccine production capacity, because the private sector has largely avoided getting into this area for a whole lot of reasons, primarily that it's not a financially rewarding area to get into.",
        "And so even if we have a new vaccine, Ira, it doesn't mean we can produce it for the world.",
        "And I might add that although we tend to be American-centric on this issue, saying that we need to get our country protected and vaccinated, we have to understand with this global just-in-time economy that we live in, we have a need to vaccinate the world.",
        "Today, 80 percent of all the drugs we use in this country, all the vaccines and drugs combined for cancer, for antibiotics, all these things come from offshore.",
        "Look at parts of our food supply.",
        "Look at many essential products and services that we use in this country, they originate offshore.",
        "And so if a pandemic were to wipe through the world, and even if we had more vaccine available to us and could minimize its impact here, the collateral damage to the United States of America would be huge during a pandemic.",
        "And so what we have to do is move to a better vaccine and we have to, as a world, not just the United States.",
        "I think this is G-8 issue, it's one of an insurance policy that I can't imagine is more important, and we have to find a way to create the kind of vaccine production capacity, and then the distribution and delivery system; if we don't we will pay one hell of a price in what I would consider a worldwide Katrina.",
        "I have about a minute left, Dr. Eze - Dr. Emanuel, the idea of giving the vaccine to people aged 13 to 40, instead of the elders.",
        "You say this is the best way to maximize the result of a pandemic.",
        "Something we - you know, we would not think about as a regular flu vaccine.",
        "Right.",
        "I think there are two justifications.",
        "One is an ethical justification, which I've given you.",
        "Right.",
        "I think giving people the opportunity to live through a life.",
        "Another is a practical consideration.",
        "Just imagine what happens if you bet wrong, and say it's W-shaped like the 1918.",
        "And the biggest mortality rate is the 20 to 40 year olds and you've given the vaccine to people over 65, you now have had your major catastrophe in 20 to 40 year olds.",
        "Say you bet the other way, and you give your vaccine to 20 to 40 year olds, and it turns out to be more U-shaped and the higher mortality or at-risk is in the older people.",
        "Well, we know compared to annual flu…",
        "Dr.",
        "I've got to wrap it up.",
        "I think you made the point, but we've run out of time.",
        "I want to say goodbye to both of you.",
        "Michael Osterholm, and Ezekiel EEmanuel.",
