        "Well, I don't know if you're familiar with Science Friday, but we talk about a lot of science issues.",
        "And when we were contacted by your publicist to come on to the program we figured you, you know, they must have known that and we're very happy to have you on here because we love your work.",
        "But is there any real science - so you're delving into scientific issues and using science sleuthing at all in the film?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, you know, what's just fun about it was, you know, I had this - an idea for this movie.",
        "And I kind of wrote it out, and then I went to kind of my research people here, and I said, look, here's the idea for the movie.",
        "Is this - is it at all possible?",
        "Could this, could this possibly happen?",
        "And they came out with all these stacks of, you know, cases and studies and scientific information.",
        "And they went, not only - you know, not only is it possible, but versions of this have happened in nature a lot.",
        "And so it was a very interesting process to kind of, you know - something that it kind of, you know, take - like what Michael Crichton does, take two things that are scientific, that's a factual that's happened, and then take a leap to a third thing that could happen.",
        "So, is this film about the earth rebelling?",
        "Well, you know, it could be.",
        "It could be.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Part of the fun of it is that there is a - you know, basically what happens in the movie is that there is about this couple that lives in Philadelphia and then this event happens in New York where the piers and airborne chemical toxin has been released, and people are dying at a very, very horrific fashion.",
        "And it's attributed to terrorists in its initial phases.",
        "And then it starts happening in other cities, in Boston, in Philadelphia, and all along this East Coast little - this crescent-shaped area of the East Coast.",
        "And our couple find themselves stuck in this area.",
        "And there's all kinds of theories about what to go - well, who's doing it and what's causing it.",
        "And they become less and less plausible as the event takes on the scale that is taking on.",
        "And it, you know, it's an interesting thing because I started - when I started writing it people start sending me articles because they knew what I was writing about, friends, the people that we worked with.",
        "And one of the articles was about the bees disappearing.",
        "Right.",
        "The collapse.",
        "The kind of the opening scene of the movie with Mark talking about, in his classroom, talking about the bees disappearing in.",
        "It's very much about what we're talking about here, the idea that, you know, there are acts going on here that science is going to try to label this while the bees disappearing it's because of this, it's because of the cell phone, because it's that or it's this.",
        "And in reality, we really don't know what happened.",
        "But we know there are forces that we're not aware of.",
        "And there's something greater - a shift that's happening that we're not aware of.",
        "Hmhmmm.",
        "And, you know, there's a bunch of those kind of references in the movie to oddities that are occurring in science."

        "And one of the things that really struck me about Einstein's story was how he was kind of an atheist when he was younger.",
        "And then, as he, you know, as he worked, and you know, got more and more into, you know, the way the world exists, the rules behind it that he was discovering, he started to become a believer again.",
        "And in a way, he saw in the gaps of science some hand at work something.",
        "Some divine hand and he attributed it to God, you know.",
        "And he became a believer, devout believer, in the later years.",
        "And in that same way, like Mark's character, he's just a high school science teacher but he knows there's gaps in science that we keep trying to fill.",

        "And then at the end, the fumes of the movie kind of leave you thinking about something a little deeper perhaps like, you know, \"\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\"\" you know, about the paranoia of communism.",

        "Well, I mean, we wanted to have somebody that had enough knowledge and also a lack of knowledge that, you know, a kind of a humbleness about things that they knew, whether they didn't know, sort of felt like somebody who had just moderate knowledge.",
        "This isn't someone who's going to save the world or come up with any answer or anything like that.",
        "This has to be somebody who knows enough to believe.",
        "You know, most of my movies they're about that kind of like struggle to awake your belief - the belief system again in you.",
        "And Mark plays this character Elliot Moore who kind of his almost childlike in his belief of what he sees in science and what the implications are.",
        "And so, instead of a scientist who has strong beliefs, you're having someone who's open to any kind of suggestion."
