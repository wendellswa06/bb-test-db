        "Good afternoon.",
        "Thank you very much for taking my call.",
        "I want to share with you a little bit about what your previous caller said.",
        "My brother is 36 years old.",
        "I'm his guardian.",
        "He had his first psychotic break at the age of 15 and has taken every imaginable anti-psychotic medication to the point where he suffers from neuroleptic malignant syndrome and a muscle breakdown disease called rhabdomyolysis, and I'm probably not pronouncing it right, where pieces of muscle tissue break off and go into the bloodstream and becomes toxic.",
        "He has been petitioned into a hospital at least 15 times over the last 15 to 16 years because, when he is having an episode, he doesn't know whether - he doesn't think that he needs to go to hospital.",
        "And every time he's petitioned, the police come, handcuff him, and take him away.",
        "So he never understands why he is being arrested, but he is not.",
        "And he can no longer take any anti-psychotic medication because his liver and his kidneys are in such bad shape now that he basically is in an assisted-living place where he just babbles all the time now.",
        "And it's very, very sad.",
        "Dr.",
        "Joshi, what sort of options are available to Cecilia's brother?",
        "You know, the neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a very rare, but a quite dangerous side effect of anti-psychotics.",
        "And when it happens, patients can be really limited in the kinds of medications that they can take, especially when it comes to anti-psychotic medications.",
        "All the more reason that we follow these patients really, really carefully.",
        "Because when they are really quite psychotic and unable to function, we have to manage them in a very secure setting so that they don't harm others and they don't harm themselves.",
        "And, you know, the decisions are made case-by-case, and we do the very best to help these patients.",
        "And there is always risk benefit no matter medicine one uses.",
        "It's always balancing the risk versus the benefits and all the more…",
        "(Unintelligible).",
        "…and all the more reason for patients to be compliant so they can be followed very regularly, so we don't want any sorts of difficulties.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "David Oaks, let's get you back in here.",
        "Yes, I just like to briefly respond to the caller that there ought to be a whole range of alternatives available, and that starts with a different paradigm.",
        "The model of the current mental health system is still very authoritarian, and what we're finding is that our members who fully recover -and yes, one can fully recover after a diagnosis of even schizophrenia - the common denominator are things like empowerment, self-determination, peer support, community connection, jobs, housing, a whole range of approaches.",
        "What helped me back then, when I was diagnosed as psychotic and was locked up five times - family, friends, peer support, we had a drop-in center.",
        "I improved my nutrition and exercise.",
        "I avoided recreational drugs.",
        "And even activism and advocacy were important.",
        "Even things like - we did nature outings, this little group of ex-mental patients.",
        "I learned from them that peer support is kind of the - it's kind of the solar power of mental health.",
        "It's really an engine of support that can really be sustainable for folks whether or not somebody is not a psych drug."

        "So the emphasis on force drugging is what we call reductionist; it kind of reduces the whole question down to kind of a really simple bumper sticker, which is more forced drugging.",
        "And I just want to warn the nation on the TALK OF THE NATION that incredible suffering and death can be caused by that approach.",
        "I'll just mention my diagnosis was schizophrenia.",
        "Those of us with that kind of serious diagnosis, the current study now shows our lifespan is 25 years less.",
        "A lot of reasons for that, but one of them may be the super powerful drugs.",
        "And we're finding that in the poorer countries - the World Health Organization did two studies - that the people that have best recovery, full recovery, reintegration into the community are the countries with the least psychiatric drugs and psychiatrists.",
        "The poorest countries have double the recovery rate that we do.",
        "David, I want to ask you a question.",
        "We have an e-mail from Anne in Jackson, Michigan, who says: I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder after being treated for depression and anxiety for 11 years.",
        "I firmly support forced treatment for those with serious mental health programs.",
        "Free will and informed decisions require a certain level brain function.",
        "When the brain is not functioning properly, you can't expect decision making to be working well.",
        "You wouldn't ask a diabetic to somehow make his pancreas work at a higher level than possible, but that's sometimes exactly what you're asking someone dealing with significant mental illness.",
        "You're asking his brain to function at a level that allows him to make informed decisions.",
        "Two quick replies.",
        "One is, there's no force treatment for diabetics.",
        "Why is that?",
        "There's a lot of folks diagnosed diabetic that are eating horrible foods, doing terrible things to their bodies.",
        "They're not being forcibly treated with diabetes medication.",
        "But also, the best doctors in diabetes, when you talk to the cutting edge doctors, they're finding that all kinds of non-tangible things help us, even for diabetes and heart conditions.",
        "Things like our community, our culture, our connections to each other, our relationships.",
        "But what about the specific question of not necessarily being the best judge of the decisions about your own treatment when you are in the middle of a psychotic break?",
        "Okay, there I was, middle of the psychotic break.",
        "I thought the neuroleptics were poison for me, personally.",
        "And again, I respect other people's decisions.",
        "I thought it felt like it was damaging my brain, that it was potentially harmful to me.",
        "I was right.",
        "The current medical evidence is that there's a very high risk from these drugs, including frontal lobe shrinkage.",
        "Now that's shown with CT and MRI scans.",
        "So I was right.",
        "We need to take a short break now.",
        "We will talk more with Dr. Paramjit Joshi and David Oaks when we come back.",
        "And more of your calls, 800-989-TALK, or e-mail talk@npr.org.",

        "David Oaks, what do you think the impact will be of the Virginia Tech tragedy on your efforts to fight forced treatment?",
        "If we do nothing, if people who are diagnosed with psychiatric labels and our allies do nothing, horrible disaster.",
        "I would predict hundreds of thousands of more young people prescribed powerful drugs without adequate advocacy, information, alternatives - and again, I'm totally pro-choice about the decision to take it - but I see mass increase in forced drugging, and also just prescribing drugs to especially college kids.",
        "If people speak out, if people with psychiatric diagnoses speak out, if our organizations get a voice like you're doing here - and TALK OF THE NATION is one of the few places we've heard about to have the voice from the sharp end of the needle, as we say.",
        "Even though this topic is hot all over the nation, this is one of the few - you're one of the few shows, thank you, to have this side of the story.",
        "So let's hear from mental health consumer psychiatric survivors and perhaps something could somehow be taken from this horrible tragedy that we can hear from people who've been there.",
        "What has helped them recover?",
        "What is it like to be forcibly treated?",
        "A lot of us actually see that as violent.",

        "It was a form of violence.",

        "Okay.",
        "Well, currently, I'm under forced medication - because the reason it's forced is because if I go off of it - I voluntarily take it every night, okay - but it's forced because if I go off, they have threats.",
