        "Thank you.",
        "You're on the air, Judy.",
        "What's your comment?",
        "Okay.",
        "I'm a person who was diagnosed with schizophrenia, forced to take medication, forced into a hospital, and it remains - and the doctor's going to say, oh, that was a long time ago, so it's different now - it remains one of the most horrible experiences in my life, and it shaped my whole life because I became an advocate, like David.",
        "When I was in the hospital, I said to myself there's got to be a better way to treat people than this.",
        "I was depressed.",
        "I was actually looking for help when I went in.",
        "I ended up getting involuntarily committed after having gone in voluntarily, and I said there's got to be a better way.",
        "Why are we treating people like criminals whose only crime is that they're depressed or miserable or unhappy?",
        "And so I became part of an advocacy movement that started back in the 1970s, and we are actively out there not only advocating for our rights and for our -especially our right to speak for ourselves, but also developing all kinds of self-help programs, which exist all over the United States, which are funded out of, in many states, out of the mental health budgets of states to provide self-help, peer support, things that people do go through voluntarily, and a lot of people who come to our programs voluntarily won't go near the mental health system, the established mental health system because they've had such bad experiences.",
        "Judy, thank you for your call.",
        "David Oaks, I wanted to ask you about that but also about - we heard earlier from Rae Belle Gambs, who felt that the criminal justice system was the only way she could get her son help and that that was much more intrusive and violent than had she been able to commit him through the health system.",
        "Well, two things.",
        "One is, the vast majority of us, as people have pointed out here, are non-violent.",
        "We are peaceful.",
        "I am a diagnosed psychotic.",
        "I'm one of the few people that come out of the closet and say that.",
        "That's a label you hide, believe me.",
        "It's - we actually have a mad pride movement to encourage people to speak out on that.",
        "So number one is, the vast majority of us, like the caller - Judy Chamberlain is a famous advocate in this field whose given her life to this field, and you don't hear about the Judy Chamberlains.",
        "You hear about the Chos.",
        "But second, the fact is that when somebody does an aggressive, dangerous act -we know Cho, for instance, was stalking.",
        "We heard about other criminal acts people have done, threatening - for instance, one of your guests has been threatened by a person with a psychiatric label.",
        "We're not against the use of state force.",
        "I mean, that's against the law, and the problem is the criminal justice system is just horrible, where people are just thrown into a cage.",
        "And we all agree, there's common ground, that ain't the way to go.",
        "But when the state uses force, isn't there something more than metal prisons and chemical prisons?",
        "Can't we be more creative with all kinds of support groups and alternatives and advocacy and jobs programs and home programs and housing programs?",
        "Let's be more creative about it."

        "I think, you know, I think the problem is we're stuck in this medical model, because I'm told all the time that it's because - supposedly a chemical imbalance, and I encourage any journalist listening to just ask professionals, is there any study showing an actual chemical imbalance?",
        "There's no study on that, so we're kind of stuck in this one medical model.",
        "I don't even use the term mental illness anymore.",
        "But Mr. Oaks, if I may just respond to your comments.",
        "Don't you think we can all work together?",
        "Because it seems to me what this tragedy has brought to the fore really is that we need to educate the public about mental illness, that there is help available, work against the whole issue of stigma so people can reach out and get treatment and get help, and your points about getting other kinds of supports and, you know, family input and the community, I think these are all wonderful ideas.",
        "But we all need to work together, and advocacy groups have an important role.",
        "I agree, but the missing voice again is often people who have been through the mental health system.",
        "They tend not to be listened to, almost - in fact, I'd say - I'd go out on a limb and say every mental health consumer group I've heard of opposes expanding forced drugging and commitment laws.",
        "Why is that?",
        "Because they have found other ways to help other than more forced treatment.",
        "So we're not really hearing from folks.",
        "In fact, a lot of the groups in this field get substantial amount of money from the drug industry.",

        "You know, my hope is that there will be more common ground.",
        "These are decisions that are not made lightly.",
        "I think it's going to force the mental health community, it's going to force universities, places of work, to really try and come up with a system, and we really can't be polarized on this.",
        "We really need to be going about it in a very thoughtful way.",
        "You know, what determines dangerousness, you know, the various levels of it?",
        "At what point do you really mandate that treatment occur?",
        "And the issue really -there are three things that we need to keep in mind.",
        "One, that we really adhere to very carefully is that the treatment needs to be provided in the least restrictive setting.",
        "Now, for some patients, under certain circumstances, that could be an inpatient unit.",
        "For others, it could be intensive outpatient treatment.",
        "For others, it could be supervised housing and supervised treatment in some way, shape or form."
