        "Joining us today to discuss these topics and more, from our NPR headquarters in Washington, Joe Davidson an editor at The Washington Post.",

        "She's a social and cultural commentator on the television show Meet the Press, seen in the Boston area.",
        "And Nat Irvin, professor of future studies at Wake Forest University.",

        "Let's go to a story that I think people had hoped to hear differently from the FBI, and that is a story that received a lot of press coverage, the reopening of the investigation which included the exhumation of Emmett Till's body.",
        "We are finding out now from the FBI that no federal charges will be filed for the 1955 killing of the 14-year-old, that they're suggesting the five year statute of limitations on federal civil rights violations has expired.",
        "And before we go further, we should note that the law was amended to provide for death penalty cases, but it can not be served retroactively.",
        "Joe, I guess, the first question would be, didn't we know this from the beginning?",
        "Well, I think that's true.",
        "None the less, I think people often, certainly a lot of people hoped, that the FBI, the federal government, would find a way to go back into this case and bring those who are responsible for Emmett Till's murder, those who are still alive, to justice.",
        "And these kinds of cases, though, it must be said are awfully difficult to bring, even though there have been some notable ones in the last ten or 12 years.",
        "Byron De La Beckwith was convicted for the 1994 slaying of Medgar Evers and Bobby Frank Cherry in Alabama, convicted in 2002 for the Birmingham church bombing, which was in '63.",
        "Edgar Ray Killen last year convicted for the killing of civil rights workers in 1964, so clearly it's not impossible.",
        "It is difficult, and in this case the federal government decided, I guess, it was too difficult for them.",
        "Right around this time is when America starts getting fatter and more diabetic.",
        "It is a tall order.",
        "It's actually - it doesn't happen very often and I went back and I did a little bit of research.",
        "The president has vetoed a total of two bills in his tenure and both of those vetoes were sustained, and they did not have the two-thirds majority to override it.",
        "President Bush, as it were, actually had three bills that his veto was overridden by the Congress.",
        "It does not happen very often, but it does happen.",
        "And there are some areas of disagreement with some Democrats that they have with the president where you could see people toying with that idea in next couple of years.",
        "So what would be the one that you think has the biggest chance of being overridden?",
        "People are looking very closely at legislation that would place additional sanctions on Iran if the current nuclear disarmament talks fail.",
        "Those are - there's a deadline for some disarmament that needs to be in place by the summer.",
        "And the president has already said that should the Congress pass an Iran sanctions bill he would veto it.",
        "But there are enough Democrats in the Senate, particularly, that it's possible to get to the 67.",
        "If you do the math, the way you look at it is that there are 12 Democrats in the Senate who have supported Iran sanctions in the past.",
        "So that gets you to one short of the 67 you would need to override a veto.",
        "But the problem is, of course, that some of those Democrats are not inclined to buck the president at this particular point.",
        "And there've been some who have said that they plan to see what the president has to say, see what the State Department has to say, about how the talks are going before they make a decision on what to do on an Iran sanctions bill."

        "The Senate already had their 67 votes, but the House was not there.",
        "And I spent many nights outside of these meetings inside the Capitol watching these rank-and-file Republicans, some of us who - we didn't even know who they were - coming into these meetings as they were listening to them try and convince those Republicans that they should vote to override the legislation.",

        "And there were several demands from this group of black law students, removing the Confederate flags was one of them.",
        "Why did you decide that this was the right thing to do?",
        "Well, Melissa, one context point in - these issues really have been talked about at Washington and Lee for some time, you know, the involvement with slavery, many other issues related to race here at Washington and Lee.",
        "But I think, you know, this was a time, really, to address a difficult question head-on and to say, yeah, this is part of our history and how can we deal with the complexity of history?",
        "So I think the timing was right and it was in part, but I would say not entirely, because of some of the requests from the law students.",
        "And if I understand this right, the flags that were removed were reproductions - they weren't original flags.",
        "But you will have original Confederate flags in a different part of campus, right - in a museum?",
        "Yeah, you know, as you begin to look into the history of the flags in Lee Chapel, it got more and more complex and more and more complicated.",
        "They were original battle flags that were not even the university's property, but were the property of The Museum of the Confederacy.",
        "And those original flags were not being displayed in a historically appropriate way.",
        "And so they were taken back by The Museum of the Confederacy because they were deteriorating.",
        "And they were replaced by reproductions.",
        "It made very little sense to have reproductions there, they serve no educational purpose.",
        "And if there is any educational purpose, that would be more appropriate in an actual museum, which we have.",
        "I want to ask you about another demand from the black students who call themselves the committee, they want Washington and Lee to issue an official apology for the university's participation in chattel slavery - I'm reading from their statement here - and a denunciation of Robert E.",
        "Lee's participation in slavery.",
        "So why don't you walk us through what the university's history is with slavery.",
        "You know, as a national liberal arts college, we respect history.",
        "And part of our history is, in fact, that the university was given an estate back in 1826 and that estate included between 70 and 80 slaves.",
        "And for a period of time - a little over 20 years - those individuals were either used for labor in the town, or in a few cases, were actually sold.",
        "And that is a part of our history and that is part of something that we need to learn from.",
        "Now in terms of the demand for an official apology for the university's role with slavery, in your statement, you say this was a regrettable chapter of our history that has to be confronted, but you also said that you wouldn't apologize for the crucial role that Robert E.",
        "Lee played in shaping this institution.",

        "But as Peter mentioned, there was a technocratic government that eurozone leaders liked that wanted - that they could work with and they were non-elected, and the Greeks reacted very badly to that.",
        "They felt that that government has served the interest of the European Union and the eurozone, but not the interest of Greeks, so it's dangerous territory to say let's put a government in place that we want and not respect the democratically-elected government in place.",
