        "On the other hand, what often happened in these cases is that the folks in the community had some link to these people.",
        "They knew who some of the perpetrators were, so I would suggest that there's probably some evidence still locally about kinds of hints that lead to enough evidence to move on this case.",
        "And the larger question really becomes, you know, what is the perception of Mississippi and really as a country are still wrangling around these race issues?",
        "This was an opportunity, I think for the federal government to move forward and try to put to rest some of these notorious cases that happened during the civil right movement.",
        "And Callie, you beat me to my next question, and Nat, pick up on this if you would.",
        "And that is when you reopen a case like this to the fanfare that the FBI allowed for this without warning up front that the statute was there and it may be problematic, you tend to dash the hopes of many who looked to the justice department and others to right wrongs.",
        "Sure you do, Ed.",
        "And we still have - you know, if you're a baby boomer, a black baby boomer, a white baby boomer for that matter, the case of Emmett Till still resonates because of the visual images that we have from the Jet magazine photo of Emmett Till's body.",
        "I think, you know, when we compare the decision by the FBI, whom today has decided not to pursue this case, compare that with the decision by next door neighbor Alabama to go back and pardon the number of folks who had been charges with violating the segregational laws, you see a part of our country who's trying to deal with a very painful part of our history.",
        "We make progress and we fall back.",
        "I think the opportunity that the state has, Mississippi, maybe the district attorney will follow-up, I'm certainly hopeful that the folks in Mississippi will not let this thing just fester.",
        "This is not something that's just going to go away.",
        "We'll be talking about this case 10 years from now, 20 years from now, 30 years from now, and this is an opportunity, while the people are still alive who do know what happened, to come forward and help us to heal a very...",
        "All right, and we should note as everyone has alluded there, that the state in fact can still bring charges, that the statute of limitation does not apply in the same way there.",
        "And many people are hoping that the state will pick up from here and continue.",
        "Joe, did you have - I thought you were trying to get in on it.",
        "Well, one of the things that I think it particularly galling about this particular case is that this is a case that, in a sense, drove the civil rights movement from the very beginning almost, and so it became kind of an icon of the civil rights movement and what can happen to black people in the South for little or no offense at all.",
        "And so I think there's a lot of emotion with this case, as there certainly - and that's totally understandable.",
        "I have a lot of emotion about it, and I think every black person does.",
        "And so for this outcome, it feels so unsatisfactory, you know, even if on a strictly legal basis it was - it makes sense.",
        "And I don't know all the ins and outs of FBI's case or lack of a case, but it leaves us wanting because of the power of this case over decades.",
        "All right.",
        "Let me bring this up.",
        "In terms of trying to right a wrong, if you will, even though Nat jumped the gun on me there for a second, but Alabama lawmakers are considering pardoning hundreds, even thousands or people who were arrested decades ago for violating Alabama segregation law.",
        "This would, in fact, include Rosa Parks, whose conviction is still on the record.",
        "Callie, you know, many people say that it's a nicety, but it doesn't do anything.",
        "Others feel that it helps close a wound.",
        "What do you think?",
        "And we should note that this would be called the Rosa Parks Act."

        "What I think is important, aside from the pardons, and this is what I wish sometimes that we could do in terms of race relations in this country when it comes to our history, is sometimes that we could just acknowledge that we're sorry for what happened.",

        "A part of the healing is just to say, we shouldn't have done that, and this is a small step, but I don't see what's wrong with just saying we're sorry.",
        "A pardon is a formal kind of declaration of it, but the problem with it is that it says that you did something wrong.",
        "Hell, they didn't do anything wrong.",
        "What was wrong was the way people were being treated, and this is a part of the process, but it doesn't do it all.",
