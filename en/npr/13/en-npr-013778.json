        "So there is a lot of skepticism out there about its claim today.",
        "But clearly the fact that they even conducted the fourth nuclear test, the first in three years, is a big provocation from Pyongyang.",
        "Well, there has been skepticism but also condemnation by the countries in the neighborhood.",
        "Right.",
        "Even if it is a nuclear test, it is, you know, a real throwing down the gauntlet to North Korea's neighbors.",

        "Well, of course, always hard to know what leadership in North Korea is thinking.",

        "He is going to turn 33 on Friday, so he's a very young leader in this communist dynasty.",
        "So we think that he's probably trying to present himself as a strong, tough leader in North Korea.",

        "That's the first time in 36 years that this big occasion will have happened.",
