        "And Buckley acknowledges that maybe in fact he would have been on the side of the loyalists during the Revolutionary War.",
        "It is a remarkable exchange.",
        "We see Buckley's honesty there, his candor and his being uncertain in some ways about where his own philosophy might have led him or might lead him.",
        "It has to be said, in talking about National Review, that it was indeed on the wrong side of the civil rights movement.",
        "Buckley, later on in his life, changed his mind, admitted he was wrong.",

        "Buckley not existed?",
        "Do you think there would have been a conservative revival?",
        "Doing counterfactual history is treacherous.",
        "I do think that there would have been some kind of conservative revival because conservatism, broadly speaking, is an important part of the American psyche.",
        "But I think all that can be said is this: had it not been for Buckley, conservatism would not be what it is today.",
