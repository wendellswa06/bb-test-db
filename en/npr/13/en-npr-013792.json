        "And why would that be?",
        "There seems to be such a flagrant violation.",

        "Ultimately, the solution of piracy, however, is found not in prosecution of individual pirates, that's the symptom, but really in dealing with the root causes of piracy, which is the lack of anything resembling a government in Somalia.",
