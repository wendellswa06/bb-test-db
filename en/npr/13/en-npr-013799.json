        "Well, we got some mail about our piece from StroryCorps Griot this week.",
        "The piece featured Carrie Conley, a single mother who raised six children alone during the 1960s.",
        "Conley told her youngest son, Jerry Johnson(ph), about how she got by, especially at Christmas.",
        "Around the first of December, all the rich peoples, they would play out their children's toy chest.",
        "And they would take all these nice toys to the Salvation Army.",
        "And I would go there and I would pick out nice toys.",
        "And so it seems that we had a big Christmas.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But I never did tell you it was the Santa Claus because I said that I cannot give no man credit for what I did.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "That story reminded Lena Shultz(ph) in Poca, West Virginia of someone she knew.",
        "Lena writes, when I heard the story told by Carrie Conley, I thought of my own mother, Amelia Bellfalor(ph), who also raised six children in deep poverty.",
        "Mom would use some meager food stamps and buy a little extra sugar one month and some chocolate the next.",
        "Every month, she stashed something away for our holiday meals.",
        "Then she baked cookies, make candy and make a great feast for us.",
        "She died young, aged 58.",
        "And I hope she knows how grateful I am for her sacrifices and her constant love.",
        "God bless Carrie Conley and my mother and all the women who do the whole job when left with children to raise and do it with nearly nothing and do it so well.",
        "By that he means Pakistan's lawyers will once again take their grievances onto the streets.",
        "Phillip Reeves, NPR News, Islamabad.",
        "Yeah, like you suddenly become, like, really angry at hearing something shocking or learning about something that you really, really deeply dislike."

        "Thank you.",
        "The lower courts allowed the case to go forward, declaring that Iqbal had a plausible claim, and the government appealed to the Supreme Court.",
        "Today, the Court, by a 5-4 vote, ruled that Iqbal's lawsuit did not state a plausible claim.",
        "Writing for the court majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy noted that in order to win this case, Iqbal would have to show that Ashcroft and Mueller intentionally singled out Arab Muslims on the basis of their religion or national origin for imprisonment and special harsh treatment.",
        "We do not reject these claims because they are nonsensical or fanciful, said Kennedy, but because they are stated as conclusions without support.",
        "It should come as no surprise, he said, that in the wake of a devastating attack, law enforcement policymakers would direct the arrest of those with a suspected link to al-Qaida and that this policy would have a disproportionate, but incidental effect on Muslims.",
        "Iqbal's lawsuit is not dead, however.",
        "The court specifically left intact the ongoing lawsuit against prison guards and low-level officials.",
        "And it did not foreclose the possibility of the lawsuit against Ashcroft and Mueller continuing.",
        "Lawyers representing Iqbal said today they would seek to amend their complaint to keep the lawsuit against Ashcroft and Mueller alive.",
        "Cardozo law professor Alexander Reinert, one of Iqbal's attorneys, conceded today's ruling makes his task more difficult, but he downplayed its significance.",
        "The court's decision clearly contemplates that individuals such as General Ashcroft and Mr. Mueller can be held liable, provided sufficient allegations are made and those allegations are proven.",
        "And so in that sense, we don't think it stops us in our tracks at all.",
        "It's a temporary detour, but we intend to continue with our case against these defendants.",
        "ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt, who was not involved in this case, echoed that sentiment.",
        "Taking the opinion at its word, I do not think it sets up an insurmountable barrier.",
        "I also have no doubt these plaintiffs will likely be able to get over the barrier on remand and to re-plead their case, given everything we know that's come out since this complaint was filed — including what the Justice Department itself found in an internal report.",
        "Gelernt acknowledged, however, that there's a danger in today's ruling for people seeking redress throughout the entire legal system if, in his words, the opinion is overread by the lower courts."

        "Many of them took part in protests that began early last year, when Musharraf moved to oust Pakistan's chief justice.",
