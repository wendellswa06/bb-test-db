        "First, remind us about the first commission proceedings back in August of 2004.",
        "Yes.",

        "So many things went wrong.",
        "These were proceedings that were designed to be speedy and efficient.",
        "And in the end, they have ended up being neither.",
        "The translation broke down repeatedly.",
        "At one point, one of the detainees blurted halfway through a confession and the court finally shut him down.",
        "He had already fired his lawyer, so there was a lot confusion over the rules.",
        "And that was exacerbated by the fact that there was no video or photo or even audio recording evidence of those proceedings.",
        "Reporters were allowed to come in and just carry a pen and a pad.",
        "So unlike the Nuremberg trials, there was really very little scrutiny.",
        "There were a few people that were allowed in from international organizations like the ABA and Amnesty International.",
        "And in the end, those people were heavily critical of the way those proceedings went.",
        "And in the first one, three of the panelists were disqualified.",
        "Later on, one of them acknowledged that he didn't know what the Geneva Conventions were.",
        "This is the primary body of international law, theoretically, that they were using to determine some of these cases.",
        "And in those proceedings what was the role of the military as opposed to the CIA or other agencies of the U.S.",
        "government?",
        "The IRS agent insists that she does not find it funny.",
        "Well, I think that this is the fundamental question: How do we re-imagine, how do we remake the social contract when the generations no longer really look like one another?",
        "How do we then create a narrative of our nation where our shared fate - regardless of generation - now involves folk of very, very different ethnicities, languages, immigration histories, while we continue to emphasize the sheer qualities of what makes us all Americans?",
        "Do you think, as we move - we have seen ourselves, I think it's fair to say, as a white-dominated country that's not necessarily going to change any time soon."

        "Half of all Hispanics now consider themselves white.",
        "So then we need to talk about an off-white phenomenon.",
        "How do we think about the fact that 100 years ago, near where I am now, here in the Lower East Side of New York, huge numbers of Italians and Irish and eastern Europeans came to our country, and they weren't - certainly were not viewed as white.",
        "So this is a story that has been with us for 100, 150 years.",
        "How do we remake the social fabric of the nation as we absorb new cohorts of Americans by choice?",
        "Yet, as you speak from New York City, that's a place that's been, historically, one of the great membranes of America, where people come in, are absorbed and changed, then move out.",
        "But for so long, because of the immigration laws, much of the rest of the country was inoculated from change, from demographic change, and that has changed remarkably over the past, what, 20 years or so.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The story of the South is a story that really tells how much we've changed.",
        "As you look at the fastest growth of the Hispanic-origin population of the United States, it's really taking place in the South.",
        "It was really just the spectacular growth of the real estate sector, construction, that really worked as a huge magnet recruiting workers from all over the world, especially from Latin America, Mexico, Central America during the 1980s, '90s.",
        "And that's - what we see today is a kind of - the demographic echo of that story.",
        "I guess in the 2000 census, the story really was a story of immigration.",
        "Today, 12 years later, the story is a story of the children.",
        "That inevitably becomes part of the story when a society has experienced large-scale migration, really, over two generations now.",
