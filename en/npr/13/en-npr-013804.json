        "(Reading) Today, I introduced my co-workers to the St. Louis secret of ordering bagels bread-sliced.",
        "It was a hit.",
        "That's Alek Krautmann reading the tweet he posted along with a picture of two boxes of bagels.",
        "Each bagel inside is sliced vertically multiple times.",
        "So what's his excuse?",
        "I think it's better for sharing and snacking, and I guess that's why we do it.",
        "I don't know.",
        "Krautmann traces this back to the St. Louis Bread Company, which is known in every other part of the country as Panera.",
        "We went straight to the source and called up Sara Burnett, Panera's vice president of wellness and food policy.",
        "That's how we used to sample bagels.",
        "So we'd have a new flavor, we'd pass them around as a bread slice.",
        "So it's a nice, little, easy, dippable slice of bagel.",
        "And that started in St. Louis because we started sampling in St. Louis.",
        "Little did she know that would lead so many to take a bite of this action.",
        "The chief of detectives of the New York City Police Department weighed in and thanked his Twitter followers for reporting bread-sliced bagels as a crime.",
        "The mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, tweeted, St. Louis, we're really worried about you.",
        "Give me a call.",
        "It's about bagels.",
        "One thing is undeniable - any way you slice it, people love their bagels.",

        "So what…",
        "Good to be with you.",
        "It's great to have you on.",
        "What's going on in New Hampshire today?",
        "New Hampshire today is unseasonably warm.",
        "It has a gray overcast and it has a lot of candidates campaigning as though their lives depended on it.",
        "And we have, I think, a highly emotionally charged situation on the Democratic side, where the crowds following Obama around the state are not only were setting records, but they are also reaching extraordinarily high peaks of emotionality.",
        "In some of these events, the candidate is clearly energized by these.",
        "It's really driving him to new heights of oratory.",
        "At the same time, you have an almost tragic sense around the Clinton campaign where the sudden demotion of the previous frontrunner has clearly had a huge impact on the campaigners around her, her staff, her longtime loyalists, her family, which has been traveling with her, of course - Chelsea and former president Bill Clinton.",
        "And today, just about an hour ago, at her event, Senator Clinton actually seem to begin to weep at one point when she was imploring her supporters to stay with her, imploring people to compare her qualifications for office with those of Senator Obama and really bringing this to a very personal degree of importance to herself and to her supporters.",
        "So this has really been quite an emotional morning in the New Hampshire campaign with the first votes to be cast tomorrow morning.",
        "That sounds incredibly dramatic.",
        "What other tones and textures have you found in New Hampshire in terms of, for example, have senators - has Senator Obama and has Governor Huckabee, have they been crowing out their victory or what has been the tone of any of their engagements?",
        "Well, I think on the Republican side, you see quite a different dynamic playing out because the people who boosted Mike Huckabee to his victory in Iowa are largely absent here - that is to say the demographic group, the evangelical Christians who were so important to him in Iowa and who made up, in fact, a very large proportion of the entire Republican vote in Iowa and went very heavily for the governor.",
        "There are not quite so many people who so identify themselves here in New Hampshire, and there has been some resentment among New Hampshire Republicans in general at the suggestion that they would like the Iowa Republicans flock to this Baptist minister from Arkansas.",
        "They haven't."

        "military custody.",
        "There is a small number of people that have been in CIA custody.",

        "The ACLU Director Anthony Romero called it one of the worst civil liberty measures ever enacted in American history, and that kind of echoes what House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said.",
        "She says because it allows the president to interpret the Geneva Conventions through executive order, it invites other countries to do the same.",

        "Supreme Court.",
        "Whether the court takes it up, that remains to be seen.",
        "But critics could argue, for example, that allowing the president to interpret international law is itself a violation of international law.",
        "It also - this new law allows the denial of habeas corpus, so a detainee cannot go to the courts theoretically and it require reasons for his detention.",
        "That's another thing that could be challenged under international law.",
        "And I've talked to a lawyer who specialized in this just a moment ago and he said, rest assured, there will be challenges.",
