        "You know why does he always have to defend himself against being a Muslim?",
        "Where are we now, years after the 9/11 attacks, in the middle of two wars, in terms not just of the plurality issue as it comes to race, but when it comes to religion, have we moved forward or backwards?",
        "I would say, I believe we're in a holding pattern overall.",
        "I think right now, the good news for Obama and the bad news for McCain, we are so concerned with the economic picture.",
        "We are so concerned by the fact that we're fighting two wars right now, that has a different - the idea of whether Barack Obama is a scary, and I'm using scare quotes here, is a scary Muslim has less impact than it might have in bountiful times.",
        "Particularly in swaying an independent moderate view - moderate voter, but if you - if you are on the web as much as I am and read everything coming from all directions.",
        "There is - I would say it's more than a fringe on the right of center that has grave concerns about a person's religion, and what it would mean to have a Muslim commander-in-chief, and what his alliances would be because of his religion, his particular belief in God.",
        "We have, you know just one member of Congress who is Muslim, and he happens to be also African American, black American-born, and converted.",
        "And he has come out with a statement, Keith Ellison, praising General Powell's remarks about who is an American.",
        "It strikes me, Rob, that on November 5th this country will still have Muslims, Christians, atheists, Hindus, Jews, any number of other religions that probably some of which I haven't even heard about.",
        "Atheists.",
        "Yeah, you know, and so these things that we're discussing are not going to stop when the election stops.",
        "So is it going to be a will to have a discussion maybe once politics is off the table per se, and just really have a national, you know, meeting of the minds on - on what constitutes being an American.",
        "It depends on if Barack Obama wants it, I'm not sure he does, you know.",
        "Now you're assuming Barack Obama has won.",
        "Well, I assume that Barack Obama at this point is going to win the election, and short of a startling revelation where they can actually prove that he actually is a Muslim, which will be a problem for some people, which I'm not thinking of as a problem at all, I agree with Powell.",
        "I've been taking that tact forever saying that so what if he is a Muslim, and I think that's highly offensive that other them, that whole other them is so offensive, but back the point of your question.",
        "There needs to be a dialogue, I'm not sure there will be one, there definitely won't be one if John McCain's elected.",
        "One thing that has come up, Carmen, is whether or not, and we've discussed this before but I think it's good to take the temperature, whether or not there's a cult of Obama that is totally counterproductive.",
        "That people are just invested in, OK, I'm going to get the T-shirt.",
        "I'm going to, you know, go and talk about this all the time, but maybe not get deeper on the issues.",
        "What's your weigh in on how the cult of Obama is doing these days?",
        "The good news I think the cult of Obama is being swamped by those of us who are thinking and have made a reasoned decision, but does the cult of Obama exist?",
        "Absolutely, and perhaps even more fervently than the cult of McCain/Palin, which exists as well.",
        "But my concern is actually, and I don't know if we're really going to get into this, but I have heard some incidents of people doing hateful things, who believe Obama's going win, sort of exerting their muscle, like who do you think you are, you wait till Obama gets in, some really crazy stuff like that."
