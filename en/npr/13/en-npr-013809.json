        "And you can make things with it up to about the size of a loaf of bread.",
        "Now, if you want to spend more money, you can - there's machines out there, or if you want to make it yourself, you can make a machine that's even bigger.",

        "The marine industry and the aerospace industry, they want to be able to build parts that are several meters in length, and so that is certainly a limitation.",

        "While there are a lot of plastics and metals and composites out there, we need more.",

        "You can make structures that you cannot make any other way, and I think that's - you know, if there's one important message, I think, about these printers, it's not about how you duplicate things that you make today with other techniques, but it's how you explore, as we said, the new frontiers of design, making things you can't imagine today.",
        "And that's really the direction.",
        "The bottom line is that with these printers, complexity is free.",
        "For the first time in human history, making something complicated, with details and features, is not more difficult than making a paperweight.",
        "It takes the same amount of resources and skills in terms of manufacturing.",

        "So - you - there's experiments being done with making electronics on - but those are still early days.",
        "That's one of the good frontiers.",
        "But you can definitely make robot parts that either come off and move together, and you would just add a servo or a motor, and you're - and you could make a remote - we love to make remote-controlled cars and remote-controlled battlebots and all these kind of things.",
        "It's really an endless possibility of how much - what you like to do.",
        "Whatever you like to do, MakerBot it.",
        "We've made, in the lab - we've printed a battery, a real, working battery.",
        "You made a battery with all the extra parts in it?",
        "A battery with all the materials in it.",
        "And we've made - and we've printed an outrigger, a motor, out of raw materials.",

        "Hod Lipson, have you been able to make anything - is there anything you don't think that you can make?",
        "I mean, is there a limit to what you can make, or when you - for example, when you make the battery and the parts, do you have to stop the printer and put new material for the insides of the battery, outside of the battery.",
        "Or is it all a one-step process?",
        "It's a one-step process.",
        "So you preload the printer with five different materials for the battery, and it goes.",
        "Now, the challenge is you have to spend some time thinking about how to make a battery out of purely materials that you can squirt out of a syringe in our case.",
        "And, for example, a battery, if you take apart a conventional battery, it has a - what is called a separation layer that's typically made out of paper.",
        "And we could print everything, but ironically, we couldn't print the paper.",
        "We had to actually think of some other material to replace that.",

        "You know, I think that - you know, one of the technological breakthroughs isn't really what you would think of as normal technology, but it's the culture of sharing.",
        "So one thing Hod and I both share is we both make machines, and we do research.",
        "And we release it, and we let anybody do anything they like with it.",
        "This culture of sharing is something that means, really, there's nothing we can't do with a community, and, you know, it means that whatever we do, that people will stand on our shoulders, and, you know, it happens.",
        "And then people stand on those people's shoulders.",
        "And then, you know, I can stand on Hod's shoulders, and then Hod can stand on my shoulders.",
