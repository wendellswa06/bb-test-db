        "And I think that at this point we haven't the slightest idea.",
        "I think you're absolutely right.",
        "I think it was also - I was going to say I think it's also interesting that, just to add to the theatrics of it, President Bush actually went there last night.",
        "He pulled out Dikembe Mutombo.",
        "He pulled out Wesley Autrey, whose daughter I think was echoing the sentiment of most of America.",
        "She was asleep next to him when everything was going on.",
        "And Wesley was so New York, he had peace signs and everything up and I love it.",
        "He needs to write a book and go out on the speaking circuit.",
        "But I think that, as we said, it's largely ceremonial on all points.",
        "And I think that if people, the American people, all of us, I think really want to hear not just the rhetoric but exactly what kind of proposals do we have for cutting out 20 percent of the gas use for the next 10 years.",
        "What kind of proposals do you have to win this war?",
        "It seems like I heard a call for a mercenary organization being created when you're going to create citizens that could be armed, that could be hired to be sent over to fight a war.",
        "That kind of scared me, so I'd like to hear more about the details.",
        "Well, I think we have E.R.",
        "back.",

        "I was particularly impressed that he connected the dots between the money we're spending in Iraq and the money we're not spending in New Orleans and the rest of the Gulf Coast.",
        "And it sounded to me a bit like what Martin Luther King Jr. did in the last year of his life in connecting the money we were spending in Vietnam to the lack of money and vision we had for the urban areas of this country.",

        "We've been talking about the president's speech.",
        "But let's move on to another topic for today.",
        "And that's this - a new poll by the BBC says the United States' image took a hard hit last year, rising to 52 percent for those who see our global influence negatively.",
        "The sample came from 25 countries.",
        "Issues like the war in Iraq, prisoners at Guantanamo Bay - these are among the reasons given for this deepening negative slide.",
        "So how might a change in war strategy - I'm going to come back to you, E.R - How might a change in war strategy change that global perception?",
        "And how long would it take to turn it around, or can it be turned around?",
        "Well, first of all, we're not quite sure what the change in strategy is.",
        "It involves sending more troops in, and we just saw that on Monday, I believe it was, 88 Iraqis were blown up in a marketplace in Baghdad, hundreds of others were wounded.",
        "We're sending more troops into that.",
        "I don't see much of the allies joining with us in sending in more troops.",
        "So the strategy part is the first question to ask.",
        "But it should not be so surprising that the rest of the world has these negative views because Iraq is such a monstrous issue and no one knows how to extricate ourselves from this in a way that makes the U.S.",
        "look OK and in a way that maybe helps Iraq to get its acts together."

        "I want to come to you because I'd like to know who do you think is best suited among these four presidential candidates - Clinton, Obama, McCain and Giuliani - with regard to campaigning for dollars privately.",
        "Yes.",
        "We'll never go to the ballet again.",
        "Well, that's a hard question, Tony.",
        "As far as I'm concerned, obviously, optimally we want to stand well in the world's opinion so that if we need to do something, we can bring allies in to do it with us.",
        "And that means not only things involving guns but maybe things involving global warming or talk about the immigration debate.",
        "But then on the other hand, I don't know.",

        "They're not thinking of me so much as black as the American, and my president is George Bush.",
        "And the conversations have gotten worse and worse despite the fact that politically I am very much a centrist.",
        "There is this absolute hatred of everything the man does, everything that America has stood for about the past 10 years.",
        "And this is the crucial part of it.",
        "Sometimes it seems to me that it's kind of like what I sense in the Democrats here, there's a joy in hating President Bush that goes beyond any kind of empirical argument.",
        "I have heard 13-year-olds in Europe say very anti-American things before Iraq and before Afghanistan just because they like railing their fists at the big monster.",
        "And to an extent, I'm not sure how much we could do about anti-American sentiment at this point.",
        "It is not a surprise.",
        "It is only going to get worse given what's going on in Iraq.",
        "And, you know, Kyoto comes up every time you talk to somebody from outside of this country.",

        "So would you say, Jeff, that when the president, this president, you know, leaves office in a couple of years, that that opens the door for a new look at America?",

        "Right now - last night, we talked about winning the war on terror, but how do you win the war on terror?",
        "Is some united terrorist society going to submit a surrender notice eventually via telegram or the Internet?",
        "It's very nebulous, so until we define an enemy and then quickly end this, I think we're going to be going through a quagmire for some time to come.",
        "One of the points that you raise was who would be the next president, and that leads me right into our third topic, our last one for today.",
        "New York Senator Hillary Clinton will not accept public campaign financing for her run for president.",

        "What's new is that she is the first to decline public financing for both the primary and the general election.",
        "Some are already calling it a very smart move because it frees her to raise as much money as she can without restriction.",
        "Now Senator Clinton's decision is expected to influence how other presidential hopefuls raise money, although she is the first to commit to this strategy publicly.",
        "E.R., kind of briefly, the question is can you run a campaign, a winning campaign without - with public fund limitation.",
        "Let make sure I'm clear on that.",
        "Can you run a winning campaign with public fund limitations?",
        "With limitations.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It doesn't seem that one can.",
        "If you're talking about needing $500 million to be elected, then you cannot go to the public funding system.",
        "It seems to me not so scary that she's taking this route.",
        "And it would obviously lead other candidates to do the same to try to catch up to her, because there's so many more watchdog entities out there these days, whether you're talking about people who are blogging, as I have begun to do in the last week, or you're talking about various foundations that are set up to look into funding sources.",
        "So I think because this whole public election funds idea came about because of the crisis of Watergate, I think we've moved beyond that and I'm pretty confident that we're not going to be in trouble if the candidates for the president don't go through this system.",
        "I would differ if we're talking about city council races and that kind of thing.",
        "Thank you.",

        "I'm a little perplexed at all of the journalistic prattle about, you know, who's spending more money and polls done 10 minutes ago, et cetera.",
        "Obama has a massive charm, a massive charisma that Hillary Clinton has never had.",
        "And it seems to me that he could almost get away with just using the public system.",

        "I think that white America is in love with him for reasons that are both good and bad.",
        "I don't think he's going to have any trouble with black America.",
        "And so we can talk about what Hillary Clinton is doing, but I think we really need to be thinking about our great black hope and the kind of power that somebody like that can have above and beyond the mundane issues of how many millions he spends on his campaign stocks.",
