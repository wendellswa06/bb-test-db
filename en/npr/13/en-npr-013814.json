        "We like to know that we're progressing through the queue.",
        "So that seems to be the most important thing.",
        "So, when somebody says, your call will be answered in one hour and 26 minutes, if somebody comes back 12 minutes later and says one hour and 14 minutes, we're feeling better?",
        "I think so.",
        "I mean, that's a pretty extreme example.",

        "What some of the researchers have found is that it kind of reminds us that we're waiting.",
        "So, one of the researchers I spoke to, Anat Rafaeli from the Israel Institute of Technology, had done a study.",
        "And what she suggested is when you're listening to music or you're being given information about moving forward in the cue, all of a sudden, this apology springs up.",
        "We don't believe it because it's this robotic voice that sounds more patronizing than anything else.",
        "And so, it just breaks us out of whatever we are in and, oh, yeah, I'm still waiting.",
        "This is terrible.",

        "But in a case like this, when you're dealing with historical documents, what do blogs actually bring to the table when discussing a story like this, which is pretty hot on the blogosphere?",
        "Well, I would say the best part of blogs reporting something of this nature is that you - the important questions get asked about what took place.",
        "In particular with this one, I wasn't that all surprised that the FBI was investigating.",
        "It was run by Hoover, who was astonishingly against the civil rights movement, and not afraid of taking measures that were borderline illegal.",
        "But I think what the blogs do is they ask the question.",

        "Why are these records just not coming out?",

        "I'm kind of hoping he stumbles a little bit because - and it is because I'm bias.",
        "I'm definitely voting on a Democratic ticket this year.",
        "He's probably the only Republican I'm really worried about, mostly because his run is a symbolic run.",
        "He's been smart enough to stay out of the debate so far, by waiting to announce.",
        "And so he's in a position where he doesn't have to worry about tripping up on what he said in the past.",
        "He can just work - focus on the future.",
        "And he kind of stands in that deposition that Reagan did.",
        "He's an actor.",
        "He's a moderate Republican, at least, on the surface.",
        "And he doesn't come across as somebody who's connected to the past mistakes of the president and to the past mistakes of the Congress.",

        "Ah, it's possible certainly because he's a, you know, a moderate conservative, and he already has high visibility given the fact that he's already been a senator, and, plus, his acting roles on \"\"Law & Order\"\" and other, you know, avenues there.",
        "So I think what's going to happen is that it'll make a lot of people on the conservative Republican side very excited because what I'm hearing on my blog from people who are, you know, black and Republican and conservative, are that they don't feel like there's many candidates that they can choose from, who they can really get excited about and get behind.",

        "He's actually been campaigning all this time.",
        "And I've been listening to some of his speeches on C-SPAN and he's not really saying anything.",
        "He's just making a lot of symbolic statements, a lot of symbolic gestures.",
        "He actually has to catch up to some of the Republicans.",
        "And I think, and this is an opinion not being a Republican, I guess, okay.",
        "But I think he has to catch up to some of the other Republican candidates who have been making very specific statements appealing to very specific branches of their core.",
        "So, he's missing some of his own party.",
        "His big advantage is, as Brandon said, he's an actor, capable of putting across the symbolic candidacy that the Republican Party is looking for."

        "I want to actually stay with you, Earl, and move on to another topic - very interesting one: Ireland.",
        "There are reports that the Republic of Ireland -that's the south - the bulk of the island is opening a predominantly black school in a Dublin suburb.",
        "I've been to Dublin, loved that city, very diverse city in a country, which is majority white.",
        "And so Ireland's education system is actually bursting at the seams and the school is going to cater to the needs of 70 kids whose parents missed the enrolment deadline, mainly parents of African descent.",
        "And some say white parents missed the deadline, too, but their kids still got seats.",
        "There's a whole bunch of different issues here including that many schools require there be a certificate of baptism and some of these students, these African students, are Muslim.",
        "What does this say about the kind of rough path of diversity in education, not just in the U.S.",

        "Ireland - I'm disturbed by it a little bit.",
        "I know that the IRA actually pitched in with the Black Liberation movement earlier.",
        "So in Ireland, there is a consciousness of race dealing with black people specifically not just the tribalism of Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland and Great Britain.",
        "Oh, well, we want listeners in on this conversation.",

        "I would like to give them a little time, though.",
        "Because as you say, they're pretty diverse over in Dublin right now and this is the first real blunder that I've heard of.",
        "So I'd say let's back up a little bit and see if they can correct that.",
        "Shay, do you think it's just absolutely crazy to think of starting a black school or is it something that was just a logistical glitch?",
        "Well, I think that, first of all, it's just interesting to me how Europe is always chastising America about racial issues from their lily-white soapbox.",
        "Yet when they, you know, get confronted with racial diversity, the racism really emerges such as in this case.",
        "Now, I'm not of the opinion that an all-black school means that, you know, they're not going to achieve and I don't believe that integration - racial integration is important to black's success necessarily.",
        "But what I do find interesting is that what will probably come from this because it's an all-black school as people will say that African immigrants or the children of African immigrants didn't want to integrate into society and never mind that these individuals were trying to get into the preexisting system.",
        "But yet, black children even Catholic ones were not able to get into these slots.",
        "But, yet, whites, whether they were Protestants or agnostic or atheist and who have moved into the area later, were able to get slots.",
        "You know, so that immigrants weren't clamoring for a new system in the first place.",
        "What I'd like to see them do is craft the school in a way that would suit them in the particular needs of the black children there.",
        "Brandon, Europe is becoming way more multi-ethnic and multicultural.",
        "a lot of immigrants.",
        "Is this something that other countries are probably going to have face and figure out things in ways that America is still struggling with?",
        "To a certain extent.",
        "Europe doesn't have the same history in terms of discrimination within their own nations that the United States has, so I don't think that they're going to have the same type of problem.",
        "And I hesitate to say that Ireland did that purely on racial issues.",
        "In all likelihood -considering it's Ireland - it's probably more religious and that 98 percent of those schools are Catholic schools.",
        "But - and this is a generalization, but looking at past performance, I'm surprised they didn't let those students in because African students tend to be overachievers in terms of education."

        "So it is not the case that there isn't enough time to do it.",
        "There is not political will to do it.",
        "And I'd like to see that will developed.",

        "He hit those points, all right.",
        "But those can be addressed at the same time as impeachment as Iraq because nobody is - I mean, the entire population of the House of Representatives is scattered all over Washington in little meeting rooms while they're holding their cases anyway.",
