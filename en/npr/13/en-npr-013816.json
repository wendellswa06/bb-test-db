        "Hi, Neal.",
        "I just - when I was calling a helpdesk person, service for - Internet service provider, one of the things that they did which I thought was really interesting is they actually had a DJ.",
        "When you're on hold and they played music and they said, yeah, we have about 1,100 callers right now.",
        "And, you know, we're going to get to you as soon as we can.",
        "But they played display different music.",
        "But there was a guy, an actual DJ, while you were on hold playing different music and telling you, you know, what they call queues look like, how many people are calling and how long the average wait time was.",
        "And it was live.",
        "It was real time.",
        "So you were getting play by play?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It was fantastic.",
        "And the company, you know, was a really great company.",
        "They got acquired at - you know, and, the Internet service provider, you know, I was having problems with dial up, and called them up and not only did they help fix my problem, they kept me entertained, and on the phone for quite a long time while I was waiting to get the service.",
        "Russ Juskalian, that seems like an inventive approach.",
        "Yeah, it does.",
        "It definitely captures us in that wanting-to-move-forward sort of thing, and I think it makes us feel like someone's paying attention to us, even if there's nothing else going on.",
        "And did you eventually get through, Michael?",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes, I did.",
        "I eventually got through, and I got taken care of.",
        "But, you know, the idea of having the actual, like radio DJ on, you know, on the hold and kind of talking you through and playing the music - playing music every once in a while was really - was one of the most memorable times on hold that I actually (unintelligible) I quite enjoyed.",
        "As jobs and radio dwindle, we're all in favor of this.",
        "Michael, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Thanks, Neal.",
        "Bye-bye.",

        "And then, do they counsel the people who eventually have to - the live people who are eventually on the other end of that phone - to deal with the rage that they have incurred in their callers by - who have held on the line for unconscionable amounts of time?",

        "Because there's this feedback loop of negative responses that starts happening.",
