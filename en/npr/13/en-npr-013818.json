        "She's a House member who's voted with the president 62 percent of the time according to FiveThirtyEight.",
        "So she really, you know, pushed on those centrist moderate credentials and, you know, ran trying to get crossover Republican votes and independent votes, which there are quite a lot of independents here in Arizona.",
        "Well, that's so interesting because this is a moment where a lot of polling is suggesting the Democratic voters in much of the United States want people they send to Washington to take a very confrontational approach to President Trump and really go after him.",
        "She's talking about how much she voted along with the president.",
        "So who are the voters who are sending her to Washington?",
        "I think she did get a lot of those crossover Republicans and a lot of independents, those suburban women that everybody talks about who are just kind of upset with the divisiveness in Washington.",
        "And her opponent did kind of embrace the president.",
        "And so Sinema running as a very moderate candidate, that was a successful strategy for her.",
        "And I think that she's likely to kind of govern in the same way and not necessarily take on the president directly.",
        "But she - you know, maybe on the big issues vote with her party but try as much as possible to, you know, work across the aisle - that's kind of the brand she's made for herself.",
        "And another interesting thing that could happen here - I mean, we heard the two candidates with - you know, sounding - you know, it was civil - I mean, a lot of civility in both their voices.",
        "The governor might be appointing a new senator for John McCain's seat, if Jon Kyl resigns from that seat, and might appoint McSally.",

        "That is a possibility.",
        "I think that Governor Ducey - you know, he's a very cautious politician.",
        "And so he is going to kind of read the political tea leaves and see what's the right decision.",

        "He's a mentor for her.",
