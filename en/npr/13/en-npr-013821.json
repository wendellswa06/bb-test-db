        "And is Brad Stout's experience being shared across the board, do you think?",
        "Well, I think that he is seeing, you know, some trends that retailers are seeing across the country, which is that, as the holiday season has progressed, traffic has picked up inside stores.",
        "Sales have increased.",
        "But compared to last year, they're still not where they were.",
        "Saturday is typically the busiest shopping season - shopping day of the holiday season, and so, you're going to see a lot of people out in the stores.",
        "You're going to see a lot of people in that parking lot.",
        "But when you look at the comparison to last year, it's just not living up to what it was in 2007.",
        "I was interested looking at your face as he was describing his sales technique - don't slash your prices on stuff you have to reorder, just cut the prices way down stuff you're trying to get rid of.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That doesn't seem to be followed by a lot of people.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, he has - I think that he has some - that he has some benefit of being a small retailer in that folks will come and shop to his store - shop at his store because they know that they're supporting him.",
        "They're supporting a local business.",
        "But for a lot of large retailers, they're finding that customers know that if they simply waited out, that the merchandise will go on sale.",
        "So you're finding a lot of retailers just really cut prices across the board.",
        "I was out at a Macy's before I came here, and it seemed like every single rack had a 20, 25 percent off sign on top of it.",
        "So, you know, there is a lot of discounting going on out there.",
        "But retailers really have to be careful that they don't sort of give all the merchandise away.",

        "People just want their basic stuff, and they are buying some gifts from me, but they are buying basics for their daughters.",
        "So, the specialty stuff having a hard time moving, the basic stuff is selling?",

        "Right.",
        "You know, you're seeing a lot of folks stick to the basics.",
        "During this time when people are afraid about their jobs, maybe afraid about looking at their 401K, they're not willing to splurge and to take a risk on something that someone may or may not like that maybe they may or may not use.",
        "So they're saying what is this person going to use for sure?",
        "What is this person definitely going to like?",
