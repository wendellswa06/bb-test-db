        "So, people are saying, I want my dollar to do not only good for the product that I'm buying, but also good for the business I'm buying it from.",
        "And, Bob, you're echoing that?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And not just buying local, but buying from somebody I know, buying from somebody who has been in touch with me several times a year, buying with somebody I have a relationship with."
