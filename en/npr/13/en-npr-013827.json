        "Because the family was unhappy with just the way the paper was going, and may be the financial situation?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think they were philosophically opposed to the way that the paper had moved from the far right to the center.",
        "In addition to that, profits began to slide a little bit in the late 1980s.",
        "Those profits really took a nosedive.",
        "Times-Mirror began selling off its properties.",
        "Ultimately, it wound up with the paper having to be sold to the Tribune Company and the Chandler family bowing out entirely.",
        "But in the meantime, Otis's reign, as probably one of the greatest publishers of the 20th century, had come to a final and sad end.",

        "In one sense, it is par for the course because there has always been very acute competition between the two for decades.",
        "In another sense, it's different, and that is that the North Koreans have been doing more and more provocations recently.",
        "And in 2010, they basically violated the armistice by sinking a South Korean naval vessel and then shelling an island.",
        "And it was that point that the South Korean government and people said we're not taking this anymore, and the next time you do this we're going to strike back.",
        "And this time, both the government and the public have said we're not taking this anymore.",
        "So, when the north starts saying this like we're ending the armistice and we're threatening to do these things, there's much more of an edge to it in terms of the inter-Korean dynamic because I think everybody's worried about escalation.",
        "So, let's get to this bizarre diplomatic visit by former NBA star Dennis Rodman.",
        "He was cozying up with Kim Jong Un.",
        "We saw pictures of the two embracing and at the basketball game and having dinner.",
        "What is the significance of Rodman's trip, do you think?",
        "I think the primary significance is to try to understand the new North Korean leadership.",
        "And I think Rodman's meeting with him tells us that unpredictability is really the new normal in North Korean relations.",
        "We knew quite a bit about the former leader of North Korea and how he operated, but we know very little about the new leader.",
        "And his antics in many ways are quite unpredictable - whether it's going to an amusement park, not meeting with the chairman of Google but meeting with Dennis Rodman - it's just a very, very bizarre leadership.",
        "I mean, is this just as simple as Kim Jung Un really likes basketball and he's just a fan of Dennis Rodman or are there people out there like yourself who are reading into this saying, oh, maybe this means he is in some way looking for closer ties to the West?",
        "Well, he definitely loves basketball, we know that.",
        "And I think you're right.",
        "I mean, I think he just loves basketball, he loves the Chicago Bulls and he wanted to meet with Rodman.",
        "But I think it tells us that he's interested in some of these things and perhaps interested in interacting more with the world.",
        "The problem is that the history of the nuclear negotiations shows that he wants all of these things but he doesn't want to give up his nuclear weapons.",
        "And 25 years of U.S.",
        "diplomacy has been based on the notion that there was a quid pro quo.",
        "You can join the West, we can normalize relations, sign the peace treaty but you have to give up the weapons.",
        "Meanwhile, it is my understanding that North Korea's relationship with China has kind of chilled recently.",
        "What is the significance of that?",
        "I mean, China is North Korea's most staunch ally."

        "But we have to see whether they follow through and enforce the sanctions that are in this resolution to really punish North Korea.",
