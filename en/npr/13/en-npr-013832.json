        "And I think many, especially younger people who are studying architecture, sometimes want to remake the world through architecture.",
        "And I think, you know, to some extent you can, but you have to be modest about it as well.",
        "Because sometimes, you know, you can be in the most beautiful building in the world, but if you've got a headache that headache will wipe out any advantage that the building might have been able to provide.",

        "And I just wanted to comment on how, you know, coupled with being there for mass, it just kind of has a surreal, almost spiritual feeling and effect on -and I think that building has affected me more than any other, you know, building I've stepped in before.",
        "I think that's fascinating.",
        "I think that churches and religious buildings generally teach us a lot about architecture.",
        "They really teach us a very basic lesson, which is we don't think the same way wherever we are, that there are certain buildings that put us in certain frames of mind.",
        "You know, a well decorated, a beautiful church will put us into a mindset where we're more receptive to dwelling on certain issues.",

        "That's right.",
        "I mean if you look at architecture all over the West, you know, right from, I don't know, San Francisco to St. Petersburg, there was a consensus for hundreds of years that a beautiful building, especially a courthouse or an important building, should be a classical building.",

        "Suddenly you get a new choice in architecture.",
        "And whereas choice is a wonderful thing in many areas of life, when it comes to architecture, if you have a city or a town where all the buildings look different, they all seem like they're in a way having an argument among themselves.",
        "That can be very disorienting and confusing.",
        "And among many architects for really a hundred years or so, there's been a search to try and find some style which would win everyone over so that we wouldn't have chaos in our cities, and that search is ongoing.",
        "You point, for example, to the city of Bath in England which is beautifully designed, unifiedly designed, and presents an incredible impression when you come upon it that was not built at much greater expense or much greater trouble than a lot of places which are considerably less distinguished.",
        "That's right, and what's nice about a city like Bath is that every street is more or less the same.",

        "And some of the nicest cities in the world are really quite simple.",
        "You know, it's just the same unit that keeps being repeated.",
        "And part of the problem with contemporary architecture is the belief that the architect is a kind of lone genius whose task it is to produce something utterly different from what's come before.",
        "And that's led in many cases to streets which are seriously sort of disconnected and are not giving out a coherent message.",

        "It looked like flames were gushing out at one point of two apartment buildings, one - two apartments, one on top of the other.",
