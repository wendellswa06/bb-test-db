        "No, it's okay.",
        "I also had another question.",
        "Because when you were just talking about the city of Bath and how a lot of the streets - the architecture all looks the same.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Relatively.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean do you think that sometimes when architecture is repeated in a row, like on a street, is it poor architecture that gives you a bad feeling when you see something like that?",
        "Because my family moved to a neighborhood when I was a teenager and the houses were all the same.",
        "I mean they all looked exactly the same, and I couldn't stand it.",

        "Pardon?",
        "Does the phrase ticky-tacky apply here?",
        "Kind of.",
        "I mean, like they were just all the same, and I just couldn't stand the neighborhood.",
        "And I just didn't know if that was because it was poor architecture, because it just didn't give me a sense of comfort.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I don't think that buildings being alike on their own will necessarily make it good, but when you have a good design like you do in Bath and like you have in many parts - I mean, many parts of New York City, for example, are very repetitive.",
        "It's the same kind of building type just repeated again and again.",
        "And it looks nice because, you know, the building type is good.",
        "And I think one of the things we often seek from our architecture is a kind of calming influence.",
        "We don't necessarily want every single building to be different, because that's as irritating and as aggravating as, you know, if people are all shouting at the same time.",
        "So we're often looking for calm, and repetition can be a good quality.",

        "And there's a fascinating example you give in the book, comparing buildings drawn by two different German architects for two different World's Fairs and how they express absolutely clearly the nature of the governments that built them.",
        "That's right.",
        "I mean, buildings are extremely - sort of, if you want - eloquent things.",
        "They do communicate all sorts of emotions.",
        "And whenever architects are asked to design things like embassies - but also kind of parliaments and big civic buildings - they often have to ask themselves, you know, what does my country believe in?",
        "What do I want to say about the world through my building?",
        "And if you look at the history of German embassies in the 20th century, it's fascinating.",
        "You know, during the Nazi period, you see a building - which even if you take away the Nazi flags, etc., you look at it and you think that is an aggressive building.",
        "You just - you feel the aggression coming out of the window frames, the roof, the ceiling moldings - everything about it says aggression."

        "You look at some of the embassies that were done in the ‘50s by German architects, and it says this is the product of a country that is devoted to democracy and openness and lightness and communication between the inside and the outside.",
        "And in a way, you get a kind of moral message.",
        "So - and this is true not just of embassies.",
        "All buildings, as it were, tell us a story about how their owners see the world.",
        "And when we say that a building is beautiful - when we use that word beautiful - really what we're saying is we kind of like the vision of life that's coming out of a building.",
        "So, beauty isn't just a sort of aesthetic word.",
        "It's a word about, you know, how we want to live - which is why it sort of inspired me to give my book the title The Architecture of Happiness, because there's a lovely quote from the French writer Stendhal, where he says to think of something as beautiful is to see in it a promise of happiness.",
        "So it's all about seeing in beautiful things a promise of a good life.",
        "Yet you also write about how at various in the history of architecture, architects gave up the idea of talking about beauty at all.",
        "That's right.",
        "Particularly in 20th century, you know, the words like beauty can be easily associated with effeminacy, with aristocracy, with luxury - kind of not the basics of life.",
        "And in the 20th century, architects became obsessed with seeming a bit like engineers.",
        "They wanted to be like the guys.",
        "You know, engineering is a very male-dominated profession.",
        "And architects - there's almost, you could say, a sort of gender anxiety among 20th century architects.",
        "What they didn't want to be seen as was decorators - interior decorators, traditionally associated with gay men.",
        "So they wanted to be like sort of macho guys putting up bridges, etc. And it meant that they were very against words like pretty and beautiful and sweet.",
        "And actually, of course, as ordinary homeowners and buyers and users of architecture, one of the things that we do very often seek from buildings is qualities like prettiness.",
        "And my hope for the 21st century is that architects rediscover the idea of prettiness, they rediscover the feminine - rather like many fashion designers have been doing.",
        "So it's been an unfairly neglected quality in the 20th century.",
        "I have to say, that seems - reading your book - more than a hope.",
        "You are calling for an aesthetic revolution.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "That's right.",
        "That's right.",
        "I'm being British and self-deprecating, but yes, absolutely.",
        "I think it would be wonderful if architects learned from some of the best lessons of the past and stop producing cold, clinical boxes which don't please anybody.",

        "Theme parks are like jokes.",
        "And it's nice to hear a joke, but at some point you've got to get back to real life.",

        "You feel like real people are not living here.",
        "Real people don't have the challenges of ordinary life.",
        "And my hope is that we get away from this terrible dichotomy between on the one hand, lovely theme parks, and on the other hand, complete massive industrial estates and highways, etc. You know, the ideal would be to create an ordinary environment - neither theme park nor industrial park - an ordinary environment where ordinary families can live that is attractive.",
        "That surely seems to me to be the challenge.",
        "And speaking about some of those houses you were just describing, Phil, Alain de Botton writes in his book, the same kind of banal thinking which in literature produces nothing worse than incoherent books and tedious plays can, when applied to architecture, leaves wounds that will be visible from outer space.",
        "Bad architecture, he continues, is frozen mistake writ large.",
        "All right, I love it.",

        "They try and find things to celebrate in the modern world, and so try and make us at home in the world we actually live in rather than always trying to send us back to a world of our great-grandparents which is no longer with us, and, indeed, perhaps was never that perfect anyway.",
