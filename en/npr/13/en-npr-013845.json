        "I do think there is a responsibility, however, to make sure that those with pre-existing conditions can purchase policies at an affordable rate.",
        "The whole concept of insurance is to spread the risk, and spreading the risk means that those with pre-existing conditions will have to pay for coverage, but the payments should not be so great that, in fact, there is not accessibility.",
