        "Yeah.",
        "And over the years, lots of other producers have, you know, called us up and asked us to do different shows, whether it's, you know, a TV show or a commercial, endorsement or something, and we've said to ourselves, that's not who we want to be.",

        "You know what?",
        "I actually don't.",
        "You know, sometimes when I was walking with my children, and they were very young, and all of these people would come and want my socks without ever taking off my shoes, it was really intrusive.",
        "So I don't miss that at all.",
        "But the lingering effect is really a gift because people are still warm and still so wonderful.",
        "And what you realize also is that Joe is like an exception to the rule because once people taste that kind of fame, it becomes very addictive.",
        "And Ted, I know you've seen examples of people in our business who get a little carried away.",
        "Well, and I think it happens more to people who haven't been in the business for a long time, for whom - you know, appearing on television is just one of those transformative experiences where you have to keep things in perspective.",
        "I always find it very helpful, when I'm in a supermarket for example, and the cashier gets very excited about seeing me and then says something like, you know, I haven't had a big day like this since the local weatherman was here last week.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "You know, there is - we are all, because we appear on television, there is that level of fame.",
        "But that's a far cry from the Fonz fame, from the Susan Boyle fame, from the fame that a Princess Diana had to deal with."
