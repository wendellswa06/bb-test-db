        "Yes.",
        "That was normally the first question everybody asked me: How well do you know Michael?",
        "And was that a kind of fame?",
        "Well, my fame was I wore a bright red suit and bounced around at games and did lots of personal appearances.",
        "And I could wear my fame, but I could then hang it up in a closet and go away and be anonymous.",
        "Ted Koppel, you and I, I think, are both pleased at this moment that we are in our corner of show business.",
        "Absolutely, and I must say I think that what you've got there is the absolute bracketing of what fame is about and that is being the Chicago Bulls mascot and quite literally being able to hang up your fame when you've had enough of it.",
        "And on the other hand Michael Jordan, who cannot go anywhere in the world without people feeling that they own a little piece of him.",
        "And that's the part of fame, I think, that is difficult to deal with.",
        "There is a sense, and I'm talking about only at that Michael Jordan/Oprah level, that everyone who recognizes these people and loves these people also feels, to a certain extent, that he or she has invested in them.",

        "And you even see somebody like Mickey Rooney at his age, who was the number one box office star in the United States, what, 60 years ago, and I think can't escape it today.",
        "Right, and the idea that it might - that that might not be favorable, that might be a curse, as Ted suggested.",
        "It's funny the way that people block that out.",
        "The earlier caller that was talking about being an actor and saying I hear what you're saying, that this is not all this is cracked up to be, and yet I still very much want it.",
        "And it makes me think of when you check out - you go to the checkout at the grocery store, and you can see the kind of US Weekly, People magazines that paint this kind of perfect image of fame at the Malibu poolside, or the National Enquirer, which is kind of showing the bulimia and the drug addiction and the divorce, and people kind of are offered two visions of what this might be like.",
        "And are there differences between those who would have, one might say, earned fame, like Henry as an actor, or Ted Koppel as a distinguished journalist, and this sort of instant celebrity?",
        "And what happened after you're - were you on TV?",
        "Have you been in the newspaper, that sort of thing?",

        "And nobody scored higher on this test than the reality TV stars.",
        "And it kind of made sense when you thought about it, that in order to think, well, I'm just going to brush my teeth or have a fight with my wife on camera, and that will be worth people watching, that that would take a healthy amount of narcissism.",
        "So I think that one could go and say that there are kind of different breeds of celebrities in kind of a psychological perspective.",

        "Can you only talk and meet with other people who are either in the same business or as isolated as you are by fame?",
        "You know what?",
        "I made a conscious effort not to do that.",

        "I don't know if it works for somebody else.",
        "But if I was honest with the people that were coming up to me on the street, if I was with my children and I said, you know what, I'm just in a conversation with my son, could you excuse me for a minute?",
        "Thanks so much for saying hi.",
        "They, most of the time, 90 percent of the time, got it.",
        "And they said yes.",
        "If you create this aura about yourself and this energy, then it will create the frenzy back, you know?",
        "What you put out is what you get back.",

        "After a few months, I started getting letters, then invitations to read at coffee shops and creative writing groups.",
        "And I absolutely hated the fact that people acted as if they could say whatever they wanted to to me just because they knew me from my column.",
        "People said things to me about my writing that even my cruelest writing professor wouldn't have said.",
