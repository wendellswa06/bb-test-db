        "Now, there are some kids who only know me from reading the funny books.",
        "And it's an amazing thing.",
        "I - that part of it makes me so happy that I was on television just for that reason.",
        "And Ted Koppel, after your experiences, you would say this was in general a positive experience?",
        "Oh, it's been a positive experience.",
        "But again, I want to draw the distinction between the sort of minor league fame that I've enjoyed over the years and these - the white hot fame that comes to people either because they are on a very popular television series, as Henry was - and I'd still like to hear Henry talk just a little bit.",
        "You fuzzed over it, Henry.",
        "There have to have been moments back there in the '70s, when you were the hottest thing in the country, when it was just excruciating and very, very difficult for you to be out in public.",
        "And…",
        "And we'll give you 30 seconds to say it.",
        "Go for it.",
        "Let me just say, the worst part of it was driving home after shooting the show at Paramount Studios and having to find circuitous routes.",
        "It was like I was in a movie because people would follow me to my house or ring the doorbell at 3:00 in the morning.",
        "And it wasn't funny after a while.",
        "Henry Winkler, I'm afraid we have to say thank you and good luck with Hank Zipzer.",
        "Thank you.",

        "Eleven months before Election Day, a federal judge has given the Republican National Committee a big win.",
        "He has allowed a consent decree to expire that was in place since 1982.",
        "That agreement prevented the RNC from carrying out what the party saw as ballot security measures and what critics deemed voter suppression.",

        "He writes the Election Law Blog.",
        "Welcome.",
        "Good to be with you.",
        "What happened in the early 1980s that led to this consent decree?",
        "Well, the Democrats accused the Republican National Committee of engaging in a number of activities which they said was voter suppression in violation of the Voting Rights Act and other civil rights laws.",
        "One thing the RNC was accused of was sending armed police officers off duty to polling places to patrol the polling places in minority areas.",
        "Rather than going to trial, the RNC agreed to settle the case, and it settled the case in what's called a consent decree, which means that the settlement between the parties was embodied in a court order.",
        "And if the RNC ever violated that order, they could be found in contempt.",
        "And so this was a very powerful too that the Democrats have been able to use for the last few decades.",
        "And over the years, the Democrats convinced judges to extend this consent decree until now.",
        "Why not?",
        "Well, so back in the mid-2000s, the RNC went all the way to the Supreme Court trying to get the consent decree eliminated because nobody wants to be under the threat of contempt.",
        "But in 2009, a federal judge said, all right, I'm giving it eight more years.",
        "Unless the Democrats come forward with evidence that the Republicans are still engaging in this activity, the consent decree will end as of December 1, 2017.",
        "So this summer, as the Trump campaign started touting problems with voter fraud and trying to collect signatures of people who were going to engage in poll watching on Election Day, Democrats said the Republicans were violating the consent decree.",
        "The judge determined that whatever the Trump campaign might have done, it was done without the RNC's cooperation, and therefore the RNC didn't violate it, and the consent decree was allowed to die.",
        "So what do you expect will change in November when people go to the polls and, for the first time, the RNC is not under this consent decree?"

        "If we were not in the Trump administration, I wouldn't expect very much to change.",
        "The RNC has been very careful to instruct people associated with it not to engage in any activities that might be seen as suppressing the vote.",
        "But Trump adds something different here.",
        "He has made voter fraud a centerpiece of his rhetoric about campaigns.",
        "He's claimed falsely that 3 to 5 million people voted illegally in the last election, and he's organized people to try to be on the lookout for voter fraud at polling places.",
        "If he tries to use the RNC in this activity, there's now nothing under this consent decree that would stop him.",
        "And so I do think to the extent that Trump controls the RNC, we may see more activities aimed at so-called ballot security, which could be seen as suppressing the votes of minority voters.",
        "Wouldn't that immediately end up in court and presumably another consent decree?",
        "Well, it could end up in court.",
        "I certainly wouldn't expect the RNC these days to agree to a consent decree.",
        "It might lead to litigation.",
        "But you know, this kind of litigation can take years, and the benefit of the consent decree was that the RNC was always under the watch of the DNC and had the ability to bring up a claim of contempt.",
        "They don't have that anymore, and so it's a much harder road if it comes to new litigation.",
        "Could you argue as the RNC did in a statement today that this just puts the two parties on equal footing?",
        "That's right.",
        "President Bush speaking this week at the US Naval Academy.",
        "He presented his strategy for victory in Iraq which calls for Iraqi troops to assume many of the combat roles now undertaken by US forces.",

        "Oh, my God, it's the total X factor.",
        "There's been no public discussion by this administration of airpower in terms of how many missions, how much tonnage.",
        "During the Vietnam War--I'm long of tooth, and I remember that--we used to get a daily account of how many sorties--That's one flight, by one bomber--how many sorties, how much tonnage, and one could get a sense of what--how--where--the air war was very intense then.",
        "And here only you get anecdotal stuff.",
        "The one statistic we found is really quite amazing.",
        "A Marine Air Wing, which is responsible for close air support of the Marines in the field, reported that between fall of '03 and late fall of '04, about 15 months, it expended 500,000 tons of ordnance, and that is two million, 500-pound bombs--two million, 500-pound bombs--one Marine Air Wing.",

        "We have no concept of what's going on today, but what I've been told and what is going to happen is pulling out will not mean an end--certainly will not mean an end to the violence, nor will it mean in any way that we're changing the president's position that he wants to win.",
        "Pulling out simply means we're going to be reducing the number of American boys exposed to death, which is great.",
        "But in replacement, we're going to increase the bombing.",
        "So therefore, violence probably in all likelihood will go up.",
        "Now one of the concerns you say that military people who were your sources on this story have expressed is that if you have US Air Forces working in concert with Iraqi ground forces, with laser-guided weaponry these days, it's often, in fact, the ground units that are responsible for fixing the target, not the airplanes.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "Tell us how that works.",
        "We have planes in the area, loitering, flying around, waiting for contact.",
        "`Oh, my God, there's an insurgent there,' and the plane rushes over, drops its bomb.",
        "These are jets.",
        "And, of course, all the targeting now is done by Americans on the ground because that's the most sensitive part.",
        "The pilot is simply a delivery vehicle.",
        "He's simply delivering death.",
        "And to the credit of the Air Force, one of the concerns is we want to know who's telling us what to bomb, and no matter how they shape it, what they would ask if you were asked at the White House, they would say, `Well, they're going to have a joint American-Iraqi, at first, and then, eventually, we'll train them and, eventually, the Iraqis will take over, obviously, because we're getting out.'",
        "The reality is, the Iraqi army is undoubtedly very likely to be penetrated by the insurgency.",
        "There's a lot of tribal disputes.",
        "There's a lot of internecine warfare.",
        "We learned in dealing with interpreters on the ground--when the war began, interpreters would say, `Do this house,' and it turned out to be their brother-in-law they wanted--that they had a problem with.",
        "So we learned that--a lot of things will go wrong, just in ground operations.",
        "The military people who spoke with you, do you get the impression that they're expressing some of the anxieties and doubts and concerns about this transformation you describe in the military as well, or even in the councils of government, that they express to you?",
        "No.",
        "The story I hear from my friends inside, and this comes more from the civilians, senior civilians with access, this president and the people that run them don't want to listen to what they don't want to listen to."
