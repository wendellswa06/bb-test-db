        "Other companies also make this kind of four-seater commuter car.",
        "The Nissan leaf was one of the first.",
        "Dan Sperling, co-director of the National Center for Sustainable Transportation at the University of California, Davis, says there are a number of things you should consider before you buy an electric car.",
        "First, do you just need a car for commuting or other relatively short trips, and what fuel produces the electricity you will use to charge it?",
        "If you buy an electric car in an area where the electricity is made mostly from coal, your car will be the same or possibly even a little worse than a gasoline car.",
        "Ouch.",
        "To find out the source of your electrical energy, search EPA power profiler, and enter your ZIP code.",
        "If you'd like an electric car for commuting but need a car with a longer range for weekend trips, you could consider a plug-in hybrid like the Chevy Volt or the Toyota Prius Plug-in hybrid.",
        "Sperling says they typically have a 25- to 50-mile all-electric range, enough for most people's commute.",
        "Of course, the cost of a new electric or a hybrid is also a big consideration.",
        "Sperling says these days, many are quite affordable partly because automakers are selling them below cost to try to build a market.",
        "So you can actually get an electric car now for a very low price.",
        "Some are available for less than $20,000 after subtracting a $7,500 tax credit from the federal government, and many states provide tax incentives, too.",
        "There is another thing to consider in making a decision, and that's the amount of carbon emitted in manufacturing a new car.",
        "Ten to 15 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions from that car over the life of the car would be associated with the manufacturing.",
        "So, Sperling says, you won't get any overall reduction in your carbon footprint until you've driven your new, more-efficient car 10,000 to 20,000 miles.",
        "Another big consideration is how much you drive.",
        "Sperling says if you have an older car and you're only driving a few thousand miles a year, it's probably not worth it to upgrade to a cleaner car.",
        "If, however, it's a car that is being used quite a bit - say, 10,00 miles a year or more - there's definitely a high payoff because now there are cars that get 50 miles per gallon compared to your 25.",
        "Of course, the best thing to do for the environment, says Sperling, is walk or bike or use mass transportation.",
        "John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.",
        "And now a story of activism and espionage."

        "There have been a number of incidents over the full period of the occupation, and now with the soldiers still there, even in that time both in terms of some IED incidents, but also in terms of other effects to ambush soldiers and then the shoot-downs of helicopters.",
        "Of these two incidents last week, has the military there confirmed that one of them was a shoot-down of a helicopter?",
        "I don't know if there has been a formal acknowledgement of that, but that is the understanding that's been made to us, that at least one of them was a shoot-down and possibly both.",

        "How about these more than 200 ballot boxes that the commission says should be thrown out?",
        "Is that going to matter in the vote count?",
        "Well, I think if you put it in perspective, this is a tiny percentage of--you know, I don't even know if it's 1 percent of the total ballot boxes that were out there, and there are still investigations going on.",
        "Of course, you don't want to have had any fraud, but in terms of a substantial altering of the outcome of the election, that seems very, very unlikely.",
        "There is a real question, and still is, as to the count.",
        "We don't have a final count, and that will be important in terms of whether there's actual majority of seats for the Shia list and--or whether how extensively they need to form coalitions, how many people they need to form the two-thirds majority they would need to get some of the key approval through.",
