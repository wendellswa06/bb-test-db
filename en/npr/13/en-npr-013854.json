        "But Dubowitz worries that over time, the idea of re-imposing sanctions, the snapback, will have less meaning, especially in Europe.",
        "And it will be very difficult to convince European companies to leave Iran again.",
        "It took decades to convince the Europeans to leave the first time.",
