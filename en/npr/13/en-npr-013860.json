        "Haya's story, her search for her lost child, grows out of a palimpsest of personal quest and public record.",
        "Employing photographs, Nuremberg trial testimony, poetry, and newsreel style scenes of rape, incarceration, torture, murder and assassination, Drndic has created a terrifying book, both personal and objective; a book of names about one woman's story, and a book of places and events that have made the last century infamous for the ages.",
        "A book you may now and then will have to set down, to breathe, to blink and blink again.",
        "And say to yourself and whatever gods you might believe in: Please, oh, please, please, please, never again."

        "The Brooklyn headquarters will be the nerve center for a campaign that's expected to eventually cost as much as $2 billion and employ thousands of people.",
        "The last time she ran for president, Mrs. Clinton had a long and ultimately unsuccessful primary fight against a talented young newcomer, Barack Obama, who captured the public's desire for change and managed to paint her as the candidate of the past."
