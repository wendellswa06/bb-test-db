        "Much of the toxin would be inactivated during the heat pasteurization process.",
        "Then all of this contaminated milk would rapidly move through the supply chain.",
        "You'd have about a half a million people consuming this milk, and depending on how quickly we figured out what was going on, in any ca--we, optimistically, assume within 24 hours of the first symptoms, we would completely halt consumption, and you'd end up with several hundred thousand poisoned people, and about half of them would die.",
