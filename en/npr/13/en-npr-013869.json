        "And the third and really the main recommendation we're making is that there is a 15-minute immunomagnetic-electrochemiluminescent test--that is, you know, commercially available that could test each truck while the truck is already waiting for 45 minutes for its antibiotic residue test, so this could pretty much take this threat off the table for a cost of maybe 1 or 2 cents per gallon of milk, so less than 1 percent of the cost of milk.",
        "And has any action been following these recommendations?"
