        "No.",
        "You know, this--well, as soon as--when I briefed the government last fall, no one in the room was aware of this test, and everyone thought that the only commercially available tests available were ELISA tests, which took three or four hours, which really wasn't practical.",
        "So about seven weeks ago, I found out about this test, I immediately e-mailed Assistant Secretary Simonson and telling him about it.",
        "He wrote back and said, `Thank you, Larry.",
        "Very interesting.",
        "This morning, I called up a person at this company, BioVeris, and asked them, you know, `Has the government been in touch with you about this?",
        "and they said, `No, they have not.'",
        "So before you actually published this, you did go around and tell people about this.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Last September 23rd, I briefed maybe 40 or so people.",
        "Assistant Secretary Simonson was there, people from the White House, Department of Homeland Security, dairy industry, FBI and so forth.",
        "And so we did have, you know, a two-hour meeting where I briefed and we had discussions.",
        "And, indeed, at that time, I realized the dairy industry was nervous about this paper being published.",
        "I didn't realize the government shared their concerns.",
        "But a month later, I was contacted by Assistant Secretary Simonson's office saying they knew--they had heard I had a paper, `We had concerns about it.",
        "Could we see it and make suggestions?",
        "and I said, `Sure,' and I e-mailed them the paper right away and said, `I'd be happy to work with you to come up with something that is informative without raising national security concerns,' and they e-mailed back, said, `Thanks, we'll get back to you next week,' but they never got back to me.",
        "So they never got back to you, so you went ahead and published the paper.",
        "And then what happened?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, at that time, when I didn't hear from them, I thought their main concern was that I would put something in the paper, either data or information that's not in the public domain.",
        "And, of course, I didn't do that.",
        "When I didn't hear back from them, I assumed they were OK with the paper, but that was presumptuous thinking, so, you know, they did ask PNAS to pull the paper.",
        "I think PNAS behaved appropriately and professionally all the way around.",
        "I think it was correct of them to delay the publication of the paper and hear the government out.",
        "After all, if the paper was, indeed, a road map for terrorists, it would be more important not to have that out there, and it's not a big deal to delay the publication of a scientific paper by a few weeks.",
        "So even after the paper was pulled, though, you had this op-ed piece in The New York Times that basically...",
        "Right.",
        "Well, the...",
        "...laid out the same thing that was in the paper.",
        "Right.",
        "So the sequence didn't actually happen that way.",
        "The op-ed was written before and was really accepted by The New York Times before the government asked PNAS to pull the paper.",
        "I--main reason for writing the op-ed was because I heard about this new 45-minute--this new 15-minute test that I didn't know about when I wrote the paper, and so I wanted--you know, that was kind of the main recommendation of the paper, so that's why I submitted it.",
        "And so then the National Academy of Sciences looks at the paper, says--Bruce Alberts writes something accompanying the publication and says, `You know, this is nothing really new.",
        "You could just get all this stuff on the Internet anyhow.'"

        "Well, it did surprise me because the other two main catastrophic bioterror threats are anthrax and smallpox, and I was the co-author of the first detailed mathematical studies of these topics also.",
        "They also appeared in PNAS.",
        "And those papers did not receive this kind of response.",
        "Indeed, the anthrax paper--this same group of people I briefed--Assistant Secretary Simonson's office--that was before he was on board, and they actually hired me to do further work on the anthrax vaccine.",
        "And that paper's just as detailed.",
        "It has a figure of the number of casualties vs. the number of anthrax spores released.",
        "So I still am kind of puzzled as--you know, why the response on this one vs. the other papers.",
        "Are you still waiting to hear from the government?",
        "Well, yeah, they haven't been in contact with me in the last month.",
        "Are you waiting for someone to sit up and say, `Hey, you know, this guy's got something here.",
        "Maybe we should have this 15-minute test'?",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)",
        "You know, it's a tricky business because, you know, whether we need the test or not depends on how good the new pasteurization formula is, and that is not publicly available information and shouldn't be, as Bruce Alberts said in his editorial, because that could help be a road map for terrorists.",
        "So, in fact, I e-mailed the government the morning the paper came out earlier this week, and the only way I can kind of say it in public is as an equation, so maybe if your radio listeners aren't driving your car, you can just write down this little equation in terms of two unknowns, X and Y.",
        "So let Y be on the left-hand side.",
        "Y is less than a fraction with one in the numerator and 30,000 times X in the denominator.",
        "Y is the fraction of toxin that survives the pasteurization process.",
        "So if the pasteurization kills 99 percent of it, then Y would be 0.01.",
        "And X is also not in the public domain, which is a factor that says the capabilities of the terrorists to concentrate the toxin in this acid-mud mixture, of what's the additional factor on top of what I assume, using 1950s and '60s technologies, of four grams per gallon.",
        "So, for example, if they could do 40 grams per gallon vs. four grams a gallon, X should be 10.",
        "And without...",
        "So that's 40-year-old technology that you used, where they might be much better at making the toxin now.",
        "Well, if you had, you know, sophisticated equipment and sophisticated people.",
        "So this is something I think the government has a handle on what X is.",
        "It's not in the public domain.",
        "I'm not going to say what it is.",
        "The government certainly knows what Y is, and I'm not going to say that.",
        "But I will say that if Y is less than 1 over 30,000 times X, then the milk is safe enough.",
        "And if Y is considerably bigger than 1 over 30,000 X, the milk is not safe enough, and we should seriously consider putting in in-line testing at a cost of a few cents per gallon.",
        "Well, if anybody in the government missed that, we have a podcast of this broadcast; they can listen to it and get those numbers later on.",
        "It seems--silly, I was going to say.",
        "It's interesting that you have to get those numbers out to the government by talking to us on the radio."

        "That bombing from the air is then combined with two other factors that are utterly merciless.",
        "One is the siege tactics to prevent food and medical supplies getting in.",
        "And then the second is the house-to-house cold-blooded murder that's been reported over the last 72 hours.",

        "One thing you have said is - you've said that we cannot say we don't know what's happening when the victims themselves are tweeting and sending messages out about the horrors that they face.",
        "Do you - are you hearing silence from the international community in the face of those cries?",
        "Well, I think that there's certainly division in the international community.",
        "There's fragmentation of the voice, and there is frankly impotence from the top of the international system because of the division between Russia and its Syrian allies on the one hand and Western countries on the other.",
        "And I think it's very important that we're all witnesses to this tragedy.",
