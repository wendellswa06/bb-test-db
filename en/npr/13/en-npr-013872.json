        "He was the last one to leave the south tower, I believe, before it collapsed.",
        "Can you tell us the story?",
        "Well, yeah, Ron was a money-market trader, and he was above, you know, working above the point of impact, you know, found himself, like many other people, trapped above that point.",
        "Initially, he tried to go down, but the stairwell he found himself in was blocked by debris, and there was a tremendous amount of smoke coming up.",
        "So he got to this landing just above the impact point, and people were collapsed on that landing, some of them apparently unconscious.",
        "Others were sobbing, had kind of given up, I guess, and Ron was there.",
        "And he suddenly felt an intervention.",
        "He felt there was someone else joined him on the landing.",
        "He heard a voice, which gave him very specific directions.",
        "You know, Ron, you can survive this.",
        "You know, you'll get out of this.",
        "You've got to keep going down.",
        "And he literally felt like he was led, and he was led towards the flames and towards the smoke and ended up fighting his way through debris, covering his head as best he could with his arms against the flames, and fought his way down and got through this after a few minutes and found himself in a lit stairwell.",
        "Everything appeared to, like, resume to normal below the impact point.",
        "And he carried on down and was able to get past some firefighters coming down, was able to get out just before the building or just as the building was collapsing.",
        "With this fall of anti-government forces in Aleppo, what are the prospects of getting back to the negotiating table?",
        "Is that kind of faded altogether?",
        "I think it's really important to remember that the end of every war involves some kind of political settlement.",
        "And wars are only settled in a durable way when there is a credible and legitimate sharing of power.",
        "In Syria, the political dimension has got to come into play.",
        "And frankly, the big players are going to be the Russians and the Iranians, and no one yet knows how they're going to play their cards.",
        "Are they going to seek to do in Idlib and in the southwest of the country what they've done in Aleppo, or are they now going to sue for peace?",
        "And I think that the stories of the bloodbath that happened in Aleppo can only raise the fear that, far from ending the war, we're going to see sporadic outbreaks of fighting across the country on a continuous basis.",
        "And that is dangerous both for Syrians, but frankly also for close allies of the United States next door, like Jordan, and also for Europeans, who are suffering now the waves of refugees are still coming despite the winter months.",
