        "That's a very simplistic way to talk about it.",

        "Most of the critics here have really been taken with it.",
        "And one other thing, people were talking about the writers strike in relation to Sundance, and some saying that actually the strike would lead studios or distributors to make deals there - because there's a lot of product - that they may not have otherwise.",
