        "Well, I think he entered the presidency with many people thinking he had miraculous powers, and that's very hard for anybody to live up to.",
        "He's somebody who was elected, just as you say, on these soaring promises of change and hope, but it was combined with a pragmatic style and a cool demeanor.",
        "And that will always make him, I think, someone very difficult for people to get a handle on.",
        "But I think once people got over the fact that no, he doesn't have miraculous powers, I think he has governed very much as he said he would in the campaign - this pledge to make change, but to use fairly traditional means if that was the way to get it.",
        "So he may have a little less - sort of get a few less points than he did before on inspiration, but I think he is, broadly, who he promised to be.",
        "Traditional means - but he came to Washington talking about really shaking up the system, and I want to actually tick through a few specific areas and talk about the promises he made and his progress in trying to actually meet those goals.",
        "David, because national security dominates the headlines right now, let's begin there.",
        "Some of the president's goals were fairly specific: ending the involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "Others are a bit more opaque: making America safer in the face of terrorism.",
        "What will it take for him to credibly claim that he's made progress on both fronts?",
        "Well, I think he's basically continued the Bush policies, closed Guantanamo - or at least promised to, not actually closed it, and will move some of the people to a prison, maybe, in Illinois.",
        "But it's basically continuity on the national security front, kept the Department of Homeland Security on Afghanistan, basically taking the strategy that was left to him by the Bush administration and now expanded it in Iraq, basically taking the SOFA, the agreement we had - that the Bush administration had to wrap down that war, accelerated it.",
        "So it's an evolutionary change, but I wouldn't say it's a dramatic change on national security.",
        "E.J., on Guantanamo, specifically, does he change the timeline or shift the goal there?",
        "Because he's obviously not going to meet that one-year deadline.",
        "They are saying that they won't shift the goal, and I think they are too locked in.",
        "Guantanamo has sort of come to stand for all of the changes he would make in the Bush security policies, where he would respect civil liberties more, where he would make us look better in the eyes in the world.",
        "But, clearly, his timeline is going to slip on that.",
        "OK.",
        "As we tick through another promise, improving America's reputation overseas and its relationship with both allies and adversaries, what will it take for him to make the case that America has a new and perhaps more effective relationship with countries like Iran or Pakistan - in the news today, again, because of the suicide bombing at a volleyball game there?",
        "Well, in Iran, I think Iran has made it very difficult on itself.",
        "I mean, he's going to have to shift his policy.",
        "He's gotten tougher and tougher in speaking about human rights and speaking in support of the opposition movement there.",
        "In Pakistan, there has been some progress where the Pakistanis really have become more aggressive against sort of Taliban-like, al-Qaida-like elements there.",
        "But that has always been the place that was going to be the biggest challenge of his presidency, and I think it still is.",
        "And he can, you think at this point, make the claim that he's changed the temperature there?",
        "Go ahead, David."
