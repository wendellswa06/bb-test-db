        "But we also want to make sure that the mirror will stay in there.",
        "Elephants are extremely curious animals and like to pull at things.",
        "So we installed a huge mirror that was about eight feet by eight feet glued to a piece of plywood, encased in steel and then bolted to a wall so that the elephants have no way to really manipulate the mirror.",
        "We would then release the elephants into the yard where the mirror was located to see how they would react to the mirror image.",

        "You could traditionally do the same autopsy images.",
        "Cut the body up, take photographs.",
        "But those are very gruesome, and sometimes they're not admissible because, you know, you don't want the jury throwing up on these very gory images.",
