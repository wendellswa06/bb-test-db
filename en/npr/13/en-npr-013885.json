        "Over the long 4th of July weekend where not many people were paying attention, Apple told EPEAT that it wanted to opt out of the rating system.",
        "Apple removed all its products from the group's environmentally certified list and all of them, by the way, had earned the highest rating.",

        "So they changed their mind.",

        "That's a really good question and we don't know the answer.",
        "The company isn't saying.",
        "Many observers suggested that Apple was concerned that its newest products, including the retina Macbook Pro, you know, its fancy new machine they're advertising all the time, which does not meet the basic EPEAT standards and they wouldn't get a green certification.",
        "So perhaps Apple thought, rather than be embarrassed or worse by that, they would simply exit the rating system.",
        "But there's another school of thought that says, no, Apple pulled out because the company just didn't want to be part of what it viewed as an antiquated product registry, one that really didn't reward Apple for its environmental innovations.",
        "Now, whatever the motive, the company heard from lots and lots of customers and they weren't happy.",
        "A couple of days ago, Apple called EPEAT and started talking about rejoining the certification process and, today, on its website, the company said it had done just that.",
        "Now, just to give you a sense of how much attention all this drew, the EPEAT website, not exactly a household URL, was swamped and crashed within 20 minutes of today's news.",
        "Wow.",
        "Well, you mentioned that certification question.",
        "Are Apple's products, in fact, now back on the EPEAT list?",
        "They are.",
        "All 39 of the originally certified computers and monitors are back on the list and Apple is requesting certification for more, including that fancy new Macbook Pro, apparently believing that it will, in fact, pass muster.",
