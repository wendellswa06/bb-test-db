        "Organizers like Don Marsh are hoping to do as well this year.",
        "He says it's been exciting to bring New Orleans' musical community back together, but also costly.",
        "In the past we could, you know, tell a local band just to come on over to the festival.",
        "Here' your parking passes, be on stage at such and such a time, here's your dressing room.",
        "Now it's providing, you know, airline tickets, hotel reservations, a lot of coordination.",
        "So the budget has expanded tremendously.",
        "Typically it takes about $10 million to run this two-weekend extravaganza.",
        "It's second only to Mardi Gras in terms of its potential to help the area recover economically.",
        "Last year, it generated $300 million in business.",
        "Kelly Schulz, with the New Orleans Metropolitan Convention Bureau, says that's why so much is riding on this year's festival.",
        "I'm doing well Farai, how are you?",
        "It's the same general stress building up.",
        "That one was a 9.1 magnitude earthquake, which is one of the biggest that was ever measured on Earth.",
        "And that happened at a slightly different junction of continental plates.",
        "It was farther to the north, but it was still off the coast of Indonesia, it was still in this general area.",
        "But even though the plates - they were slightly different, yet it is, essentially, the same seismic activity, the same portion of these plates, one against the other.",
        "And as it happens, four plates come together in this one part of the world, which is one reason why there are always so many earthquakes around Indonesia.",
        "And as we remember that 2004 quake triggered a devastating tsunami.",
        "Why not this one?",
        "Well, that...",
        "Or the series of quakes?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, they've been lucky, really, because there've been tsunami alerts and warnings and concerns about it.",
        "But in 2004, the quake there ruptured a very long length of the fault under the seafloor.",
        "And what happened was it caused that area to bounce, a very big bounce, like a 10-foot bounce on the seafloor, and that, of course, created this enormous surge of water upward and that really is what caused the tsunami; that huge bounce of the seafloor.",
        "These have been quite lucky, the ground motion has not been the same.",
        "And I don't know exactly what's going on right now, but that was really the difference between these.",
        "Now, those here in the U.S.",
        "those here in the U.S.",
        "may be wondering how those quakes differ from the ones along the faults close at home at San Andreas."

        "Right.",
        "Well, San Andreas sort of slips north and south that rubs against - one plate rubs against to another, more than one diving under another, so you don't get the same kind of bouncing motions as much.",
        "So, they are, obviously, the same process of continental drift, but you get very different grand motion from that.",

        "The two administrators were among five people charged with aggravated hazing at the Phi Kappa Tau house at Rider University in Lawrence Township, New Jersey.",
        "The story caught our attention because the two officials were not present at the fraternity house party, where the student, Gary DeVercelly, had been drinking.",

        "I'm fine.",
        "Could you please tell us exactly what happened in this case late last March and who was charged?",
        "Well, what we were told was in March - late March - I guess it was the 28th into the early morning of the 29th, there was a fraternity - Phi Kappa Tau fraternity pledge initiation ceremony of some kind called a big little night, which is a big brother-little brother ceremony.",
        "And they drank something called a family drink, which is something the big brother passes down apparently to the little brother.",
        "In this case, Gary apparently drank Absolute Citron…"

        "Now, two of the administrators - the dean of students and the director of Greek Life - both who are among the five people charged here, weren't present at the party.",
        "So how does the prosecutor justify charging them?",
        "Well, the way it's been explained to us - we haven't seen what evidence they have against the two administrators - and this was what they call an investigative grand jury rather than a targeted grand jury.",
        "So the prosecutor basically turned over all the evidence they had, all of the interviews, all of the any - pictures, anything they found at the fraternity house, turned it over to the grand jury along with the statute and said go to town.",
        "So, apparently, the grand jury found something in that evidence that they thought was compelling enough to charge the two, but we have not seen what evidence they have.",
        "And in your stories for The Times of Trenton, you also talked about a young man named Adriano DiDonato, who's been charged and he is the house manager for the fraternity.",
        "Was he at the party?",
        "Well, we've heard conflicting accounts.",
        "He's lawyer told me yesterday that he was not at the party.",
        "I guess what the lawyer has said is he was called once Gary was in distress.",
        "He was called into the room and then eventually, I guess, he was part of the group that called the paramedics.",
        "But he was indicted as a student, but he is also technically an employee of the university.",
        "So you have told us about three of the five people charged.",
        "Who are the other two?",
        "One is the president of the fraternity and one is the pledge master.",
        "And I don't know if either of those two people were at the party or if they were charged because of their role in the fraternity.",
