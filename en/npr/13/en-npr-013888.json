        "It isn't likely to be the first big city to do so; Philadelphia is further along in the process.",
        "But San Francisco's plan has created a lot of buzz.",
        "As NPR's Laura Sydell reports, that's because of a proposal from one very high-profile company.",
        "San Francisco officials believe it's important for everyone to have access to the Internet.",
        "So late last summer, Mayor Gavin Newsom promised that he would find a way to blanket the city with free wireless.",
        "Chris Vien, the mayor's senior technology adviser, says they believe Internet access will spur economic growth and help low-income citizens move up the ladder.",
        "If a person doesn't have that access, that limits their ability to grow, to get a better job, to do whatever that they may need to be doing in their life to be happy and successful.",
        "Two dozen companies have made proposals to set up the free Wi-Fi network, among them, Motorola, Ericsson and EarthLink, which recently won a contract to set up Philadelphia's free wireless.",
        "And then there's Google, which seems to be everywhere these days: partnering with Sun Microsystems to create desktop software; digitizing libraries and experimenting with instant messaging and video.",
        "But setting up a Wi-Fi network?",
        "We think San Francisco can be a great test bed for the development of new applications, services, local advertising, all kinds of really cool community-based services.",
        "Chris Sacca is part of the new business development group at Google.",
        "Sacca says what he's imagining is that people carrying portable wireless devices will be able to use Google to find what they need wherever they are.",
        "We recently acquired a small company called dodgeball that allows you to let your buddies and friends of friends in an area know where you are and what you're up to and invite them to come hang out with you.",
        "More importantly for Google is it's an opportunity to sell and make lots of money from very localized ads.",
        "It might look something like this."

        "This is a money machine for Google.",
        "And, frankly, that's what's driving this shift, is there are people who have discovered they can offer for free what the phone companies can only charge you a lot of money for.",
        "The cable and telephone companies have generally come out against cities offering free wireless, and in some states, their lobbying efforts have resulted in bans against municipal-run Wi-Fi.",
        "The big telecom companies have argued that government has no business setting up networks that compete with private business.",
        "But network providers are not opposing the San Francisco plan because it involves a private company.",

        "Is this a particular professional concern of yours?",
        "When our customers connect to the Internet, they're going to be using the most reliable and powerful high-speed connection around.",
        "So we're watching with interest the Google Wi-Fi proposal, and certainly we'll continue to pay attention to their entry into the marketplace, as we do all the competitors."

        "San Francisco has not yet decided which company will get the contract, and isn't likely to make a decision for a few weeks.",

        "In a closely watched case, Fisher versus the University of Texas, the court ruled seven to one to send the case back to a lower court, but on the way it also made it clear that any use of racial preference will come under a more skeptical eye from now on.",
        "In a case that centered on admissions policies at the University of Texas, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority, quote, \"\"the reviewing court must ultimately be satisfied that no workable race-neutral alternatives would produce the educational benefits of diversity.",
        "Some analysts call the decision a compromise rather than a punt, but the ruling leaves open many questions about what's next for affirmative action.",

        "Yes, this is one that the most surprising aspect of it is what they didn't do.",
        "When this case came up for argument in October, it sure looked like the case that the conservatives had wanted to basically say no to affirmative action.",

        "So the first surprise is why it took so long, and then the second surprise is sort of what they finally came up with, which is - you described it as sort of a skeptical tone to - sends it back to a lower court and says the university must show that affirmative action is really necessary, there's no other so-called race-neutral alternative that would bring about diversity on campus.",
        "But I think from the larger perspective is most colleges and universities would sort of view this with sort of a sigh of relief and say, well, this will not force us to change anything.",
        "So what happens when it goes back to a lower court?",
        "My guess is that the lower court will - I think there's a good chance they will reject the Texas plan, but it's because of something specific to Texas.",
        "Texas has this so-called top 10 law that says that if you are a - in the top 10 percent of your high school graduation class, you can get into the University of Texas.",
        "And that law, over time, has led to a steady influx of Hispanic and to some degree African-American students.",
        "So as each year goes on, it's sort of harder to argue that the university really needs affirmative action in order to bring about diversity on campus.",
        "So in that case, would it be appealed back up to the Supreme Court?",
        "It could be, but I think it would no longer be, you know, a national case that we're all watching.",
        "In other words, it's something that's particularly - Texas has this law that seems to have worked in a way that not many other states could do the same thing.",
        "I will say there's sort of a moderate, liberal view is that a lot of universities, state universities in other - Florida, North Carolina, whatever, ought to try something like this, that is recruit or admit the very best students in some of the, you know, poorer, lower-income high schools in the state.",

        "But in fact the graduation rate at the University of Texas has been going up steadily, and when I went down there in the fall, and a lot of these admissions people admitted that they were pleasantly surprised that those students who were good students in high school, did well in high school, may not have great test scores, nonetheless did just fine at the University of Texas.",
