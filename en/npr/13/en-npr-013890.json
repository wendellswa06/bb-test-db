        "Both of these men are young - just 22 years old - now very rich and with very little life experience.",

        "(Reading) Dear Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin III.",
        "You've been mentioned in the same breath for the last several months, but once you get drafted and shake hands with Darth Vader, your lives will diverge, and you'll be immersed fully in the identity of your new employers.",
        "That is, of course, former Denver Broncos tight end Nate Jackson reading from the letter he posted online a few days ago.",

        "Thanks for having me.",

        "Certainly.",
        "(Reading) Immediately following the draft, you'll board a private jet to your new cities, where you will step off the planes as hope.",
        "Whether leading your teams to triumph or failing miserably, every breath will be a public affair.",
        "For better or for worse, your privacy is gone.",
        "You make the NFL sound miserable.",

        "And when I was playing it, I couldn't really voice that opinion.",
        "I couldn't be honest about it.",
        "And truthfully, I felt kind of ashamed of having that opinion like I should be behind everything that the NFL does because it is the highest level of football in the world.",

        "And the one who dissented and why?",
        "Ruth Ginsburg dissented, and her view was that the top 10 plan is a race-conscious plan after all.",
        "It was done to improve diversity on campus.",
        "And her view was that we ought to just go ahead and approve the use of race in situations like this, and she would have just flat out upheld the University of Texas policy.",
        "I thought it was quite interesting that Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Stephen Breyer joined sort of, you know, this moderate conservative bloc to say let's send this back for another close look by the lower court.",

        "Is this going to encourage more lawsuits?",
        "I think it's hard to gauge.",

        "You spent years trying to get a case at the Supreme Court, and you don't - you know, it's not much of an incentive to do it again.",
        "I think it may encourage a few big states, as I mentioned, to try to move away a little bit from weighing race and trying to find a way, like this top 10 law, rewarding top graduates, find a way to bring in more minority students but without giving an explicit preference in the admissions policy.",
        "Now some will remember there was another case I think from the University of Michigan that was also broadly about affirmative action.",

        "The lower court decided that on a different basis, basically said that they threw out - the lower court threw out a state proposition, a ballot measure that prohibited affirmative action in Michigan.",
        "And so that's a different legal issue, and the court's going to hear that case and decide it next year.",

        "Coakley, which takes on the issue of protestors at abortion clinics.",
        "And as I understand it, their case argues that the law in Massachusetts that prohibits them from barring entry to - they have to be a certain distance away from entries to abortion clinics, that violates their right to free speech.",
        "Yes, this is sort of an old issue that the court dealt with about 10 or 12 years ago and sort of settled on a - and that sort of seemed like a compromised position, which was to say you could have a buffer zone around the entrance to an abortion clinic, so patients and doctors could go in and out, but the protestors could stand on the sidewalk and hold signs or protest.",
        "And now the court's going to revisit a Massachusetts law that does something like that, and my impression - my sense of it is is that the conservative justices think this is a little bit unfair to abortion protestors, that they should be able to walk up to somebody on the sidewalk and say here's a pamphlet, or you should reconsider your decision.",
        "They're going to allow, I think, a little more leeway for sidewalk protestors to speak to patients.",
        "Another case that will be also closely watched, NLRB versus Noel Canning, and that's about the president's power to so-called recess appointments.",
        "Yes, that's a big sort of a political - in a sense, Washington political story.",
        "It's a big deal for the Obama administration because the House Republicans have used their minority and the filibuster rule to block a vote on a lot of Obama nominees for agencies like the National Labor Relations Board and this Consumer Financial Protection Board.",
        "Obama turned around and made a recess appointment when the Senate was out for three weeks early January of 2012.",
        "A lower court ruled that you can - really narrowed the president's recess power and said only when the Senate has formally adjourned after two years can the president make a recess appointment.",
        "So President Obama's lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court, said you should reverse that decision.",
        "So that's what they're going to take up in the fall.",
        "And it's a sticky case because the administration uses this frequently, and the previous administration did, as well, this ability to make recess appointments over the objections of a faction in one of the opposite party in the United States Senate.",
        "But nevertheless, without this power, it's going to be extremely difficult to fill some of those jobs.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "This - as you said, for a long time, presidents have done this as sort of an emergency way to get around a recalcitrant Senate.",
        "The situation is particularly bad now because, as I say, the Republican minority has blocked a lot of people not because there's anything wrong with the nominees, it's they just don't like the agencies.",
        "They don't like the NLRB, and they don't like this Consumer Protection Bureau.",
        "So the president has no way to get somebody appointed to those offices, and if the court says you can't do it as a recess appointee, then the president can't put any one of his appointees sort of in charge of the agency."
