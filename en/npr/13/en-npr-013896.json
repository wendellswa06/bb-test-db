        "The reality of the matter is, is that that tool has never been 100% effective any more than any other tool that we've used.",
        "Over the years, Axon has made some eye-popping claims about how well Tasers work.",
        "It said they had more stopping power than a .357 Magnum or a .38 Special, and it boasted success rates as high as 97%.",
        "But when APM Reports reviewed data from a dozen police departments in major U.S.",
        "cities, none showed effectiveness rates higher than 80%, no matter what model of Taser they used.",
        "Every city has its own way of tracking and defining effectiveness; Axon says that makes their data unreliable.",
        "It also argues that police department databases don't fully capture the lifesaving power of its weapons, which it says have been deployed nearly 4 million times.",
        "Even so, Axon has acknowledged in its own marketing videos that when an officer fires a Taser, the stakes couldn't be higher.",
