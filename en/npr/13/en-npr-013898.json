        "Del Pozo's officers expected Grenon to fall down and drop the knives.",
        "But that's not what happened.",
        "The Tasers hurt him enough to make him really angry and to aggravate his episode and yet did not hurt him enough to incapacitate him.",
        "After the Taser darts struck him, Grenon ran at the officers, knives swinging, and one of them opened fire, killing him.",
        "There are lots of reasons Tasers can fail to subdue people.",
        "Their electrified darts can miss or get snagged in clothing.",
        "They also don't work as well at close range, where Tasers still hurt but won't always incapacitate.",
        "Trouble is, close range is where police typically use Tasers.",
        "In the aftermath of the shooting, the Burlington Police Department rolled out some new tools - low-tech stuff, like fire extinguishers filled with pressurized water and a long metal pole they could use to simply pin someone to a wall.",
        "But Chief del Pozo isn't about to get rid of Tasers."
