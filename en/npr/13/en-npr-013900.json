        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "Congressman, you are a Republican, as you say, and it's certainly a different mood in Congress since you were there.",
        "How would you explain the views of the candidates on climate change and evolution in the Republican primary?",
        "Well, it was never an issue when I ran.",
        "And the - in my district, I was pretty well-known, and that's one thing.",
        "You know, I have encouraged a lot of scientists to run for office, and they want to jump right in and run for Congress.",
        "It's very hard to win that way unless you have previously established a good local reputation.",
        "In my case, I was a reluctant candidate initially.",
        "I got involved just because of a local solid waste problem.",
        "And it was going nowhere.",
        "And so I was persuaded by friends since I'm very environmentally minded.",
        "They said, look, a scientist with an environmental interest would be the ideal candidate.",
        "So I ran for the county commission.",
        "It was an eye-opener to me but I basically solved the solid waste problem in our community.",
        "And many of the people who know this are grateful to it to this day.",
        "But from there, I went to the statehouse.",
        "I was there a few years, then the state Senate and then ran for Congress.",
        "By then, almost everyone in the congressional district knew me and knew about my work, and they weren't the least bit interested about my scientific views.",
        "They just knew that I worked hard, that I kept contact with the constituents and that I was a good guy, and so they voted for me.",
        "So for scientists who are thinking of running, recognize - you can try to run on the basis that you're a scientist, and you'll add a lot to the Congress, and you might win.",
        "But basically, it involves getting known in the community first and being willing to work for the good of the community without remuneration in many cases.",
        "And they see you at work.",
        "They see your name in the papers.",
        "They say, hey, you know, this guy knows something.",
        "And it's much easier to get elected to the Congress.",
        "So I encourage anyone who's thinking about running, you know, get active at the local level, run for the school board, the city commission, whatever, and just work your way up the ladder.",
        "The - in most case - in most states, it's not a full-time job until you reach Congress, so you can continue with your professional work.",
        "You just have to spend a couple of evenings a month, and you can do some really good things for your community, but also, you are building a base for a congressional run if that's what you want.",
        "I really think it's important that scientists, even if they don't want to run for office, get involved.",
        "And my first involvement rose out of a meeting in the American Physical Society in San Francisco some years ago.",
        "And at that time, I was at the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics at the University of Colorado.",
        "And I went to the meeting in San Francisco, and Mike McDermott, who is a chemist from the Hanford plant, he was a congressman from the state of Washington, and he gave a great speech and said: Now, why are you all sitting on your hands?",
        "Why aren't you politically involved?",
        "I want you to go home and write your congressman and offer to give free scientific advice for him.",

        "Our number - 1-800-989-8255 is our number.",

        "There you go.",
        "We have.",
        "We've been talking actually this time around to a couple of the different television networks about that, not to the moderators directly, but to the different networks.",
        "And there's a little bit more interest this time around than there was last time, I have to say, partly that's just because the - so many science issues have become so politicized and much more of the presidential discussion is focusing on questions of science.",

        "I think the president also needs to have kind of a good basis in both of these topics.",

        "Hmm.",

        "You know, I was sitting in my office, listening to the floor debate when this person talked about cutting funds for the National Science Foundation for two reasons, first of all, because they were going to do research on ATMs and, secondly, because the - well, I won't get into too much detail.",

        "But I end my story about how to - earlier I was telling about how I became involved directly was when Mike McDermott spoke at an American Physical Society meeting and said write your congressman and offer to give him scientific advice, no charge.",
        "And so I got back home and wrote a letter to Gerry Ford, who was my congressman; offered to put together a science advisory committee in my area, and told him I would pick scientists from several disciplines.",
        "We'd meet with him whenever he wanted to, and answer any questions he had.",
        "I dropped the letter in the mail and thought oh, well, in a week I'll get a response saying, thank you for your letter; we'll keep you in mind; etc. But instead, the day they got the letter, I got a call from Gerry Ford's chief of staff saying hey, thanks for the letter.",

        "And it - I knew Gerry just slightly but not very well.",
        "So I got there, and met with Gerry and his chief of staff.",
        "And I thought a very telling moment was - and I said - we decided how we'd arrange the committee, how it would operate and so forth.",
        "And I just appreciated Gerry's attitude.",
        "And I asked one tough question.",
        "I said, do you want me to have the scientists on the committee be all Republicans or a mix - regardless of their political view?",
        "And his aide immediately popped up and said oh, they should be Republicans, of course.",
        "And Gerry said, I don't see why.",
        "He said, pick the best people you can.",
        "And we had a very good relationship.",
        "We'd meet with Gerry at least quarterly.",
        "And if he had a tough issue, he would ask us to meet with him again.",
        "And it's the old story.You have to be there at the right time, to act.",
        "And I encourage every scientist to make that same offer to their member of Congress or to their U.S.",
        "senator, or even their state legislatures.",
        "You can grumble all you want about those idiots in the Congress.",
        "But if you're not helping to educate the idiots, you're not doing your job.",
        "But you also have to have someone like Gerry Ford, who was interested in the truth.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, if you don't, then you should run against the congressman you have.",
        "Yeah.",
        "This is Shawn here.",
        "I want to re-emphasize that point; that we've kind of gotten away from science in our public dialogue because, in part, scientists have gotten silent over the last 40, 50 years.",
        "And the voice of faith and values is important in discussing public policy dialogue, and the voice of economists and industry leaders are important.",
        "But the voice of scientists are also important, especially when so many of our big challenges that we're stuck on revolve around it.",
        "So we really do need scientists as part of that process, and it doesn't necessarily mean that they have to run for office.",
        "Like Vern said, they could volunteer to form a science advisory committee.",
        "They could just even show up at local school board meetings.",
        "And when talk of teaching creationism in science class comes up, or dumbing down standards on geophysics, and telling people that there's a scientific controversy about climate change when there isn't, they could speak up and educate school board members and members of the public about why that is.",
        "Dr.",
        "Paulos, you agree?",
        "I do agree.",
        "And I think part of the resistance is just the word debate, science debate.",
        "I mean, maybe it should be billed as a science discussion.",
        "I mean, what's important is not so much science as a noun, but science as an adverb ever - how do you think scientifically, whatever the topic.",
        "That's why, I think, you know, kind of in a sense, trick questions or questions regarding math or whatever, that they require them to like, think through a problem on estimating or scaling or sequencing.",
        "I mean, not so much it should be an SAT test, but just to see how they think analytically.",
        "Again, that's not surprising that the - you'd meet resistance because politicians are used to, as I say, just giving canned, rehearsed answers."
