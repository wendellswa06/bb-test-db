        "Interesting.",
        "Shawn, did you want to jump in there?",
        "I just - yeah.",
        "I wanted to just underscore what John was saying, that there's really no politician that is going to be excited about debating anything to do with science.",
        "Politicians are in business when they're running for election to do one thing, and that's to get votes to get elected.",
        "And if they don't see a payoff for them in this, and if they see undue risk, they're not going to want to do it.",
        "There's a reason why in 2008, we set up a science debate at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, and the candidates turned us down and instead did a faith forum at Messiah College.",
        "And that's because they perceived a lot of noise and a lot of votes at stake from that community.",
        "They didn't hear anything, comparatively, from the science community, even though there are millions of scientists working in the United States.",
        "So you're saying that scientists could become a voting bloc, an interest that they would have to pay more attention to?",
        "And to that, you should add the engineers and the MDs.",
        "As it is, quite a few MDs run for the Congress already and win.",
        "And in many cases, they are the only scientifically trained people in the body.",
        "And you know as well as I that the medical doctors are very, very well-trained, but they are not necessarily that adept at science or know that much about science.",
        "So it's important to have a broad spectrum, as I say, of scientists, engineers and medical doctors or others with scientific background working in the Congress, and then you can have quite a bit of clout.",
        "When I was the only one there, it was tough.",
        "I just had to go around, continuously talking to people about issues and educating them.",
        "It took an immense amount of my time.",
        "You can't do it through floor debate.",
        "It has to be one-to-one conversations.",
        "So the more scientifically-trained people we can get in Congress, the better.",
        "It doesn't have to be physicists and chemists.",
        "It can be a lot of different professions representing it.",
        "This is SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR.",
        "I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Shawn Otto, Doctor John Paulos and former Congressman Vernon Ehlers.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "Does - you know - how many scientists or how many engineers, mathematicians think of Congress or working in government as a career path for them?",
        "Not too many.",
        "I think another problem is kind of the macho nature of being a politician, you know, the can-do, I can solve this and kind of - it's not unrelated to American exceptionalism, so-called.",
        "And science is about - sometimes, at least - about constraints, and constraints are part of science, and the politicians don't want to say, well, I can't do this and that because of that and this.",
        "So, you know, but I can do anything.",
        "And it's better if I'm, you know, kind of vague and don't specify the, you know, limitations or constraints, which in some sense, I know exists, but I don't want to stress that much.",
        "Do you think Jimmy Carter's background as a scientist, knowing what you just said, hurt him as a politician?",
        "Possibly.",
        "I'm not - I don't quite buy into the fact that he had such a great scientific background.",
        "He has a - had a bachelor's degree, and he studied under - he worked under Rickover, but he didn't have a bachelor's degree on in nuclear engineering.",
        "But, yeah - I mean, science - another factor is the diffidence that the skepticism - in science, you have to suspend belief, and it has to be shown to you, whereas politicians have always be certain.",
        "And the problem is that most things aren't very certain, and scientists will say, well, it might be, that might not be.",
        "We don't have enough evidence yet, or this or that.",
        "And, you know, nobody - that's not a way to inspire voters, to say maybe.",
        "I think it was..."

        "That's a great answer(ph).",
        "I think it was Rush Holt who was quoted when he got into Congress, his saying, when I was a scientist, facts meant everything and illusions meant nothing.",
        "When I became a politician, illusions meant everything and facts meant nothing.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Well, you know, there's another aspect to that, too.",
        "Most of the work I did with my fellow colleagues was not on the floor, not even in committee meetings so much - although that more important than anything I said on the floor - but the social context.",
        "Almost every night, there's a fundraiser for someone or another, and I made a habit of trying to go to those and make myself available to others, to talk in a very friendly and formal manner about science and about science issues.",
        "I recall on time someone who was dead-set against any ideas of global warming.",
        "I happened to be - ended up sitting next to him at a table.",
        "And he said: Vern, is there carbon dioxide in this room?",
        "And I said, yes, and explained where it was from, et cetera.",
        "And we ended up with quite a discussion about CO2 and what caused it, where it comes from, how it affects people and things.",
        "And I think in that 20-minute conversation, I certainly made him doubt his opinion that global warming was just a farce.",
        "He realized there was a scientific basis for it, and it made him much more cautious from that time on in making public comments about it, and he gave up a lot of his preconceptions.",
        "So that one-to-one activity that you can do outside of the chamber and the committee room is very, very important, and that's why you just have to be there.",
        "So the more scientists we get there, in the Congress, the better.",
