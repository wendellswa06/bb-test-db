        "What got you started?",

        "�to stay alive.",
        "And that's the plane crash survivor, right?",
        "Right.",
        "But that's probably also how most organisms in most societies first took it up.",
        "They were dying of starvation and someone died, or there was a body - or they may have killed someone.",

        "But starvation is pretty much the obvious stimulant to start into other things.",
        "For instance, there's endocannibalism, where - which is tied in with funerary cannibalism, because you're eating of your dead.",
        "And that's usually your family members, and sometimes that turns into religious cannibalism because some people believe that if the body isn't consumed, the person can't travel on.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And then there's exocannibalism, where you annihilate your enemy.",
        "And that can relate to token cannibalism, in that you may only eat the heart or something.",
        "Other tribes, who probably have less protein around in their surrounding area than others, will consume the entire body, and they will tell you, though, because you always put a belief system around something you do that something inside of you says, maybe we shouldn't be doing this.",
        "And so the belief is that if you consume the body, you annihilate the soul.",
        "Then you - therefore, you have completely ridden yourself of that enemy, and his ghost can't come back to haunt you.",
        "Hmm.",
        "There's a lot of religious, which goes into ritual token.",
        "For example?",
        "Well, a religious act would be connected with a funerary, in that if you don't eat of the body, they don't go to heaven, all right?",
        "Hmm.",
        "Communion, in the book, I repeat Christ's words.",
        "And what a lot of people don't read about what he originally said to a group, many of them left when he told them about his body and that they had to consume it.",
        "I don't think many people know that hundreds of years ago, the Eucharist was laid out - it wasn't a bowl of wafers.",
        "It was a big piece of bread that was in the shape of a man, and you were consuming Christ's body.",
        "But one of the most fascinating is medicinal.",
        "It's referred to as iatric cannibalism, and it is never, ever in any medical writings or anything referred to as being an act of cannibalism.",
        "It's medicine.",
        "And also the Inquisition years, of almost 600 years, Europeans went to their physicians and he prescribed mummy, which was a small cube of human ham.",
        "And they never referred to this as being cannibalism.",
        "And it started with a - hundreds of years before that, mummies coming from Egypt, ad it was - came along with a myth that if you ate mummy, it would improve your health.",
        "And my husband's a physician, and I had a lot of wonderful help on this book from a lot of physicians and psychiatrists and everything else.",
        "But we all know the placebo effect does work.",
        "And since the majority of illnesses improve with time and your body fights them and they go away all by themselves, if you took the mummy and you got better, you'd say, well, it was the mummy."

        "I guess - I'll bet you must get asked all the time: If you're an expert on cannibalism, what does human flesh taste like?",
