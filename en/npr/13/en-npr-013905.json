        "Officials in Washington said the plane was an unarmed weather research plane...",
        "It was, indeed, a research plane, but the weather was scarcely its concern.",
        "It had been built to research Soviet military strength.",
        "Beginning late in 1954, as the F-104 fighter, the plane emerged within three months as something completely new: a reconnaissance aircraft.",
        "It carried no guns, no military markings or identification; just a camera that pilots said could photograph a golf ball from 55,000 feet.",
        "To camouflage its secret function, it was designated a utility plane, the U2.",

        "I would take the debt that has the lowest balance, pay that off aggressively, and then move to the next debt with the lowest balance.",
        "Ignore interest rates.",
        "Psychologically, it helps people dig out of the hole faster when they can get rid of debt fast.",
        "And then stay where you are, even if it's a little crowded, until you can clear up this, and then move forward and think about getting another house.",
