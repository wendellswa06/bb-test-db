        "I was in Iraq in 2005, and I was based with a military police unit in Baghdad, and I think the one that I'll always remember is every time we came under fire while we were down there, it was inevitable that we would get called off, our military police unit would, because we were trying to let the Iraqi police take care of things.",
        "And I mean, most of the things I heard the military policemen say as we were leaving I can't say on the radio, but they were definitely symbols of how little faith the military police, at least back then, had in the abilities of the Iraqi police.",
        "And how did that match up to the stories that you read about what was going on in Baghdad when you came back home?",
        "Well, I mean, I certainly think back then, they probably matched up a little bit, but you know, I still have friends who are in the military who are coming home, and I don't hear them being any more confident about the abilities of, you know, the Iraqis, their security forces at this point.",
        "And I think - I don't know if I would blame the media or who, but I know that we think we're confident we're leaving next year, and I don't know, I kind of agree with your guest, that it's going to be difficult to do so.",
