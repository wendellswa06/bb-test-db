        "Afghanistan, of course, is getting a lot of attention as well, and we are seeing diminished interest in what is happening here in Iraq.",

        "What I had found also is through blogging and through just, you know, asking back home, the military, some of the junior officers to include myself, felt somewhat frustrated that not only were the higher-ranking officers, but it seemed like the media were not asking the hard questions back in, you know, in early 2004.",
        "For both the - for all of you, do you feel the media has learned from those lessons, from 9/11 on, are asking those harder questions?",

        "You know, from the junior officers that were doing it, we just didn't seem as supported as we could have been, and although I had mentioned it to some of the reporters in my area of operations, the focus back then was, as you remember, Fallujah, and it didn't - you know, it didn't seem like we were getting the support from the military and also from the media, thinking - because we were not, as you might think, the more important mission back then.",
        "Is the media realizing that the advisory mission is more important, and also is - you know, you're asking those harder questions, you know, questioning our higher command authorities in the area?",
        "Well, a couple of points.",
        "First of all, the transition advising the Iraqis was the top priority under General Casey.",

        "My job is to report, to ask questions, and I think we did ask the hard questions.",
