        "I wondered how they check out their translators.",
        "Not just for accuracy, but might they be hearing a metaphor or there's something that has more than one way to take it.",

        "Well, it's something you have to work with a lot.",
        "I found early on I was bad at it and I'd have to sit down, you know, the day with the translator and say, don't summarize.",

        "Try to give me a literal translation.",

        "For sure, it's very difficult, especially if you don't master the language.",
        "Yes, of course, English is my second language and I don't claim that I speak perfect English, but I manage to communicate with others.",
        "And the problem is that whenever you talk to people, especially when you have non-Iraqi reporters with you, you have to translate everything.",
        "But the problem is that as everyone else is aware of it, there are some kind of cultural differences here.",
        "And our culture - the Iraqi culture, the Arabic or the Muslim culture - is much different than the Western culture.",
        "So things being said in our culture might different - might mean something different in your culture, so we have to be aware of this.",
        "Because sometimes for non-Iraqis, whenever - even if they know the language, the local language, the Arabic language, when they hear a certain word, they make explain it or put it or interpret it in a different way, different than an Iraqi one.",
        "So we have to go through these difficulties and these kind of metaphors, whatever proverbs or saying in our culture.",
        "And we have to put it in a way that gives you the real meaning but in a frame or in the language that you may understand because if you keep on translating literally word by word, you will lose the meaning.",
        "You have to go through metaphors, you have to go through figures of speech to compare a meaning.",
        "It's a difficult job, but you have to do it.",
        "And you have to master this language and you have to understand the exact or the hidden meaning, just like you have to read between the lines, then you may tell the meaning or what is meant by a certain word.",
        "Loraine, thanks very much for the call.",

        "Go ahead please.",
        "I get a lot of my news from you guys and also online.",
        "But a lot of the stuff going on over there - I was over there in '03 when we first rolled through and then I just got back in '07.",
        "And a lot of the stuff over there, I think we are fighting - we began fighting a war that's been going on for thousands of years religion-wise.",
        "So I've seen - as a medic over there - I've seen, kind of, both sides of this story and I think we're going to have a hard time pulling out as quickly as Obama thinks.",
        "And a lot of our guys are dying for senseless reasons right now, so - it's tough.",
        "I think everybody would agree with that - that last part.",
        "Ghassan Adnan, what do Iraqis you speak to tell you about when Washington - when the White House announced it's plans that they will pull out even faster than the time-table laid out in the Status of Forces Agreement?"

        "But when you go to the street level, general speaking or the majority, they are saying, well, if Americans would leave, something bad is going to happen because till now or up to this moment, Iraqi security forces - yes, they are doing a great job, good job, they are being developed progressing everyday, but they are not up to this task or this mission.",
        "They have to spend more time, more training by the US Army.",

        "Not maybe as long as necessary, but I think we're going to find ourselves recognizing that we're in a very hard choice and that there are no moral answers.",
