        "So whenever there's anything involving foam, you know, everybody scrambles, but last night at about 8:00 p.m., the mission managers met and then one of them, Bill Gerstenmaier, head of Space Programs, came out to talk to the press.",
        "And he had the foam in a little Ziploc bag, and you could see it was small, it was sort of three inches by four inches.",

        "They said they think they understood why it came off.",
        "Some ice formed on that day, that it rained and that sort of pinched a joint and some of the foam popped off.",

        "In other words, are there problems, but you're saying, Oh, that's okay, oh, that's okay, just because you're really eager to launch?",
        "And Gerstenmaier said no. He said, We ask ourselves this all the time, and we really feel like these problems are small and we've looked at them very seriously and resolved them.",
        "The other problem that they had in the past few days was with a broken thermostat on a thruster that they use to do some subtle maneuvering in space like docking with the space station, and there are six of those and they decided they could do without one of them, but they had to go through a special procedure and approve a waiver for that.",
