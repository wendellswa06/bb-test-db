        "Tens of thousands of homes were flooded.",
        "In the time since, the local newspaper, The New Orleans Times-Picayune, has been a lifeline for residents.",
        "Earlier today, I asked the paper's editor, Jim Amoss, what today's front page looks like.",
        "It's a mixed bag very much the way New Orleans is a mixed bag today.",
        "You know, there are some signs of resurgence and rebirth, a story about an important part of town across the river, one of the first to emerge and to be humming with residential and commercial activity, a place called Algiers.",
        "Algiers is OK.",
        "Algiers is a beacon in--I won't say an otherwise dark New Orleans but a place that is still struggling to come to life.",
        "What is the photograph at the center of the front page?",
        "The main photograph on our page one shows a bus arriving, carrying workers from Baton Rouge.",
        "It's a regular bus service that FEMA is sponsoring at least for the next two weeks to bring workers into the city, and it's one of the dire needs of the city to have people who can perform the jobs that are needed to make an economy run.",
        "Yeah, it's one of the biggest issues there at the moment.",
        "What time do they have to get on the bus in Baton Rouge to get to work in New Orleans?",
        "The first bus leaves at 4:30 AM, and if you do the trek from Baton Rouge to New Orleans these days, unless you get started before 5 in the morning, there's a horrendous traffic jam each morning coming into the city, which I guess is a good sign.",
        "People are going back to their workplaces even if they don't have housing yet in the city.",
        "If you do this, can you actually work that day when you get off the bus?"

        "That's the bad news.",
        "You just get to tell us on the radio what you think those birds are.",
        "And you can also surf over to our Web site at Sciencefriday.com.",
        "No, it's just started this week, and it's a little bit shaky, and the story points out that many of these people arrive, didn't quite know where to go or what jobs were available, but eventually some found their way to places that were hiring.",
        "One person just walked down Bourbon Street and stumbled on to a job as a cook in one of the restaurants.",
        "One of your headlines says this: Corps Wanted Gate Instead Of Levee Walls.",
        "What is that about?",
        "Well, that is about what went wrong with the levees that are supposed to protect the city and what must be done to build levees that will protect us and will cause us to want to live here in the future.",
        "And this particular story deals with a proposal in the early 1990s to build gates at the very shore of Lake Pontchartrain where the drainage canal that drains the city of rainwater enter into the lake.",
        "And these gates, if they had been built, would have prevented the storm surge that inundated the canals and busted through the levees and flooded the city.",
        "Had they been in place, this probably would not have happened.",
        "You know, almost every week we hear a news story about the failure of the levees and what could have been done and who did what wrong and how much the fix would cost and whether or not that would really work.",
        "What about this one?",
        "Does this seem really practical?",
        "It certainly would have prevented the direst of the flooding.",
        "The disadvantage of the gates and the reason they were opposed by the local sewage and water board is that they make it more difficult to pump rainwater out of the city.",
        "But if you weigh the disadvantage of having some rainwater in your streets vs. having the city inundated by Lake Pontchartrain, I think there's really no contest.",
        "If someone is reading The Times-Picayune this morning looking for a real bright spot--we mentioned Algiers, but just for some sort of uplift either nationally or locally, is it there on the front page?",
        "I would take some uplift and some comfort from an item that we have that says that a local music festival has returned to the city and took place over the weekend and drew some 15,000 people, which in these post-Katrina days is a significant crowd.",
        "Jim Amoss is the editor of The Times-Picayune in New Orleans.",
        "Thank you, sir.",

        "Well, we wanted to hear which unusual birds were spotted in our area here in the New York City area, so we called Audubon's Rare Bird Alert here in New York, and this is what they told us.",
        "Among the Brooklyn counts, 122 species last Saturday, where a Eurasian Wigeon, Red-necked Grebe, Rough-legged Hawk, barn owl, Pine Warbler, and two Yellow-breasted Chats.",
        "Wow, all that here right here in New York City.",
        "So if you joined the Christmas Bird Count, you could have fun at seeing more birds and all kinds of birds, plus the total number of birds, the number of species you report.",

        "Last year, a record number of volunteers in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America counted more than 61 million birds.",
        "Wow, that sounds like a whole lot of birds, and some species, like raptors and doves, are doing well in many places.",
        "But the fact is, in general birds are in trouble.",

        "I know that's quite different, as you mentioned, when you get out into the, you know, certainly the Rockies and the West Coast.",
        "They're getting hammered with storms and snowstorms and a lot of rain in the South, so it's, you know, sort of hit or miss what the weather's like.",

        "There's a lot of open water.",
        "Actually, an awful lot of fresh water has yet to be frozen, even up into Eastern Canada.",
        "So many species aren't concentrated into the areas where we usually anticipate finding them on Christmas Bird Counts.",

        "We actually did have a pretty strong cold snap earlier in the fall, so some of the lingering species kind of got hastened on their way.",
        "And we didn't have anything like the major fall weather events that we had last year that lead up to all the bizarre stuff that was left lingering across the continent, really, on Christmas Counts then with the sort of hurricane events.",
        "So it's sort of a - it actually - the mild weather can actually be to the benefit of the birds, but sometimes to the detriment of the counters because we just can't find them because they're not as concentrated as they usually are."
