        "This weather is not warm enough to prevent them from migrating, is it?",
        "No.",
        "No, actually most birds that are migrating are pretty much programmed to migrate, and it's been more sort of keying on day length and the diurnal cycle, and it gets to a certain point in the late summer and fall and it's just - it's time for them to head south.",
        "So they don't necessarily key as much on what the temperature is doing.",
        "Some of the other species, like robins and things like that, are more sort of keeping an eye to, you know, if - how much snow cover there is, you know, is there food available - wild food - are there still worms and bugs out, and stuff like that, so.",
        "Yeah, there was a picture in the newspaper on the Web today of New York City's most famous raptor, Pale Male.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "Helping out a - an Associated Press photographer actually captured a photo of Pale Male spotting a bald eagle right above it with a fish in its talons.",
        "Well…",
        "That's a rare sight in Manhattan.",
        "I would think so, yes.",
        "I'm sure Pale Male wasn't particularly interested in the fish and was much more interested in the eagle that was over his territory, so.",
        "Are they natural enemies?"

        "Well, Red-tails, or most birds of prey, are quite territorial about their breeding territories, and certainly Central Park is Pale Male's turf, his home turf, and he would notice.",
        "I don't think he would ever actually charge, you know, anything like an eagle, but he would certainly notice it and keep an eye on it.",
        "Dr.",
        "Yaukey, let's talk about New Orleans for a bit.",
        "I've heard that the numbers of resident birds in New Orleans decreased after the flooding to the same extent that the human residents, like yourself, were displaced.",
        "Is that true?",
        "Yes, Ira.",
        "My data from before the storm when compared to after the storm, from some residential areas in New Orleans, showed that about two-thirds of the bird population disappeared for, you know, your typical suburban and urban backyard birds, like morning doves and mockingbirds and house sparrows and so forth.",
        "Interesting.",
        "And how many have returned?",
        "Hopefully more people - more than the residents have returned.",
        "Well, it depends on which species you look at.",
        "You know, some species like - you mentioned Mourning Dove as being doing well in New Orleans.",
        "It actually - Mourning Dove is sort of the best case of a bird that does seem to be coming back and is approaching its former numbers now.",
        "There are many other species, however, which are still very, very scarce.",
        "Cardinal appears, to me, on the verge of disappearing from, I guess, you can say, formerly residential areas of the city that got flooded.",
        "House pigeons are virtually gone.",
        "House sparrows might be at about 30 percent or so of their former numbers.",
        "So not all species are coming back but a few are.",
        "Let's go to the phones to see if we can get a winner on our non-contest.",
        "Hi, Debbie, in Aldridge, New York.",
        "Aldridge.",
        "Yes, hi.",

        "Well, why not?",
        "OK.",
        "I think the first one was an ivory-billed woodpecker.",

        "Yup.",
        "Right.",
        "That's the kind of thing that I - you know, it's the way that, you know, do it - given that the Christmas Bird Count occurs in the same place as you mentioned and the same people doing it in the same way every year at the same time of year.",
        "That's the kind of thing that, you know, you can sort of track over time as to what these - what's involved with the changes of exactly where the birds are and which portions of the local areas as well as the continent that you find them, based on just what's the, you know, what's happening in a given season.",
        "And in the wintertime, the bird feeder helps because the snow covers the ground, but we have no snow out here in the East.",
        "So the birds are they're foraging on their own.",
        "Exactly.",
        "They don't - they just don't really need to come in to the feeders.",
        "And it is - I just want to mention to remember that people should also in addition to feeding the birds, it's also important to have a heated bird bath, or at least keep one that doesn't get frozen during the winter, because as much - almost more importantly than the bird feed itself, they do need water and a place to bath.",
        "Well, that's interesting.",
        "Yeah, and the water will freeze unless you heat it.",
        "All right, we're going to take a short break and come back and take lots more of your calls about the birds, so what kinds of birds have you been spotting, maybe some unusual occurrences, some rare birds.",
        "We'll come back and talk with Geoff LeBaron about the Christmas Bird Count that's going on, and also Dr. Yaukey will tell us some more about what's happening in New Orleans.",
        "So stay with us, we'll be right back after this short break.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "I'm Ira Flatow.",
        "It's our annual Christmas Bird Count program.",
        "With my guests, Peter Yaukey, biographer and chair of the Department of Geography at the University of New Orleans; and Geoff LeBaron, director of the Christmas Bird Count at the National Audubon Society in Williamsburg, Massachusetts.",
        "Our number 1-800-989-8255.",
        "Dr.",
        "Yaukey when you get back to New Orleans, was it like silent spring there?",
        "Yes, you know, it really was almost surreal at some places in the city where - which have been flooded and the people are gone and the birds are also almost entirely gone.",
        "And that the silence, both because of the lack of human noise and the lack of bird noise is really kind of very, very odd and very kind of spooky even in some ways."
