        "And have they been gradually coming back or do they come back in little groups?",
        "I mean one at a time or you see them in groups?",
        "Well, it's actually pretty complicated and different species have been doing it in different ways.",
        "It seems like for some species like the house sparrow, what might be going on is that most of the increase in the numbers.",
        "And there hasn't been a huge increase in numbers yet.",
        "And maybe, you know, have gone from an 85 percent reduction to now maybe a 70 percent reduction in the numbers from formerly - it seems like maybe it's recruitment of young that were born here in the city - fledged here in the city last summer.",
        "Others seem to maybe being recruited from outside the metropolitan area.",
        "So it really isn't clear how they're moving into the city whether it's singly or in groups or how much of the recolinization is occurring due to reproduction and how much of it is due to immigration.",
        "But I think it's probably different for different species.",
        "Geoff LeBaron, are the birds - and I mentioned at the top that there was the impression that birds are generally in trouble in this country that - could that be a correct impression?",
        "It's - I wouldn't say it's quite fair to say that all birds are in trouble.",
        "But certainly, there are some birds that are definitely declining and are in serious trouble but they're actually other species that are doing quite well.",
        "As what Audubon is actually undertaking now is a large-scale study of a Christmas Bird Count database to - we're coming out with next year sometime or a document called the State of the Birds report, which will be the first large-scale analysis of Christmas Bird Count data looking at the trends that show up within the Christmas Bird Count, as well as in comparing them to the trend data that we see from the breeding bird survey in the summer.",
        "And that will give us an even better idea of which species are going up and which species are going down - sort of a - you know, quick early results.",
        "We do know, that things like Rusty Blackbirds, which winter, primarily, in the Southeastern U.S.",
        "are really in dramatic decline.",
        "A species called Harris's Sparrow, which breeds up mostly around James Bay and up in Central Artic Canada, and winters in the South-central U.S., sparrows are declining a quite bit.",
        "But Merlins, which is a sort of a medium-sized falcon, real feisty, a lot of fun birds to watch.",
        "They're actually doing very well across the country.",
        "So it's quite - some birds are increasing, some are decreasing.",
        "And some it's also, you know, are depending upon what region you look at, some are increasing and some areas are decreasing.",
        "And others - so it's sort of a patchwork quilt of what's happening with them.",
        "There you go.",
        "It's probably - certainly a lot of it has to do with the habitat alteration, let's say.",
        "You know, grassland species and shrub lands species as two groups in particular are declining sort of pretty much across the board because there's almost all the native grasslands are very much less than they use to, you know, in the extent that they used to be."

        "There's a whole host of species, including things like Painted Buntings and probably some of the other species like Kestrels and Loggerhead Strikes that are declining that need that sort of transitional habitat.",
        "And as agricultural practices are changing, there's less and less shrub land, and you know, parcels aren't left to go fallow and also as in development tends to gobble up areas that would be left to shrub lands.",

        "More or less, you know, commensurate with the overall loss of the bird population here.",

        "You know, maybe 10 or 20 percent would survive.",
        "After the storm it was more like 80 or 90 percent surviving.",

        "You know, I know that blue jay and crow numbers and also squirrel numbers, by the way.",
        "The squirrel population took a hit similar to both the human and the bird populations.",

        "But at this point, the numbers are still down for the Northern mockingbird, even after this strange summer of very high reproductive success; apparently a released from predation pressure.",
        "The other weird thing about it was that it seems like the high reproductive success is contingent upon the male mockingbird actually being able to attract a female, and that it seems like maybe as high as a quarter or even more of the male mockingbirds were unable to find a female.",
        "And so there's kind of this weird playoff between difficulty in pairing, but very high success if they could find a female.",
