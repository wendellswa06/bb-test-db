        "Well, it could be that the cold - if they had been further north or further up in the hills or something, the cold weather might have actually forced them down more into the valley and closer into areas - I mean into your - nearer to your friend's house.",
        "Robins, during the winter, actually do form big flocks, and often times form tremendous roosts.",
        "There are sometimes counts in the Midwest that can get up to, you know, over a million robins in a given roost.",
        "So if one of those happens to be near your friend's house that could be part of it as well.",
        "And it's one of those things where, you know, most years you might think there just aren't any around, and if you happen to be near the roost, they're kind of everywhere.",
        "But robins in general are one of the species that do seem to be shifting their range northward in the winter.",
        "And that's another one of the things that we're trying to look at with the Christmas Bird Count, is, you know, try to see what birds are shifting their ranges northward.",
        "Some are shifting their ranges southward in the winter.",
        "It's interesting to try to figure out the big picture.",
        "Thank you, Judith.",
        "Could that be due to climate change?",
        "It certainly could be.",
        "That's one of the things that Audubon's going to - and a lot of other people are very interested in looking into that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We can pretty easily document what species are shifting their ranges.",
        "The question then becomes, why are they shifting their ranges?",
        "And to actually document that it's actually climate change is the challenge.",

        "And birders are really good at ferreting out birds and counting them.",
        "And so it's really a very good data set to have handy, and it covers, you know, everywhere from Barrow, Alaska, to even some counts in the tropics now outside of North America.",

        "And those analyses are not complete yet, but they do - the Christmas Bird Count was able to pick up a very strong signal from those storms coming to shore.",
        "It is very clear from the count data that a lot of species, especially resident land birds, were in unusually low numbers last winter immediately after the storms.",
        "Geoff LeBaron, do you ever count city birds like pigeons?",
        "Pigeons?",
