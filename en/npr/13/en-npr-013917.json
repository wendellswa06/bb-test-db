        "You know, for a college to catch up, students, a lot of students, you know, first of all just don't have any income, period.",
        "Secondly, if they are working part time, they often aren't making nearly enough to actually pay the freight.",
        "Does this mean that students end up taking out a greater burden of loans?",
        "You're raising the right questions, Farai; it absolutely does.",

        "So we are looking at really a challenge for young people, if you want to make yourself more competitive, you've got to get a college education.",
        "And we know, the data says, if you get a college education, you are likely to make over the course of your life about a million dollars more that you would if you didn't.",

        "Now she wears her Canadian heritage proudly after she fought in one of the great traditions in Mexican lucha libre, a mask-versus-mask fight that results in the loser having to give up their disguise and reveal their true identity.",
        "The mask is really an important symbol here.",
        "It's very sacred to the wrestlers, not so much for me because I'm from Canada, you know, I'm not part of this whole culture.",
        "But I know people who have been wrestling over 20 years with the same mask and they tell me that sometimes they think that's the only thing of value that they have.",
        "Since she lost her mask, she can now own up to her real name: Sarah Stock.",

        "And the other thing we know is that we meet young people where they are, we take them to where they need to be, we work intensely with our young people.",
        "But at the same time, we really do understand that this proposition called higher education is becoming unaffordable for many people, and we really need to work on ways to make sure that every student who has the desire and the ability, has the opportunity to have access to higher education.",

        "Is it worth it?",
        "And what I mean by that is that - you know, we've talked a bit about whether or not in some cases grad school is worth it - but if you walk out of college with $80,000 in loans, which can happen, is it worth the cost?",
        "Well, if you walk - if you don't go to college and you end up with a million dollars less in lifetime income, what do you think?",
        "I mean, certainly it's hard, and certainly there are lots of possibilities that young people have around coming out with $80,000 worth of debt.",
        "Much of that debt can be negotiated, but the fact is that we know that if you have a college degree, you are going to earn more than someone who didn't.",
        "And so, yes it is worth it, it is snarly.",
        "We need to change public policy, Farai, so that young people who want to matriculate and want to excel and want to have access should have it.",
