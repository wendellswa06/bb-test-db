        "Pursue your passion?",
        "Or go for something more practical?",

        "And she contributed mightily to the study of law and mightily to her sorority and mine, Delta Sigma Theta, mightily to many things.",
        "She didn't get her first choice, but she got another choice.",
        "So I always tell people, look at your many choices.",
        "Don't close any doors.",
        "But the fact is that, you know, take your passion, take it as far as you can, but understand you've got to make a living, and you've got to pay the loan back.",

        "We want every brain to work and to be fully engaged, and we know that college education provides opportunity for so many people.",
        "But at the same time, the dollars are not there.",
        "We've got to raise the dollars.",
        "I've got 105 - 104 peers, HBCU presidents, and we're all doing the same thing, trying to raise money to make sure that our students come into the world with as little debt as we can provide for them.",

        "It is so daunting when I think about how we've gone in 20, 30 years, and how few opportunities our young people have.",
        "And so all I can do is work hard, beg hard, you know, ask for people to invest in our young people, but that literally is what keeps me up at night."

        "But perhaps, just - was a more generic conversation right now, and if they're going to get into some specifics on it, they'll have a further discussion later.",
        "Is it true that Clinton plans to retain all of her delegates and if so, why would she do that?",

        "Obama did win, but she came very close to him in terms of popular vote and number of delegates.",
        "She's behind by about 200 delegates, which isn't a ton, given that there are about 4,000 that were allocated.",
        "So if she kept her delegates, it might give her some additional leverage in pushing for things that she wants, whether it's the VP slot or heighten the tension to some of the issues that she cares about.",
        "But on the other hand, if she's pushing for unity, and she's pushing for the party to all come together behind Obama, why would she want to hold out her delegates, and kind of give the impression that she might be ready to step back in at the convention, if there's some, at that point, concerns or questions about how Obama's faring as the Democratic standard bearer.",
