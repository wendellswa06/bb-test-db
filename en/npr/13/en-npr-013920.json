        "And that was kind of the changing point for me, is when I stopped looking for - stopped caring too much about when I was leaving and started worrying more about when I was coming home.",
        "And you worked on it, and what was effective?",
        "For me it was just - I guess really like listening to my wife when she would, you know, tell me about things, when she would talk to me about what she wanted to do instead of just paying lip service to her, going yeah, sure, that sounds great, because in my head I was thinking, well, I'm not going to be here for that.",
