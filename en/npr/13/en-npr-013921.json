        "I mean, letting that go was almost impossible for a while.",
        "When he came back and had his epiphany and decided that he wanted to work on the relationship, letting him back in and letting him be a part of the process was, you know, it was re-establishing that trust that he still trusted you to be effective and be the woman that you were supposed to be or we thought we needed to be all by ourselves.",
        "But allowing some of the balls to be juggled in his hands instead of just mine when he was home and to reintegrate himself back into our family again.",
        "You talked about how he changed.",
        "You had changed, too, because you had to take control of the family.",
        "You were doing everything, making all the decisions when he was gone.",
        "Just like the caller, I was independent of him, and my life revolved around myself and my children and my career and the FRGs and doing all of the responsibilities that came along with supporting his career.",
        "And he was just something else to do when he came home, unfortunately, and just one more thing to put on that plate that was already way too full.",

        "Do your guests have any suggestions as to what I can do as a friend to be supportive?",
        "I will tell you absolutely do not, you know, dual military marriages are just even more complicated than the single military because you don't have a lot of say in your assignments or this, that and the other, and you're absolutely separated and pulled and tugged by both of your careers all the time.",
        "And neither one of us have experience in that, and I'm sorry, I don't have anything.",
        "I don't know if Lisa does.",
        "We hear a lot of it, and a lot of people talk to us about it, but, you know, I just shake my head and respect that as one more issue that we're having to cope with and that we really need to address.",

        "We can't post anything on Facebook.",

        "And I think that that's something that isn't understood.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think the thing that helped me the most, and I think we've lost this because of the way the war has worked, is those relationships that you build back while the guys are forward, that I think we stopped communicating and getting to know the other ladies that are in similar situations and getting that bond to help you through it.",
        "You can't talk with outsiders about some of the missions and things that they're doing, but having that support system in the rear, where you can talk to people that are actually going through the same thing is so important.",
        "And you don't feel as alone.",
        "And being able to say things out loud and feel like you're in a unity of trust is so important for getting through those deployments, and I think we've lost that, and we need to get back to the old way of doing things a little bit.",
        "It really is, and I'm grateful you had mentioned in your - earlier, Lisa, the FRG.",
        "And I'm really grateful that you had mentioned that.",
        "The FRG is the Family Readiness Group, and it's the support for the families while their husbands or wives are away on deployment.",
        "And that's something that's really made a difference.",

        "No. I still use the same tool.",
