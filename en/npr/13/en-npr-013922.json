        "But my question to you, Sergeant Major, is with TRICARE, do you happen to know if there are any initiatives out there for them to improve some of their mental health services, especially for spouses?",

        "The reintegration briefs that we get now are the same that we got at the beginning of the war, but things have evolved.",
        "As we outlined in our story, there's not a great deal of access to mental health providers on local economies in a lot of places.",
        "And I think we could do more within the Department of Defense to get more health providers for the families.",
        "So I know that it's being discussed.",
        "I know that it's being looked at as the department reviews all of its family care programs.",

        "We end somehow dating a stranger, and the relationship falls apart.",
        "Some of us don't even manage to get to the altar, yet our sacrifices and stresses aren't acknowledged or assisted.",
        "If you're not married, you're not worth helping.",
        "Hooray for the family readiness group center.",
        "Where's the non-dorm living single readiness center?",

        "We've found that we communicate better and more while deployed than while I'm home, just being able to keep each other informed of what's going on, decisions to be made and making an effort to stay part of the decision process for the things going on at home even if I'm not here.",
        "And just found that that has helped us stay closer even when we're miles apart.",
        "So Skype really helps.",

        "Communication, I joke about, you know, when you read stories of wars gone by where a letter was a sent three months before it was received, you know, and the reply took just as long to get back, you know, to the soldier in the trenches, you know, so six months later you get an answer to what you sent.",
        "Those days are so long gone, and communication is so much better now than what has ever been that the only excuse for separation during a deployment is lack of effort.",
