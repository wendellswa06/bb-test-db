        "And last month, he was honored for his work at the National Book Awards.",
        "This year, in partnership with Scholastic, he's giving $1.75 million to school libraries.",

        "So in Louisiana, they had a practice on the books that meant that felony convictions could happen with a split jury, so 10-2 or 11-1.",
        "And voters said, no, we're going to be like the rest of the country, with the exception of Oregon, and we're going to have unanimous juries for felony convictions.",
        "And this was a practice considered by many as kind of a carryover from Jim Crow era, right?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "So after the passage of the 14th Amendment that extended voting rights and, therefore, the right to serve on juries to all people, you know, regardless of race, across the country, Louisiana legislatures moved to create the practice of allowing convictions for split juries.",
