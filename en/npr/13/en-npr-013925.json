        "And let's start with what Tam was just reporting on.",
        "E.J., is the gender gap something that's likely to fade away or do you think the difference between Democrats and Republicans with women votes could determine the outcomes this November?",
        "The Democrats have needed a substantial margin among women ever since 1980, when the gender gap first started appearing.",
        "I think the most striking thing that's happened is that so-called women's issues are now to a remarkable degree economic issues.",
        "I think you heard that in the Hillary Clinton clip.",
        "There was a lot of talk in 2008 about her breaking the glass ceiling.",
        "What she said this time - she was talking about lower income women - it feels to them as though the floor has collapsed beneath their feet.",
        "And the issues that are being talked about - child care, family leave, equal pay for equal work, minimum wage increases - are all about economics.",
        "And that's 'cause the gender gap is especially important in the election among less well-off women.",
        "Yes, abortion and contraception are issues in some races like Colorado.",
        "But I think it's now about economics, which presents the Republicans with very particular challenges.",
        "David, what do you think?",
        "I don't see the challenges.",
        "If you look at The New York Times-CBS poll this week, women are even.",
        "Half are Republican.",
        "Half are Democrat.",
        "Democrats have no advantage, which is unusual.",
        "And so Republicans seem to be holding very well among female voters, in part because I think the issues have migrated to economics and Republicans are scoring reasonably well on that.",
        "But especially because terrorism and security is back.",
        "And we used to have this phrase back in the Bush era - the security moms.",
        "And that seems to be happening too as foreign-policy comes in the fore, people - male and female - go for Republicans.",
        "But if women are splitting evenly between Democrats and Republicans, in that case, in that poll, men would be far more Republican.",
        "Right, so there is still a gap among men and women.",
        "But usually Democrats have a bigger advantage.",
        "And that - The New York Times-CBS poll was surprisingly bullish for Republicans, I thought.",
        "Hmm."

        "Well, because in fact it's in a lot of ways a lose-lose job for people, at least that's the way some people view it.",
        "They come in to try to salvage a war that's gone on more than four years with very little optimism around them at this point that things will get better.",
        "So you know, General Jack Sheehan, a four-star retired Marine general, told me when he was approached by the White House that he decided that they didn't have a coherent strategy.",
        "And why would he want to come in there, get an ulcer, as he said, and then have to leave in frustration months later when he already knew that coming in.",
        "General Lute apparently already has questions about the war.",
        "Wasn't he a skeptic of the surge, this buildup of troops in Baghdad?",
        "He's not sure that's the right thing to do.",
        "That's right.",
        "He was - during the internal policy review that led to the president's announcement in January that he was going to send the extra 28,000, I think, troops to Iraq.",
        "General Lute was one of the most key resistors of this idea.",
        "He thought that a short-term surge would do no good.",
        "It would strain the military and that the broader issues of political and economic stabilization and reconciliation were more important than simply sending more troops to get shot at.",
        "Now, he is a professional military man.",
        "He's a three-star general.",
        "When the president makes a decision, he salutes and says, yes, sir, and I'm going to go along with it.",
        "So he's at this point obviously will implement whatever the president tells him to implement, but he comes in with a point of view, and he comes in with a great deal of experience that his mind supports that point of view.",
        "One last thing.",
        "He's a three-star general.",
        "Right.",
        "He's going to have authority now over four-star generals, over a lot of them, especially over General Petraeus, who's on the ground in Iraq running things there.",
        "But that does work?",
        "I mean, in effect he will.",
        "He's not going to be part of the chain of command in the traditional military sense.",
        "But because he speaks with the authority of the president, he will in effect be telling a lot of four-stars and cabinet secretaries what to do.",
        "And that is an interesting dynamic here that some people feel may be untenable.",
        "You know, what Steve Hadley, the National Security adviser, says about that is, look, you know what, people are going to know he is transmitting orders of the president of United States.",
        "He is the president's agent, not just simply a three-star general.",
        "And therefore that is not a question of how many stars he has on his shoulders, it's a question of who is he speaking for.",
        "We'll see.",
        "I mean, that's going to be a very open and interesting question in the next few months as this goes forward.",

        "Some students who might not have known anyone personally involved in this tragedy are trying to move on and try to get some meaning in this, and try to find some semblance of normalcy.",
        "And you know, the campus at sunrise this morning, there were joggers out on the empty streets as the sun was coming up and it felt like any college campus.",

        "And I asked some students, you know, was that a directive from the administration?",

        "President Bush is going to be here.",
        "And that's supposed to last a little more than an hour.",

        "But clearly the White House was now controlling the event and who would be part of it.",

        "Well, you know, that certainly is plausible.",
