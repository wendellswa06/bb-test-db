        "And he seems to have change his mind over the past couple of weeks, not just campaigning in Iowa personally, although he's made a couple of trips to New Hampshire as well, but never - but pouring a lot of money into the race, both for himself and through the Super PAC.",
        "Well, and there seems to be some pent-up demand to see him now that he's actually here, so his crowds are quite are big.",

        "And those are not the same candidates who look at New Hampshire and say I'm a good fit for New Hampshire.",
        "I think most obviously it would be Mitt Romney, but also Jon Huntsman takes a look at New Hampshire and thinks that that might be a place for him, and that's where he's put all of his eggs in that basket.",
        "A candidate like Newt Gingrich might think that while he might do well in Iowa, that he could also do well in New Hampshire but it seems like the field sort of divides between the Iowa type of candidate and the New Hampshire type of candidate."

        "Well, so they - not only do they have more people wanting loans, but there's also a real influx of money coming from all over the world looking for profit, money from oil-producing countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia, money from China and India, which are booming, is circling the world looking for returns.",
        "And much of it ends up coming to the United States and ends up coming into the mortgage market, and as a result the mortgage market becomes more competitive, which is in many ways a good thing.",
        "It lowered mortgage fees, and it allowed people to get some mortgages that in the past they wouldn't have been able to get, but those good things fairly quickly led to excess.",

        "And so based on that idea that they had never declined, people got it into their heads that they never could decline, and so they bid up prices incredibly high, which then made it a certainty that they would have to decline.",
