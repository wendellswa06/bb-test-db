        "In some cases, people need to connect with jobs in Houston, in Dallas, in Baton Rouge, because their ability to return to New Orleans is long-term because of the damage that their home may have suffered.",

        "Well, I think in this case what we're doing is just basic--dealing with basic needs on one front.",
        "I mean, the other side of it is the broader policy implications that I'm going to talk about this morning; the idea that, indeed, Hurricane Katrina laid bare the problems of poverty, race and class in this nation in a way that many people, to be quite honest, felt that these problems had been solved.",
        "But they were absolutely wrong.",
        "Those of us who work in these areas, who've worked with people in communities and cities, have been loud voices for a long time saying these problems have not gone away.",

        "Now one of the features...",
        "I actually have to jump in just because we're running out of time.",
        "One of the reasons we're running out of time is because we want to talk about the bankruptcy bill which affects a lot of Katrina survivors.",
        "But before I go to that and ask you about that, I want to ask you, in your role as head of the Urban League, do you feel that you should be in an adversarial position to government urging to it to do something different, or should you be in a partnership with government trying to get government to reinvest in work programs that would get Katrina survivors back into their own city?",
        "It's both."
