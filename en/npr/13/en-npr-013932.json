        "I want to move on to some other news this week and these were new revelations about the NSA, this idea that an audit showed that they overstepped privacy rights and was admonished by the FISA court.",
        "That's the court that's supposed to oversee its activities.",
        "Now, buried in the papers today were the names of the four appointees by President Obama to his proposed independent review board that's supposed to kind of take a look at what's been going on with the NSA phone and data monitoring programs.",
        "Is this a first step towards kind of curbing the public's concern about this?",
        "I don't know who wants to jump in first.",
        "Well, I'll jump in and The Washington Post, E.J.'s paper, rather cheekily both did a blog today that points out that the person that Obama has chosen to oversee this panel, Mr. Cass Sunstein, who's a professor of law at Harvard, he, himself, in a paper that he wrote back in 2008, that he co-authored, suggested that government should hire private companies to infiltrate chat rooms and even real life groups to break up ideological complexes and conspiracy theories.",
        "So the idea that Mr. Sunstein would be in charge of NSA abuses of investigating and surveiling domestically is a little complicated (unintelligible).",
        "But, E.J., how about this, right - three out of the four appointees have worked in and out of the administration in security roles.",
        "What's your take here?",
        "Well, I think Cass Sunstein, a distinguished law professor, cares a lot about civil liberties, is a very smart and practical guy.",

        "Americans want to be protected from terrorist attacks.",
        "We also want our privacy.",

        "And I think that's what this commission is about.",
        "The good news is that we're learning a lot and that these disclosures are to be applauded.",
        "But we're also learning that we weren't told things that some of the surveillance may have been questionable.",
        "My colleague Ruth Marcus wrote that an intelligence community consistently too cute by half ends up hurting itself and the folks they're trying to protect.",
        "I think we're trying to rebalance now and I think that's a good thing.",
        "We're also seeing a real divide with Republicans about what to do about this.",
        "This week on our air we had Congressman Sensenbrenner, one of the authors of the Patriot Act talking about the NSA was out of control, the Patriot Act needs to be changed.",
        "Amy, what do you make of this split and how this conversation is being had?",
        "Well, that's right and Mr. Sensenbrenner has been appalled by what's been revealed.",
        "And let's remember that all of these revelations were forced on the NSA by Mr. Snowden and his revelations.",
        "It's not the administration coming clean.",
        "And, in fact, the director of national intelligence, Mr. James Clapper, told a Senate hearing committee that, well, as he described it, the least untruthful answers that he could provide to sitting senators who are supposed to have to oversight of the NSA.",

        "I really believe that there ought to be a moratorium or a suspension of these new provisions to give people an opportunity to determine whether they want to file bankruptcy.",
        "I fear that many people I know have rushed to file bankruptcy to beat the new deadline because they fear that after the deadline they're not going to be able to discharge their debts.",
        "I think that the new bank--features of the new bankruptcy law were just insensitive and inappropriate to try to force people.",
        "It runs counter to what bankruptcy is really all about, and I think that there ought to be some specific provisions, a moratorium if you will, on the new bankruptcy law for Katrina victims and survivors, to give them more time and an opportunity to get their lives together.",

        "Bannon is heavily quoted in journalist Michael Wolff's new book \"\"Fire And Fury.\"\" In it, he calls a meeting that happened at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer, quote, \"\"treasonous,\"\" and he lashes out at the president's son Donald Trump Jr. The quotes made President Trump upset, to say the least.",

        "All right, so I want to get to these quotes, but first, just tell us more about this book and in particular how Michael Wolff got this access - the access he would've needed to write this thing.",
        "Yeah.",
        "He is saying that he did more than 200 interviews for this, and the way that this is being described is that he was at the White House so much last year, he was basically camping out in Steve Bannon's office and other places, as opposed to coming in for specific interviews.",
        "There's a lot of eye-popping quotes from Trump advisers in the excerpts we've seen, not just from Steve Bannon.",
        "A lot of this is being denied by the White House and some of the people quoted, but some of the main allegations that are getting attention are things that have been coming up a lot in a lot of different reports - the idea that Trump just doesn't seem to be engaged on policy, that many of his aides and cabinet members have insulted his intelligence and that he seems to spend a good chunk of his day, according to this book and other reports, seething and watching cable news.",
        "So let's get into exactly what Bannon said because this illustrates what is becoming a deeper rift between these former allies.",
        "What exactly is - has stoked the ire of the president so much?",
        "What seemed to really set this off were quotes that first appeared in The Guardian, going back to that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting set up of a premise of Russian intermediaries having damaging information about Hillary Clinton.",
        "This is the meeting that Donald Trump Jr. famously emailed about saying, if it's what you say it is, I love it.",
        "So Bannon is quoted calling the meeting, quote, \"\"treasonous and unpatriotic.\"\" And he goes on to predict that investigators looking into this will, quote, \"\"crack Don Jr. like an egg on national TV\"\" - other quotes as well.",
        "But going directly after President Trump's family and into a territory that President Trump is so sensitive about - the Russia investigation - seems to have triggered this, this bombastic response from the White House.",
        "And we heard how Sarah Huckabee Sanders characterized the president's response.",
        "But then the White House actually took an extraordinary step and issued a statement from the president on this.",
        "Yes.",
        "And even with the statements we've been accustomed to reading on Twitter and elsewhere, this was remarkable.",
        "It discredits Steve Bannon.",
        "It says he's always overstated his importance.",
        "This was issued from the president himself.",
        "The line that really stood out was, when he was fired, he not only lost his job; he lost his mind.",
        "In addition to that, Trump's personal lawyers have sent a cease-and-desist letter.",
        "They're threatening a lawsuit, but we should point out, throughout his career, President Trump has consistently threatened lawsuits and not actually filed those lawsuits.",
