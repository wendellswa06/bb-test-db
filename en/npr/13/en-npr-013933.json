        "Ian Shepherdson says the big thing holding back U.S.",
        "growth is the sequester, the across-the-board federal spending cuts that took effect in January.",
        "I think the public spending cuts really are doing damage.",
        "And they'll do more damage in the second half of the year.",
        "Shepherdson says other challenges for the economy include weak consumer incomes and another potential damaging fight on the debt ceiling this fall.",
        "What the U.S.",
        "really needs to turn the economy around completely is for Congress to stop doing crazy things and for the recovery in bank lending to the business sector - which has been progressing very nicely - to continue and bring those small and medium-sized businesses back into the game.",
        "Shepherdson says that, so far, the recovery has largely been restricted to large firms because banks were reluctant to lend to smaller ones.",
        "If that changes, he thinks smaller businesses will resume hiring.",
        "Federal Reserve policymakers also weighed in on the economy today.",
        "After a two-day meeting, they issued a statement that was little different from the one following a meeting six weeks ago.",
        "There was no mention of Chairman Bernanke's timeline for dialing back the Fed's huge bond-buying stimulus.",
        "That timeline rattled the markets when it was unveiled in June.",
        "Policymakers did downgrade their assessment of economic growth, from moderate to modest, suggested some concern about rising mortgage rates and noted that inflation is lower than they want it to be.",
        "But Shepherdson thinks the Fed is still on course to begin exiting its stimulus in September, as Bernanke has suggested.",
        "The Fed seems to put much more emphasis on the labor market numbers than they do to growth or inflation.",
        "And so, bearing in mind that the payroll numbers have been revised up since the chairman made those remarks in June, I think that they're probably still on course to announce a tapering of their asset purchases beginning in September.",
        "Diane Swonk agrees.",
        "If they continue to see modest improvements in the labor market, they're going to be willing to lift their foot off the accelerator a little bit, but certainly not hit the brakes anytime soon."

        "When Trump's spoken publicly about Bannon before, he said, you know, Steve Bannon's a friend, he's an adviser, but he came on late in the campaign, and, you know, I'm the one who was responsible for this.",
        "But this idea that Bannon is totally out of the loop on the presidency - we should say that he was a close adviser and that at the beginning of the administration, President Trump basically appointed him as almost a co-chief of staff with Reince Priebus.",
        "That was an unprecedented move.",
        "Which he did on purpose to kind of create this competition to see who would rise and who would fall.",
        "Right, right.",

        "Well, he did that many years ago to pen plays for the theater, and his most recent is called \"\"Taboos.\"\" And it's playing for the next three weeks here in New York and the play tells the story of two couples trying to become parents through artificial means.",
        "One is a lesbian couple, the other an infertile Christian husband and wife and they play raises some really interesting and complicated questions about reproduction, when sex and children no longer go hand in hand.",
        "So what does it mean to be a parent in the modern world of birth control, infertility drugs, test-tube babies when we all can interchange our sperm and egg and then raise children, surrogate parents, all kinds of issues.",
        "Very interesting issues.",

        "Well, that's my preoccupation in the last probably 20 years when I started moving from the laboratory to be coming an author first of novels and then of plays.",
        "I either first started with the issue of reproduction, what is happening in this world, things using separation of sex and reproduction, sex as usual in the usual places.",
        "Reproduction more and more under the microscope on the other assisted conditions.",
        "And the implication it has not so much of the scientific ones, but really the societal ones and that includes everything from women's rights and the power position of men and women, the power of elation of women.",
        "Women and sex reproduction all the way to (unintelligible).",

        "Christians is not really correct.",
        "It is a fundamentalist couple because it wouldn't make any difference whether they are Christian or Jewish or Muslim or anything else.",
        "But I wanted to say fundamentalist, and fundamentalist doesn't have to be fundamentalist Christian although in this case, it is.",
        "Because I think that it's another issue that I find it necessary to address many people who have a very preconceived notions about what is proper and improper in sexual reproduction, and yet, they themselves frequent violate it which to me is a form of hypocrisy to which we should call attention particularly in this politically-charged climate right now."

        "Mm hmm.",
        "Do you write these plays because you think these are dialogues that scientists should be having but they don't speak out enough about them?",
        "Well, that is true also of the fiction, the science fiction that I wrote first.",
        "I've written five such novels and now, about eight plays.",
        "But that's the fundamental point scientist, I'm talking about active research scientists.",
        "Don't spend the time of talking to the public for very obvious reasons.",
        "Not only don't they think there's a time, but they get no brownie points for it by their professional peers and really professional recognition in science depends entirely - absolutely entirely on your peers and naturally general public.",
        "So really don't get any brownie points for that, and people that are willing to do this, people like me, basically are doing this when they are, you know, emeriti or close to the end of their active professional career which is extremely unfortunate.",
        "But I think we scientists have to talk to the public and I'm particularly interested in doing it in a dialogic format who out of then just giving popular lectures or adding popular articles, because dialogue - really the most human form of intercourse you might say, which was used in literature from the Greeks all the way through Galileo and to the Renaissance is not used as a literary genre now except in plays.",
        "Now, the plays that I'm writing are intellectual plays.",
        "They are - I hope also amusing, and there were lots of laughs and performance I saw that's now \"\"Taboos,\"\" but you know, every, any play is only seen for a short while, and I really feel very strongly that plays can also be a read as books, certain plays.",
        "Plays of Tom Stoppard(ph) for instance just to give an example.",
        "A wonderful literature and just to call them plays is in a way demeaning.",
        "They're more limiting their exposure, and I feel very strongly about this and that's why I'm delighted that after this play will show - published in book form in just a couple of weeks ago by the University of Wisconsin Press under the the excellent title, 'Sex in An Age of Technological Reproduction\"\" and that's really the theme that I'm addressing.",
        "Yeah, it is.",

        "You know, I saw that, for example, in the state of Utah earlier this year, the legislature adopted similar legislation.",
        "Another way is to use leverage, or debt.",
        "So let's say you have $1 million and you borrow 99 more million dollars, and then you make your $100 million bet.",
        "And then that $100 million bet rises in value to $101 million, the same 1 percent increase I just described a minute ago.",

        "It's a great return.",
        "Homebuyers do the exact same thing when they make a down payment rather than paying the full price of their home.",
        "It works wonderfully on the way up and miserably on the way down, because if the investment declines by one million, you're now totally wiped out.",
        "Well, things go along, everybody gets into it.",
        "They formulate more and more of these kinds of hedges and multipliers.",
        "You quote Robert Rubin, who's got to be one of the smartest money guys in the world, the brilliant secretary of the Treasury for President Clinton - he's now an executive at Citibank - and you quote him saying last week there's some kind of financial instrument he'd never even heard of until it turned out to be trouble for Citigroup."
