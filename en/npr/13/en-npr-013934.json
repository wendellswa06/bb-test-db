        "That's something traditionally left to the governor or attorney general.",
        "The bill is sponsored by Michigan State Representative Robert VerHeulen.",
        "And when we reached him in Lansing, I asked why this bill is necessary now.",
        "Well, I think across the country, we're seeing more and more public policy issues are being addressed in the courts rather than solely in the legislative chambers.",
        "So I think it's important that the voice of the legislature as an institution be heard in some of these legal proceedings.",
        "Let me try to nail down your specific concerns.",
        "The incoming attorney general, a Democrat, has said she will not support certain state laws such as the one on same-sex adoption.",
        "Is that something you're trying to address here?",
        "Well, not directly, but I suppose it's possible that if the attorney general feels that an act is unconstitutional, I think professionally it would be very challenging to ask her to defend the constitutionality of that.",
        "If the legislature thinks it is constitutional, well, then perhaps that's an example of when this would be utilized, where the legal analysis undertaken on behalf of the legislature would be different than that of the attorney general.",
        "But to the timing question here, Republicans have controlled the legislature for eight years.",

        "You know the man's family name or the family blood, things like this.",
        "In consequential compared to the role that you're playing as a parent in fathers, and people who think that this impending separation of sex and reproduction will destroy - affect the nuclear family are totally wrong in my opinion because if you, in fact, to resort to more and more to assist the reproductive techniques for various reasons and we can try and address that, not just infertile people but fertile people.",
        "But you only do this once or twice in your lifetime because in Europe average five family is now 1.5 children.",
        "In the United States, it's something like 2.1.",
        "So, people have very few children.",
        "So, the important thing is what do they then do with the children?",
        "How do they behave to other children and that a wanted child because any child conceived by assisted is a wanted child not an inadvertent one, not an accidental pregnancy is this cement for a functioning family.",
        "And since both parents want to have a child, I think that both of them are going to pay more attention to the parenting aspect of it which I think makes it a much better and more meaningful nuclear family than just one which is a family in name only in where their mother plays most of the functions.",

        "It is better to have two parents, but it is really particularly important to have one loving parent.",
        "Many people are born under condition - many babies are born or children are born under conditions where they were totally unwanted.",
        "Remember out of all pregnancies that occurred in the world, about 50 percent unexpected and 25 percent of them are unwanted and that results - that's the reason why we have nearly 50 million orphans each year.",
        "So, it is much, much better to have one loving parent than to have two lousy ones, and I think lots of people have these.",
        "OK, Elaine?",
        "Thanks.",
        "Thanks for calling.",
        "1-800-989-8255.",
        "I find that your plays are could be great educational tools.",
        "So find that schools are able to use them or are your topics so controversial these days and not politically correct enough for a lot of schools that they shun that?",
        "Well, forget about political correctness, but your question is the key question.",
        "Now, this play, \"\"Taboos\"\" is written for the commercial theater and it involves, you know, theater production and so on.",
        "I've written at the same time, it play just called, \"\"ICSI\"\" and that is the technique that I was referring to inter-fad of love, an experiment injectional, the injection of a single sperm into an egg which is one of the key methods that is being used in that it's having enormous - enormous, ethical and practical and reproductive consequences.",
        "And that play which is a pedagogic word play just with two voices and you just need to read them, you need no staging and so on.",
        "With audiovisual materials also included in that same book with which came out in \"\"Taboos.\"\" And this is now been used in Europe and actually also in Taiwan because it was translated into German before hundreds and hundreds of high school students that I saw but I also saw it at two medical congresses, I saw it at the Royal Academy of Medicine in England, BBC Radio Three broadcast it where I played one of the roles.",
        "And the interviewer, Vivian Perrier (ph) a woman Ira Flatow in London the other role.",
        "We didn't tell the people it was before a live BBC audience that in fact it was - pedagogic play that I'd written because it's in a form of a TV interview between a woman, green moderator, a very critical moderator and a scientist discussing this particular fields that subject so you get the pros and cons all the time.",
        "You don't just get one view, that's a very important thing.",
        "I don't give them any answers, I only raise questions.. And when we did this on the BBC, people had not realized that in fact we're doing a play of mine, they thought it was a real interview because it was before a live audience and then they announced that in fact it was a play, and everyone was rather amused by this.",
        "So, I have very important pedagogic motives and that is the reason why this paperback which I happened to pluck in my hand which it's called \"\"Sex in an Age of Technological Reproduction\"\" contains both plays.",
        "It contains the play \"\"Taboos,\"\" it contains the pedagogic word play ICSI which is only 45 minutes long so it fits into a classroom, and it contains a CD with all the audiovisuals and even shows a DVD of the actual ICSI injection, how you see the injection of a single sperm into the next which very dramatic.",
        "There's nothing question of political correctness, there are no four-letter words in there.",
        "If people are embarrassed to look at this then I think they fail entirely in sex education in schools entirely.",
        "Do you think that scientists can learn something from your plays?",
        "I beg your pardon?",
        "No question whatsoever.",
        "I've done this - first of all, if I ask a group of chemists just tell me what is ICSI.",
        "Well, you know nine out of 10 haven't gotten the foggiest idea.",
        "And after most scientists other than reproduction biologist or biologist are really not any better informed about reproduction and the complicated social consequences than any other person.",
        "I mean, we are all citizens and I think this is not to written down to an audience, it's written to a general audience and as I told you, it was done before the Royal Academy of Medicine where average audience were 60 and these were there, the (unintelligible) of British medicine.",
        "And they were asked, taken and engaged by this as I've saw high school students, and I talk to high school student.",
        "I basically mean juniors and seniors.",
        "It's not that younger ones can't understand it but I think the languages about a little bit more sophisticated because I really don't like to talk down to people.",

        "And I have to say, I enormously admire women who are generous enough to do this because they are believing and sort of helping parents who cannot have children particularly women.",
        "And we feel best on it that didn't - do not want to adopt, but want to go through the intimate birthing process even though it's not their own genetic child.",
        "And I think I can only commend the caller.",
        "I can only say I wish you would see my play because you'll see there is - they show the discussion, it's - in this case a conflict between a surrogate egg donor who also is a mother at the same time because she donates one of the eggs to one woman but the other one she uses herself.",
