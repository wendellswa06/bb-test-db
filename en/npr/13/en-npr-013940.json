        "The president takes some of the statements by Republican leaders and important and prominent Republicans about the absolute folly of pursuing a strategy that ties raising the debt ceiling to demands on spending cuts.",
        "The fact that it is folly, you know, we take heart in that because we believe it's good for the economy to cease that practice.",
