        "I think one of the challenges created by the Affordable Care Act is that it did put in place a system that is unsustainable, whether it's fiscally unsustainable or unsustainable because it's creating regulatory issues that are raising premiums to a significant percentage where you've got insurance that's affordable in many places.",
        "And so what I think Graham-Cassidy fundamentally does is, one, is it addresses those issues of affordability of health insurance by creating potentially a more competitive landscape in many states.",
