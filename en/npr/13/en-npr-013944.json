        "Some of the water the feeds this neighborhood stream runs through enormous piles of waste from another old mine, the Empire, now a state park.",
        "Mine waste, called tailings, can contain metals like mercury, and chemicals that become dangerous if they're even exposed to air.",

        "The only thing that I had was my teammates, who were amazing and then, you know, when you're having an off day or a really bad day, you could call them up and say, hey, I just need you to tell me it's going to be all right.",
