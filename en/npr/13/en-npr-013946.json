        "If I might linger on this a bit, Governor Blagojevich, as those of us from Illinois know, he has a popularity rating that almost makes President Bush like - look like the winner of \"\"American Idol.\"\" He's had some real reverses in the popularity polls and some, again, run-ins, disagreements with other Illinois politicians.",
        "Have you had any conversations with him on this?",
        "I have had no conversations with the governor.",
        "He has indicated in a press conference the other day that he has no interest in having conversations with any of the prospective candidates.",
        "He's trying to put together a team of people who will make a judgment or a recommendation to him, and then he alone will solely make a determination.",
        "I hope that the governor looks at my record objectively.",
        "I've served in Congress for nearly 14 years.",
        "I'm the only member of Congress, Democrat or Republican, who after casting thousands of votes has only missed two.",
        "I brought billions of dollars back to the state, $600 million to my district, specifically.",
        "If the decision is based upon record, upon tenure of service, upon consistency in service, and loyalty to Barack Obama, which he will need on day one in the United States Senate, I would hope that the governor would give my record consideration.",
        "Congressman, millions of people around the world saw the multitudes in Grant Park and I think were able to pick out the face of your father, tears streaming down his face, as an African-American, and in fact an African-American politician from the South Side of Chicago, was elected president and addressed the nation Tuesday night.",
        "What does this moment mean for your family, your father, for the country?",
        "Let me tell you what I think it meant for Reverend Jackson and Congressman John Lewis and Dorothy Height and Julian Bond, and other luminaries who made that moment possible.",

        "And so for them to see, and for us to see, Barack Obama emerge as the president-elect and the 44th president of the United States, that had to be an extraordinary moment.",
        "And it truly was.",
        "I think all Americans can share in the progress that we've made as a nation.",

        "It's a world that George Hawley of the University of Alabama spent a lot of time in.",
        "He wrote the book \"\"Making Sense Of The Alt-Right\"\" and has interviewed dozens of activists in the movement.",
        "Earlier today, Hawley told me last weekend's rally in Charlottesville was an effort by those activists to move their community from the virtual world into the real one.",
        "I think the goal was to show that this is not - at least anymore - a movement that is purely made up of anonymous Twitter trolls.",
        "These are people who are willing to come out and make a show of force and be seen out in the real world."

        "Now, is there a connection to those longstanding white supremacy movements that people are most familiar with, say, the KKK or skinhead groups?",
        "For the most part, no. What makes the alt-right unique compared to earlier white nationalist movements - as you mentioned, skinhead gangs and the KKK - is that those movements existed for the most part in the real world.",
        "They were real organizations that had people gathering in real life.",
        "And for most of the short history of the alt-right, that has mostly not been the case.",
