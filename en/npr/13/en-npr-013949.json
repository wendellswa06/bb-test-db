        "The original idea was that primary care physicians would be put in charge of patients and given a fixed amount of money for all care, which would give the doctor an incentive to improve the overall health of the patient, because the healthier the patient, the more money the doctor could keep.",
        "The system, however, led to more denials of tests and operations, which Zebley says was shocking to patients.",
