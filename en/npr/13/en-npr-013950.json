        "Well, President Ahmadinejad has been rather silent, and his past policies have really worked to try to relegate and push women back into the home.",
        "And in recent weeks, his advisor on women's issues has taken a very negative stance towards women's rights and basically, in her last press conference, she said that if you want to have equality between men and women, then you should probably vote for a reformist candidate.",
        "Mousavi has outlined some…",
        "Wait, meaning that Ahmadinejad's administration calculates that a lot of Iranians do not want equality between men and women if they're going to speak like that?",
        "No, I think it's really more of an ideological difference in the way that they see women.",
        "I think within the Islamic Republic, always, the issue of women's rights has really been framed in the context of equity as opposed to equality, meaning that men and women have different roles, they have different responsibilities and therefore they should have different rights.",
        "But in this presidential campaign, we're seeing the use of the term equality as opposed to equity.",
