        "The vote on the spending bill was expected as early as today but looks more likely to be pushed into next week, in part because House Republicans are stalling the vote, accusing the Democrats of abusing their power.",

        "Yes, he did a great number of experiments, and he read a very large number of books and articles about what farmers and animal breeders generally did.",
        "And this was the basis of his work, that there was an analogy, he suggested, between the farmyard and the selective procedures that horticulturalists, gardeners, farmers were very familiar with and what might happen in the wild.",

        "He was traveling with a book that he had been given before he left on the Beagle voyage, which was written by the man who then later became one of his closest friends - Charles Lyell.",
        "And Lyell's doctrine was that the geological world only operates through very minute and very slow and gradual accumulation of little events.",
