        "But he was delighted that the Beagle voyage - the invitation to go on the Beagle voyage intervened.",
        "And for a few months on the Beagle voyage, he was still thinking he might return to become a clergyman, but that soon died away.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "How unusual was it?",
        "He was a wealthy young man from a very prominent family.",
        "Nevertheless, to get the opportunity to go on this trip as a gentleman companion, this was quite unusual.",
        "It's a fabulous opportunity.",
        "And I've done some research into whether other people ever had that opportunity offered to them, and it seems that Darwin was genuinely unique in this regard.",
        "Often, when a companion or a naturalist was wanted for a voyage, they would be well-qualified people who were already known to the British Admiralty or to the captain of the ship.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "In this particular instance, I think we have to put it down to the captain who probably didn't have very many friends in those areas.",
        "And the captain, Robert FitzRoy, asked the admiralty to find him someone.",
        "And the old boy network immediately got into operation, and they wrote around to their friends in the universities, and very luckily, very fortunate - what a wonderful opportunity - Darwin's professor said I think I've got just the man for you.",

        "Even before they married, she said my reason tells me that honest and conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us.",
        "She expressed the fear that science was leading him into ever greater skepticism.",
        "Hesitantly, she suggested that Darwin's doubts might prevent them meeting in the afterlife or belonging to each other forever.",

        "When I am dead, know that I have many times kissed and cried over this, Darwin wrote on the edge.",
        "That's a very moving episode with his wife, but was Charles Darwin an atheist?",
        "Oh, he was never an atheist, no. But he did have very considerable doubts all through his life about the role of the divine in nature, and he says when he wrote \"\"The Origin of Species,\"\" that if - that really he should - he considered himself a deist, that he believed in something - something supernatural, something powerful, something divine - but he certainly didn't adopt the principles of the Protestant church in which he was raised.",
        "I think he probably would have called himself a Christian, but he was never, ever an atheist.",
        "There was some interesting works written at the end of his life.",
        "After he died, one or two people tried to suggest that he was an atheist, and the remaining family came out very strongly and said, no, no...",
        "Hmm.",
        "...Darwin was never an atheist.",
        "Let's call him agnostic."

        "If he'd published his book today, I'm sure he would have received quite a few.",
        "Well, the climate was different then.",
        "No, he didn't receive death threats.",
        "What he did receive were what he used to call curious letters, so he certainly received abusive mail of a nature that either accused him of dancing with the devil and things like that.",
        "Or he was being accused personally of introducing doubt in the minds of children and women and people who were less able to - in those days it was thought - make up their own minds.",

        "I have colleagues who - I'm in the medical field as are they, so they've had science classes, they've had biology, microphysiology, all those kinds of courses, and yet still can't see the science behind Darwin's work and just refuse to even discuss it sometimes."

        "Bye-bye.",

        "We think of Darwin primarily in terms of his ideas as a challenge to religion, yet at the time, this was also seen as politically dangerous, this was a threat to the proper order.",
        "Well, yes.",
        "If you start saying that animals and plants were not given their identity and their place in the natural world, the implication immediately is, well, what about human beings?",
        "Are they, too, not given their particular place in the world?",
        "And that opens the door - it certainly opened the door in 19th century thought - for all kinds of questions about, well, maybe the natural hierarchy of the social order - as was very rigid in the United Kingdom in Darwin's country at that time - perhaps there would be opportunity for the social order to change and evolve in just the same way as he was suggesting that animals and plants did.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "There was also - various people came up with adaptations of Darwin's theory - this was not endorsed by the man himself - ideas that came to be known as Social Darwinism and which a lot of people - which led to a lot of problems later.",
        "It sure did.",
        "Much of Darwin's work, in fact, was based on an idea of what humans might be like in societies, so Darwin was not completely separated from these ideas, but they were extended onwards after his death, towards the end of his life, by other people to suggest that - putting it very crudely - might is right, that the economic structures of a society should be adjusted so that competition could flourish in an unfettered way, and that those people who succeeded in the competition for existence in the economic and political world, those nations that succeeded in that kind of competitive struggle, were by definition therefore the fittest.",
        "Now these are difficult and dangerous ideas.",
        "We know they all came to a head in the Second World War, and I think we find it very objectionable now to discuss and address Social Darwinism as if it were still a living thing.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Here's an e-mail from Matthew.",
        "It's my understanding that Darwin didn't like or use the term evolution because it implies a progress, a movement forward, and Darwin's theory of natural selection just explains adaptation and change without any implication that later species are superior to earlier species.",
        "Yes, you're quite right.",
        "The - he does use the word evolution later on in his life, once it becomes - takes on the meaning that it has today.",
        "But Darwin was extraordinarily conscious of the fact that change isn't necessarily progress, that adaptations might in fact be very successful if they took an animal backwards or took an animal sideways, or maybe a plant might be more advantageously adapted if it was a little more primitive than its relatives.",
        "So there was no necessary progress in Darwin's scheme, and that's been the most difficult thing for many people to understand in his own day.",
        "And even now, it's still very hard to deal with that.",
