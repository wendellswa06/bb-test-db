        "Hi, there.",
        "Professor, I was wondering if your - what your thoughts are about Alfred Russel Wallace.",
        "In particular, I have a book that I read, it was published in 1980, called \"\"A Delicate Arrangement: The Strange Case of Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace\"\" by Arnold Brackman, B-R-A-C-K-M-A-N.",
        "Out of print, but I got it at the library, and it's available as a used copy on Amazon.",
        "And this author, he basically makes a case that Darwin was in a crisis about how to really put his theory of evolution all together, and he was spurred to publish \"\"On the Origin of Species\"\" as a result of some correspondence from Wallace, who - in looking to get some validation for his ideas - had sent him a transcript of his theory.",
        "And it caused a great deal of consternation, not only for Darwin, but for his celebrated friends that you referred to in the beginning, and that there was a crisis of primacy - who was going to get credit for articulating this theory of evolution?",
        "And I understand that Darwin himself actually gave Wallace credit as being a co-creator of theory of evolution.",
        "But this man Alfred Russel Wallace is really quite forgotten, certainly in a lot of academic writing.",
        "So I'm wondering what your thoughts are and if you're familiar with Arnold Brackman's book, \"\"A Delicate Arrangement?",
        "I don't want to even think about it.",
        "I don't want to think about it because I don't want to see this place destroyed.",
        "And it might be.",
        "It might be.",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, all the Darwinists are very familiar with the Brackman book and with a number of other books that suggest that possibly Alfred Russel Wallace has been the victim of either a bit of sharp dealing on Darwin's part or even the victim of a conspiracy, a silence, because Wallace did come up with almost identically constructive theory of evolution by natural selection.",
        "He is one of the several individuals who think of evolution at the same time as Darwin.",
        "Wallace writes this up and sends it to Darwin, who he knew a little bit.",
        "And the Brackman argument is that Darwin stole some things from Wallace's writings before he then acknowledged the receipt of Wallace's letter and the two went forward to publish jointly.",
        "So there's a lot of accusation flying around there from defenders of Alfred Russel Wallace.",
        "The case, as most people now seem to think as it happened, is that Wallace and Darwin were both exceptionally generous men, and neither of them knew that the other one was working towards this same theory.",
        "So that when their paths crossed in this very circumstantial way, they were, of course, shocked.",
        "Anyone who has put together such a tremendous theory would be shocked to find somebody else had the same idea.",
        "And they very delicately - that's why the book is called \"\"A Delicate Arrangement\"\" - very delicately wished to share the credit with each other - an extremely gentlemanly arrangement.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Hmm.",
        "You know, there was - follow up that is that Brackman made the case that Darwin was a lousy writer, that the \"\"Origin of Species\"\" was very difficult to read and he had difficulty elucidating concepts.",
        "And that if you looked at contemporary writings from Wallace at the time and communications that he had sent to Darwin, it was much cleaner prose, much more well thought out."

        "Yes, that's right.",
        "If you think of Wallace as the brilliant essayist with the clarity of vision and the tight prose of an essayist and Darwin as the man who had spent 20 years plodding through the evidence and piling it up in these great accumulated chapters, that they are both working on the same thing with different styles.",

        "Hi.",
        "Coincidently, I was in England last week and I went to Darwin's house.",
        "And there was a display there about his family, and one thing was very intriguing.",
        "It said that his grandfather had his own theory of evolution.",
        "And I was wondering - there wasn't much about it, so I'm wondering if you could speak to that.",
        "Yes.",
        "His grandfather was called Erasmus Darwin and was a doctor, a philosopher and a poet - a combination that you don't often find.",
        "And the grandfather was part of the 18th century rationalist group of thinkers who believed in progress - a little bit different from the grandson."

        "Putting round another way, Erasmus Darwin - the grandfather - didn't really have a mechanism for the changes that he was proposing.",
