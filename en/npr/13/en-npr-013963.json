        "OK, but if I went to the North Pole, I wouldn't see him.",

        "I don't have any pictures of the injustice, so I guess it's not unjust.",
        "So how exactly are we going to cash out this idea that there's something wrong with believing in Santa Claus but there's something good in believing in justice or things that are just?",
