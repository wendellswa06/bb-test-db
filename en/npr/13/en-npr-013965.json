        "I don't know if you've read any of her other books.",
        "They can be quite bloody.",
        "But they're great crime mysteries that are - also have really great characterization but not at the expense of plot.",
        "And so the book I want to recommend is called \"\"Pieces Of Her.\"\" It's totally propulsive.",
        "It's about a young woman named Andy Oliver.",
        "She's at lunch with her mom, chatting it up when, all of a sudden, next to her a deranged young man comes up with a gun.",
        "And her mother does something very, very surprising for a lady who is described as knowing where all the tops to the Tupperware are, which is that she very calmly and coolly kills him.",
        "(Laughter).",
        "So I'm not going to say any more than that.",
        "The rest of the book is this roller coaster ride of finding out who her mother is.",
        "And it's also this really great mother-daughter story.",
        "And, bonus, it will be turned into a mini-series by Netflix.",
        "What is that called again?",
        "Just remind me.",
        "It's called \"\"Pieces Of Her,\"\" by Karin Slaughter.",
        "But if you're waiting for the next book like that that's coming out, the hottest off the press, I would recommend \"\"Bunny\"\" by Mona Awad, which is also very funny and very sharp and an extremely readable page-turner, which is coming out in June.",
        "I also think about summer reading as escapism fiction.",
        "You know, you want to go to another world or back in time or fantasy novels.",
        "What about that?"

        "Yeah.",

        "They just announced it.",
        "And it might take you until next summer to finish \"\"Wolf Hall,\"\" to be ready.",

        "This is a - like, a - certainly a long piece of psychologically realistic fiction.",
        "But you - from the minute you meet Thomas Cromwell, you really are going to be sucked in.",
        "And if - if you are a \"\"Game Of Thrones\"\" watcher who is interested in how power corrupts, how an intensely human, brilliant person can, you know, become the kind of person that maybe dragon fires a whole village or - I don't know - takes down the Catholic Church and murders a queen, then, you know, \"\"Wolf Hall\"\" is for you.",
        "Plus, you then will have the benefit of being right on time in March, when the third one comes out.",
        "What about for your friend, the - the I-don't-do-fiction reader, the reader that wants to read...",
        "I don't know any of those people.",
        "(Laughter).",
        "I don't know many, but I know they exist - the person that doesn't really want fiction.",
        "They want nonfiction.",
        "They want something smart to read.",
        "I'm thinking more along the lines of, like, Ron Chernow's \"\"Hamilton\"\" that everybody became obsessed with, that read like fiction but was actually the book that's going to impress people that you read this summer."
