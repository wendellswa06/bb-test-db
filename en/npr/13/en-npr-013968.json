        "Yes.",

        "His work on music was very well respected.",

        "And he then proclaimed that plague or the disease was a living thing.",
        "There's still a debate now going on about whether he should be given credit for the germ theory of disease, but because I'm a fan of him, I think that he should be given credit for that, at least.",

        "That's the law that will require almost every American to become insured by 2014.",
        "Now the idea is that as the marketplace for insurance grows, so will competition, and the price for getting coverage will go down and it will save taxpayers' money, money that goes to pay for health care costs for the uninsured who get treatment but can't pay for it.",
        "Now many Republicans say they don't have a problem with that idea; it's just that they believe Congress doesn't have the constitutional authority to make people buy insurance.",

        "The state then will often pay for it.",
        "There are uncompensated care pools in most states where they help try to offset the losses that hospitals have from the patients coming in.",
