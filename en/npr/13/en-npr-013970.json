        "Now, many conservative lawmakers would agree that the story we just heard is a problem, and some might even agree with the idea that if everyone were insured, health insurance costs would fall for everyone.",
        "But what those same conservatives object to is the idea that everyone must have insurance.",
        "They say that the commerce clause in the Constitution and even Congress' tax authority doesn't cover this question.",
        "Here's California Congressman Dan Lungren, a Republican.",
        "What Congress has attempted to do, and the president by signing the bill, is to say that the individual citizen, you are required to enter into a contract, that is you're required to buy a product, in this case something called health care insurance or health care coverage.",
        "And if you do not, you'll suffer a penalty.",
        "So if you accept the fact that one's participation in one's own health care is somehow a matter of interstate commerce, in this case it goes even beyond that.",
        "It says that if you refuse to enter interstate commerce - that is, if you consciously decide to be inactive - that in and of itself is a type of interstate commerce.",
        "I mean, it's a question that if you answer it in the way that those who support this bill answer it, it leaves you no room to - well, for any concept of freedom if you really think about it.",
        "So you would argue, just to clarify, that health insurance is not a form of commerce.",
        "In this particular case, it goes beyond that.",
        "It goes to the question of whether you can be mandated to enter into it.",
        "I mean, the famous case decades ago goes to the question of whether someone who is a farmer and is growing weed, I think it was, or corn or whatever the commodity was, could produce it in their own backyard or basically in a small part of their farm for their own personal use and whether that would violate the laws that then existed with respect to the limits on production."

        "Here, you're being told by the government you must enter into this and your failure to enter into it is evidence of the fact that you're involved in interstate commerce.",
        "I mean, your argument is that, of course, that Americans should have the right to decide whether or not they want to have health care, right?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "Look, if the federal government can tell you to do this now, why can they not say that we have an epidemic of obesity in this country, and therefore, as a condition of remaining a citizen or being in this country legally, you must join an approved health center program that is identified specifically by the federal government as being acceptable?",

        "Oftentimes, they don't pay and those costs are then passed on to people like you and me who do have health insurance and do pay premiums, so we ended up footing a large part of that bill.",
        "Well, that's a different question.",
        "That's the question of how you provide health care to people.",
        "That's not a question of whether the Constitution allows you to answer that specific inquiry in this particular way.",

        "So, is it as clear-cut as Dan Lungren argues?",
        "Well, no, according to many constitutional law experts, including Andrew Koppelman, who teaches law at Northwestern University.",
        "One of the remarkable things about this whole argument is that constitutional theories that a couple of years ago everyone would have agreed were wrong have gotten resuscitated.",
        "And so you have a wide group of people stating things that's been settled for decades aren't the case and folks in unison are saying them, that doesn't make them true.",
        "I notice that Representative Lungren was very careful not to mention the necessary improper clause of the Constitution.",
        "After the Constitution enumerates the powers of Congress, that it can regulate commerce among the several states.",
        "It has the power to collect taxes to provide for the general welfare, and then the list of congressional powers ends with an authorization to make all laws, which shall be necessary and proper to carry out its responsibilities.",
        "The necessary improper provision means that in order to carry out its responsibilities, Congress can do things that are not among the enumerated powers.",
        "So when somebody goes without health insurance, you know, we can argue about whether they are or not part of interstate commerce.",
        "But it doesn't matter.",
        "It's necessary to carry out where Congress does have the power to do.",
        "If you look at the Senate now and the Senate as it's probably going to look in January, there are an awful lot of people who are new to the Senate and who have no particular allegiance to its traditions and are not going to be looking for ways to compromise.",
        "They're going to be looking for ways to make a political point.",
        "The basic idea of the mandate was that unless you require people to buy health insurance, and since people with preexisting conditions are protected and allowed to buy insurance, healthy people can wait until they get sick to buy insurance and that would bankrupt the whole health insurance system because nobody would be paying into the pools.",
        "So the only way to protect people with preexisting conditions is to force healthy people into the system.",
        "But if the federal government can require all of us to have insurance and for those who don't have insurance to buy it, why wouldn't it be able to then pass a whole series of other requirements that would force Americans to engage in other commercial activity?",
        "Well, Congress has authority and authority can be abused.",
        "Congress has the taxing authority, and that means that Congress could, if it wanted to, impose a 100 percent tax on all incomes, which would destroy the American economy.",
        "I don't think they're going to do it.",
        "I don't think we have to be worried about it.",
        "Congress is only going to do this if they have to.",
        "I mean, this is quite unusual for Congress to require people to do something.",
        "So the idea that we are on a slippery slope to Congress forcing you to do all kinds of things you don't want to do just misunderstands political reality.",
