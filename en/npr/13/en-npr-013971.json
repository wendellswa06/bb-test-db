        "I think the lesson coming out of this election is that the Republicans would expect the president to work with them on their agenda.",

        "He also worked for House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.",
        "Howard says if President Obama believes Republicans will come on board with the White House agenda next year, the president has it backwards.",
        "If the White House takes from this that we're going to spend the next two years doing more of the same, then they're not going to get anywhere.",
        "The prospects for bipartisanship seemed to dim even further this week when the top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, told the�National Journal, quote, \"\"The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\"\" Democrats are running with that, repeating McConnell's quote as part of their election strategy in the last days of the midterm campaign.",
        "Even some senior White House officials seem to think the president's dream of bipartisanship will evaporate in the daylight.",
        "Adviser David Axelrod spoke with reporters at the White House last week.",
        "Now, it could be that on Election Day, a lightning bolt will come down and the skies will then open and people will be imbued with a new sense of responsibility and public-spiritedness, and I hope that's true.",
        "But I think it's fair to say that these guys have made it very, very clear that they want to roll the clock back, and we've made it very clear we are fighting to stop them from doing it.",
        "That could just be pre-election partisanship.",
        "Or it could be a sign that Washington's kumbaya moment is a bit farther off than Obama suggests.",
        "Ari Shapiro, NPR News, Washington.",
        "And we turn now to our regular political commentators E.J.",
        "Dionne of The Washington Post and the Brookings Institution.",

        "This week we saw a battle over immigration law in Arizona that we just heard about.",
        "The White House going on the defensive over education reform and the auto industry turnaround.",
        "Let's begin with immigration.",
        "If this issue continues at a full boil all the way through November, E.J., how will it play out in the midterm election?",
        "Well, I think the common view is that the court declaring parts of the Arizona law illegal is going to help Republicans because a lot of voters will be angry that these restrictions, which are popular, according to the polls, won't go into effect.",
        "I think there's some truth to that because control of the House is determined district by district.",
        "And a lot of the swing districts have very low or relatively low proportions of Latinos.",
        "So in those districts the immigration issue may at the margins help the Republicans.",
        "I'm not sure that it's going to have the enormous negative impact, A, all of this could finally begin to boost Latino turnout, which people, as the piece just said, have worried would be low this year.",
        "And, secondly, I think a lot of the people who are strongly opposed to immigration reform, strongly for the Arizona law, a lot of those people were voting Republican anyway.",
        "So, help Republicans is what you're saying.",
        "Help slightly, but I don't think as much as the conventional wisdom would have.",
        "Now, David, we just heard from someone in the Jeff Brady piece who said this is going to hurt Republicans.",
        "Yeah, eventually.",
        "Eventually, if current trends continue, the Republicans will not be able to be a national party because they will have no Latino voters.",
        "Precisely."

        "And that's going to be true in Texas, California and a lot of places.",
        "But in the short term I think it'll strongly help.",
        "And on top of everything directly involving immigration, there's a class component here.",
        "There's a popular sense that there's a ruling class that doesn't get the concerns of average people.",
        "That this ruling class doesn't live in neighborhoods where a lot of illegal immigrants are, doesn't work in jobs where a lot of illegal immigrants compete and just don't get it.",
        "And that the people of Arizona democratically voted this thing in and then the judge struck it down.",
        "That's going to seem to people fundamentally outrageous and anti-Democratic.",
        "So I think in this atmosphere where a lot of hostility toward the perceived ruling class, this will be a strong issue because it hits right at that point.",
        "I think there's some truth to that.",
        "Although David said an important thing when he mentioned California.",
        "That's a state where the Republicans had hoped to pick up the governorship, a Senate seat and I think this will galvanize the very big Latino vote in California.",
        "So that's why I think it has a differential effect around the country.",
        "There is a story that's percolating today based on a question of whether the administration might be considering a strategy to bypass Congress on immigration, thinking that Congress might not act on its own by issuing new guidance and regulations.",
        "This is based on a memo written by the director of the agency that handles immigration benefits.",
        "David, is a scenario you can imagine?",
        "It would be extremely dangerous for the same reason.",
        "If people see people really care about immigration, Democrats and Republicans.",
        "If they see some major reform being passed without a democratic process, they'll be angry.",
        "But let's not forget that this is actually a much more flexible issue.",
        "People are pretty sophisticated about this.",
        "The voters really do like the Arizona law, but they also like comprehensive reform.",
        "They acknowledge there are these 12 or 14 million people here and we've got to realistically deal with them.",
        "So the public is pretty flexible and I think pretty realistic and with some wise leadership, which we almost had a couple years ago, you could get a pretty serious and substantive bill.",
        "So I don't think there's a need to go around the legislative process necessarily.",
        "I want to turn to another issue.",
        "The president was in Detroit today to do a little chest pounding on the administration's bailout of the auto industry.",
        "Let's take a quick listen.",
        "There were leaders of the just-say-no crowd in Washington.",
        "They were saying, oh, standing by the auto industry would guarantee failure.",
        "One of the them called it the worst investment you could possibly make.",
        "Now, that's the president speaking to Chrysler workers.",
        "He then went to GM to test drive the Volt.",
        "The car has a name that makes it sound like it's some sort of superhero.",
        "But is a $41,000 electric car the future of the auto industry, E.J.?",
        "Well, the Volt probably is overpriced, but on the broader message..."

        "I didn't think the government could really turn it around.",
        "I thought the quality of the fleet was quite low.",

        "What about the shuttering of thousands of auto dealerships?",
        "Was that a precipitous move?",
        "No, I think that the auto industry was in deep trouble and in order to get the bailout, there had to be a lot of restructuring.",

        "We avoided that catastrophe and I think this is one time where that really fits in with people's sense of things, that usually you can't say it could've been worse.",
        "A lot of people in the Midwest understood the dangers if the auto industry had collapsed.",
        "You know, while we're talking about jobs, though, we only have a little bit of time left, but as we head into the midterm elections, there's always the question that voters wrestle with as they head to the polls: Are you better now than you were a year ago in this case, are you better now than you were two years ago in the midterm elections?",
