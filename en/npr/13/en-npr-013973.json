        "And a two to three percent drop is on the margin not insignificant.",
        "Well, let's move our fingers across the map, across the Pacific Ocean in fact, and go to China, where I saw a news item the other day saying that China ended subsidies that were keeping oil prices low.",
        "What's that doing?",
        "Well, they did not add subsidies, they reduced subsidies.",
        "Okay.",
        "China right now is the most interesting case.",
        "There's an analyst out there named Paul Tane(ph), very well respected, who came out with a report a few weeks ago that said in June Chinese demand was 8.4 million barrels a day - the highest ever by a lot.",
        "Now, everybody's kind of looking to the Olympics and the post-Olympics period to see what happens.",
        "do they reduce the subsidies further by raising their prices?",
        "And number two: there are indications that the Chinese were on a diesel-buying binge prior to the Olympics to hoard diesel because diesel's what you run in backup generators for electricity.",
        "Oh, they wanted to make sure the Olympics went smoothly?",
        "Right, exactly."
