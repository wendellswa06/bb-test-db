        "That seems like a politically risky move for him to take.",
        "Well, it was really a necessary move to make because without passage of some kind of comprehensive health care reform this year, it's going to be really damaging to his young presidency this early."

        "I want to ask you about the opposition to the president's health care plan and other parts of his agenda, Peniel.",

        "A lot has been made of Joe Wilson's outburst.",
        "Is too much being made of it in your view, Peniel?",
        "No, I don't think so.",
        "I think it's part of a larger pattern in terms of opposition to Obama.",
        "We've got the birthers who claim that the president is not a U.S.",

        "We've seen the tax parties, the tea parties.",
        "We see the 9/12 movement.",
        "And we've also seen the opposition to the president speaking before school children.",
        "So I think that this is part of a pattern that's not just uncivil, but there's really some underlying racial dynamics here where part of the groups who are being cultivated here really have a problem with who the president of the United States happens to be.",
        "But isn't there a danger in caricaturing some of these protestors in sort of saying they feel threatened by President Obama and his agenda?",
        "There was always that danger, but when we look at what Congressman Wilson said and the level of uncivility and really the level of vitriol and, at times, hate language and hate speech that the protesters themselves use, we can discern that it's not just the policies that they're opposed to.",
        "They're actually opposed to the person as well, largely because he happens to be African-American.",
        "You've studied and written about American protest movements.",
        "Put what we're seeing now into context for us.",
        "Well, what we're seeing in a way recalls what people call Calhoun Conservatism for the South Carolina Senator John C.",
        "Calhoun who really in the 1830s had his own vision of the way in which American democracy was going to look.",
        "And his vision of American democracy was less expansive than Andrew Jackson.",
        "It was less expansive than the more progressive elements in the country.",
        "It was a vision that didn't include freedom for African-Americans.",
        "It didn't include robust and expansive rights.",
        "And when we think about the way in which these modern Calhoun conservatives are using the notion of American democracy, it's really a government that has very, very little control and responsibility over most American citizens.",
        "They're using things like they're talking about the 10th Amendment and nullification.",
        "And nullification was used during the period of antebellum slavery, the notion that states have the right to prevent the federal government from impinging on their own autonomy and rights to own slaves.",
        "So what's interesting here is that their vision of American society, American democracy actually harkens back to the antebellum period in American history.",
        "And is Obama looking to the past for guidance on how to deal with his agenda now?",
        "Forestland.",
        "And that's a combination of unprotected forestland, which means that it's not a part of a national park or state park, and about 14% was owned by corporations.",
        "But it was quite striking to see this massive chunk of the U.S.",
        "designated as forestland, and about 2% of that goes away and then comes back every year (laughter) - gets replanted."

        "So that's cropland.",
        "Cropland is about a fifth of the U.S.",
        "But what's interesting is that the amount of food that we eat from all of that cropland, a lot of it is used for livestock.",
        "And so that's corn for livestock, soy for livestock.",
