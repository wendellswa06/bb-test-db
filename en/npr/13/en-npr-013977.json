        "The East Germans did that, and in the Tour de France, that was clearly happening in the past.",

        "Let's talk about human growth hormone, because that's big here in the States.",
        "That was talked about a lot with baseball players.",
        "How effective is human growth hormone?",
        "Well, that's a really good question, and I think the answer for scientists is that we just don't know.",
        "The data that we have from the laboratory is sort of equivocal.",
        "I mean, you can show that muscle mass is - it goes up, but it doesn't appear to correlate with strength.",
        "So you get bigger muscles, but a lot of it is water retention.",
        "So what we would say as scientists, in the limited amount we can do, is we don't see human growth hormone having effect on putting on muscle mass - which is strength, which is what people use it for, or claim to use it for.",
        "But what we can't say for sure is that we don't do - we're not allowed, obviously, to do research on elite athletes because they would be banned, and also we can't give the same levels of doses sometimes.",
        "So it is quite difficult as a sort of - my normal scientific career, I can test things properly.",
        "In doping in sport, it's difficult to test.",
        "So - but the evidence of human growth hormone is much less strong than the evidence for anabolic steroids that it's effective.",
        "So it might be much ado about nothing?",
        "It might be.",
        "I mean, of course, there is a very strong placebo effect in taking a drug that no one else has got and that it's banned, and you're injecting it.",
        "So there's huge importance in improved performance even if something is not having an effect on your biochemistry.",
        "You say that when we talk about stimulants, take amphetamines and you feel can run faster; take caffeine and you actually will run faster.",
        "Yeah, well, that's, again, laboratory studies.",
        "And we've done - there's a reason, we've got a data set on amphetamines and a lot of data on caffeine.",
        "And clearly what I mean by that is that amphetamines give you - because they're a recreational drug, they give you this feeling of high.",
        "Caffeine doesn't.",
        "So if you take a lot of caffeine, just your heartbeat goes up, and you feel - but the actual effect on fatigue - by fatigue I mean what stops you really competing at the highest level - appears to be stronger in caffeine than in amphetamine, from what we can see in the laboratory.",
        "So why is it not banned then?"

        "We all take it.",
        "And one of the reasons you have to be banned is you have to be harmful to health or against the spirit of sport.",
        "So the organization that chooses, the World Anti-doping Agency, doesn't consider caffeine now to be against the spirit of sport.",
        "They did in the past.",
        "And that's very much a judgment call, and part of the reason I wrote the book was to enable more people to understand the science and to be able to be involved in those judgment calls, which I think are important.",
        "Chris Cooper, the book he's speaking about is \"\"Run, Swim, Throw, Cheat: The Science Behind Sports in Drugs.\"\" Can altering a single gene dramatically improve sports performance?",
        "And might we just see, you know, gene-altering things happening now?",
        "Well, gene doping is the big sexy topic, if you like, for drugs in sports.",
        "It's one I get asked a lot about.",
        "We do know from certain individuals that gene doping, you know, a single gene can make a difference, and there's one very famous example, a guy called Eero Mantyranta, who was a Finnish cross-country skier, who had an altered gene that enabled him to have more red blood cells, and therefore it was like he was naturally blood doping.",
        "And he won five gold medals, three Olympics, two world championships.",
        "He was, you know, a single mutant.",
        "So you're looking at sort of a mutation of one individual.",
        "But it's much more general than what you'll get in a combination of genes.",
        "We know a lot of genes, up to 200, affect performance, and it'll be some combination.",
        "So it's relatively rare to get a single gene that has an effect.",
        "It doesn't mean you couldn't design that and work on it, but it's relatively rare.",
        "But it can be done?",
        "I mean, people - you're saying people are working on this.",
        "Well, scientists are working on trying to improve muscle mass because there are - in certain diseases.",
        "So there are animal studies trying to improve muscle mass for a range of diseases.",
        "It turns out that that's not a very popular or sort of huge pharmaceutical need for that.",
        "So there's not a huge number of scientists working on that.",
        "But there are some who have injected compound genes into muscle in animals and shown an increase in muscle mass, but it should be said that gene therapy works in animals, where you have people who are ill for a single gene, like cystic fibrosis, and you could cure those sorts of things in animal models.",
        "It doesn't seem to work in humans.",
        "So I'm fairly easy about whether I think, you know, when gene doping will be effective.",
        "I think people might be trying it.",
        "I think it's unlikely.",
        "But I also think it's very unlikely to be effective, really."
