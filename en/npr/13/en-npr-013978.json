        "We get a lot of phone calls from people who see a bright light on the horizon that seems to be shimmering, dancing around and changing colors, and they think it might be an artificial object.",
        "But then we look it up on our planetarium software and find out that no, actually, the planet Venus was on the horizon at that time.",
        "How is it that on one night many people could see this, sort of, superior mirage but not see it on any other night?",
        "Why would it happen on one particular day as opposed to happening every week or every month?",
        "We do see the sunrise every day and every…",

        "Yes.",
        "But not this.",
        "Something like this, it would have to be unusual weather conditions, something with cooler air close to the surface and much warmer air high up.",
        "So as for the explanation that some of our listeners prefer, which is that - just a courtesy call from Venus or something like that or some distant galaxy, no point to rush to any such inference from this, you're saying.",
        "Right.",
        "I would say that extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.",
        "And if somebody really thinks it is alien visitors or hyperdimensional travelers, they need to come up with a better explanation than eye witness reports.",

        "There were more tough questions today for Virginia Tech administrators about whether they should have known that Seung-Hui Cho was mentally unstable and dangerous.",
        "Back in the winter of 2005, Cho was accused of stalking two women and then was admitted to a mental health facility.",
        "We have several reports in this portion of the program, including the latest on the crime scene investigation.",
        "We begin our coverage with NPR's Jeff Brady in Blacksburg, Virginia.",

        "Still, questions remain about whether the university and mental health providers did enough.",
        "The school's associate vice president for student affairs, Ed Spencer, says Virginia Tech employees followed procedures in handling stalking complaints against Cho.",
        "And beyond that, Spencer says, Cho had five on-campus roommates.",
        "Well, this is a big deal for the Obama campaign and for those on the left because it goes right at McCain's central claim about being sort of above politics and not being tied to the special interests.",
        "Well, here you have an instance in which he's quite closely tied to special interests, and, in fact, he has a lobbyist working in his actual campaign.",
        "So it has less to do with the specifics of Georgia.",
        "You could argue, in fact, from the McCain standpoint that, you know, it's good that he has an expert on his team who knows about this country.",
        "But the point from the Obama campaign is, how can McCain claim to be a change agent in Washington, that he's going to reform the system, when he's got his campaign hardwired with lobbyists who are, you know, in the thick of these kinds of deals."

        "They care how news is delivered to those very important states that are going to determine this election, and they point out, for example, let's look at Pennsylvania, a state that everybody - and where there's lot of Democrats that say, oh, Barack Obama is going to have so much trouble in Pennsylvania because Hillary Clinton beat him there during the primaries.",
        "Well, he's pasting McCain in the polls in Pennsylvania.",
        "So they focus specifically, if you look at their ad campaigns, they're running some national ads, but they're also running targeted ads in Wisconsin, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania at McCain, taking him on pretty hard because they are focused on the battleground map.",
