        "A lot of those strides were made under Governor Hodges, to my left, but we still have a long way to go.",
        "And I think that's the foundation of all of our problems, but also the best hopes for our futures.",
        "And I think when we have an education climate that is attractive, I think more businesses will come to the state because we'll have a more educated workforce.",
        "I also believe that we need to do things to make sure that people keep their own money and are able to spend it more versus being taxed to death, as well as regulated to death from the state and local governments.",

        "And I think, Farai, it symbolizes some of the opportunities in South Carolina because this project will create a complex of warehouses and logistics centers in this region and will provide anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 jobs over the course of the next 20 or 25 years.",
        "That's an immense change for an area like Orangeburg.",
        "And I think it speaks to the hope for areas in South Carolina that are close to the poor and the things that can be done there.",

        "They shouldn't be.",
        "In fact, if you would ask me, I think that the Congress made a huge mistake in how they handled the Dubai issue.",

        "But in states like this that need education funding and, frankly, most states would say they need education funding, do you really expect the federal government to come to the rescue?",
        "Well, I think that the federal government needs to recognize that investing in better technology and better facilities is a national priority.",

        "Well, I'm not in the legislature, of course, but I did suggest and I think what - I mean, Ben Tillman was governor and in 1940, they did put up a plaque that seemed to leave out every part of the history in terms of - how it affected African-Americans.",
        "I think, at a minimum, what we should do is have the correct historical plaque up that, you know, led our South Carolina historians, a diverse group, come up with the accurate history.",
