        "So how large of a loss is this in terms of advertising and advertising dollars for the show, and is there sort of a critical mass they need to actually stay on the air?",
        "Well, it's hard to tell because, to be fair to these companies, a lot of them aren't specific sponsors of Don Imus.",
        "They buy blocks of time or they just buy time on MSNBC or CBS Radio and their ads get rotated through.",
        "But saying that, just looking at the TV show, some estimate show that it brought in around $8 million in advertising last year.",
        "And I was just doing a back of the napkin calculation here and it looks like $2, $3 million would probably be lost if these advertisers stayed away for a year, which is a big question.",
        "Now, as we know, there have been a growing calls for CBS to fire Don Imus.",
        "Does losing these advertisers make this more or less likely?",

        "You know, advertisers know which way the wind blows, and we expect that probably more will drop out.",

        "Now, saying that though, advertisers are also very fickle.",
        "When we see boycotts like this in the past, they tend to stay away for a few weeks and then when the controversy blows over, they're ready to come back, you know.",

        "The prosecution wants the agent to testify anonymously, wearing a disguise.",
        "Prosecutors say they have no plans to introduce at trial any information gathered from interrogations during Padilla's time in military custody, in part because it's doubtful the court would rule it's admissible.",
        "Even so, the defense has worked hard to make those years in the brig part of this case.",
        "While there, Padilla was held in extreme isolation, subjected to sleep and sensory deprivation, conditions his lawyers say amounted to torture.",
        "David Rivkin, a lawyer formerly with the Justice Department, thinks the government will have no trouble making its case against Padilla, as long as it convinces the jury that allegations about how he was treated in the brig have no bearing on this case.",
        "If I were prosecuting this case, I would just basically say very calmly, this is irrelevant; it's your job as jurors to look at the following facts that establish the charges.",
        "It's sort of interestingly, because I think the defense would be largely arguing emotion and then sentiment, and the prosecution would argue the facts.",
        "And to the extent they stick to their guns on that, they should do very well.",
        "The defense says because of his time in the brig, Padilla suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder and is not competent to stand trial.",
        "Federal Judge Marcia Cooke rejected a series of defense motions that sought to dismiss the charges on those grounds and several others, motions that further delay the trial."
