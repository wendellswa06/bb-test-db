        "Stewart and the kids had more time together since Stewart quit work, but Rebecca recalls his relationship with their children was slowly changing too.",
        "There were many, many days when I'd either get calls on my way home from work or at work or as soon as I pulled the car up to the house.",
        "The kids were running out the door and saying, mommy, daddy's being mean to us, and one morning, it really came to a head.",
        "Rebecca remembers Noah was having a tough morning, arguing with his dad before school, and when Stewart went out to pick up the morning paper, Noah swung open the screen door and almost hit his dad in the face.",
        "Which, granted, would enrage anybody, but he grabbed Noah by the scruff of the neck and swung him around and laid him down and just like sat on top of him and said, you know, like, don't you ever even think of doing that again, and it just really scared the crap out of him, and, at that moment, I was really scared and really angry, and I took the kids, it was time to go to the bus.",
        "I took the kids to the bus stop, and I came back home, and I went upstairs, and I just screamed at him, and I said, don't you ever do that again to any of my kids because I will send you out of this house, and you will die a lonely man.",
        "And, of course, I regretted that after I said it, but I had to let him know that his behavior was just getting more and more extreme.",

        "He was convinced that a neighbor of ours, who lives down the street, had come into our house and had started doing things in our house, like changing the wiring or taking his slippers and hidden them or other things, and this person has never been in our house, and he would just say, no, you're wrong.",
        "I know she was here.",
        "Rebecca occasionally took walks with neighbors, trying to make sense of what was happening, but mostly, she was quietly keeping stories like these to herself.",
        "Eventually, she started looking online for support.",
        "I would read stories like that all the time of people who were just dealing with these wild, emotional behavioral and all other kinds of problems, that they were just struggling to try to cope with, and some people, you know, I would read these beautiful stories about people ending their 30-, 40-year marriages, and it was just so beautiful how they just loved each other right out of existence, and I was just thinking, God, why isn't that happening to me?",
        "Why isn't that going on in my life?",
        "Instead, Rebecca says Stewart and his illness pushed her further away.",
        "I mean, there were a lot of times when he wanted to divorce me.",
        "He would just get so angry when I would try to tell him that his perceptions of things were wrong.",
        "He would just say we should just get a divorce, and I will just go away, and you can do whatever, but I just don't want to be around you anymore, and that was really hard.",
        "Eventually, Rebecca decided to take a leave from work.",
        "It was too much to keep up with the kids and home and alternative treatments for Stewart's tumor, but Rebecca remembers the tension between them only grew.",
        "Sometimes, we'd be out, and he'd get ticked off with me about something, and he would just start dressing me down right in public, and I didn't know what to do, and, at that point, we were seeing some therapists, speech therapists and physical therapists because he began to lose sensation in one of his legs, which was causing him a lot of mobility problems.",
        "And sometimes, he'd go in, and he'd start talking to them about our relationship issues and saying, Rebecca's doing this and this and this, and I'd have to say, no, honey, she's not really here to hear that.",
        "She's here to help you with your movement, but I knew they had nothing but sympathy for me, and they would hand me little notes and say, you know, try calling this number.",
        "Call this social worker, do this agency, and it was scary.",
        "It was terrifying.",
        "One of the most difficult moments came one evening about eight months into Stewart's illness, when her father-in-law was visiting.",
        "Rebecca says she was trying to stay out of an argument Stewart and his dad were having about politics, trying not to incite Stewart to any further anger."

        "He asked Rebecca to make a drawing of her cabinet and said he'd build it for her.",
        "And I said, yeah, but how do we get it here?",
        "It turned out that I flew down there to Cincinnati, and we loaded up a truck, and we drove it back, and we just fell head over heels in love with each other once again."
