        "The biggest progress that's taken place, if I can be so politically blunt, is the change of administrations from one that was hostile to the notion that there should be government control on private industries' emissions and one which believes that it has to listen to science first and politics second, and that taking care of the global commons is an important priority alongside of the economy.",
        "And we now are historically closer to having world agreements on starting down the road of getting climate policy than we've ever been, and that's a result, I think, of the combination of nature cooperating with theory, because we've been talking about this for a long time.",
        "I first testified to the Senate why energy and climate policy were the same to Ribicoff and Muskie in 1979.",
