        "So we'll have to find fair ways to have job retraining, to have compensation, to have tax breaks for industries that go into those areas that used to produce products which we now know are polluting.",
        "And all of that will require a vision to see this as not simply an energy problem, not simply an environmental problem, not simply a security problem, but a problem that cuts across the social needs of the society.",
        "As we look ahead to the future, what is the latest in terms of what we can know about how temperatures might rise because of climate change in the future?",
        "We don't know whether they're going to warm up another three degrees or another 10 this century.",
        "Three degrees more is not a good thing, but 10 is utterly catastrophic.",
        "That's a difference between an ice age and our current warm period happening not in 5,000 years, like nature, but in a hundred, which would be devastating.",
        "Species would go instinct.",
        "We'd have problems with food and water.",
        "So we sure don't want the high end, and none of us can rule it out, better than a 10 percent chance.",
        "So we really need to do research and try to pin that down.",

        "That's a big unknown.",
        "There was a piece appearing in the New York Times this week that described new research that basically found even if we curb emissions now, climate change will likely continue until at least the year 3000.",
        "Do you feel like there is any solution?",
        "Can we ever go back?",
        "We should not think about the fact that we're going to be pristine and back what we were like before the industrial revolution.",

        "We have used the industrial revolution to get rich.",
        "We've improved our quality of life.",
        "Now, those very techniques are reducing the quality of life through environmental side effects.",
        "Let's try to prevent it from getting a lot worse.",
        "So while we can't stop a few degrees of warming on top of where we already are, we can stop the 10 degrees.",
        "My notion is do as much as you can, as fast as you can, as fairly as you can, and as cost effectively as you can, and don't get hung up on the numbers because three degrees is a lot better than six, and 10 degrees is dramatically worse than any other numbers.",
        "So let's approach what we can realistically do and set up the adaptation funds to try to deal with that, which we're already stuck with because we didn't have the foresight way back when to anticipate these problems.",

        "Kindred says the NCAA has plenty of great players but he's missing the epic stories that used to make March Madness the season a sports fan lived for."

        "Several things have changed, Tom.",

        "I worked in Kentucky for a long time - Kentucky people know what I'm talking about, Laettner, threw in one that is still a dagger in their hearts.",
        "That kind of story doesn't happen now because we don't know the nuances of the story.",
        "I think that, you know, maybe I'm speaking more as a writer than as a college basketball fan, because the lack of richness in the stories today is what bothers me.",

        "No.",
        "I just wanted to understand, again, what you said at the beginning.",
        "You think the factor here is that presumably the NBA is grabbing these guys before they get a chance to really play out their whole four years, and therefore they're taken away from us just as we're getting to know them, is that rule change, is that specifically what you're talking about?",
        "Yes.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Happened in 2005, took effect in 2006.",
        "Great players, you know, Kevin Durant, John Wall, Anthony Davis - great players who've made a mark in NCAA tournament, and with their schools coming are gone in a year because the NBA instituted a rule that said you had to be 19 years old to join the league.",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, as you guys touched on earlier, I'm actually really excited about the parity and the fact that I think any team could win.",
