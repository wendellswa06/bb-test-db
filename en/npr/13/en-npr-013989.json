        "Lewis says when fireflies light up like this, they're talking.",
        "They are talking a lot, and they're talking about two things, primarily.",
        "They are talking about sex.",
        "The males are signaling their availability; females are responding with a flash signal to those males that look particularly good for whatever reasons.",

        "Players will come and go.",

        "It's not as pretty to watch.",
        "You know, I know I sound like a guy talking about the good old days, but, in fact, a whole lot of basketball people agree that the game once was built on speed and grace.",

        "And the truth is that a lot of people do make picks during tournament time and get all excited about, you know, bracketology and really sort of the idea of making picks.",
