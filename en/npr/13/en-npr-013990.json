        "Because exactly four years ago right now, there was a messy, crowded primary with too many candidates, people who were totally unelectable - and Donald Trump was one of them and ended up winning.",

        "They say this word electability is used to scare voters into choosing a safe candidate.",

        "Lewis and her small team of assistants are studying the species Photinus greeni.",
        "They carry tiny lights that mimic the male's flash, so they can find females and study their responses.",
        "Firefly populations typically have many more males than females, so there's intense competition among males to attract a mate, which Lewis says poses an intriguing question.",
        "So one of the things we've been interested in looking at is what makes males winners of mate competitions.",
        "Lewis says a male's success appears to be related to the quality of its light flash.",
        "In some species--for example, these guys--flashes that have shorter intervals between the two pulses are more attractive to the females.",
        "In other species of fireflies, faster pulse rates are more attractive to females.",
        "Which leads to another question: Do fireflies that exhibit faster or slower pulses of light make better mates?",
        "That's actually something we're really, really interested in knowing more about.",
        "In one species of firefly, Photinus ignitus, we have discovered that males that produce longer-duration flashes also deliver a more nutritious nuptial gift to females.",
        "And we're not talking about carrot cake here."

        "No.",
        "During mating the males are busy transferring not just sperm to the females, but a very elegant coiled package called a spermatophore.",
        "And it turns out the spermatophores have a lot of protein in them, and the males that have slightly longer duration flashes are males that also have larger nuptial gifts to give the females.",
        "I'm sorry, I think I see a female over here.",
        "I just wanted to...",
        "Lewis runs off to collect the female in a plastic cup.",
        "I'm amazed that you can pick out a female from 50, hundred feet away.",
        "Well, you know, one of the cool things about fireflies is that you can really eavesdrop on their conversations.",
        "So you can see that here are males that are out advertising, `I'm a male, Photinus greeni.",
        "I'm a male, Photinus greeni.",
        "Just with a penlight, you can actually imitate the flash signals of males, and you can get females to respond to you.",
        "So it's a great activity for kids 'cause you can talk to fireflies.",
        "But, as Lewis said, some of the fireflies out here are also talking about death.",
        "Lewis says the species Photuris, common in many Northern states, is a femme fatale, a voracious predator that uses her flash to lure the much smaller Photinus, who thinks he's found a mate but instead meets a ghastly end.",
        "Once they lure in a male, they suck the blood out of the male, and then they pretty much just chew up the rest of the body.",
        "They'll often leave the eyes and spit out the hard bits.",
        "Goodness.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Sarah Lewis of Tufts says if Photuris fireflies were the size of house cats, people would be afraid to go out at night, and the soft, gentle glow of their nighttime presence would be anything but soft and gentle.",
