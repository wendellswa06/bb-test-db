        "NPR's Wade Goodwyn is covering this story.",
        "He's with us again now.",
        "Wade, welcome back to the show.",
        "And I want to begin with a just a little kind of a book-keeping matter that's kind of puzzling.",
        "The number of children taken from this ranch was 416.",
        "Now, it's 437.",
        "What happened?",
        "Well, it does speak a little bit to the confusion.",
        "If you can't even count the number of children correctly, it gives some indication of, just a little, how chaotic things are for the state.",
        "I mean, they're having trouble figuring out the children's identities, the children's ages, which children belong to whom.",
        "And it's not just the child welfare officials.",
        "The state judge, Barbara Walther, she sent her staff in to get information that the court needs to proceed, and they've come away shaking their heads, too.",
        "The children have similar names.",
        "The state says the children and their mothers were trying to deceive them about identities and ages.",
        "It all speaks to whether underage teenage girls have been spiritually married and having sex with men.",
        "So that means blurring the lines, not only the teenage girls' ages, but also the infants ages and the younger children.",
        "How old are they?",
        "Who gave birth to them?",
        "The DNA testing is the first step that the state is taking to try to sort some of these questions out.",
        "OK, because presumably these lines are going to be a lot more clear, but you've got to get the samples from all of the children and then, I suppose, every adult who has been at the ranch, as well.",
        "How are they going to go about doing all that?",
        "Well, I mean, I guess they're swabbing everybody.",
        "You know, the lawyers for the church and for the men are protesting that, you know, this information is going to be used in criminal cases against them.",
        "Now, child welfare officials are saying, that's not what this testing is for.",
        "But I do believe Texas intends to try to make criminal cases against the men for sex crimes if the evidence is there.",
        "And one of the complicating factors in this case is that the state wore two different hats when it went into the ranch and took the children.",
        "One hat was child welfare officials and their investigation, and the other hat was Texas law enforcement and its investigation.",
        "But which hat was the state wearing at which moment of the raid?",
        "You know, Texas seized a lot of potential evidence at that ranch.",
        "Was that child protective services gathering that evidence to protect the children?",
        "Or was it the Texas rangers taking the evidence to prosecute the criminal cases?",
        "And it's important because different rules apply to the evidence depending on which hat the state says it was wearing.",
        "So, you know, I think the lawyers for the men are probably right to be concerned.",
        "Well, Wade, is there anything preventing these two agencies from sharing this DNA information?",
        "In other words, could child welfare officials turn it over to prosecutors?",
        "I don't - that's a good question.",
        "I don't know the intricacies of that.",
        "I mean - or maybe they don't need to.",
        "Maybe the state will do its own DNA testing.",
        "But what if child welfare officials share what they've learned?",
        "Maybe they don't share the evidence, but they share what they've learned with law-enforcement officials.",
        "That certainly wouldn't be unusual.",
        "They do that all the time.",
        "And then the state can go get its own DNA testing based on the DNA testing the child welfare officials have done.",
        "So you can see, you know, how the lines can blur.",
        "They do blur now, and I expect them to - I mean, in normal child welfare proceedings.",
        "And I expect nothing to be different in this situation.",
        "And Wade, the state allowed more than 80 of the moms to stay with the children.",
        "The children who were very young, four years old and younger.",
        "But child welfare officials have said that, once this DNA testing is completed, they could also be separated.",
        "Why is that?"

        "Now, that has people shaking their heads here.",
        "I mean, here's the facts.",
        "Allowing the mothers to stay in the first place was an unusual step.",
        "It was an accommodation by child welfare officials.",
        "The idea was to ease both the children's and the mothers' transition into state custody.",
        "But now, Texas is going to try and put these kids into foster care.",
        "They're reaching out to relatives first who aren't members of the polygamous group as the first option.",
        "I think they'd like to see Mormon families step up to the plate and volunteer to be foster families.",
        "We'll see how that goes.",
        "But moms don't usually get to go with their children into foster care.",
        "It's as simple as that.",
        "There's no question this is going to be a traumatic experience for the women and the children.",
        "Up until now, some semblance of family and intactness has remained, but that's going to start going away.",
        "And I expect the suffering is going to be intense.",
        "Wade, something else here, if we may.",
        "This initial thing got going because a caller called in to authorities and said there's sexual abuse going on at this ranch, child abuse.",
        "That caller has still not been identified, and some of the lawyers for the ranch people, the FLDS, are saying they think it's a hoax.",
        "Any more on that?",
        "Well, supposedly, the caller was a 16-year-old girl who said that she was pregnant and already had one child that was eight months old.",
        "She called, you know, on more than one occasion.",
        "Child welfare officials certainly thought that what they were hearing was authentic.",
        "Merri Edwards is an evacuee from Galveston, Texas.",
        "She joined us on the line from a hotel north of Houston.",
        "Thanks a lot, Merri.",
        "Best of luck to you.",
        "It was my introduction to Dr. Julian, was that stamp, and my curiosity was piqued, and - as we have to do with our history, we have to go find it and get it, because no one is teaching our history.",
        "So I went out to get it.",
        "And I found that who he was, and I was absolutely amazed by his accomplishments.",
        "Who is he?",
        "Who was he?",
        "He was a black chemist who was concerned about making things affordable, medicines affordable to people who normally hadn't been able to afford things.",
        "His major contribution was to - for Cortisone.",
        "It helped us with rheumatoid arthritis, which was a debilitating - I guess you would call it disease or ailment of that time.",
        "And there were treatments, but at $400 a gram, sterols were not affordable to, you know, poor people or regular working people.",
        "So when he extracted sterols from soybean, it made sterols almost like 20 cents a gram.",
        "You know, when you talk about blacks in history in this country, from the turn of the century during the time that Julian was getting going, we know that there was discrimination in politics, and in the arts, and in sports, and in education, but you don't hear a lot about the racist activity in the world of science, you know?",
        "But apparently that was a big part of what his struggle was because the scientific community, the academy of science did not want to accept him because of his color.",
        "They did not want to accept him.",
        "And a wonderful chemist, Dr. Vitcup(ph)), was the guy who continually prodded the academy to allow Dr. Julian to be a member of that academy, and not until the '70s did he finally accomplish it and have Dr. Julian inducted into the Academy of - National Academy of Sciences."

        "He was interested in making a difference in the world in other ways, that people who were like him, and like his grandparents, and people that he knew, people who needed affordable health care.",
