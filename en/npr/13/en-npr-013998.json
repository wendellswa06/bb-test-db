        "What did you have?",
        "It contained a few different colors of Sharpies.",
        "The black Sharpie was the most important, but also a nice rainbow array of other Sharpies, because you never know what kind of typos and kind of - what kind of medium you're going to encounter as you're going along.",
        "And Wite-Out was another important part and dry erase markers, chalk, crayons, pens - you name it.",
