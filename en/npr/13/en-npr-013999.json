        "And our conversation with this particular shirt seller was very interesting, because it revealed a lot of other communication problems besides just that surface communication problem of typos.",
        "There were just taboo topics that we couldn't quite get to that we always had to dance around.",
        "And I think that typos can really lead you into some interesting situations of communication failures that are not strictly spelling and grammar.",
