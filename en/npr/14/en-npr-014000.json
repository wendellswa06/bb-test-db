        "So why is the 12 percent drop, this drop in the number of people who think he's a Christian, more - why is it really any different from the number of people who think he might - he is a Muslim?",
        "Well, you know, I think the Muslim headline is the one that was -the headline, frankly, got most of the attention because it's, you know, it's the sort of thing that, you know, drives news.",
        "But it very closely correlates to the job approval the people think the president is doing.",
        "That is, people who disapprove of him are much more inclined to say, yes, he's a Muslim, than those who approve of the job he's doing.",

        "I think, you know, the president - there are two ways of looking at this.",
        "Either the president is not fundamentally all that religious, or he's privately religious - which is what the White House says, that he doesn't want to wear his religion on his sleeve, but he regularly consults with religious leaders; he prays.",
        "You know, he has a faith.",
        "He just doesn't outwardly talk about it.",
        "The issue, I think, just from a purely political perspective, is that lots and lots and lots of people in this country go to church, and do talk much more outwardly about their religion.",
        "It's a way in which they often feel as though they can connect with someone who's, you know - the president of the United States, not exactly a job that a lot of people have.",
        "And empathy matters in politics.",
        "Feeling as though - you need the people who vote for you to feel as though you understand their problems, you understand their life.",
        "And that's always been the president's most difficult - you know, he's an - obviously, a very gifted communicator.",
        "But the thing that he has struggled with at times is he is not naturally empathetic.",
        "He's more - sort of intellectual.",

        "On Friday, I was saying we were going to get a foot, but we ended up with about double that.",
        "So the - and it all depends on the track of the area of low pressure that brought in the moisture off the Atlantic, not only the track, but how deep that pressure system got.",
        "And the track just changing 50 miles one way or another can make a dramatic difference in the amounts of snow.",
        "So the track of that storm was actually about 50 miles closer to the coastline than we had anticipated on Thursday night and into Friday when I was doing my forecast.",
        "So that's why things changed.",

        "So why does it seem that weather predictions are less accurate in the winter?",

        "So that's just about a nearly passing grade on exam.",
        "But it's because of the unpredictable nature of the movement of low pressure when it encounters ocean air masses and land air masses, and that's where we live on the East Coast.",
        "We constantly have this battle between the marine environment, as well as the land environment.",
        "Sometimes the land environment will win out and sort of push that low pressure farther to the east.",

        "Well, in a - usually about 48 hours in advance when we have gotten, to this point, certainly, with our advances in the science.",
        "That means within 24 to 48 hours in advance that we're within several inches of what we were predicting.",
