        "But - and you've probably heard us talk about models, which are nothing more than the solutions to mathematical equations that we can use to actually model the atmosphere.",
        "And we plug in all the numbers into the equations, and then the computers do all the calculations.",
        "And we have several different models that have different biases and such that we look, OK, at a whole ensemble of different models and say, all right, let's take the average or one of, you know - some of them have a certain bias to the east or some have a certain bias to the west.",
        "So it's a matter of really looking at, OK, is the general consensus of all the model output putting the storm in this position?",
        "And then we sort of go with that.",
        "So is there an advance in modeling or technology or research that would make forecasts more accurate?",
        "Or is it just so inherently changeable and chaotic that there's going to be a point beyond which you can't possibly know?",
        "Well, that's a great question.",
        "We only got samplings of what the atmosphere is doing once per hour at several hundred sites around the United States and some isolated ocean sites.",
        "So we only get, like, one freeze frame per hour of what the atmosphere is doing.",
        "Of course, the atmosphere is constantly moving and changing.",
        "So it's like looking at one frame of a movie and trying to decide what the whole movie is about.",
        "So if we could get constant samplings of the atmospheric conditions real time, all of the time and then plug those numbers in running calculations of the models all the time - see, we can run the models every six hours.",
        "If we could run them, say, every 20 minutes, then we could reach a point where we could get very, very good with accuracy.",
        "But we're still, I think, years away from that.",
        "And certainly, it's feasible to do it, sampling from space, and we have the technology.",
        "It's a matter of spending the money to do it.",
        "We've talked about don't blame the weatherman for the bad weather, but I imagine in your years of experience, you have taken a fair amount of flack.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "It comes with the job, and I completely understand it because so many plans are disrupted.",
        "And people plan their lives based on what the forecast is going to do for outdoor events and weddings and trips and vacations.",

        "Hi.",

        "There's an old saying around here: big snow, little snow, little snow, big snow, meaning that if the flakes are small, you get a lot of snow.",
        "If the flakes are big, you get a little bit of snow.",
        "Seems to work, except that sometimes it starts out with big flakes and then goes to little flakes.",
        "I'm wondering if there's any meteorological explanation for this.",
        "Well, it has to do with the amount of available moisture in the atmosphere.",
        "Usually, of course, you get the smaller flakes when the atmosphere is very dry.",
        "And, of course, you have that in mountain environments.",
        "Of course, Provo is a spectacular place for that kind of powder.",
        "And you usually have dry conditions there on the lee side of Sierra Nevada and all the way, you know, to the western slopes of the Rockies.",
        "You get pockets of some very dry air.",
        "They're, of course, sort of a semi-arid region, anyway.",
        "So whenever you get that moisture coming in off of the Pacific Ocean, what - a lot of times, most of it will sort of precipitate out over the Sierra Nevada.",
        "By the time it crosses the mountains and gets into the desert regions, in the arid regions to the east of Sierra Nevadas, a lot of that moisture's gone.",
        "But there - sometimes, there's so much moisture coming in from the Pacific that it eventually does make it all the way there.",
        "And there, with the dry air in place, that moisture falls into to the dry air and it makes those flakes much smaller.",
        "Now, if you've got a storm that is coming from farther to the south of where you're located, and maybe that storm will pick up some moisture of the Gulf of Mexico, then it's going to be a wetter storm, and that's when you get sort of - some of those bigger, fatter flakes.",
        "So it maybe, initially, it may start as big, fat flakes, because there is sort of more moisture.",
        "But eventually, that moisture is sort of zapped out of that particular storm system.",
        "And then it's -only that gets left is some of the, you know, lighter amounts of moisture in the upper elevations of the atmosphere.",
        "Then you get the smaller flakes on top of the big ones.",
