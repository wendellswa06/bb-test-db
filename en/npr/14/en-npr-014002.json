        "Yeah.",

        "And I do think that you're exactly right.",
        "I think his campaign - in a brilliant way - and he, himself, as a candidate brilliantly was able to take sort of everything that people wanted out of politics and felt like they weren't getting, and put it into him - that this was a person, as you mentioned, with a sort of, a very different resume, background - frankly, literally looked different than any president we've ever had before.",
        "And so he was able to serve as a, you know, as a vessel through which everyone saw the best of what politics can be.",
        "Governing and campaigning are two very different things.",
        "We've learned that any number of times throughout history, including over the last 18 months or 20 months now, with President Obama.",
        "And I think some of that vagueness, that unwillingness to - again, he always is going to get compared to Bill Clinton because Bill Clinton was the last Democratic president before him.",
        "You know, Bill Clinton, with the tearing up and the hugging and the very famous, you know, I-feel-your-pain line - that is not Barack Obama.",
        "That doesn't make him a good, bad or indifferent president, but that's not who he is.",
        "And so religion would be a way in which he could bridge some of that sort of natural unease with doing the kind of empathetic outreach that I think he views as somewhat political - politically phony.",
        "But again, he has shown time and time again, he does not tend to bend as the political reeds blow.",
        "And I think this is an issue where we're very likely to see the same approach by his White House.",

        "There was a machine behind that as well.",

        "They don't like what he's doing.",
        "He's not leaning to the far right, and they just don't like it.",

        "I mean, that's why - frankly, I think the caller addresses at least why I thought the Muslim numbers were a little bit overblown and some of the other fascinating numbers in the poll were lost - which is, there is a very a close correlation between those who disapprove of the job the president is doing, and those who say that he is of the Muslim faith.",
        "There are always - in any election, in any presidency, there are going to be 15 or 20 percent - pick, actually - frankly, pick whatever number, but it's probably under 30 and above 5 on each side, who fundamentally do not want whoever it is, is president to be president, and are willing to believe the worst of them.",

        "I mean, pick a president, and you will see that happen.",

        "Bush, almost anything about Bill Clinton, almost anything about George H.W.",
        "Bush, Ronald Reagan.",
        "You know, I think that that core exists.",
        "I think it's rallied around the idea that Barack Obama is either a Muslim or a socialist.",
        "Why those two things have gained credence, I don't know.",
        "But again, I think it's more a reflection on an element within each party's base willing to believe the worst about the other side than it is something that's particularly unique to him.",
        "Bringing up the idea that being Muslim is the - is what that side believes is the worst or could be the worst.",
        "So you're saying, then, if you called people who hated Barack Obama and said, do you think Barack Obama has antenna an as - and is an alien, they would say yes.",
        "I think - I don't know if they'd say yes, Andrea, but I'd say there's a whole heck of a lot larger percentage or chance that they would, than if you called an independent who maybe voted for George Bush in 2000 and Barack Obama in 2008.",
        "I'm very bitter about that.",
        "You know, I think what that - the email addresses the idea that Barack Obama is not regularly seen going to church.",
        "He speaks at churches occasionally but doesn't attend, although the White House says he attends regularly at Camp David.",
        "And you know, the comments he made about the controversial New York City mosque came at an iftar dinner a few weeks ago at the White House."
