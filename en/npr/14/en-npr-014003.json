        "You know, Andrea, I think it - one number, you know, I said I think a lot of numbers got overlooked.",

        "They ask, sort of, where did you get this information?",
        "Of course, that led to lots of media bashing, which is very, you know, popular and easily done.",
        "We're a terrific scapegoat.",
        "But I would say, I think a lot of people are defining the media very broadly: email chains, message boards, you know, conservative media strings that are not part - even in the broadest definition - of the mainstream media, and saying, well, the media told me.",
        "Well, getting an email chain from someone is not the media.",
        "But you know, I think people kind of lump it in - again, because the media is easily scapegoated.",
        "I'm not sure that - I know that anytime it's ever come up in my conversations, whether doing interviews, whether writing, whether being on television, I always say, I'm more than happy to talk about it, but let's get the facts straight first.",
        "Barack Obama is not a Muslim.",
        "He is a Christian.",
        "We have absolutely no evidence anywhere in his life to draw any other conclusion on that.",
        "Now, I'm happy to talk about the people who believe wrongly that that's the case, but let's say that at the start.",

        "However, I have friends who unfortunately - from my point of view - are conservative Republicans, and they don't believe that Barack Obama is a Muslim.",
        "I think that 12 percent, as has been talked about, represents a group of people who not only dislike him, but are extremely fearful of him because, let's face it, he's an African-American -or a mixed-race American.",
        "And that frightens a lot of people.",
        "It's very politically incorrect to say that out loud.",
        "And so people will say instead, you know, he's a Muslim.",
        "And they probably don't do the due diligence that they would do in any other case if it were a man who looked different, let's say.",
