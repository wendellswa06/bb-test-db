        "So why do you support Barack Obama?",
        "Well, for one thing I think, I'm much more of a moderate, but I support Barack Obama for two reasons.",
        "One of them is that he is somebody who can think.",
        "And, after the past eight years, I think that this country could use a president who is actually reflective and likes to think.",
        "And in particular, Barack Obama is good at splitting the difference and looking at both sides and trying to come up with a combination.",
        "And I suppose that reminds me of myself, and I just - it appeals to me.",
        "And, so I think that he is the better man because the qualities that I just described don't happen to correspond as well to John McCain, although I have nothing against him.",
        "And then the second reason is that I honestly believe that if there were a black man in the White House with his black family, especially for eight years, then I think it would show that even though racism is not dead in America, and even though I don't think racism will ever be completely dead in America, that's something really important has happened.",
        "I think that with Barack Obama in the White House, anyone who wants to say that America is founded upon racism and America is still all about racism.",
        "And that any impression otherwise, is just a matter of not being able to see beyond the superficial will be pulled down to earth somewhat.",
        "It won't eliminate that kind of rhetoric, but I think that Barack Obama's presence would make people have to reconsider that maybe Martin Luther King did not die in vain, and that maybe we actually have made some genuine and striking progress.",
        "And, I especially think that whatever we grown-ups think that if there were a generation of people, and this is black, white, yellow and everything else who grew up seeing not just Barack Obama but the Obamas in the White House.",
        "If we saw those two girls grow up in the White House, if we saw Barack and Michelle together there every single day on your laptop, on TV, getting in and out of Air Force One.",

        "And, so it's not that I don't think that there's racism in America, it's not that I don't understand that the playing field isn't level.",

        "I have no problem with it but in 2006, before anybody had any idea we are going to get to this point, that was just something I pointed out.",
        "But as far as experience, to be perfectly frank, I thought Hillary Clinton had more experience than - now the gradient was not large enough I think to matter, and I was for Barack Obama during the primaries too.",
        "But he is intelligent enough, and he is quick enough a study, that whatever experience gaffe he has compared to for example, Senator McCain, he could easily make up for.",

        "I just think that will really diversify those that go into teaching.",
