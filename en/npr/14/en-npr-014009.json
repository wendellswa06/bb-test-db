        "He has actually spoken before a teacher's union, heavy crowd and been booed for a couple of the things that he said.",
        "And it's because the school question is very, very complex, but anybody who thinks it's just a matter of poor schools don't get enough money from on high is understandably so, but mistaken.",
        "That's not what the problem is, and Barack Obama understands that.",
        "And, so I think that he would be poised to make a difference.",
        "He also realizes that No Child Left Behind, despite its good intentions needs to be either deeply revised or scrapped, and that is something that is important.",
        "He also cares about education to an extent that John McCain simply constitutionally does not.",
        "So, once again, I think that he is a better person for this moment.",
        "Tom, thanks for the call.",
        "Appreciate it.",

        "Let me ask you, John McWhorter, if Barack Obama is elected president next week, a week from today, he will be working with a Democratic-controlled House and Senate as well.",
        "How do you think he is going to be able to cope with these very experienced inside politicians who are going to have agendas of their own, agendas that may not comport necessarily with his agenda, who may want to enact programs of their own?",
        "Well, you know, Neil, it seems to me that what you just described is what it is to be a President of the United States.",
        "And so, the question is how would Barack Obama deal with it?",
        "I think that he would deal with it pretty well given that he is someone who I think, - talk about what someone as constitutionally is constitutionally inclined towards trying to bring the best of both sides together into something constructive.",
        "And so, of course, he will be presented with differing agendas, and he'll do his best.",
        "It's interesting, people seem to look at his voting record in the Senate and suppose that he's actually under the impression that that's the kind of presidency that he would put forward.",
        "A highly liberal voting record."

        "Hi, I just wanted to propose my final argument as to why he should be and is the most viable candidate.",

        "Whether he is negotiating with Canada and Mexico or NAFTA, or whether he is negotiating accords in the Middle East, he has this sort of come let us reason together empirical attitude that lends itself for listening to others, reasoning with others, and I can't see the angry John McCain in that role.",
        "I've never been able to fit him in that role.",
        "Let us focus on Barack Obama for just a moment and just to pick up your metaphor, Jeff, in the cauldron of the presidential campaign - Barack Obama, as we just heard in the previous segment has generally declined to embrace Muslim Americans and Arab Americans and has pretty much avoided the issue of immigration.",
        "I believe the first thing he has to do is run for office and overcoming fear in the campaign is not in a way that you can directly answer that question.",

        "He has to avoid talking about those issues because for reasons that all of us are dismayed about as we heard in the past segment.",
        "There are people out there where their vote might tip one way or another based on whether or not they associate him with Islam, and that is not a good thing.",
        "But just because it's not a good thing doesn't mean that it isn't true.",
        "And so, yeah, let's wait to see what happens when he gets into office.",
        "It is interesting there are certain things that will always be with us like for example, once he gets in, yeah, there will be people on bar stools saying, well, now that the blacks have a president, what more do they want?",
        "There will be those people.",
        "There will roughly every six weeks be discovered a plot by a bunch of idiots where they are pretending to have a plan to assassinate the president.",
        "There will be those things, but I think that there will be so many good things about Barack Obama in office including race relevant legislation such as bringing fathers back into contact with their children, such as prisoner re-entry programs.",
        "These are really important things - faith-based and non-faith-based.",
        "I think it will be a wonderful time although it will not be utopia because we'll never have utopia.",
