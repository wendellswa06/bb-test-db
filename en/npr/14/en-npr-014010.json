        "The verdict consents were manifestly fair for the horrific crimes that he supervised, organized and ultimately tried to cover up.",

        "When I listen to Martin Luther King's \"\"I Have a Dream\"\" speech, I'm always curious as to why many of us overlook the opening statements of his 1963 address.",
        "It's as if we only want to hear one side of his speech.",
        "Why do we quickly repeat the words, I have a dream, and not the words, America has given the Negro people a bad check, which has come back marked insufficient funds, but we refuse to believe the bank of justice is bankrupt, we refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vault of opportunity of this nation?",

        "And every time we had a genuine disagreement about where the story should go or what should happen to a certain character, we always asked, can we use this?",
        "So a lot of our real disagreements became sort of the exaggerated comedic disagreements in the book.",
        "David Hayward, are you a different writer now from this experience?",
