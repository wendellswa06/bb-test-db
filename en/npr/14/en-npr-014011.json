        "Hydration of the body takes 10 to 15 minutes, which is kind of a long time.",
        "But animals usually stop drinking in less than a minute no matter how thirsty they were when they started.",
        "Somehow the brain figures out that water is on the way.",

        "But where is the signal coming from, right?",
        "How does the brain know that we are drinking water?",
        "To find out, Oka and his team studied mice, and they identified some very special brain cells in the thirst center.",
        "These cells fired only when a mouse was drinking water, but they kept quiet when the mouse was eating, even if the food was a gel that was almost entirely made of water.",
        "These neurons can distinguish if animals are drinking or eating somehow.",
        "This is, I think, amazing.",
