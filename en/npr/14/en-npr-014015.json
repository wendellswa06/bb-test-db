        "Well, what I've found out through editing this book, we have - our first chapter is on loyalty, and it's contributed by Jordan Grafman, who's at the National Institutes of Health.",
        "And he takes a look at different parts of the brain that are responsible for keeping us loyal to our team, not necessarily just the Cubs, although the Cubs are a good example because their history has not been so bright over the past decades, but really fans of any team in any sport.",

        "And after we got here, after a couple of months of patrolling it, we gave that over to Iraqi and national guard unit and that street is now one of the safest streets in Baghdad.",
        "I think pulling the US troops out too soon and not getting any Iraqi troops trained up is the wrong answer.",
