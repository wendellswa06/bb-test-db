        "presence in Afghanistan.",
        "Now, in contrast to his predecessor, he waited for the Arab League to call for a no-fly zone in Libya and followed the lead of France and Britain to get approval from the United Nations Security Council.",
        "Some critics say he dithered and should have taken decisive action earlier.",
        "Others argue that the military steps he's taken don't match his actual goal of regime change.",

        "Bob Woodward, nice to have you back on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And is there an Obama doctrine?",
        "Well, first of all, you have to kind of step back and say there are two strategic cultures in American foreign policy.",
        "And the first one is a kind of crusading, moralistic - this is the George Bush approach: We have a duty to free people."

        "In Obama, the two converge.",

        "Sometimes it's crusading, moralistic.",
        "Sometimes it's now we're stepping back, we're trying to get out of these wars and focus on our domestic problems.",
        "At the same time, I think his approach now, after several years, you can determine what some of the features are.",
        "And that would include?",
        "Well, I think first that he likes coalitions, other countries involved, even likes the idea, as in the case of Libya, of at least announcing or making it appear as if other countries are leading.",
        "The second feature is probably, like in Libya, an assertion: No ground forces.",
        "Third would be no preemption, like George Bush in Iraq.",
        "In other words, we're not going to start a war to - just kind of out of the blue because we've decided it's time to get rid of somebody like Saddam Hussein.",
        "Or, he said that if there are forces gathering that might threaten the United States with weapons of mass destruction or terrorism, we will act first.",
        "Yes, but, you know, Obama's much more restrained in that.",
        "I think another element of - he likes negotiations, calls it engagement, economic sanctions if necessary, sometimes tough ones, like in Iran."

        "Now that's...",
        "No, he said it was a matter of days before the United States turned over command of the operation to another organization as yet to be determined.",
        "Right, but some of his national security team have said, well, this will just take days and maybe weeks.",
        "That's risky.",
        "War is so - it's the land of the unknowable, and to put kind of time lines - I mean, if you go back to the Iraq War, Rumsfeld, who was Defense secretary, met with his closest advisors before the war.",

        "Yes, there's something about that, too.",
        "Some of our contributors of a chapter on the joy of victory and the agony of defeat talk about how there are parts of the brain that seem to be, maybe light up a little bit more when the reward that we seek is not expected and the kind of - to actually make a connection with gambling, how gambling can be so attractive and to some people addictive because they are looking for that unexpected reward.",
        "Well, transferring some of that over to baseball, clearly we Cubs fans cannot be expecting a World Series win at this point.",

        "Howard Zelaznik, let's talk about hitting which has been described as the single most difficult act in all of sports, correct?",
        "The hitting of fast ball coming in 95, 100 miles an hour.",
        "A batter - what's going on in the minds or the head of a batter to be able to make contact and actually hit the ball very well?",
        "Well, we have to keep in mind that even the best and greatest of hitters are really not very good at the task, and that's why they get so many swings.",
        "Imagine a free throw shooter getting five attempts to shoot two free throws.",
        "So, it's really difficult.",
        "What the batter needs to do is halfway down the pitch - meaning when the pitch is about halfway toward home plate - the batter has to either pull the trigger and swing, or keep the bat on his shoulder, as one might say.",
        "Right.",
        "And the batter does that based upon some very early information about what he thinks the speed of the ball will be, so he can predict how the ball is going to drop.",

        "There are some very classic studies that have actually filmed the eye movements of batters, and the batter doesn't see the ball hit the bat.",
        "And one of the reasons is that the eye can't rotate fast enough to keep up with the angular velocity of the ball on the eye.",
        "It's like being in the Indianapolis speedway and trying to see a car that's going by in front of you versus on the other side of the track where it moves relatively slowly across your visual field.",
        "Do we know what part of the brain is working most heavily in this situation?",
        "All of the brain is working very heavily.",
        "I mean, there are motor areas in the brain, but there is not a baseball spot in the brain.",
        "Dan, do you agree?",
        "Well, there are certain spots that are a little bit more active when the hitter is deciding whether to swing.",
        "And there's also an aspect of the brain that - we have a chapter on the brain aspect of hitting.",
        "And what the contributors talk about is that there's a part of the brain called mirror neurons, and these have been proved in nonhuman primates and monkeys - not yet in humans, but they're pretty sure that we have them, too - so that a hitter can kind of take a look at the pitcher's action even before he throws the ball and have some idea of where that pitch is going to go and whether he wants to swing.",
        "So, that makes up for the extremely short time that he has while the ball is in the air to actually follow through on that swing.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "1-800-989-8255.",
        "Of course, we've always heard that a good - any good Major League hitter can hit a great fastball.",
        "It's hitting the ball, the breaking pitchers, that are hardest, and it's the great pitchers who can change speed and be more wily than the batters.",
        "I mean, you know, even not throw it that fast but have you guessing - how much of guessing, Dan, is about baseball?",
        "Well, there's an aspect for the pitchers.",
        "Their goal is to kind of fake the hitter out.",
        "The hitter is taking his knowledge of the wind-up that the pitcher is going through, but also his memory of past situations maybe with that pitcher, maybe in a similar game situation or in a similar count and is making a decision whether to swing based on those things, the pitcher is looking to do whatever he can to kind of distract the hitter and throw the hitter off.",
        "So if he can throw one - if he can throw a couple of different pitches, pitches of a couple of different speeds from the same spot or with the same arm motion, that can be what really fakes the hitter out.",
        "And as Dr. Zelaznik said, hitters, you know, they're - in the Major Leagues, the hitters are quite good relative to the rest of us but they still miss.",
        "Even the best hitters miss about seven times out of 10.",
        "We're going to spend the next few minutes in India.",
        "Lots of changes in that country these days.",
        "We'll talk about how the movie industry is modernizing in a moment.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Let me bring in a guest now, William Raasch, who is an associate professor of Orthopedic Surgery at Medical College of Wisconsin.",
