        "Welcome to the program, Dr. Raasch.",
        "Thank you.",
        "You have talked about pitching and have written and said that if we lower the mound a little bit, we might get some advantage to pitching that way.",
        "Tell us a bit why you think that is.",
        "Well, about five years ago, Major League Baseball decided to try and fund research that might help produce the risk of injury.",
        "And when baseball players - when pitchers throw the ball, they're always right at that edge of injuring something.",
        "Through motion analysis, we discovered that the forces are very high to the threshold in which the soft tissue, the muscles, the tendons and ligaments fail.",
        "And so basically, what we did is we did a motion analysis study looking at mound height - basically a pitcher throwing his fastball at flat ground, as we would do just on a straight surface, and then we moved it up to mound height, which is 10 inches above flat ground, and we used a couple of intermediate heights as well - six and eight inches.",
        "And what we discovered is that, sure enough, there are some differences between throwing a baseball from the flat ground versus 10 inches.",
        "What we saw were some increases in stresses on the shoulder joint particularly, and especially in what we call the cocking phase.",
        "You know, when you look at the pitcher from the side and you see that arm twisted almost all the way back like it's going to break off.",
        "That's when we saw the differences.",
        "We saw an increase in what we call adduction - A-D-duction torque as well as an increase in what we call superior shear.",
        "Shear, think of something trying to slide out of place, and a torque, well, you take a wrench and try and remove a nut or a bolt.",
        "And this is all because the mound is higher, not because of any mechanics of the pitcher?",
        "Well, obviously, when we - we also looked at the side of kinetics, which would be the forces.",
        "We looked at the, basically, the kinetics, which would be the position or the velocities that are occurring.",
        "And we did not see a lot of difference.",
        "Now, we saw a difference in timing.",
        "For instance, when the foot first made contact with the ground, the arm would be more externally rotated.",
        "So the arm was basically in different positions at different times during the throwing motion.",
        "When we looked at velocity, for instance, we did not see a statistical difference between throwing from flat ground versus the mound.",
        "Now granted that's one of the things we try to control.",
        "We wanted him to throw at about a 90 percent level, nice and easy, so we could simply take that variable out of play, because if you throw harder, typically, you will increase the stress on the shoulder.",
        "Did you find that then pitcher could be as effective at a lower mound as effective a pitcher, potentially, and not put as much stress on his shoulder?"

        "Well, you know, that's not - we really can't say that.",
        "What we can say is that, with regards to certain parameters, we can decrease the stress on the shoulder if we drop the pitcher down to a flat surface.",
        "The problem is that doesn't necessarily mean that the pitcher can get the ball player out - the batter out.",
        "One of the things that we're always trying to do is, again, improve mechanics to reduce stress and reduce injury.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But sometimes, what these pitchers do is they'd have some sort of little quirky delivery that provides that little bit of extra movement on the ball.",
        "Right.",
        "Because of that, it can fool the batter and get him out.",
        "So, if I have a pitcher that has perfect mechanics but can't get anyone out, he's healthy, but he's not very productive, and he's not going to last long in the Major League.",
        "However, if someone has a little bit of a quirky delivery, puts an increased stress on it, well, then you're probably going to go with that as long as he can with the understanding of the increased risk for an injury down the road.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Well, you could still have the quirky delivery low on a - with a lower mound.",
        "Could he not?",
        "That is possible.",
        "But we didn't, you know, we didn't check for all that.",
        "Basically, we did 20 professional baseball pitchers, along with some Division 1 collegiate pitchers.",
        "And we saw the significant differences again in certain torques and shear stresses on the shoulder.",
        "We saw some differences in the elbow as well, but they weren't quite statistically significant at this point.",
        "Obviously, we - best thing to do would be to incorporate more pitchers into the study, carry it out a little bit further.",
        "At this point, we do see some differences so we can explain why, for instance, when we're rehabbing a pitcher and they're doing well after their shoulder injury, they're throwing fine from flat ground.",
        "But as soon as we get them back to the pitching mound, all of a sudden, their shoulder starts to bother them again.",
        "So this, clinically, we knew something was going on."

        "Let me - two more points to make and I'll let you go because I know you're in spring training.",
        "One, you mentioned the - in the paper that Nolan Ryan liked to practice on flat ground and he had this good a fastball as anybody.",
        "You know what?",
        "He was way ahead of the curve.",
        "I mean, he was also known for incorporating rotator cuff exercises.",
        "Now the rotator cuff is basically that group of muscles that keeps the, basically, the ball of the arm bone centered in that very shallow cup we call the glenoid.",
        "And if that's working perfectly, your shoulder's going to stay healthy.",
        "So he was just way ahead of the game.",
        "He kept his shoulder healthy longer than just about anyone.",
        "And again, as you said, he threw at an incredible velocity.",
        "And he could do it on a flat surface?",
        "Well, that's what he practiced on.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, he practiced on a flat surface and that, you know, some pitchers will say, well, I have to practice in the exact same way in which I pitch.",
        "You know, hard to say if that's true or not.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Obviously, it wasn't true for Nolan Ryan.",
        "Let me ask you this one question about little leaguers.",
        "You know, we talk about little leaguers and the potential for their arm damage that could be done by them trying to throw curveballs.",
        "Yeah."

        "Could - if we lower the mound much lower, would that help prevent some of the injuries they might be suffering from?",
        "Well, their mound is already lower for the little leaguers, in most cases.",
        "And the problem is, if you go to any sort of little league ballpark in a typical community that height can be anywhere from six inches, three inches, two inches to a little bit of a rut into the ground.",
        "So at this point now, we can't truly say that.",
        "All we know is that we see some increased stress.",
        "Now, the next question, obviously, that arises is: Does that increased stress actually lead to injury?",
        "Now, here at the Milwaukee Brewer's, we have our own database looking at pitchers.",
        "And whenever we someone, for instance, outside of two standard deviations of norm with regards to a certain stress or strain in the shoulder.",
        "It's been pretty predictive that that shoulder is at a high risk for injury possibly resulting in surgery.",
        "And so when we see that, we try and alter mechanics at least to keep that pitcher safe while still maintaining an effective pitch.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So you can get the batter out.",
        "Well, I want to thank you for taking time to be with us, Dr. Raasch.",
