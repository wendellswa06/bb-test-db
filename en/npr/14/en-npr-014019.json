        "In fact, the seams are crucial because if the ball were purely smooth, the pitcher would have a bear of a time controlling it.",
        "So the seams help to prevent turbulent flow at the speed that the ball normally travels.",
        "So the seams actually aid the pitcher and they also are very important for things like knuckle balls in particular which take advantage of the seams producing turbulent flow when the pitcher throws the ball a little slower and trying not to spin the ball.",
        "Well, if you a have ball spinning backwards and the seams helps the air flow around the ball and pushes the air down and the ball's going to go up.",
        "It's going to try to be, you know, action and reaction, so it's -a fastball will appear to rise and will not go down as much because there's a force trying to hold it up a little higher.",
        "But the knuckle ball is very interesting topic because if you actually watch - I've seen movies of painting the ball, you know, they'll paint half a ball and throw the - I know you probably seen the same ball, and it's just doesn't rotate at all.",
        "The best knuckle balls don't rotate at all so they're like a bullet that's not spinning.",
        "They're not, you know, they're not predictable where they're going.",
        "So that's one of the great pitches in the game."
