        "That's something that's inherent in baseball.",
        "And every team but one has to say that at the end of the season really.",
        "So, what we say is that, you know, we've got this beautiful ballpark, we've got a team that has, you know, that we suffer the lows with but also, we've come close a few times and so when it does happen, it's going to be that much sweeter, and why not keep rooting for them, you can't just abandon them.",

        "Howard Zelaznik, we got about a minute left, but I could - I really can't avoid talking about steroids in baseball.",
        "Do we have any evidence that steroids really help baseball players hit longer baseballs or make their reaction time just a fraction of a second faster as they get that advantage?",
        "As far as I know, no. The increase in muscle strength might make the bat swing faster which will be an advantage.",
        "But if you look at long-term trends, the trends that increase the number of home runs, actually falls on a nice looking curve, even before the steroids were introduced.",
        "So, I'm not sure if it really has much of a benefit.",
        "The big problem still is getting the bat at the right place at the right time and steroids are really no help for that.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And that's…",
        "Exactly.",
        "And your genes may be a better help for that.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Do you ban caffeine?",
        "So where is that line drawn for baseball players and for sports?",
        "Mm-hmm, because baseball players have been taking those uppers for years before there were steroids."

        "Nice to be here.",
        "So what does narrow networks mean, and how does it relate to the Briggs family?",
        "Well, this is something that dates back to the beginning of the Affordable Care Act.",
        "Remember, they're required - insurers are required now to provide this wide array of benefits.",
        "And when they were starting to put together their plans, they thought, how are we going to do this and still keep this insurance affordable?",
        "And one of the ways they did that was by having what we call narrow networks, meaning they only contract with a limited number of doctors and hospitals.",
        "And the hospitals that they most often don't contract with are these big teaching hospitals because they tend to be expensive.",
        "So we've seen this not just in places like Virginia, but we've seen it across the country starting in 2014 when this began, where people who had children or family members or themselves in the middle of - often, cancer treatment - were suddenly cut off from their hospitals.",
        "So it is a big problem for people who have ongoing care needs like this family.",
        "This year, when there are so many insurers that have pulled out of the market - because as you discussed, of the instability and the things that the president has done - there are more people who only have a choice of one insurer.",
        "So that if that insured doesn't cover the hospital that they need, they have a problem like the Briggs.",
        "But is this an ACA problem?",
        "Is this a problem that exists primarily because of the Affordable Care Act and all the sort of political wrangling around it?",
        "It is more intense within the Affordable Care Act plans because, as I mentioned, they have to cover all of these various benefits, and they need to keep the prices down because they're competing, in some cases, with other plans.",
        "But also, people are paying the full freight.",
        "But you do see this also in employer plans, you know, particularly for smaller employers, who have to pay more - for whom it's a bigger burden.",
        "You see narrower networks there, too, where they don't contract with very many providers.",
        "But we've seen this kind of - we saw this kind of fight here in Washington, D.C., some years ago when the federal Blue Cross plan had a fight with Children's Hospital.",
        "And the winner of that fight was the Washington Post because there were full-page ads every day for weeks before they could come to some kind of agreement.",
        "So when it comes to looking for insurance on the exchanges, I take it that it's important to shop around.",
        "But can people still shop around?",
        "Well, it is to the extent you can.",
        "It looks like about a quarter of people on the exchanges will only have a choice of one insurer.",
        "Now, they can shop around within that insurer for different plans, and that is still important.",
        "When it comes to these networks, they're largely the same.",
        "So if you have a problem with the network, you have to do what this family is doing and try to sort it out with the insurer or with the hospital - you know, with the facility that you need.",
        "But yes, it remains really important to shop, particularly if there's some provider that you know you need.",
        "So we only have about a minute left, Julie.",
        "So the bottom line is the Briggs family are not the only people in this situation.",
        "It's a particularly heart-wrenching situation, but they're not the only people in that situation."
