        "Bob, you - Bob Cooke, you talk in your book about, you know, where this idea first comes from.",
        "Can you, you know, relate where this sort of began to emerge into Dr. Folkman's thinking?",
        "Well, Folkman saw a phenomenon when he happened to have been drafted by the Navy and was working in Bethesda, Maryland in a laboratory.",
        "And he and his colleagues finished their assigned job much too early and had plenty of free time, so their captain said, well, do what you want in the laboratory.",
        "So they got some cancer cells from across the street at the National Institutes of Health and tried to grow them in this special apparatus where they were testing substitute blood supplies for the Navy.",
        "It turned out, when they grew these cancer cells, I think they were black melanoma cells, they grew up to about, oh, maybe one or two millimeters in size, and all of them stopped growing at the same time.",
        "And Folkman said, well, that ain't natural.",
        "That's - there must - they must be telling us something.",
        "They can't grow beyond a certain size for some reason.",
        "There's a barrier there.",
        "And he spent a couple of years thinking about that and doing experiment and realized that if they can't get a blood supply and call it enough to keep growing, they can't grow beyond a certain size because the nutrients and oxygen can't flow across tissues unless a blood vessel's really close.",
        "Huh.",
        "And one of the things, I think - they made this observation, but this time in his life, his training was - he was a surgeon.",
        "I mean, normally, we don't think about surgeons getting down to the cellular level anyway.",
        "Was that unusual?",
        "Well, that was one of the problems because most of the cancer specialists in the world thought surgeons didn't know anything but how to cut and sew.",
        "And Folkman was a master at both, but he also liked to consider himself a surgeon-scientist.",
        "And he learned a lot of science, somewhat by doing, but he was a learning machine.",
        "He soaked up information like nobody I've ever known.",
        "He's always taking notes.",
        "He was always underlining the important parts.",
        "And so, his idea, to the cancer specialists, seem both too simplistic and naive.",
        "And they said, oh, that - what you're seeing is just inflammation and not blood vessel growth.",
        "So it took a long time to prove his four main points.",
        "Dr.",
        "Norton, I guess, you know, that's an interesting point.",
        "How important is it that Dr. Folkman was a physician in terms of shaping his thinking, do you think, about his science?",
        "I mean, I think it was very important.",
        "But there is an even bigger overarching theme here that I think is very important for the people listening to this to understand is that contemporary science is very reductionist.",
        "The whole concept is to take a very complex phenomenon and try to find single components that can be studied meticulously in the laboratory, removed from the real phenomenon.",
        "What Judah was doing was starting with the phenomenon, was starting with the tumor growth and with the observation of blood vessels and then the manipulation of that as a phenomenon in the laboratory without necessarily driving to the molecules that were causing it primarily, but studying the phenomenon itself.",
        "And this is not typical of the contemporary view of what the way science should be conducted."

        "So it was not only his training and his background that made him stand out from the crowd in terms of pushing his ideas forward, but also, there was a major philosophical difference, and that philosophical difference still exists.",
        "We're - people are listening to this show together, or they're joining together in \"\"Second Life\"\" at the Science School, I think that's the right place.",
        "And we have somebody who has written in in the name of Possedent Drake(ph) who says, is the increased amount of blood vessels seen in all tumors, or just in cancers ones?",
        "And that's an interesting point.",
        "Dr. Norton?",
        "All tumors, including tumors of the blood vessels and blood cell -blood-forming tissues.",
        "You even find that in cases of leukemia, which we think is starting in the bone marrow, that there is increased blood supply.",
        "It's universal.",
        "So what does that say, I mean, about the difference between the blood vessel recruitment of a benign tumor, let's say, versus the blood vessel recruitment of a cancerous tumor?",
        "Well, indeed, that may be the thing that transforms a benign tumor into a cancerous tumor is its ability to produce blood supply.",
        "And we're approaching this as a community from a variety of different directions.",
        "Okay.",
        "Well, Dr. Folkman called that the angiogenic switch because when that switch is thrown, it starts drawing in the blood vessels.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "And, you know, we think, Bob Cooke, a lot about this being primarily related to cancer, but Judah Folkman got into other areas particularly something called macular degeneration?"

        "Good, you know, still vertical.",
        "I was - just wanted to ask a question to your guests regarding all of this talk of tumors and blood vessels and development.",
        "You guys have been mentioning about how these tend to recruit blood vessels that are nearby, but my question was if the blood vessels, being present and all of that blood going to one area, seems to be a result of the tumors, could that also possibly be a cause of the tumors, in effect, too much blood vessel development in one area could help increase the chances of tumors developing?",
        "And could that be related to other cancers in parts of the body that are particularly known for abnormal blood vessel development?",
        "Hmm, interesting question, Nathan.",
        "Let's ask Dr. Norton what he makes of that.",
        "Well, not in a simplistic sense, but actually in a much more complicated sense, it actually is very relevant.",
        "Because one of the things that induces blood vessels the best is inflammation.",
        "When you have an infection, you have to deliver blood to that area to allow white cells to get in there to heal the infection.",
        "And infections tend to attract blood supply as well.",
        "And that's why they get red and that's why they get raised.",
        "And there's a very strong connection between inflammation and cancer.",
        "Indeed, every prostate with cancer in it has evidence of inflammation.",
        "Every breast with cancer in it has evidence of inflammation.",
        "So the connections between inflammation and cancer are very real.",

        "One of the things that Dr. Folkman and some of his colleagues used to say is that cancer is very much like a wound that will not heal.",
        "And so it keeps on putting in new blood vessels and it's growing and trying to heal.",
        "So - and about the distant metastases, or other cancers, the arrival of new blood vessels provides an avenue through which tiny cells from the cancer can migrate to other points in the body and set up these other tumors.",
        "So they are related, but as Dr. Norton said, in a very complicated way.",
        "And I just want to be clear, the drug that Genentech makes, Avastin, that's not the same as these drugs that Dr. Folkman was pursuing in 2000 -angiostatin and endostatin, right?",
        "That's correct.",
        "Avastin is an antibody, an artificial molecule made by Genentech that blocks the action of one of the blood vessel growth stimulators, VEGF.",
        "VEGF is the problem in the eye and it's one of the main stimulators that tumors use to draw in blood vessels.",

        "And eventually, slowly, the community came over and saw the validity of it.",
        "And I think that's a very important part of the story, because many people have very good ideas, have real insights, and if they can't get support for it, grant support or peer support or community support, they abandon those ideas, they move on to other ideas.",
        "It turns out that Judah was totally right.",
        "I'm part of an organization called Breast Cancer Research Foundation and we gave him an award, actually one of our first awards, over a decade ago.",

        "And, Bob Cooke, you write that a lot of his early funding wasn't from federal sources at all but from industry.",
        "Well, not so, but he had industry.",
        "He was the one who got the first big grant from industry into Harvard.",
        "And that really touched off a fuss at Harvard because one, the university didn't accept patents or want anything do with commercial income, and that led to changing the whole policy at Harvard and most other universities in the country as the biotechnology revolution was taking off.",
        "And, of course, a lot of people disliked Folkman for that, particularly at the time.",
        "Now they love it.",
        "But Folkman, when he was - when I asked Harold Varmus, who was formerly head of the National Institutes of Health, about Folkman he said, the first time he'd heard of Folkman - I think it was back in the 70s, he said that Judah Folkman was described as this guy in a hair shirt walking - working on an island in Boston Harbor, kind of really off the mainstream.",
