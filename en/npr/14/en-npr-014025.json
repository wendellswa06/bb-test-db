        "Okay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It depends upon the organ that we're talking about.",
        "But that most of us have some elements of benign tumors in our bodies at all times.",
        "Why they suddenly become malignant - by malignant we mean that they grow larger and especially, that they can invade into surrounding tissue and they can spread to other parts of the body - that's one of the key questions that we are wrestling with right now in cancer research.",
        "And clearly, the ability to start to attract the blood supply is part of that.",
        "In the breast, ductal carcinoma in situ is a benign tumor that is found very, very commonly.",
        "And most of the time, it doesn't do anything but occasionally, it does convert into a malignant tumor.",
        "In men, there is something called PIN, which is a prostatic benign tumor that is very common as men get older.",
        "Indeed, most men over age 50 and 60 have some evidence of that.",
        "And that also can stay totally benign through your life or can convert.",
        "So this is one of the really important topics in modern cancer research.",
        "And…",
        "Now, Dr…",
        "Go ahead, Bob.",
        "Dr.",
        "Folkman was - has pointed out several times that autopsy studies in automobile accident victims show that almost everyone has these little tiny pinhead benign tumors in the thyroid gland.",
        "So it's not uncommon, but what causes it to switch to malignancy is still not known.",
        "It has something to do with oxygen starvation.",
        "But they're still working on that.",
        "Bob, in the book, again, you described a couple of, you know, individuals who were quite remarkable - successfully treated with some of these angiogenesis inhibitors, angiostatin and endostatin.",
        "How far along, in general, have these drugs gotten, do you think?",
        "Well, they're really doing very well.",
        "I was at his laboratory this morning.",
        "Of course, Judah Folkman isn't there having died two weeks ago.",
        "But the research is continuing at terrifically rapid pace.",
        "And some of the angiogenesis inhibitors that he found are now fast approaching the clinic.",
        "At first, when they were introduced in about, oh, probably 2000 or 1999, the toxicity test suggested that there might be efficacy but not enough to get a - people to get excited about, so they have never made it to the clinic.",
        "That may soon change."

        "Dr.",
        "Norton, is that your understanding?",
        "I mean, are these drugs - these - not, I guess, not necessarily specifically these, but drugs based on the controlling blood supply, is that likely to become important in treating solid tumors?",
        "Well, it's actually already important.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, we like the trailer.",
        "This - the drug Avastin, or bevacizumab is what it's called, is actually already in use in the clinic in several diseases and we're studying in other diseases.",
        "There's about a dozen drugs in development, including the drugs that Bob just mentioned that are being developed right now that are rapidly approaching proper clinical trials.",
        "Of course, we have to learn a lot about them - toxicities, the right dose, the right schedule.",
        "There's a lot of work that's yet to be done.",
        "But without question, the fact that we have at least one anti-blood vessel drug that's on the market and that is helping people at controlling the cancers indicates that Judah was right, this is an important target.",
        "But again - now, this is - I guess, the question that I want to get at and it's very hard for me as a journalist to talk about Judah Folkman's work without thinking about a famous New York Times article which quoted Jim Watson as saying, Judah Folkman is going to cure cancer in two years.",
        "He obviously didn't do that and maybe, it was an over-the-top comment even at the time, and intentionally so.",
        "But the point is, how big of a contribution is this?",
        "I mean, is this going to - I mean, are 20 percent of cancer victims going to be saved - lives saved or is it 5 percent or is it 50 percent?",
        "I mean, can you say how big of a contribution these will ultimately be?",
        "Well, of course, you can't.",
        "You know, it could be huge.",
        "It's certainly a contributing factor.",
        "But let me tell you something about it that is huge, which is that that work shifted the attention of a very large segment of our community - and the entire cancer research community acknowledges the importance of this, shifted it from just the cancer cell to the relationship of the cancer cell and its normal environment.",
        "Many of the blood vessel cells that come - that form these new blood vessels in cancers are coming from the bone marrow.",
        "Indeed, some people think they're all coming from the bone marrow and they're circulating through the system, getting to the area of the tumor and that's where the blood vessel growth really starts.",
        "And it shows you that cancer's not just a disease of the cancer cell but it's a disease of the cells around the cancer cell, indeed, the bone marrow and the whole body.",
        "And that change of focus is huge.",
        "And that - the implications of that are really enormous for understanding biology and unquestionably are going to help a lot of people and, many of us believe, will lead to the cure of cancer."

        "Anemia itself does not make tumors grow faster or make them grow less.",
        "But often, cancers actually can cause anemia.",
        "There's an anemia of malignancy that we sometimes observe.",
        "So the cancers are actually sending out signals throughout the body for the body to produce fewer red blood cells.",
        "And again, it indicates that a cancer is not just a lump of cells that are just sort of growing, but they're related to the whole body.",
        "Okay.",
        "Let's try one more - oh, sorry, Bob Cooke, go ahead.",
        "The picture that seems to be emerging is that a tiny tumor growing until it reaches a certain size and can't grow without more blood, which suggests it's starving for oxygen and nutrients.",
        "And when any organ in the body is starving, it sends out a signal: Send me more blood.",
        "Send me more blood.",
        "And that may be part of the angiogenic switch that makes the body start sending in new blood vessels.",

        "And Avastin is working against a high-grade - like my tumor has shifted from a lower grade to a higher grade, and I'm using it in combination with several chemotherapy agents.",
