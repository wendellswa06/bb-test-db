        "Well, Julianne, Connecticut is by no means an all white state, but it's not a state like California or New York with the hugest preponderance of voters of color.",

        "I think that Joe Lieberman is looking for a fight.",

        "He's one of the few African-Americans who's been elected to statewide office there.",
        "This is really - the Connecticut Federation of Black Democratic Clubs' endorsement of Lamont was really a blow to Lieberman.",
        "And I think he's prepared to fight it out.",
        "And I think as Marcelo says, when he chooses to fight it out, it tarnishes Lamont.",
        "It really doesn't - the funk doesn't fall back on the African-American Democrats.",
        "It really does fall back on Lamont.",
        "So Lamont really needs to galvanize those African-Americans who've been supporting him.",
        "He needs to bring people like Maxine back to make it clear that there were reasons why this statement was made.",
        "It's totally incorrect again to say he didn't march in 1960.",
        "I don't know.",

        "It's that - but that's not the point, as Walter makes.",

        "And quite frankly, Lieberman's stand has been a weak one.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's move on to one last topic.",
        "The Sentencing Project released a new report revealing a growing interest in reforms of state felony voting laws and restoration of voting rights.",
        "Now this is really a state-by-state issue.",
        "Some states allow felons to vote from inside the prison walls and other states disenfranchise you forever.",
        "I describe it as a re-emergence of populist nationalism.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No, it was great fun.",
        "And so basically 16 states since 1997 have implemented reforms that have reduced the restrictiveness of these laws and more than 600,000 people have regained their voting rights.",
        "Now is this a sign that these laws, which came to birth during, you know, the post-Reconstruction era mainly, are getting rolled back?",
        "I guess, Marcelo: Do you see this as something that is a national wave?",
        "And if so, is it progress?",
        "Well, the numbers are so huge on how they disproportionately affect the African-American, the Latino voting population is such that we really need to think about what it means for a democracy when hundreds of thousands of people who did their time, paid their dues to society are permanently disenfranchised from the political process, the process that is at the very, very heart of the Democratic promise.",
        "We really ask - we have the highest incarceration rate of any advanced post-industrial democracy in the world.",
        "We really need to look at this very, very seriously."

        "People have paid their debt to society.",
        "They should not be permanently disenfranchised.",
        "And we've seen the distortions, certainly in the 2000 election and the 2004 election, in the ways that these lists have been used for scurrilous purposes.",
        "So once people have done the time and paid society, they should be fully participating citizens; it develops a level of alienation in addition to everything else.",
        "I applaud these changes, but I think they clearly don't go far enough.",
        "And obviously we have the state's rights thing, which means that various states have the choice to make.",
        "I think in states where you have heavy African-American populations and heavy levels of African-American incarceration, we have to look very carefully at the motives of those who refuse to basically re-enfranchise people.",
        "And, Walter, some of the, you know, the background on this is that these laws often came to birth during the period when African-Americans were first allowed to vote.",
        "Now even yet today, an estimated 1 in 12 African-Americans is disenfranchised, and that's five times the rate of non-African-Americans.",
        "It's very difficult sometimes to get traction with issues of crime in public discourse because it's kind of one of those third-rail issues that politicians don't like to address.",
        "Should there be a national movement in Congress to really stop making this a state-by-state issue and create a federal policy?",
        "Well, it's going to be difficult to make this a federal policy when voting is a state matter.",
        "But there are some real implications in terms of political power.",
        "In New York State for example, control of the state Senate is really contingent upon a couple of senatorial districts in which felons, incarcerated individuals, make up a sizeable plurality of the district.",
        "And if they were allowed to vote in their home districts, it would shift political power and you would see a change in partisan control of the state Senate.",
        "So there is a real underlying bottom-line issue here in terms of votes not being counted where they should be counted and communities not getting the benefit of those votes because those votes are locked away.",
        "So I think we have to really approach it at a state-level matter because election law is a state function.",
        "And I think in certain states it's obvious in terms of a disenfranchisement that has occurred, places such as New York.",
        "Other places is not as obvious because we have different statutes regarding the issue of felons voting.",
        "But I think there are some real political implications here that we better take a look at, because it's our community that is harmed by this issue.",
        "We've been talking with Walter Fields, CEO and publisher of Northstarnetwork.com.",
