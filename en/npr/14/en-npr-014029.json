        "Well, it appears that the president's tweet has put this not only in his crosshairs but also in the spotlight of Mexican authorities.",
        "As you said, they put out a release late last night.",
        "This was from the Foreign and Interior ministers, and they said they plan to review the immigration status of the migrants, the majority of whom are now stopped in the southern state of Oaxaca.",
        "Anyone that's found not to be authorized to be legally in the country or have a legitimate claim, they say, to be in the country will be returned home.",
        "And they said that 400 of them have already been deported, and that was unclear when or how that happened.",
        "But the press release was clear to point out that it's not up to Mexico to decide where the - whether these people go to the U.S.",
        "or not.",
        "They're free to make their own decision.",
        "And officials wanted to make it very clear that under no circumstances does Mexico promote irregular migration, as they call it, in any way.",
        "Well, let's figure out what is normal here because as you've pointed out to us in an earlier report, this is not the only group of migrants that's ever taken this route.",
        "We're talking here about people from Central America, right?",
        "And they head north to Mexico, and first, they cross the Mexican border.",
        "Does Mexico try to stop them?",
        "Well, yeah, they do.",
        "Of course, there are border controls there.",
        "It's - it is not very well-guarded, especially - it has been notorious.",
        "The border between Mexico and Guatemala is very easy to cross, especially through the river.",
        "But there are deportations.",
        "There are detentions and stuff in Mexico, yes.",
        "And then in recent years - just in the first two months of this year, 15,000 Central Americans have been deported from Mexico.",
        "OK, so they do stop some people, but some people, including the members of this caravan, get through.",
        "And once they're in Mexico, how does Mexico tend to treat people who are on the roads or riding on the tops of trains or whatever they're doing, heading toward the United States?",
        "Well, it depends what aspect of that you're talking about.",
        "Officially, Mexicans have been asking for more refugee status and asylum in Mexico and have been granted it in recent years, especially since that big - if you remember back in 2014 when tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors were coming to the U.S., fleeing gangs and high rates of violence in Central America, Mexico was highly criticized for a crackdown on them.",
        "But human rights advocates say many with legitimate claims were being deported, so Mexican did - Mexico did take steps to improve their screening process.",
        "And last year, more than 10,000 obtained refugee asylum protection in Mexico."
