        "And the Chinese fear it would bring either dangers to their own domestic situation, or bring American or South Korea troops up to their border.",

        "The situation though of a nuclear-armed North Korea - still poverty-stricken - it's in the past, sold missile technology to places like Pakistan and places like Iran.",
        "The North Korean regime has proven willing to sell all kinds of nasty things; whether it be drugs, or counterfeit American dollars, or missile technology.",

        "So sure, we'd all love to see regime solve the problem, but you have to face up to the fact that we've been predicting regime change for a long time.",
