        "This is TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "I'm Neal Conan in Washington.",
        "We're talking today about North Korea.",
        "Given their reported nuclear test, should the goal now be to change the regime of Kim Jong Il or to try again to change its behavior.",
        "And the obvious question: how and when?",
        "You can read about some of the implications of the crisis for China, Japan and other key players, including the United States, at npr.org.",
        "Our guest is Joseph Nye.",
        "He served as assistant secretary of defense for International Security Affairs and was chair of the National Intelligence Council.",
        "Also with us, Ambassador Thomas Hubbard, former U.S.",
        "ambassador to South Korea from 2001 to 2004.",
        "You're of course welcome to join us.",
        "If you have questions about the nuclear crisis, give us a call: 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK.",
        "E-mail us, talk@npr.org.",
        "Let's go to J.D.",
        "J.D.'s calling us from Augusta, Georgia.",
        "J.D.",
        "(Caller): Hi.",
        "Yes, what I wanted to say about the North Korean incident is that I believe that it's almost too late to change the regime in North Korea.",
        "I think that the Bush administration - now they're harking on diplomacy - well, I think it's a little too late for diplomacy, especially if they have nuclear weapons.",
        "If we try to do diplomacy - that's really our only option left.",
        "Because we cannot attack them, because if we do - if they have nuclear technology they will either attack us or our allies.",
        "That raises the question, and again, Joseph Nye - I'm not sure you or really anybody else knows the answer to this question unless you're in Pyongyang - but does North Korea have usable nuclear weapons now?",
        "I doubt that they have usable nuclear weapons.",
        "Everything we've seen from the test looks like it was a fizzle.",
        "In other words, they were looking for a bigger explosion and got a smaller one.",
        "That still leaves it extremely dangerous.",
        "But the ability of the North Koreans to deter us and the South Koreans doesn't rest on nuclear weapons, it rests on the fact that they have something like 12 or 13 thousand artillery tubes, dug in, in tunnels in the demilitarized zone, and all they need to do is drop a few shells on Seoul and the South Korean stock market will collapse.",
        "So there's a lot of deterrent capability in North Korea's conventional position and we don't have very good military options.",
        "If we'd had them, I suspect we might have used them.",
        "But we don't have them.",
        "J.D., thanks very much.",
        "J.D.: Thank you.",
        "And I think that we have to learn to accept that fact because the United States has nuclear weapons and were going to - the other nations are threatened by the fact that we have them.",
        "And the president I mean I think he caused us a problem by referring to North Korea and Iran as evil empires and…",
        "Well, I think South Korean policy for many, many years was actually - actually sought a regime change.",
        "But I think they have drawn the same conclusion that we have now, that a regime change is - we can't force a regime change unless all of us are ready to stand together and really deprive North Korea of all resources, all the means they need to survive.",
        "If China cuts off the food…"

        "Exactly.",
        "That would have terrible consequences for the North Korean people and certainly terrible consequences for order on the Korean Peninsula.",
        "So I think the South Koreans have concluded that they should try to live with this regime while working, over time, to transform it.",
        "Now, this nuclear test has brought new urgency to this issue, and I think has forced the South Koreans to reconsider their timetable, reconsider that mix of policy.",
        "I think they will continue to support engagement, but I think it will be curtailed as we have already seen in the last few days.",
        "And I think the South Koreans now are prepared to support some form of punitive action to include a little more pressure, or much more pressure, in their mix of policies designed to get the North Koreans back to an international negotiating table.",
        "Let's get another caller in - Ken.",
        "Ken's with us from Plainfield, New Jersey.",
        "Hi.",
        "Just wondering - President Bush, in the address this morning to the press, spoke about all of the U.N.",
        "resolutions that had been passed as far as Iraq was concerned.",
        "Now, dealing with the situation in North Korea, do you feel that that type of process should go on again?",
        "And if not, do you think that President Bush would be wrong to make some type of unilateral action?",
        "Joseph Nye, what do you think?",
        "Well, the question is what kind of unilateral action could he take.",
        "If he tries unilateral sanctions it won't make much difference because we're pretty much all sanctioned out already, and it's really the Chinese who hold the big leverage there.",
        "So working with the Chinese in the U.N.",
        "and getting a Security Counsel sanction which others would have to obey, would be by far the more practical approach.",
        "If I could just - let me insert that - by others would have to obey -you're talking about Chapter 7 of the U.N.",
        "Charter?",
        "(Unintelligible) Chapter 7 sanctions.",
        "If it's a resolution or Chapter 6 it's less compulsory but it would still have a certain amount of legitimacy and would be better than the U.S.",
        "trying to do it alone.",
        "If we do it alone, essentially others may not follow, and then it doesn't have any effect.",
        "And as for a unilateral military action, as I mentioned earlier, it's not clear that we have much of an option there.",
        "Is blockade an option to - they're talking about inspecting these cargos coming in and out, as I understand it.",
        "As you pointed out, you can fly plutonium out and - well, you know, we don't search ships so well coming into this country.",
        "That's right.",
        "I think Proliferation Security Initiative, which gives us - for the countries that have signed up to it - gives us the right to stop ships and inspect their cargos - could play some role.",
        "Makes it harder for them to export bulky things like missiles and so forth.",
        "And having that reinforced by a U.N.",
        "resolution would help, but it wouldn't solve the problem of smuggling out plutonium.",
        "Ken, thank you."

        "Good of you to be with us today.",
        "Hello, Neal.",
        "And many analysts say - and we heard again today - if you want to exert pressure on Kim Jong Il, China holds the keys.",
        "Well, to some extent.",
        "Certainly China has the largest amount of trade and energy supplies to North Korea over the last few years.",
        "But China is facing a dilemma here.",
        "If China cuts off food and energy supplies, I don't think China would think that it would stop Kim Jong Il from developing nuclear weapons.",
        "But in the meantime, China has to face a lot of problems: refugee flows and maybe internal strife or, you know, like civil war.",
        "So that is not an ideal situation for China.",
        "So what China has been proposing to do is - certainly the U.N.",
        "Security Counsel must adopt certain punitive actions, but they must be selective and appropriate, as the Chinese ambassador puts it, but certainly not in terms of humanitarian and food aid.",
        "China was, of course, Korea's ally in the war against - well, the United Nations and the United States in the early 1950s - yet, it's been a long time since China really… Well, let me ask you.",
        "Does China still regard North Korea as an ally?",
        "No, I don't think China regards North Korea as an ally, in the traditional sense of military alliance.",
        "Because China prefers that it does not form an alliance with other countries.",
        "So, China regards North Korea as a friendly country.",
