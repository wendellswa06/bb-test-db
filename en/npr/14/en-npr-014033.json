        "Well - and they've described this as a press conference, so chances are, we might actually get some questions.",
        "And there are a lot of them because the president hasn't taken many questions in a formal setting recently, not since he fired VA Secretary Shulkin, not since the cloud of controversy has really come up around EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, and not since Stormy Daniels' interview with \"\"60 Minutes.",
        "But it is going to be interesting to see what kind of language the president uses today.",
        "The Baltic countries are going to be looking for strong words suggesting that he's going to take a harder line on Russia because that is their central fear, and it's the central tenet of NATO, which is holding back Russian aggression.",
        "It has been for generations.",
        "Indeed.",
        "Should be interesting.",

        "Yeah.",
        "They own more local TV stations than any other company in the country.",
        "And recently, Sinclair ordered their local news anchors to narrate these commentaries that accused others in the press of publishing fake stories without checking facts.",
        "David Folkenflik reports on media for NPR News, has covered Sinclair for years.",
        "He's on the line from New York.",

        "Good morning, guys.",
        "Can I just ask what's so bad about this commentary, which says that it's really bad for news organizations to report incorrect stories?",
        "There's nothing bad in that, per se, and I think it's a point of pride to Sinclair to say, look, we're fact-based; we want to get the story without fear or favor, effectively.",
        "But they also want to do essentially what feels like negative campaigning.",
        "They talk about claims of bias in the media, how fake stories not only get circulated on social media but by some of the media.",
        "They talk about personal agendas from journalism.",
        "And it all echoes language from President Trump, just as we were just talking about in a different circumstance.",
        "You know, there's a new study out just this week from Emory University - a couple scholars who suggest that the local news has gotten more national and more conservative, and attributes that largely to the growth of Sinclair itself in recent years - to their increasing a hold on the number of stations they have and the number of markets they have across the country.",
        "So you have all these anchors.",
        "They read, word-for-word, essentially the same message.",
        "And it's not criticizing any specific story or any specific mistake by any specific news organization.",
        "It's just generically saying, don't trust the media.",
        "That's what's distinctive here, I guess.",
        "Yeah, there's no reporting behind it.",
        "This was seen as a corporate message of journalistic responsibility.",
        "At the tail end, they said, if you take issue with our coverage, you know, click a button and tell us why.",
        "But it really seemed as though they were building themselves up by tearing stuff down at other places.",
        "You know, it's a page out of the Fox News songbook.",
        "So if Sinclair is distributing this message that is seen as favorable to President Trump, does Sinclair as a company want anything from President Trump's administration?",
        "Oh, funny you should ask.",
        "And Trump, of course, yesterday tweeted very much in support of Sinclair as controversy built throughout the day.",
        "But what they want is something very tangible.",
        "You know, they've gotten good access at the White House.",
        "They've gotten sort of warm feelings.",
        "Their chief political analyst is a former Trump advisor named Boris Epshteyn, who's shown no ability to analyze separate from the White House line.",
        "But what they really want is something from anti-trust lawyers down in Washington.",
        "And that is the tension.",
        "Local conservatives distance themselves from these outside extremist groups moving in, but northwest Montana has been trending more to the far right in recent elections, especially as several of this area's timber mills and manufacturing plants closed down.",
        "On rural highways, bumper stickers mocking President Obama are common; so are the billboards listing the Ten Commandments.",
        "Instead of the usual classic rock or country, the radio is now dominated by Christian and conservative stations.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "The FCC chairman handpicked by Trump and elevated, Ajit Pai, essentially swept away a raft of rules to make sure that it would be a lot easier for Sinclair to continue to grow.",
        "It already owns or controls more than 190 stations.",
        "It's now in the process of trying to acquire more than 30 more from Tribune Media.",
        "The FCC's chairman is now actually under investigation by the agency's own inspector general for his actions in relations with Sinclair in that move.",
        "They very much want this approval, even at a time at which President Trump has been against greater media consolidation, with Time Warner, CNN's parent, being proposed to be acquired by AT&T and questions they've raised about Comcast, which is the parent company of NBC."

        "OK, so we should just note, Sinclair has been conservative.",

        "Mr. Lubinda is the minister of information, broadcasting and tourism of Zambia; nearly 50 years old, and just a tad podgy, judging from photographs.",
        "On New Year's Eve, an Australian traveler named Erin Langworthy made a bungee cord jump off of a bridge at Victoria Falls along the Zambezi River, and the cord snapped, for the first and only time in 17 years and over 150,000 jumps, officials say.",
        "Ms. Langworthy fell almost 400 feet into the river rapids - which, by the way, abound with crocodiles - and managed to swim safely to a rocky shore, despite breaking her collarbone and being bound at the ankles by the busted bungee.",
        "She is now recovering and giving interviews at a hospital in South Africa.",
        "The video of her jump, splash, and dauntless swim has been seen all over the world.",
        "The company that runs the jumps says they have removed all bungee cords produced from the same batch of rubber as the cord that snapped, run tests, and it's perfectly safe to resume jumping off that high bridge over a crocodile-infested river.",
        "A lot of people might say, oh really?",
        "Thanks, but I think I'll just watch the butterflies.",
        "Maybe we'll go to the Bowling Hall of Fame in St. Louis.",
        "A ten-pounder might fall on your toe there, but you won't wind up as snack cakes for a crocodile.",
        "Tourism attracts about 800,000 people to the Zambian side of Victoria Falls each year.",
        "They spend money on food, lodging, snow-globes, whitewater rafting, hippo-watching, and bungee jumping.",
        "The government doesn't want that number falling off - perhaps that's a poor choice of words.",
        "So, Minister Lubinda came to the bridge this week and took a bungee nosedive over the Zambezi.",
        "Let everyone come and do it, he said.",
        "I am hoping that all those who watched a middle-aged person jumping down the bridge and coming back up smiling will be encouraged not just to jump but also to come and visit Zambia.",
        "Now, there's something truly winning about a politician who is willing to jump off a bridge to demonstrate his sincerity.",
        "Imagine how it might winnow the field to include a bridge jump in U.S.",
        "presidential candidate debates; it certainly would leave more time for follow-up questions.",
        "Imagine, for that matter, how our own most devout convictions about work, family, love, caring for others or fixing the economy might plunge off a cliff if first we had to live by the advice we so freely give others.",
        "It's refreshing to see anyone not just talk the talk or walk the walk - but jump.",

        "Here's something you may not know about the White House - it's always been considered the president's home, not a museum.",

        "The White House has been done over lots of times.",

        "Few artists painted it and I can sort of understand it 'cause it's a really hard building to paint decently.",
        "Compared with how many artists have painted Mount Vernon and how many images there are of Mount Vernon, there's very few of the White House.",
        "But, Waddell says, the interiors were even more complicated to paint.",
