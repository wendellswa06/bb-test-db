        "Well, I mean, I, it, I've been doing radio documentaries for NPR for close to 20 years now, and, I mean, I guess, one of the big reasons why this thing started was that documentary I did a bunch of years ago, about 15 years ago, with two kids growing up in housing projects in Chicago - it was called Ghetto life 101 - where I worked with these two young people and gave them tape recorders and had them record stories, record a week in their lives.",
        "And part of what they did was interview family members with these tape recorders, and I saw that - for instance, when one kid would, you know, lay in bed with his grandmother and interview her, that having that microphone gave him the license to ask questions that he'd never asked before.",
        "And the conversation continued once the tape recorder was turned off.",
        "And then as the years passed, when his grandmother died, when other people in the documentary died, these tapes were the only record that these young kids had left of their loved ones voices, and became incredibly important to them.",
        "So that was a big influence on starting the project.",
        "I mean, you talked about the WPA interviews, and that was, you know, I'd been going to the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress for many, many years, listening to these interviews that were done in the ‘30s and early ‘40s.",
        "And, you know, they're incredibly beautifully recorded interviews done by - not done by, you know, the StoryCorps is everyday people interviewing a loved one or a friend or someone they're interested in.",
        "These are folklorists and historians, you know, traveling the country, but talking to everyday people in these beautifully recorded interviews that just kind of bring you back - when you listen to these things - to the 1930s and ‘40s, whether it's a fishmonger selling his wares on a street corner in Harlem, or, you know, guys in a pool parlor in Washington, D.C., talking - you know, a couple of days after Pearl Harbor - talking about what that was like.",
        "So those, you know, I'd listen to these recordings and think, you know, God, this is amazing.",
        "These voices are so powerful, and they really, you know, there's something about the voice.",
        "It's almost like the soul is contained in the voice, and there's something so powerful about hearing these voices, and I - you know, so I thought, wouldn't it be great to do something, you know, along these lines again.",
        "So that's some of how StoryCorps came to be.",
        "And, of course, we walk in the, you know, Studs Terkel is a huge influence, and, you know, this project kind of walks in his, you know, large shoes.",
        "We were lucky enough to have him cut the ribbon for us at our, at the opening of our Grand Central booth.",
        "And we have one of our mobile booths is actually named after him, so he's been a big influence, so.",
        "Well, in a way, we all walk in Studs Terkel's shoes ...",
        "Absolutely.",
        "...if we're lucky.",
        "If you'd like to join the conversation, if there was somebody you're close to who you'd like to interview, who would it be?",
        "What would you ask them about?",
        "And if you've been through the StoryCorps experience, give us a call: 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK.",
        "Our e-mail address is talk@npr.org.",
        "And let's get Peter on the line, Peter calling from San Francisco.",
        "Hi.",

        "So it was mailed to me with a microphone and some tapes, and I had two very good friends over for dinner, and we did the interviews, and it was just a lot of fun.",

        "But what we're doing this year is launching a couple of new tiers of service.",
        "One is called an outpost, where we're gonna work with libraries and museums across the country and take a quiet room and turn it into a StoryCorps room, so it'll be available in local communities across the country.",
        "And we're also starting something called door-to-door, which is kind of similar to what the gentleman was talking about, but includes a facilitator, where we'll send portable recording gear and a facilitator to - into a family reunion or a church or wherever, to record a day of interviews.",
        "And then we also have a limited number of these kits, which we Federal Express out, and people can record an interview and then send them back to us.",
        "Peter, after you finished the experience, I assume you mailed the tapes in, yes?",
        "We did, uh huh.",
        "And how did you feel afterwards?",
        "I mean, did you feel like this was an important thing to do?",

        "But, you know, it was so interesting to get really - my friends really opened up about their experiences, as a child.",

        "And we also encourage people, if they can't get to a booth, to kind of do this themselves and get a group of people together and buy a tape recorder and pass it around a do StoryCorps.",
