        "They tend to wear out or lose quality over time.",
        "So, if you could comment on this, it would be helpful.",

        "And that is basically to wear headphones and to keep the mike pretty close to the mouth.",
        "Don't put a mike down on a table.",
        "Hold it and keep it, you know, a spread-out hands length away from the mouth of the person you are talking to.",
        "And if you do that, no matter what equipment you're using, whether it's a cassette recorder or, you know, a digital tape recorder, a DAT or a minidisk, you're going to get a good recording.",
        "As far as CDs wearing out, you know, I think the trick would be to make sure that you transfer them to other medium.",
        "So if you have a CD, then you can transfer onto a hard drive and make sure that you update that hard drive, you know, over the years.",
        "But I don't know about the life of CDs.",
