        "She and her husband couldn't afford to go any longer without her paycheck, and even if they could, her boss was under no legal obligation to say yes to more time.",
        "And while this is one of the happiest times in Tricia's life, she also feels bad.",

        "But I can spend those two weeks bonding and learning how to take care of him, or I can spend those two weeks trying to learn to breast-feed.",
        "And while it comes easy for a lot of women, it can be extremely difficult for a lot of women.",
        "And while I could, you know, breast-feed and then when I go back to work, I could pump, my office is actually glass, so there's not really a place that you can pump that's not extremely visible (laughter) from the street.",
        "Again, there was other reasons that made me decide to do bottle, and I'm super happy with it.",

        "A picture especially rich in detail is called \"\"The Splendid Mrs. Madison.\"\" It shows a party, maybe around 1810, given in what was then called the Elliptical Salon; a round room in the middle of the main floor.",
