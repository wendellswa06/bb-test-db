        "Well, Idaho has been.",
        "The northern panhandle of Idaho has been.",
        "It was made very infamous by a group called Aryan Nations, which for a time was the best known neo-Nazi group in the United States.",
        "The reality is that that group was destroyed by a civil lawsuit that we - the Southern Poverty Law Center brought in the year 2000.",
        "They were bankrupted; they were forced to sell their compound, which had been a very important gathering point for various factions of the radical right every year.",
        "It's something called the Aryan Nations World Congress.",
        "You know, I think it's worth mentioning though that, you know, we see this kind of subculture everywhere, including Portland, Oregon.",
        "In furtherance of the plot, and that of course is the critical element if they're going to be charged with conspiracy which they have not been charged with yet.",
        "You know, they did things like they got a map, they prepared a map of a federally licensed gun store that they intended to rob in order to get weapons for this attack, they also tried to carry out a home invasion also to cease weapons and money from you know, just a random family, they ultimately were frightened away by a dog, of all things.",
        "But you know, they had enlisted a friend, a young woman, whose mother ultimately tipped the police to this whole business, the whole plot and that's how the ATF got to them.",
        "So there were those acts and a few others, as well, acquiring weapons and so on.",
        "So you know, I think were the feds to bring conspiracy charges that - those are the things they would cite.",
        "And I wonder, when we say skinhead, what does that mean and what does it mean in the context of white supremacist groups?",
        "Well, first of all we should differentiate between racist skinheads and skinheads.",
        "Skinheads originally were not racist at all; as a matter of fact that was a multicultural movement, very steeped in Caribbean black music back in the '60s in England when it began.",
        "You know, when we talk about racist skinheads in America, we're talking about essentially a neo-Nazi subculture of people who typically do shave their heads, who do typically wear these Doc Martens boots, this tall black skinhead boots and a number of other things, braces and they have kind of outfits they wear.",
        "But, you know, what we're really talking about is a very, very violent subculture.",
        "By braces, you mean suspenders?",
        "I mean a kind of suspenders, that's right.",
        "Typically thin red or black suspenders.",
        "You know, and often there's the color shoe laces that these people wear indicates, you know, are they racist skinhead, are they an anti-racist skinhead and so on.",
        "But, you know, what the people've heard about in the country at large of course, is racist skinheads.",
        "Because they have been so associated with criminal violence with, you know, murdering police officers and all kinds of things.",
        "These two people - one in particular, Daniel Cowart, one of the two arrestees we know to have been members of the group, the racist skinhead group, formed earlier this year called Supreme White Alliance.",
        "This was based out of Kentucky.",
        "And in fact, we have a photograph that shows Cowart with the leaders or some of the leaders of SWA, the Supreme White Alliance, celebrating Hitler's birthday in April of this year.",
        "Yeah, which might be a tip-off, but was the organization in any way involved?",
        "Well, there's nothing to suggest that's true.",
        "And I would say as a general matter, it is extremely unusual these days for an organization to plan and carry out a criminal act - mainly for the reason that they are so likely to get caught.",
        "So what we really see out there in terms of violence from the radical right is by and large what we would call lone wolves, people operating on their own or with just one or two partners, as opposed to, you know, being some kind of organizational plan.",
        "The leaders of some of these white supremacist groups say, look, they're - we're nonviolent that these groups are tantamount to social clubs.",
        "Is there any truth to that?"

        "Edwards has at least nominally resigned basically because he got a lot of bad press over this alleged assassination plot.",
        "But, you know, I mean Steven Edwards is the son of Ron Edwards, who is the imperial wizard of the imperial clans of America, second largest clan group in America also based in Kentucky.",
        "And the fact this is that this group is rife with criminal violence, they are also very into weapons.",
        "There was a special done on National Geographic very recently in which a lot of photographs or film shown of them, you know, shooting up the place.",
        "Steve Edwards is also a singer in a band.",

        "Email us talk@npr.org.",
        "And Judy is on the line, Judy calling us from Portland, Oregon.",
        "Hi there.",
        "I am just amazed in this day and age that people really think this way.",
        "I mean, and the fact that is that he isn't, you know, all black.",
        "He's half white.",
        "I don't understand why they don't even see that part of it.",
        "They're so ignorant.",
        "Judy.",
        "I'm just - I'm shaking.",
        "I'm just - I heard this the other day, I'm going, hello.",
        "Let's put these guys in prison and castrate them so they can't keep bombing, I mean.",
        "Watch the castration language, you know, that's and the thought, too for that matter.",
        "But nevertheless, are you aware of such groups?",
        "Well, you know, in Portland, Oregon, we're close enough to Idaho that you do hear about the white supremacist from time to time, and there was an incident back in the, I think it's the 70s where an Ethiopian guy was killed by some skinhead.",
        "Quite some time ago, though.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But, you know, you do every once in a while you see the graffiti.",
        "And I grew up overseas.",
        "I grew up in Japan, I'm blond hair and blue eyes.",
        "So I know what it's like to stand out in a positive, as well as the negative way for you feel like you're an outsider."

        "Bye-bye.",

        "Yes.",
        "Idaho, is it a haven for white supremacists?",
        "As the caller, Judy, mentioned that there was an important case.",
        "It was much more recent - it was in the late '80s - in which an Ethiopian student was murdered, a man named Mulugeta Seraw, by partisans of something called White Aryan Resistance.",
        "And that ultimately resulted in lawsuits by us, as well, that had the effect of destroying White Aryan Resistance.",
        "But, I mean, the point really is that these groups are scattered around the country in very many places.",
        "And they're certainly not limited to Idaho or the Pacific Northwest - I mean, we see them in the South, we see them up and down the coast and throughout the Midwest as well.",
        "Our listeners may remember allegations of another anti-Obama plot in Denver, at the Democratic National Convention.",
        "Do we know more about that one, though?",
        "Yeah.",
        "That one really wasn't much of a plot.",
        "I mean as it turned out, these guys were couple - three men arrested and a woman.",
        "And it turned out that they were very high on methamphetamines.",
        "When they were arrested, they were found with a number of weapons including two snipes - two scoped sniper rifles.",
        "But also 44 grams of methamphetamine, which is quite a bit of a very powerful drug.",
        "Then initially the federal authorities said that they had planned to try to shoot Obama from a high vantage point, in other words, from on top of a building or something like that."
