        "As Helicobacter is declining, ulcers are going away, stomach cancer is going away, and diseases of the esophagus, like reflux, esophagitis is rising and so is asthma.",
        "Can you create a one-on-one comparison or link between the two?",
        "Well, we have been interested in this trend for a number of years and showed about 10 years ago, this - an inverse relationship between Helicobacter and GERD or reflux and some of its consequences.",

        "We thought if Helicobacter could be protecting against GERD, it could be protecting against asthma.",

        "And Dr. Chan found more than 7,000 records of people who had information on Helicobacter status and asthma status.",
        "And we found that people who had Helicobacter were less likely to have asthma than people without.",
        "But it wasn't just asthma.",
        "It was also hay fever, and it was eczema and skin sensitization, all of these allergic manifestations that run together.",
        "We were very excited about this result because we had an earlier result in New York that showed almost the same findings.",
        "So, more recently, we did the study that was just published this week looking at NHANES IV, now, almost 10 years later.",
        "And in particular, our first two studies suggested that if Helicobacter had some protective role, it was in childhood onset asthma, the asthma that occurs very early in life and not an adult asthma.",
        "And NHANES IV was weighted toward more children.",
        "And we also found more than 7,000 records of people who we could study.",
        "And we found again the same inverse association between Helicobacter and childhood asthma very specifically."
