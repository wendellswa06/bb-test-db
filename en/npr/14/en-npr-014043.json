        "If I tell you today that every time you take an antibiotic, you're chipping away at your microbiome and the microbiome that you transmit to other people, and that all these 50 or 60 years of antibiotics are actually changing our microbial composition that's about as far-fetched as the other thing was.",
        "Yet, we do what we do and we must learn to understand it if then, as you say, if we're going to be treating illnesses.",
        "Right.",
        "Our hypothesis is that every time somebody takes an antibiotic, say for throat infection or an ear infection, it's having an effect on the microbiota.",
