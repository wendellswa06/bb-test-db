        "The Jordanians, they've been very careful not to align any of these radical elements to actually use their borders or even approach their borders.",
        "And so Turkey has been less careful",
        "But Ozel says Turkey also has a legitimate beef with the Americans, who in his words, washed their hands of Iraq and allowed Iran to install a sectarian Shiite, Nouri al-Maliki, as Iraq's leader with predictably disastrous results.",
        "At the moment, however, the most urgent question is whether Iraq will remain a single country or fragment into warring sectarian strongholds.",
        "Turkey's response to this possibility is startling because it involves embracing one of its long-standing foes - the Kurds.",
        "Turkey long opposed any Kurdish move on the disputed Iraqi city of Kirkuk, for example, not wanting to inflame separatist passions among its own Kurdish minority.",

        "And that suggests that Turkey sees that this is the path to gradual Kurdish secession and is not uncomfortable with those steps.",
        "Salman Shaikh, director of the Doha Brooking Center, says as the diplomatic struggle begins to cobble together a unity government in Iraq in hopes of ending the marriage of convenience between ISIS and marginalized Sunni tribes, the Kurds are well-positioned to benefit.",
        "The Kurds have been patient, and I think they're cleverly going along with the effort to build a national coalition, perhaps knowing that it may not succeed and that they would be ready, in that case.",
        "And, of course, they're the only ones who've got the security forces in order to try and protect themselves.",
        "To some extent, Turkish policy toward Iraqi Kurds was already shifting as Turkey received and shipped Kurdish oil over Baghdad's strong objections.",
        "But with the explosion of Sunni violence, Soner Cagaptay says there's now a new security element to the relationship.",
        "The Turks are now looking at the Kurds of Iraq and of Syria as a very significant cordon sanitaire that would shield Turkey away from Iraq's instability, civil war.",
        "And I think Turkey now looks at the Iraqi Kurds and the Turkey Kurds as a valuable asset."
