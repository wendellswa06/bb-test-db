        "And next day when we'd pull out to go to a different port, we'd get all around the roadblocks by going out to sea.",
        "Jim Albright, how would you describe the relationship between the guards and the inmates while you were there?",
        "I'd say for the circumstances, it was pretty good because I wasn't there to harass them.",
        "I was just there to make sure they didn't escape.",
        "Well, while you were a guard on Alcatraz, there was the famous 1962 escape from Alcatraz, where three inmates made a boat out of raincoats and attempted to sail off into the night.",

        "Tell us about that night, and what had happened.",
        "Well, that was Frank Morris, and John and Clarence Anglin.",
        "The alarm woke me up.",
        "And I had been over town playing ball the night before, and I twisted my knee.",
        "And I had crutches, and so I was out crutching up the hill, and I wanted to see what was going on.",
        "And I stepped up to the cell, and the dummy head was so real that at high noon, I thought I had the wrong cell and moved over to the next cell.",
        "The dummy head is, of course, the heads that the inmates made out of wax and soap and a homemade paint; that they put inside the beds so that the guards and officers would think that they were sleeping that night, when they were actually crawling up the drainpipes and out onto the roof, and out into the water.",
        "What went through your head when you realized that these three inmates had escaped?",
        "Well, of course, our first job was to search, and try and find them.",
        "Robert, do you remember?"

        "But the regime - it seems to us the regime liked to send a message to towns and cities in Hama countryside, that once they are liberated there will be a very severe punishment.",
        "Alhamadee said families were already leaving the area because of the fighting, but now he expects a much larger flight.",
        "But in this case after this horrific massacre in Halfaya, we expect that the number of people who are going to refugee camps in Turkey will go more - will go higher and higher.",

        "But many Syrians have said they're not sure the rebels can win this fight, and they worry about what the opposition might turn into if it did win.",
        "That's why Brahimi's efforts still engender hope, however faint it may be.",

        "They could be a duo, a trio, quartet, quintet, sextet - doesn't matter.",
        "But they're generally performing crossover pop material to a largely teen or preteen female demographic.",
        "So there's a few things that really distinctive a boy band from what you might call a man band.",
        "Boy bands are usually factory produced, meaning that there's usually some kind of CEO or talent manager who's a Svengali, who's involved.",
        "He's responsible for the sound and the look and the casting of the band.",
        "The band often has interchangeable members so there's a lot of turnover.",
        "Very often boy bands, as opposed to man bands, are performing a kind of bubblegum pop music, which reaches a large demographic - not a lot of musical complexity, very simplistic messages.",
        "And very often the big difference is that boy bands don't play their own instruments and they rarely write their own songs.",
