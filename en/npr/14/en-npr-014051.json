        "That there's someone else's manipulating the whole thing to produce a specific effect in young girls as their audience.",
        "Right, but not all boy bands, then, have to sound the same to achieve that effect.",
        "Exactly, I think when we talk about boy bands, there's a great diversity to the range of sounds that's associated with boy bands.",
