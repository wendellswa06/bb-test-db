        "So more than a decade ago when some scientists said the toads needed federal protection because there were only a few dozen left, Spicer decided he needed to do something.",
        "Of course, you need to defend yourself against such actions like that, because that's not a good thing to have happen, you know?",
        "Spicer feared the government would tell him he couldn't raise cattle or ride off-road vehicles on his own property.",
        "So he helped start a group called STORM-OV.",
        "It stands for Saving Toads thru Off-Road Racing, Ranching and Mining in Oasis Valley.",

        "We want to keep it in our hands, where it's at a local level, where we can do things and be nimble.",
        "You know, you start to get restricted by bureaucracy and monstrous, litigious things that go on in the Endangered Species Act, and we're definitely not going to have any fun on our own ranches anymore.",
        "The group has persuaded landowners to make their properties toad-friendly.",
        "And they've worked to get rid of invasive species that threaten the toad, like bullfrogs and crawdads, or plants like tamarisk and cattail that clog the springs where toads live.",
