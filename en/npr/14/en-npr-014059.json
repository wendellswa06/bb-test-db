        "To some extent, Turkish policy toward Iraqi Kurds was already shifting as Turkey received and shipped Kurdish oil over Baghdad's strong objections.",
        "But with the explosion of Sunni violence, Soner Cagaptay says there's now a new security element to the relationship.",
        "The Turks are now looking at the Kurds of Iraq and of Syria as a very significant cordon sanitaire that would shield Turkey away from Iraq's instability, civil war.",
        "And I think Turkey now looks at the Iraqi Kurds and the Turkey Kurds as a valuable asset.",
        "But Turkey's policy shift, which at a time, seemed improvised and reactive, is still missing a major piece, Turkey's own Kurdish minority.",
        "The government is now hastily trying to push Kurdish reforms through parliament as Turkey's long-suffering Kurds begin to see themselves as a crucial block in upcoming presidential elections and perhaps beyond.",
