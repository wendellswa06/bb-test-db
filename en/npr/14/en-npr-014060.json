        "A half-century ago, autopsies were an integral part of American health care, performed on roughly half of all patients who died in hospitals.",
        "But as ProPublica's Habiba Nosheen reports, today, autopsies are only conducted in roughly 5 percent of patients.",
        "And experts say that's a troubling trend.",

        "Not knowing, to me, has always been worse than knowing the truth, and we know the truth, which is what happened as a result of the autopsy.",
        "Even though that's still painful, there's a sense of peace.",

        "But they're no longer required to meet a quota.",

        "The people who pay the bills say, well, why would I want to pay money for an autopsy on a patient who's already dead?",
        "I mean, my money is supposed to be spent on people while they're alive.",
        "Health insurance companies don't pay for autopsies because they say they pay for the care for the living patient, not the dead.",
        "Families can opt to pay for an autopsy out of pocket, but that can be expensive.",
        "Besides providing closure to the families, there is another reason why autopsies might be important.",
        "Studies show that doctors make diagnostic errors in about 25 percent of cases.",
        "And without autopsies, the errors remain unknown.",
        "According to Dr. Lundberg, that has broad implication for public health in America."
