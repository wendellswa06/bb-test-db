        "That means ticket prices would have to go up even more, since eventually higher prices are bound to mean fewer ticket sold.",

        "Discount carriers are also cutting back.",
        "Jet Blue says it will postpone the purchase of 21 new jets.",

        "Swearinga says they can also charge more for the flights they do offer.",
        "If you're offering fewer seats, you don't need to discount as much to fill those seats."
