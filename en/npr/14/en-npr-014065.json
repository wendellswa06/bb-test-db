        "But Jean Yves Camus, an academic who studies the far right, says agreeing with ideas and voting for a candidate are two different things.",
        "That's a big difference between the extreme right in Europe and, I would say, what is an acceptable arch conservative right in the United States is.",
        "In Europe the extreme right is dependent on the fascist legacy.",
        "Just recently, Marine Le Pen sparked a storm of protest when she compared Muslims who pray in the streets outside of mosques in France to the Nazi occupation during World War II.",
        "She made no apologies for her remarks.",
        "(Through translator) There are some good polemics - like those that push the real issues the French are interested in to the forefront.",
        "No one wants to talk about these things, but I'm ready to kick the anthill, stir things up and make the political class confront these issues.",
        "For NPR News, I'm Eleanor Beardsley in Paris.",
        "There's drama unfolding in the world of book publishing.",
        "A top literary firm representing authors like Salman Rushdie and Martin Amis has announced it will produce e-books of some of its authors' older titles itself, bypassing traditional publishers.",
        "The Wylie Agency has made a deal for electronic versions of books, like \"\"Midnight's Children\"\" and \"\"Lolita,\"\" to be sold exclusively by Amazon for its Kindle device and applications.",
        "That has publishers like Random House on the defensive.",
        "Lynn Neary follows the publishing industry for NPR.",
        "Good morning, Lynn.",
        "Good morning.",
        "So, let's start with some more specifics.",
        "What is the Wylie Agency doing here?",
        "OK, the Wylie Agency - which is a major literary agency, very well-known - it is setting up its own publishing arm, called Odyssey Editions.",
        "And it's going to be publishing what's known as the backlist, backlist titles, titles like \"\"The Invisible Man,\"\" \"\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,\"\" books published before digital books existed.",
        "They're very, very important to any publishing company's bottom line, because these are best-sellers."

        "What about the publishers?",
        "How are they reacting?",
        "The McMillan Publishing Company's CEO responded right away to this also, and he picked up on the fact that Wylie had signed an exclusive deal with Amazon.",
        "In other words, the only place you're going to be able to buy these books is on Amazon, which is just driving everybody in the publishing industry crazy that Amazon is taking such a huge chunk of the market now.",
        "Clearly, this has a lot to do with royalties, fewer people getting a piece of the pie, right?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "That, in addition to the rights, that's the next really big question that this whole move that Wylie is making has raised.",
        "And that is the question of royalties because the publishers not only are saying well, we have the right to the book; they're also saying, we have the right to say how much royalty we will give an author.",
        "And the number that you usually hear is that the big publishing houses are offering about 25 percent royalties for e-books.",
        "Well, authors and agents think it should be more like 50 percent.",
        "So, obviously, that's one of the issues that this move by Wylie is raising.",
        "So why is Wylie Agency making this move now?",
        "Is it no more complicated than the fact that e-books are catching on and selling like crazy?",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I think that there have been a number of really significant markers, the most recent being that Amazon just announced last week that it had sold more electronic books than hard covers in the last three months.",
        "That was seen as a pretty big milestone.",
        "Also, the American Publishing Association has announced that the sales of e-books have increased from 3 percent of the market a year ago, to 8 and a half percent.",
        "So that's 5 and a half percent increase of sales of e-books in one year.",
        "So what are the larger implications for the publishing industry?",
        "There's huge implications here for the publishing industry because, basically, what Wiley has said is - to the big publishing houses - we do not need you to publish e-books.",
        "They're talking now about the backlist, but that could apply to new books as well, couldn't it?",
        "What you need the publishing houses for is to put books on shelves.",
        "If you don't need books on shelves, you don't need the publishing houses.",
        "So everybody's trying to figure out, how many books do we need on the shelves?",
        "How many are going to be e-books?",
        "And if it's going to be mostly e-books at some point in the future, what's the future of the publishing companies?",

        "But there's also potential for more enforcement.",
        "But would the tax really be fair?",
        "Economists generally regard sales taxes as regressive, since the poor spend a greater proportion of their income than the wealthy.",
        "But Kotlikoff says under this plan, all families would receive a monthly subsidy to offset the tax on bare necessities, so low-income families would end up paying no taxes at all.",
        "The wealthy, who buy and spend a lot, would pay a lot.",
        "The nonpartisan Web site FactCheck.org analyzed the plan and concluded that the poor probably would do better, thanks to that subsidy.",

        "Former Wall Street Journal reporter Brooks Jackson is now director of FactCheck.org.",
        "But you would need two other bureaucracies, and they could be huge - one to enforce the sales tax.",
        "You'd also need a bureaucracy to administer the biggest welfare system ever devised to make up for the effects of this tax on low-income people.",
        "Maybe so.",

        "Specifically, they're upset that protection for transgender people was dropped from a bill prior to a committee vote.",
        "Now, it just covers gays and lesbians.",
        "That change was recommended by Congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the only openly gay man in the House.",
        "The only openly gay woman in the House, Representative Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, is pushing back.",
        "She plans to offer a separate amendment to protect the transgendered at some point.",
        "When I spoke with Tammy Baldwin earlier today, she wanted to clarify that the term transgender doesn't appear in her legislation, only the term gender identity.",
        "Gender identity means that gender-related identity, appearance or mannerisms or other gender-related characteristics of an individual with or without regard to city individuals' designated sex at birth.",
        "So we're probably talking here about a range of people from those who feel as though they are a gender that is not their birth sex, two people who feel completely compatible with their birth sex but appear, perhaps, as a man somewhat effeminate or a woman somewhat masculine.",
        "What's at stake when you think about this, though, and the people that it might protect?",
        "What's at stake for them?",
        "Well, we get back to this original notion of discrimination and with regard to how important that is to have a fully inclusive bill.",
        "I think that over the years, we have gone from having a gay rights movement to having a movement that binds together the sort of common cause of groups that are discriminated against for reasons wholly unrelated to their job performance.",
        "And because of that criminality, I think there's been a commitment that we are going to strive together to win full, equal rights - not special rights, but equal rights.",
        "Congresswoman, I just heard you use the phrase strive together.",
        "You and Barney Frank were striving together for sometime, but you worked a long time on this bill.",
        "But did he consult with you before he decided to remove the gender-identity provision because you're not on the same page anymore?",
        "We disagree only on process and strategy, not on our ultimate goals in this timely a manner as possible, and we've had what was first a private disagreement over strategy and process.",
        "Now, it's a little bit more of a public disagreement.",
        "But ultimately, we all work towards the day, where we can add to our nation's non-discrimination laws and employment protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity."
