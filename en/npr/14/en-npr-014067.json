        "When I started in this business in the mid-'90s, I think it was in our wildest imagination that we'd have an International Criminal Court that is actually functioning and covered this many countries.",
        "It may seem early to take stock of the court, no trials have been completed and there are plenty of outstanding arrest warrants, including one for Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir, and for Ugandan guerilla leader Joseph Koney - the head of the Lord's Resistance Army.",

        "And to now cross into this other area, I think runs the risk of it becoming less effective.",

        "If it's going to be serious in its commitment to mark a change from the previous administration, it needs to ramp up its support and its involvement.",
        "We haven't seen that to the extent that we would like, quite frankly, and Sudan is a case in point.",
        "Reached by phone in Kampala, he complained that the administration has sent mixed signals about the ICC arrest warrant against Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir."
