        "But Devine believes that the current trustees and administration are using Antioch's past difficulties as a smoke screen.",
        "They dramatically revamped the curriculum here and promised to raise money to support it.",

        "We say between 34 and 38 because no one knows for sure because the centers were in turn spawning other centers, which were in turns spawning other centers.",
        "The charge is that energy money and the Antioch brand were squandered in the process.",
        "Ironically, five of those centers serving students completing advanced degrees survive today, and have been subsidizing the Yellow Springs college for the past few years.",
        "To say that the 500 or so alumni gathered here are angry would be an understatement.",
        "Carol Greenwald, the creator of the popular children's show, \"\"Arthur\"\" and four-time Emmy Award winner is one of them.",
        "While receiving an award from the college this year, she asked why the alumni weren't contacted before the closure was announced.",
        "You bump into Antiochians in the weirdest places and when you do you always say, ah, you're from Antioch, right.",
        "You know, oh, yeah.",
        "And when you're there, you talk about the horror stories, but you also talk about the great things.",
        "I do think people have a really strong connection.",
        "And if someone had said to me, Antioch is going to close unless you step up and put your money where your mouth is, I believe I would have done that.",
        "Julia Reichert is an alum, who is a respected documentary filmmaker, a full professor at nearby Wright State University and still teaches part-time in Antioch and lives here in Yellow Springs.",
        "When I first heard the news I was really shocked and devastated like a lot of people, and I was really angry because I think this thing is so poorly handled.",
        "The way that the closing was handled and announced - it was a very last-minute decision.",
        "The decision does not respect the tradition of Antioch and of us, who are grads.",
        "The way that we were not called to come and help.",
        "This is wrong.",
        "The alums gathered here this weekend are drafting a plan to save the Yellow Springs College.",
        "One of them, Chad Johnston, echoed the motto of Antioch's early president Horace Mann, who said be ashamed to die until you've won some victory for humanity.",
        "As community members, we evoke the spirit of Horace Mann when we say be ashamed to let it die.",

        "I served in the last administration, and the word on Indonesia then was that they had been doing a stellar job in finding that right balance between repression, making sure they caught the active hard-line terrorists, and also not exciting more people, in a way, to join the terrorist cause.",
        "But it appears that this might very possibly be the work of a splinter group, disenchanted with the older leadership of the main group that's called Jamia Islamia.",

        "They tend to be very secretive and work in a cell-type arrangement.",
        "When the older leadership are tracked down, it falls to younger people who are motivated to form another cell network.",
        "And so, I think that that probably accounts for the appearance of this group.",
