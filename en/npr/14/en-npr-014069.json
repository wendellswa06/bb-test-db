        "And it's anybody's guess who was behind that, though yesterday in Izmir, bystanders nearby the site of the explosion, they can called in an act of provocation and blamed everybody from Islamic fundamentalists, to Kurdish separatists, to even rouge elements of the Turkish security forces, which gives you a sense of how polarized society is right now.",

        "so far this year, so you might think twisters form pretty easily.",
        "Well, they don't.",
        "NPR's Jon Hamilton learned that it's nearly as hard to start a tornado as it is to stop one.",
        "A few years ago, the artist Ned Kahn was hired to create a seven-story tornado.",
        "He's made a career of exhibits that explore the science and beauty of natural phenomena.",
        "This tornado was for Expo 2000 in Hanover, Germany.",
        "Kahn had made smaller versions for museums, using fans to move the air and vapor to make the vortex visible.",
        "But this project was big.",
        "It cost about $10 million.",
        "So everyone was all excited about this, and we finally fire the thing up and absolutely nothing happens.",
        "There's just a big mess of fog and there's nothing.",
        "And it was one of the profound anticlimaxes of my life.",
        "But not very surprising when you consider how many things have to go just right for a real tornado to start.",
        "Ned Kahn's advisor on the project was John Snow, who's now a meteorologist at the University of Oklahoma in Norman.",
        "Snow says nature doesn't usually succeed the first time, either.",
        "Tornadoes are really rare events.",
        "Only one in a thousand thunderstorms are actually produced as a tornado force.",
        "And maybe only one in a thousand of those turns out to be an extreme form of tornado.",
        "Kahn needed to produce a tornado every time.",
        "So he visited Snow in his lab where there was a tornado simulator."

        "And he basically said, well, you know, these things are so complicated that there's really no way to mathematically predict what this one is going to be like.",
        "Snow says he wasn't sure Kahn could create a reliable tornado machine on such an enormous scale.",
        "I wished him good luck, because I knew that would be a real, real challenge right from the start.",
        "Even a small tornado requires a lair of warm wet air and a massive updraft to get going.",
        "Snow says that in nature, this only happens during certain kinds of thunderstorms.",
        "You can sort of think of them as a big vacuum cleaner moving across the landscape, sucking up this warm, moist air into the updraft.",
        "So for the German exhibit, Kahn decided to build something like a vacuum cleaner, but seven stories high.",
        "He designed a cylindrical building that was open to the sky and added a huge fan.",
        "The fan at the top was a 200-horsepower motor with these beautiful fiberglass cast fan blades.",
        "The whole thing was about 15 feet in diameter, and could move about a million cubic feet of air a minute.",
        "But Snow knew from his lab work that it takes a lot more than rising air to produce a tornado.",
        "You also need to have the right type of spin in the air.",
        "So you have to look at the way the winds are directed - some coming from one direction, some coming from another - to give you that shear.",
        "Tornadoes usually get their shear or spin from colliding weather patterns.",
        "You can't exactly recreate that inside a building.",
        "So Khan came up with a different technique to get the air rotating."

        "The whole building was essentially something like the Guggenheim Museum in New York - kind of a spiral ramp tracing up this basically open cylindrical space.",
        "And all along the underside of this ramp, we mounted smaller turbine blowers, about three feet in diameter.",
        "50 of them.",
        "That added some spin to Kahn's rising column of air.",
        "He had hoped it would create a vortex spiraling upward.",
        "But when the exhibit was completed it produced nothing, which is what often happens in nature.",
        "Snow says that even in perfect conditions, sometimes a tornado starts, sometimes it doesn't.",
        "Again, Tim Searchinger.",
        "He says nations simply need to count all carbon dioxide coming out of tailpipes and smokestacks regardless of the source.",
        "Then if the source of the biofuel was a destructive one, like deforestation, there would be no carbon emissions credit.",
        "But if it was from a good source like plants grown on previously barren land, that would earn a carbon credit.",
        "So there are substantial amounts of bio-energy we can make that do give us greenhouse gas benefits.",
        "What we don't want to do is create a false and perverse incentive simply to go clear the world's forests.",
        "Whether this new accounting scheme would affect the domestic biofuels industry is debatable.",
        "Bob Dinneen, president of the Renewable Fuels Association, says it shouldn't matter.",
        "Some of the points that have been made in the paper today, we agree with.",
        "You should never, under any circumstance, tear down a forest for the growing of a biofuel.",
        "But some scientists argue that the domestic biofuels industry does indirectly lead to deforestation in the tropics by raising the global price of corn, and encouraging farmers in South America to clear land to plant grain.",
        "Jae Edmonds, from the Pacific Northwest National Labs, says if we could place a cash value on preserving forests, that ends up being good for the atmosphere.",
        "You end up not producing quite as much biofuel, but then you don't need as much because you don't have to make up for the deforestation.",
