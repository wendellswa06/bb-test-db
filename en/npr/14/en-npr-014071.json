        "And I'd like to hear from you first about the much-reported tension between the Obama and Clinton camps.",
        "Is it real?",
        "How much tension is there between…",
        "It is real.",
        "This is a convention that is as much about repair as it is about rallying the troops.",
        "You can feel that tension.",
        "You can hear that tension.",
        "You can see that tension on the convention floor, with Hillary Clinton supporters who are showing up with their Hillary Clinton buttons and their Hillary Clinton badges and their Hillary Clinton shirts, even though in some cases, their delegations ask them not to do that.",
        "There's clear tensions between the two camps that are still working out details about what Hillary Clinton will say when she takes the stage, about what message she will deliver to her voters, still tensions about how they're going to work out the roll call vote later in the convention.",
        "And this is something that - it's a real heartburn for the Obama campaign because they need both Hillary Clinton supporters, particularly those women voters that they still having a very hard time reaching.",
        "And it's a concern, to some degree, to Hillary Clinton.",
        "And when you talk to people in her camp, they note that this could affect her legacy, her standing on Capitol Hill, if it appears in any way that she somehow sullied the party here at the convention.",
        "So - and the questions surrounding, say, the roll call, that's not for tonight, that would be for tomorrow night.",
        "The issue is whether Clinton delegates would all vote for Hillary Clinton, or whether what kind of speeches would be made on behalf of Hillary Clinton.",
        "What sorts of things are they dealing with here?",
        "There are several things that they're working out.",
        "One of the questions is how the roll call would take place, whether her name would be entered into nomination, and whether people from a certain number of states would be allowed to vote for her, and then the question of whether it would continue and all the states would be able to cast their ballots, or whether someone - perhaps even Hillary Clinton - would cut off the voting and then Barack Obama would take the nomination by acclamation.",
        "So there are a lot of these little details that are still being worked out, details about whether or not she would deliver a specific message to her voters, telling them that they should cast a ballot for Barack Obama, whether she would tell them to follow their hearts.",
        "It's really amazing that they're still involved in these deep and fractious negotiations.",
        "Here at the convention, you would assume, particularly for a campaign that's been known for its discipline, that these are things that would have been worked out days, if not weeks ago.",
        "Well, tonight's other big event before Hillary Clinton's speech to the convention will be a keynote given by Mark Warner, former governor of Virginia, now a candidate for the open U.S.",
        "Senate seat from Virginia.",
        "You had a chance to talk with him, I gather, today.",
        "What does he say about this big moment?"

        "He hopes to be in the latter category.",
        "But he knows it's going to be tough to meet the very high bar that Barack Obama set.",
        "He said he's going to be talking about what he did in Virginia as governor, turning around the economy, and what he did to reach out to constituencies in Virginia that were firmly in the Republican camp, and how he reached across the aisle and really broadened the reach in the party.",
        "And he's going to be talking about how the Obama campaign could perhaps do the same thing.",

        "She was part of a combat stress platoon.",
        "She's spent more than seven months at Al Asad Airfield in western Iraq, providing mental health care for some 10,000 Marines.",
        "And she's written a memoir of that time titled, \"\"Rule Number Two: Lessons I Learned in a Combat Hospital.",

        "He told me he was afraid his luck was about to run out.",
        "He was ashamed to feel afraid.",
        "I remembered struggling to form the words that would normalize this 19-year-old man's experience.",
        "And using a therapeutic technique that I made up as I went along, I consciously decided to take another path instead.",

        "It was interesting.",
        "I think one of the things I learned about this deployment is that many of the truth that I used to hold as a psychologist sort of flew out the window.",
        "Things that used to make sense for me ended up not making very much sense anymore.",
        "And to be able to share that unknowing feeling with the patient is not something that I typically would have done, would have explored ambiguity, frustration, vulnerability, you know.",
        "It sort of, it's a lot more structured when we're talking about more everyday type situation.",

        "And what these satellites do is they record light radiation that's reflected off the surface of the Earth in different parts of the light spectrum.",
        "And we use false color imaging to try to tease out these very subtle differences on the ground.",
        "So, for example, if, you know, you're walking over, say, a floodplain in Egypt and you just see rice, or you're walking over a modern town and it's obscuring an ancient archeological site, then you just pull back for hundreds of miles using the satellite imagery, and all of a sudden this invisible world becomes visible, and you're actually able to see settlements and tombs, and even things like buried pyramids that you might not otherwise be able to see, just because they affect the soil and geology and vegetation that's above them.",
        "So how many of these pyramids did you actually find, and how big were they?",
        "There were 17 structures that appeared that seemed to have a similar size, shape and orientation as other known pyramids in the area.",
        "Of course, we're not going to be able to say with a hundred percent certainty that they are pyramids until they're excavated.",
        "What kind of shape are these structures in?",
        "I mean, can you tell when you're looking at the satellite images?",
        "Are they simply covered over with sand and they're intact relatively, or could you determine whether or not they've been looted and then maybe buried or reburied even?",
        "Right.",
        "You can theorize as much as you want about what you think you're seeing, but until you get out there and dig, which, of course, is the really fun part, you can't tell exactly what it is.",
        "At a place like Tanis, we were able to partner with a French archaeological team that's been working there for 25, 30 years.",
        "And we visited the site, we visited the team's excavations, and we had before us a structure that matched perfectly, almost perfectly I should say, what the satellite imagery showed.",
        "But for me, what was really exciting and hinted at the future potential of this technology is that if we've confirmed that we've seen, you know, a house, then for the whole plan of Tanis, you know, I think we can say with relative certainty that that plan is going to be accurate."

        "Now, the shorter form, what's known as the certificate of live birth, which is the computer-generated form that's been printed on the Internet.",
        "This is the form that anyone born in Hawaii gets when they request their birth certificate, and it's all they can get when they request it.",
        "That is also legitimate."
