        "investigations have been going on for several years, and there's a belief in the CIA that, to some extent, the inspector general's on somewhat of a witch hunt.",
        "And as for the CIA investigating the CIA's own inspector general, is there precedent for that sort of thing?",
        "Not from anyone we spoke to for the story.",
        "When we heard this - heard about this and discussed this with several people, even a former inspector general said they'd never heard of this before.",

        "But keeping it in house is - seems unprecedented.",
        "Is this a tough investigation that might result in either some censure or some discipline against I.G.?",

        "It's still a little bit unclear exactly what they're going to be doing.",
        "We do believe that there's been some interviews set up of people in the I.G.'s office and what it ultimately would lead to is still a little unclear.",

        "And what about President Obama's approval ratings in these polls?",
        "Well, every since he gave that well-received speech after the Tucson shootings and his approval ratings spiked up over 50 percent, they've been drifting down again and he's now in the mid-40s, which is where he has been for a full year.",
        "When you look at historical comparisons, whether people think the country's on the right track or the wrong track, where consumer confidence is and where his approval ratings are, it looks like he's in the situation of past incumbents who did not go on to win.",

        "They predict the past, and so it's very hard to make predictions especially about the future.",
        "But there are big important things that will affect this election, many of which are beyond the president's control, like the unemployment rate or gas prices.",
        "And I think the most important thing to say about the 2012 election at this point is that it will certainly be much tighter than last time.",
