        "So then it becomes necessary to get at least some members of the minority to come over and join the majority, or in the most-current month of this last Congress, it was necessary to hold together 58 Democrats and two independents and get 60 votes, three-fifths of the Senate, that way.",
        "Now, that's an interesting rule.",
        "You need not just a majority rule, 51 votes, but in fact 60 votes out of 100 to get things moving, but nevertheless, shouldn't that be possible?",
        "It has been possible in the past to proceed to a bill and even pass a bill with a much smaller majority than three-fifths, but the customs and traditions of the Senate, in combination with the rules of the Senate, have brought us to this particular moment.",
        "And I believe it may be a pregnant moment in the history of the Senate, and we may be ready for another change.",
        "We've seen several changes over the full 200-and-some years of the Senate's life.",
        "They've had the right to filibuster all the way back to the first couple of decades.",
        "I believe the first time it was established was in 1806.",
        "There's been this notion that somebody can talk a bill out, as they say in British parliament, that somebody can prevent a bill from ever being passed by just continuously holding the floor the way we saw Jimmy Stewart do in the 1939 movie \"\"Mr.�Smith Goes to Washington."
