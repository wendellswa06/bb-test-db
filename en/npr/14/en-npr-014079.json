        "But that has very rarely actually happened, the talking 24-7, getting a series of senators to hold the floor.",
        "That's actually been quite rare in our history.",
        "It's mostly associated with the work of some Southern senators in the '40s and '50s and '60s in their attempts to hold back the civil rights bills.",
        "Ultimately, they failed.",
        "Ultimately, the Senate lowered the number of votes it took to cut off debate from originally two-thirds to three-fifths.",
        "And then what happened was more and more senators said, hey, three-fifths, that's not that hard to get.",
        "We could threaten a filibuster on this.",
        "We could do a few hours of filibuster on that.",
        "We could bring it down to the level of ordinary use.",
        "So the number of cloture votes filed to shut off a filibuster goes from a few, literally single digits in the years after World War II, to something like 140 in the most-recent Senate.",
        "So effectively, you have to get 60 votes to pass a bill to in favor of mom and apple pie.",
        "Correct.",
        "Well, joining us now is Mickey Edwards.",
        "He is with us here in Studio 3A in Washington.",
        "He served 16 years as a Republican congressman from Oklahoma and has held several leadership positions during that time, and very nice of you to come in today.",
        "Thank you, Neal.",
        "And again, your complaint is not where you served, in the House of Representatives, but in the other house, in the Senate.",
        "Former Rep.",
        "EDWARDS: Oh, there are a few complaints that would be valid, I think, in the House, but we've always thought of the Senate as the lower body, anyway.",
        "Sorry about that, Tom.",
        "Well, in any case, how would you say, Congressman Edwards, that this how did this 60-vote majority become commonplace?"

        "It's not just incrementally a little bit worse.",
        "Over the last decade or two decades, increasingly, there has become this sense of partisan warfare all year long.",
        "You know, instead of winning your election, taking your seat in the House or the Senate and then dealing with the merits of the legislation before you, it seems to be constantly now, how can you win the next election, how can you demonize the other party and holds, filibusters, all those things are just a piece of the action.",
        "I should say holds in the Senate, any member of the Senate has the option to say this bill is not going to come up at all, this presidential appointment is not going to come up at all, I have a hold on this, and that is frozen until such time as the senator releases it.",
        "Former Rep.",
        "EDWARDS: It is, and that's not a constitutional mandate, that's simply a Senate rule, and it can be changed.",
        "Well, it can be changed with 67 votes from United States senators.",
        "Former Rep.",

        "Only requires a majority?",

        "Ron, that's not my understanding.",

        "Former Rep.",
        "EDWARDS: Ah, okay, I yield.",
        "They do require two-thirds to change their own rules, but there is a school of thought, going back to a Supreme Court decision in the 1890s, that if the Senate were to choose to do so, it could change the rule of requiring two-thirds vote to change rules by a simple majority.",
        "So there is a constitutional debate over this and one that I think we might see joined in the months and years to come.",
        "Well, if you think it's so bad, Mickey Edwards, is this the pregnant moment that Ron Elving mentioned earlier?",
        "Former Rep.",
        "EDWARDS: Well, I think it is a moment when the amount of public disturbance over the fact that the Congress is not able to function better than it is does give us opportunities to make change.",
        "I don't think it's a matter of the public being unhappy with the absence of a health care bill or the absence of a jobs bill or any particular piece of legislation.",
        "It's the fact that it doesn't seem that in either house you can get the two parties to sit down together and try to find where their common ground is to make something happen.",
        "Well, some people say, at least in part, this is the result of the changed social atmosphere in Washington because members of the Senate, and the House of Representatives for that matter, spend most weekends back home in their district, not here in Washington, well, palling around with their other friends on the Hill.",
        "Former Rep.",
        "EDWARDS: Well, I think that's part of it.",
        "There has been -members of Congress don't travel together as much as they used to because there was a public reaction against that, and it is hard.",
        "Sometimes you have to say that your job, once you are sworn into office, is to deal seriously with the legislation that has to be dealt with and that you do whatever is necessary to build a relationship within the House, a relationship within the Senate that allows you to proceed and to see somebody else not just as a member of the other party, you know, but as somebody else with the same responsibilities you have."

        "I would love to see term limits imposed on both senators and representatives.",

        "That's total nonsense.",
        "You know, the real problem is that members of Congress operate mostly out of ideology, out of their own partisan viewpoints about what should be done.",
        "Term limits are a terrible idea.",
        "You know, it simply strengthens the executive branch.",
        "And our constitutional system says, you know, that the Congress is supposed to be making the important decisions, and what we need to do is make it where the Congress can function again.",
        "That's where the problem is.",
        "The House and Senate need to be able to work together.",
        "And Ron Elving, if ideology is, as Mickey Edwards suggests, the problem, you're getting more ideological members of the House of Representatives, and indeed the Senate, who are, because of districting, running in districts that are safer for Republicans.",
        "Therefore, their challenge comes from the right wing, if you're a Republican, or from the left wing if you're a Democrat.",
        "That seems to be the case, and if you look around the States, California, for example, they have term limits, and yet they have perhaps the most ideologically riven legislature in the country, arguably.",
        "So I don't think that there's a solution there, but I do think you've put your finger on something with the districting problem.",
        "The parties, generally speaking in the legislatures, draw these maps every 10 years in reaction to the census, to respond to the census.",
        "They have a certain number of congressional seats to distribute among the parts of their state, and they tend to draw the districts safe for Republicans in some parts, safe for the Democrats in other parts.",
        "And that hardens, if you will, the ideological attitude of each one of these members.",
        "They're more afraid, and we see this increasingly in the House, the members are more afraid of a primary.",
        "They're more afraid of somebody running against them in the primary, House or Senate, than they are of someone beating them in November from the other party.",
