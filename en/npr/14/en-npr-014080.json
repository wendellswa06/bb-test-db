        "I'm just glad it's not snowing here.",
        "For a change, or not yet, anyway.",
        "It's supposed to start later today, but I wonder how you respond to the news that Evan Bayh, citing partisanship - and I would have to say most people thought he would win re-election this year, but citing partisanship as one of his principal reasons for deciding to leave the Senate.",
        "Evan and I served as governors for most of the eight years that he served.",
        "I think we were together for six years, and I looked forward to being in the Senate, in no small part, for the chance to serve with him there.",
        "And for folks who used to serve in that role in our own states, you're used to, like, focusing on results, getting things done, and it's hard to get much done these days in the Senate, as you know.",
        "I could introduce a resolution, if we were in session today, that said yesterday was Valentine's Days.",
        "I don't know if I could get 60 votes for it.",
        "And how do you you would propose that you would be open to the idea of changing that filibuster rule.",
        "How are you going to do that?",
        "Well, right now, I don't think we do it.",
        "Someday, the Republicans will have a Republican president.",
        "Someday, they'll be in the majority.",
        "And as we get closer - as they feel that we're getting closer to that eventuality, I think they'll be more interested, on their side, to making sure that whoever's the next Republican president actually can get his or her nominees confirmed.",
        "And whoever's the next Republican president with a Republican majority in the Senate can actually move an agenda and not be hamstrung the way we've been largely hamstrung the last 13 months or so.",
        "Has it been especially frustrating to answer to your constituents who say wait a minute, you guys have overwhelming majorities in both houses of Congress.",
        "You've got the White House.",
        "How come you're not getting these bills signed?",
        "I think people are starting to realize that it 60 is the new 51.",
        "It just takes more votes.",
        "We've had, I want to say, probably 80 or so instances over the last 12 months where we've had to try to break a filibuster in order to get something done.",
        "And when the shoe was on the other foot, when Republicans had the president, and we had the majority in the Senate, we didn't make it easy for them.",
        "But I think our Republican friends have made an art form out of this, and it's you know, one of the reasons why I'm convinced of why the economy is still going along slowly in terms of new jobs, there's so much uncertainty, particularly among the part of big business."

        "So we're going to block everything the other side, the majority, tries to do.",
        "Yeah, ultimately, whoever is the obstructionist, and I'll say this as gently as I can, I think right now it's the Republican folks, but whoever's the obstructionist, what has to happen, whether the obstructionist is seen to be Democrats or Republicans, there has to be some kind of political price to pay for that in terms of what happens in the elections.",
        "As long as Republicans feel like they're going to be rewarded at the ballot box, even though their approval numbers are lower than those of Democrats in the Congress, but as long as they feel that they're going to be rewarded by obstructing things, they'll probably keep it up.",
        "That's human nature.",

        "That was when I believe Democrats were in the majority in the minority, excuse me.",
        "They pushed for a change so that the first time that on a particular issue, it was a nomination or a bill - the first time that the majority leader asked unanimous consent to move to a nomination and move to a bill, and there was objection.",
        "The initially, what they proposed, 15 years ago, I believe, was the first vote to invoke cloture, that is, to overcome the objection, would require 60 votes.",
        "If it weren't successful then, the next one would call maybe 57, the next maybe 54, the next time, finally, we get down to 51, maybe the third or fourth time we try to invoke cloture.",
        "And that's an approach that Senator Harkin, and along with Jeanne Shaheen, former governor of New Hampshire, now senator from New Hampshire, has suggested we revisit.",
