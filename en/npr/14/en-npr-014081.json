        "Hi.",
        "Now, I think that there are - if there is problem that has to be solved, it is a market problem.",
        "And so while I'm a Democrat and I guess I'd be willing to give up the single payer - the single provider plan because it's never going to pass, there are two thoughts that I have about how to provide a market.",
        "And one is to make sure that in every area of the country, that there is more than one insurance company in the market.",
        "And then perhaps - and this is probably blasphemy to somebody - but I consider health insurance to be like - to be a public utility.",
        "And I think it should be controlled like a public utility, as far as price is concerned, with everybody knowing exactly what they're entitled to make as far as investments are concerned.",
        "And while not everybody is - loves every public utility...",
        "So Mike...",
        "...they can afford it.",
        "Mike, in other words, for a concession, the public option, which is dead already, you're willing to give - you're willing to ask for things that are going to be very difficult?",
        "Well...",
        "That's no much of a compromise.",
        "Well, I don't know how - there's - there has to be - if the people who are against the single provider plan wanted - want insurance to continue to be a market, then they have to be willing to compromise and to agree to some control...",
        "I see.",
        "Your compromise is that they have to compromise.",
        "So..."

        "It's something that everybody needs and everybody has a right to.",

        "But I think you might have a tough time running for Congress.",

        "Well, you know, look.",
        "The issue is not whether or not people should give up what their beliefs are about what's good for the country.",
        "You know, the idea - the strength of an American democracy is that we do have vigorous debates between alternative points of view.",
        "So it's not a matter of the Congress not working if one side supports a bill and the other side opposes it.",
        "The problem is that they're doing that because it's for the partisan advantage, their - how their party can win the next election.",
        "That, I think, is the problem that has to be overcome.",
        "Here's a couple of good emails, this is from Jennifer in Brighton, Michigan: Thank goodness I keep voting for Democrats who promise to protect choice to get women's votes, then fail to stand for my rights or, indeed, accomplish much of anything once they're in office.",
        "I never understood people who said there was no difference between the two major parties.",

        "This is from Steve, and he's writing - he doesn't tell us where he's writing from.",
        "He said: I'd go for a cap on attorney's awards and medical malpractice cases - that's something the Republicans have been asking for - and some kind of reasonable limitation on awards for pain and suffering.",
        "Both of these drastically increase overall medical costs to all, beyond their literal expense, some to cross cases.",
        "The Republicans should not be able to resist this bait - apparently that in hopes of getting the rest of the health care bill through.",
        "And this is from Brian in San Francisco, a member, he says, of KALW, our member station there.",
        "Why not just let Republicans filibuster in the Senate?",
        "They would have to stay up all night.",
        "It would be entertaining to watch that pettiness on C-SPAN.",
        "Ron Elving, is that an option, if we have a real filibuster?",
        "That is something that fascinates me, and not just as a journalist wanting to watch.",
        "I do not understand - well, I guess I can stretch my mind to understand why individually senators don't want to go back to those days.",
        "But it seems to me that in extremis, as Harry Reid and the rest of the Democrats are now, they should at least explore the possibility of going back to real filibusters, not the virtual filibusters and threatened filibusters and holds that we have today, and make someone who cares this much go out on the floor and really hold the floor.",
        "I'll give you the last 10 seconds, Mickey Edwards.",
        "Oh, you know, I wrote a column on the Atlantic last week, said exactly that: make them stand up and filibuster."
