        "But those who follow banking point out that several large corporations--General Electric through its GE Capital Unit and Wal-Mart's rival Target--already have similar kinds of limited banking operations, raising the question why the FDIC is taking the unprecedented step of holding two separate hearings on Wal-Mart's request.",
