        "But instead of laying out a detailed plan for whittling down those costs while expanding health coverage, President Obama wants a 10-year reserve fund of $635 billion to help underwrite such transformation, since it will likely cost closer to a trillion dollars over that time.",
        "And by doing that, he avoids policy fights in Congress right off the bat, and such a fund also makes it harder to argue, as Republicans certainly will, that the nation simply can't afford a health-care overhaul in these tough times.",

        "There is a plan to pay for it by, one, reducing the premiums paid to insurance companies that participate in Medicare and also by reducing the value of itemized deductions that the highest income earners - those making more than a quarter million dollars - can take.",

        "Yes, he honors another campaign pledge in this budget, both by spending $15 billion a year over the next decade to develop sustainable energy sources and to have this cap-and-trade system where industries would have to pay to pollute, and the income from that would go to help pay for his making-work-pay tax cut, which he's already proposed.",
