        "Ruben was able to read DNA sequences from the cave bear, so the journal scientists sent him some ground up Neanderthal bone, the same bone they were using to get DNA from.",

        "In fact, says Green, for every one fragment of DNA that came from a Neanderthal, there are 20 that came from bacteria, and that means a lot more work.",
        "We have to sequence 20 times more than we would if we were getting all the Neanderthal's.",
