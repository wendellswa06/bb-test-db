        "Well, as I've said before, I don't make predictions about timing in the Security Council, because it's not likely to be successful, and when I have in the past, I've always been wrong, so no predictions on timing.",
        "It appears that Britain and France, with the support of Germany, which is not on the council, have concluded they can't bring the Russians around without further negotiations with Iran, without another attempt to convince Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment and consider alternative means to acquire non-military nuclear technology.",
        "That was the recent explicit message from Britain's Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw.",
        "Security Council involvement does not mean the end of our efforts to find a negotiated solution, but rather marks a new phase in our diplomatic efforts.",
        "If Iran is prepared to respect the requests of the IAEA in full, then the door to a negotiated solution will reopen.",
        "But for the moment, Iran is pressing ahead on uranium enrichment.",
        "Evidence has emerged that Iran has assembled what is known as a cascade of 164 gas centrifuges at a pilot enrichment project at Natanz.",
        "This is not operational yet, but if Iranian engineers do start it up, it will signal they have advanced from the purely experimental stage of uranium enrichment into small scale production.",
        "Abbas Milani, who heads the Iran Democracy Project at Stanford University, believes Tehran is doing its utmost to take advantage of the Security Council's indecision.",
        "They're using the space that Russia and China are giving them, very, very actively to create a reality on the ground and then make that the basis of the argument that this is already a fait accompli and cannot go back.",
        "Iran has also stated it intends to construct 3,000 centrifuges at the Natanz facility at the end of this year.",
        "For these reasons, the Bush Administration is maintaining a firm stance in talks at the U.N.",
        "Under-Secretary of State Nicholas Burns argued recently that only continued pressure with the threat of sanctions can convince Tehran to shift direction.",
        "Iran is not going to want to isolate itself.",
        "It's not a country like North Korea, which seems to thrive in isolation, it's a country that needs investment, it needs the kind of diplomatic ties that have been produced between Iran in some countries.",
        "And I think what's at stake is the normalcy of those relations with part of the rest of the world should Iran not respond to this united message that has been put forward.",
        "There may be unity around the belief that Iran with a nuclear weapon is a danger, but so far little unity on how to prevent that from happening.",

        "In London, the effort to recover bodies and evidence goes on one day after bombs hit the city's Underground and a double-decker bus.",
        "Police now say that more than 50 people died in the attacks, and they expect that number to rise.",
        "A huge investigation is under way, and today Scotland Yard Commissioner Ian Blair said the attacks were the work of a group.",
        "We are clear from the timings of these events that, no, it could not have been done by one person.",
        "The question is: Are they still at large?",
        "They're either at large in the UK, at large somewhere else, or they're dead.",

        "Could you begin by describing the recovery effort that's still under way at this point?",
        "Yes, all throughout today, police have been recovering bodies from The Underground.",
        "It's a pretty slow process, because the conditions, they say, are pretty horrendous down there.",
        "And as they search these sites, police have been able to recover a few clues.",
        "What have they learned so far?",
        "Well, what they say so far is that the bombs used were of a fairly small scale.",
        "They're about 10 pounds or less, probably packed into rucksacks.",
        "Now in The Underground, they were placed on the floor.",
        "What they cannot say categorically was whether the bombers were actually present when the devices went off.",
        "Their feeling, they say, is that on the Tube blasts, the bombers probably weren't there.",
        "They had somehow managed to deposit their bombs and disappear.",
        "They're not so clear about the bus bomb.",
        "There are certainly indications there that one of the bombers at least may have been blown up along with the bomb.",

        "The second thing to say is that the blast on the bus took place near the top deck near the back.",

        "He had just signed himself out of the hospital, where he was recovering after surgery.",
        "The mayor still had a hospital bracelet strapped around his wrist; he had hospital machines that kept him going, cloaked by a sheet in his lap; and he was steered to the podium by his son, a Boston police officer who had been at the finish line of the marathon.",
        "But the mayor of Boston insisted on getting out of his seat; to stand at the podium and tell his city in a hoarse, husky voice that crackled like the wheels of one of Boston's T trains when he said: We are one Boston.",

        "Ultimately the agreement with the United States says they have to dismantle it entirely, and that will take some more time.",
