        "All right, how does this work?",

        "Right, so in immigrant communities, there's a rich tradition of people coming together to lend and save money.",
        "This is an activity that is pretty widespread and it's a pretty global phenomena and has been happening for a millennia.",
        "What we did was basically recognize that activity as bonafide financial activity that just needed to be formalized.",
        "And the way we did that was we asked people to sign promissory notes so that they can then participate in the program, and then we then report that activity to the credit bureau.",

        "And then they'll all agree to, say, put in a hundred dollars into the pot, so you then collect that thousand dollars.",
        "And then they agree on who takes that thousand dollars first, and they do that in rotation until everybody has a chance in getting that thousand dollars.",
        "Again, this activity has been going on for millenia.",
        "What we did differently was we asked them, OK, well, by signing a promissory note, we basically transformed it from being invisible to being invisible.",
        "We transformed it from being informal to being formal so that the financial systems of today can actually recognize that activity.",
        "And so we put ourselves in the middle of that transaction, and then we become the loan servicer and then also become the data furnisher to the credit bureaus.",
        "So someone whose only lending experience is through one of these lending circles, now if they went to go get a mortgage...",
        "Exactly.",
        "...The bank would recognize that as being a solid credit history.",
        "Exactly because in our economy today, you need a credit score to do anything.",
        "You need a credit report to rent an apartment.",
        "I mean, some places you need a credit report to even get a job.",

        "Yeah, well, theoretically we can, and I think in the future we'll do that, but right now we're keeping it very local, you know, because we want that human interaction to happen 'cause that's actually is a very important element to the program.",
        "Why?",
        "Why is that so important?",
        "Because people, when they come together in what we call, you know, a lending circle formation session, they have to decide on how much.",
        "Is it a hundred dollars or $50, $75, $200?",
        "And then they'll start to decide who goes first, who goes second, and sometimes they do that by drawing numbers from a hat.",
