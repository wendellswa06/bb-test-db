        "That is a beginning; it's an important beginning, and it is a recognition that Obama believes in the arts, in the importance of the arts.",
        "So, we are, of course, always looking for more, but we are ever so grateful that we have been recognized with what I would like to think of as some important seed money to begin this new process of establishing the arts in the forefront of America.",
        "Well, Bob, in these tough economic times, some would say that the arts should be low on the list of institutions that need funding.",
        "When compared to health care, joblessness and the war, how can funding for the arts compete as necessary when we're in a recession?"

        "Well, those people who would say that don't really quite understand the role of the arts in America, because the arts are a part of the driving economic force.",
        "Some - over four percent of the businesses in America are arts-related businesses, and 100,000 nonprofit arts organizations out there creating a $166 billion economic impact, 5.7 million jobs.",
        "So, on the jobs front, there's really important information, but at the same time, a lot of the work of the arts connects to things like community development, downtown revitalization, health issues, hospital improvement and on and on - the data is all there - better education, retention rates, youth at risk improved.",
        "So, what we have to do in the arts is make a better case and an ongoing case of what is actually obvious if people just look around.",
        "Well, Leslie, some people oppose government funding of the arts because they oppose tax dollars going to controversial artists like Andres Serrano, who infamously photographed a crucifix in urine in the 1980s.",
        "Is that a legitimate concern, given the climate that we're in?",
        "No, I don't think it's a legitimate concern.",
        "But I think what we have to recognize is that we are now in a new era, and we need very important new problem solvers, and artists are abstract thinkers.",
        "The idea of choosing an Andres Serrano, who supposedly provoked the society with his choice of subject matter, does not talk to the real issue, which is that we need abstract thinkers, right-brain thinkers, creative thinkers, to create new solutions to new problems, because the old issues, the old models, have not worked.",
        "And it is time for us to use all the resources of this country, and we have not looked to the artists, the artistic community, to help us solve and create the country that Obama and the rest of America and the world is looking to see realized.",
        "You know, Bob, Leslie raises an interesting point.",
        "Isn't art best supported from the ground up, like the kind of grassroots political movements that swept Barack Obama into office - community galleries, theaters and the like?",
        "Well, I think what's important to understand is that is the way it's supported.",
        "You take a look at those 100,000 nonprofit arts organizations that I mentioned and the Americans for the Arts tracks, and you'll see that half their money comes from earned income; that's people like you and me paying to come to something or buying something from them.",
        "Another 40 percent of their money comes from private donations; mostly individuals, again, like you and me.",
        "And the final 10 percent is government money, but most of that is local government money investing in advancing the arts locally.",
        "The federal money is a tiny piece, less than a percentage of one percent.",
        "But it's a lever that actually helps create a flow of all the other dollars that creates this wonderful $166 billion nonprofit industry.",
        "How does, Leslie, the - America stack up globally in terms of its government support for the arts?",
        "I'm thinking now just of the story in today's paper about how upset China is over the auctioning off of some sculptures that were in the possession of the late Yves St. Laurent.",
        "Well, we have to recognize that America is the youngest country on the face of the Earth and that America is an amalgam of so many other cultures.",
        "And because as America was structuring itself, it did not have the same kind of structuring system wherein the arts were prioritized as in the other cultures globally, which have a legacy back to ancestral times, where arts was the priority in life to maintain the integrity and the heritage and the character of that culture, of that civilization.",
        "So, now that - as we build America to be the civilization, to be the global power that we envision ourselves to be, and to be part of the global network, we have to also pay equal homage to our artists, who are so important in establishing the criteria for who we are and how we will be leaders and partners in solving the global crisis.",
        "Well, Bob, which segments of the arts tend to be supported most - music, visual arts, performing arts - and why?",
        "Well, you know - and before I jump in on that, I'd just say that the other thing, comparing us internationally, is that our system is completely different than all the other systems, which are largely government supported.",
        "Ours is not a support system; it's an incentive system.",
        "And a little more incentive and you would see massive additional blossoming of private donation and individual support.",
        "Now, the kinds of art forms that get supported, sometimes you see more money going into the kinds of things that have facilities.",
        "It doesn't matter what the art form is- it could be music; it could be theater; it could be dance - but facility investment tends to end up being a chunk of dollars that takes away.",
        "And sometimes on the other end of the spectrum, the art forms that don't require a lot of materials - let's say, like poetry, for example - get less.",
        "But across the board, it really is a community decision.",
        "I just was in Los Angeles, San Jose, San Francisco, New York, and I'm headed up to Nevada this week; each of these places emphasizes different things in their own particular community-arts portfolio.",
        "And I think that's the beauty of the American system.",
        "Here's my final question, and our segment is coming to an end - I appreciate both of you coming on and sharing your thoughts with us - is it fair to suggest that President Obama's approach to the arts is a positive one and that it, in some ways, differs or improves upon that of his predecessor, George Bush?",

        "It's definitely the case that many of these people are seeking a sort of ephemeral notoriety and longer term memorialization in fetid subcultures on the Internet.",
        "But another thing - and this is, I think, the thing we have to keep in mind when we talk about these acts and the speech that's sort of attached to them - is that our discourse has a way of laundering away the obviousness of what these things are.",

        "Well, what's the point of interface between what these people say their reasons are and also what their actions do and what we accept more broadly as normative, acceptable expressions and differences of, quote-unquote, \"\"opinion in the public sphere?\"\" And once you get very granularly into what these manifestos say - right?",
