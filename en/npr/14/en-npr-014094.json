        "So one of the things that we have to do is to absolutely improve the diagnosis of this disorder.",
        "And so every service member returning from the theater should go through a process to help screen and identify people who are at risk or who are actively suffering from the disorder.",
        "The second thing is that once it's diagnosed, we have to be prepared to be vigilant in managing the care because an individual may have mild symptoms of the disease within a few weeks after returning from the conflict.",
        "And those may become dramatically more severe in the next six months, a year or two years.",
        "The medical programs that had been set up traditionally really were focused on an individual encounter with the patient.",

        "Well, the two brothers who were at the center of the attacks, Cherif and Said Kouachi, are being very quietly buried.",
        "French officials haven't announced when their burials will take place out of concern that there will be some sort of civil arrest, either from supporters, who might turn their graves into jihadi shrines, or from right-wingers, who have been agitating to stage anti-Islamist demonstration, which, so far, officials have banned.",

        "The numbers French officials use internally are 800-1,000, and that's people they believe have traveled to Syria and Iraq.",
        "Some of those people might be working in hospitals, some might be fighting with moderate forces, some might be with al-Qaida's arm there or with the so-called Islamic State.",
        "I mean, to give you comparable numbers for the U.S., U.S.",
        "intelligence officials say there are about 150 Americans who have traveled to Syria and Iraq in the past couple of years, and they say at least 12 are with the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.",
        "A handful of those 12 are back in America, and officials think they have a pretty good handle on where they are.",
        "So the number of people going to fight with ISIS and returning is higher in Europe than it is in America, right?"

        "By bringing in samples to the elephant and getting them to say yes, this area might have landmines and this area has a high likelihood of not having landmines - just clearing land a bit quicker - maybe we could open up areas to wildlife and humans alike.",
