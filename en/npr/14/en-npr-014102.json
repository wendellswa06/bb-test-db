        "He is also a social commentator.",
        "And Jane Austen was this social commentator par excellence.",

        "Well, Jane Austen's observation of social life, not at all the similar from Hammett's observation of, say, the drinking and the clubbing, and the nightclubbing and the dancing habits of Myrna Loy and William Powell in the \"\"The Thin Man.",
        "Did writing this story make you appreciate something about Jane Austen all over again?",
        "Yes.",
        "The thing that I've always loved about her is her precision.",

        "So what I appreciated here was the sparseness.",
        "What Diane started to talk to me about was the actual social manners and whether or not things had actually changed that much in terms of social aspirations, because here we have this actress who has as much social aspiration for marrying a lord as Mrs. Bennett had for any of her daughters in \"\"Pride and Prejudice.",
        "I think that's true.",
        "I also think the vitality of her women is really at a very important aspect of why she's endured and why she means so much to so many of us.",
        "And again, of course, I guess we must note that that was also one of the observations made about Dashiell Hammett's \"\"\"\"Thin Man\"\" stories, that the character we now know played in the movies by Myrna Loy was an independent woman."
