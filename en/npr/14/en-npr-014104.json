        "World leaders are gathered in Chicago for a two-day NATO summit, which starts this morning.",
        "The summit agenda centers on Afghanistan, specifically figuring out how to meet a 2014 withdrawal deadline while shoring up Afghanistan's security forces.",
        "We'll hear a view from the White House in a moment.",
        "But we begin with this report from NPR's Jackie Northam in Chicago.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF PEOPLE CHANTING)",
        "There's tight security in downtown Chicago for the NATO summit and the large protests seen here all week are expected to continue as dozens of world leaders sit down to decide Afghanistan's future.",
        "For the U.S., this summit is about winding down the war and ensuring that NATO allies and other nations stay committed to the country after the bulk of combat troops withdraw at the end of 2014.",
        "In particular, the Obama administration wants help training Afghanistan's security forces, which holds an estimated annual price tag of about four billion dollars.",
        "Administration officials say you're going to hear the word sustainment a lot at the summit.",
        "It's a euphemism for how the training program is going to be paid for.",
        "NATO's secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, says it's unlikely anyone will be writing at a check at the summit, but he's looking for a signal that the international community is willing to chip in after 2014.",
        "I would stress that the Chicago summit will not be a pledging conference.",
        "So, I wouldn't expect a total sum of contributions to be announced at Chicago.",
        "But I would expect some allies and some partners to announce significant contributions to the financing of the Afghan security forces in the future.",
        "But many analysts agree that for many countries, making a long-term commitment to Afghanistan is difficult.",
        "They say there's fatigue after a decade-long involvement in Afghanistan, and many of the European allies are struggling with the fallout from the debt crisis.",
        "President Obama is holding his first bilateral meeting at the summit this morning with Afghan President Hamid Karzai.",

        "And that was a very critical report, at least in terms of the way it was reported.",
        "And remember, its basic finding was essentially that the war in Iraq has made the terrorist problem worse.",
        "The White House has been denying that.",
        "They've been denying it now for two days through surrogates - not through the president himself - and through some spokespersons.",
        "But he clearly felt that he needed to get out there on this.",
        "He knew he would get an answer - a question about it at this press conference, and he was clearly, as you said, in a fit of pique over the issue.",
        "And if the war in Iraq is said to - at least according to this report or what we've heard about it - contributed to terrorism, the Bush administration has always pointed to Afghanistan as a success story.",
        "But since that and the beginning of the invasion it's gotten more complicated than that, hasn't it?"

        "So that was the point that we, you know, really got scared.",

        "So I don't know if it was my wristwatch or - you know, even a - well, a couple of us still had our harnesses on, which had - they're mostly fabric, but there's, you know, tiny little buckles, you know?",

        "It has a number of sort of narrow passages that you have to navigate, which posed to be a challenge when some of these guys were paralyzed from the waist down.",

        "And he could lower himself further, but it would, you know, sort of put pressure in an unnatural position on his legs.",
        "And it occurred to him that he could lower himself and break his own legs.",
        "And he wouldn't know it until he had done it because his legs were numb.",
        "And he was not the only climber suspended by ropes that day.",
        "And we have to note that one of them, well, something happened.",
        "It's not exactly clear what, but his line came loose and he fell 800 feet.",
        "Quite tragically, you know, for a young man who was invited by his prospective future father-in-law.",
        "It was a chance - as these trips often are for members of the family or a family maybe uniting to get to know each other better under exciting circumstances.",
        "And they knew that he wasn't as experienced.",

        "He did great on the Middle Teton, which is a neighboring mountain, a couple of days before.",
        "So he was taking to it and he was doing fine.",
        "There was no sense that he wasn't capable.",
        "But when they determined that they should go back down - and they were on the way back down when the storm really hit with its greatest ferocity, one of the guys who put together the trip went down ahead of this young man, and he was joined on this fairly famous ridge where there's a feature called The Belly Roll, which is a great challenge for new climbers to get around because of that big drop that you mentioned.",
        "So there's just - a lot of the people who climbed a lot talk about the Tetons not being particularly difficult for the climbing, but for newer climbers the exposure, meaning the exposure to these vast voids on the sides, and from where he was hit with sort of the concussive force of the lightning, that's 800 feet to a very steep core, narrow passage between two ridges, and that drains over another 3,000 vertical feet.",
        "So it's a place that a number of climbers and skiers have been lost in the years past and, sadly, it claimed this guy.",

        "And I want to ask, Betsy Smith, when you realized you were in such trouble, what did it look like when you saw help coming?",
        "Oh, well, it was amazing.",
        "And we were at a point on the mountain that the search and rescue would have been very difficult to reach us, so Alan Kline, my boyfriend and one of the members of our party is a professional guide.",
        "He lowered us down.",
        "I was unable to use my arms after regaining the use of my body, and a friend was unable to use one of his feet.",
        "But he lowered us down on these makeshift rappels that he used out of kind of what gear we had left that was good and got us down about a thousand feet"
