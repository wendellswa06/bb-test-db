        "And lightning struck the ground about 10 or 15 feet in front of me.",
        "And like the lady was saying earlier on the call, it was interesting because you don't really feel it immediately.",
        "But I remember every time the flash went off, it felt like maybe, best way to describe it is like a giant, grabbing your body and squeezing you, because your body completely tensed up solid.",
        "And with each flash, it's like bup-budda-bup and you tensed up every time.",
        "And of course, you fall to the ground.",

        "Yeah.",
        "You know, more - mostly, whenever there's a lightning storm now, foolishly, I'm a little nervous.",
        "But I don't know.",
        "Medically, I couldn't tell you, but it does have an emotional strain on you, because I do a lot of outdoor activities like your callers there in the mountains.",
        "And when those storms come through, you feel very vulnerable.",
        "So that's the only effect that I can remember that mostly.",
        "Betsy Smith, your lasting effects were a little bit more serious.",
        "They were a bit.",

        "I thought that, you know, that's like the old parody of a nuclear strike, where you get down and put your head between your knees and kiss your butt goodbye or something, you know?",
        "But he was actually running me through of some of the very things that Alan and Betsy and their crew did.",
        "You know, they just got rid of your metal and actually - this was interesting too.",
        "Actually, sort of, making a closed-circuit of your body, so bringing your feet together, your ankles together, so that the energy might flash over your body, and not pass through it.",
        "Some listeners may have seen those pictures of all the dead livestock out in fields along the metal fences.",
        "You know, the four-legged creatures are at a serious disadvantage because there's a differential between each of their feet.",
        "So there is a lightning position, and that's - that led to them telling me about this rescue because the rescue involved climbers - the climbing ranger team that prepares for this, but they also drafted the - a couple of the commercial guides who were present at the base camp to help them out.",

        "And Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, having been overtaken as the once prohibitive frontrunner and favorite, she has to make sure that nobody goes to the caucuses In Iowa wondering if there are real differences between her and Obama, or wondering whether or not there are not some deficiencies on Obama's resume if he is not in some sense or another lacking.",

        "And, you know, Alex, I think the Clinton people are looking at some of the polls.",
        "They're looking at the disarray on their Republican side, and they're saying, if we can win Iowa, if we can stop the Obama momentum there, then we can win New Hampshire, and we can go on to Florida at the end of January and really wrap this thing up.",
        "They are seeing Barack Obama right now as the main obstacle between her and the presidency.",

        "Both those candidates have now faded to the point where it's not even clear they're going to be factors.",

        "And Fred Thompson doesn't look competitive anywhere.",

        "It's not what we thought would happen, and I wonder if that tells you anything about politics in 2007 and indeed looking ahead to 2008.",
        "It's very difficult to write a script for the politics of a coming presidential election when the issues are shifting as rapidly as they are -Iraq declining as an issue, economic insecurity taking over for national security as a national preoccupation and when the candidates themselves are running so far out of their expectation.",
        "Mitt Romney, who is supposed to have a chance only if he could win Iowa and New Hampshire, now we see him in trouble in Iowa, in trouble in New Hampshire and yet, with a real chance to recover from a rocky start, if only because the other well-financed candidates - Giuliani, Thompson - have faded out so much."
