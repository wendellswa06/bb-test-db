        "We started going for walks at first, and now, we have moved up to going to PetSmart, which was my biggest fear.",
        "And I'm able to walk up to dogs now, and let them sniff me and pet them.",
        "So, that's what we do.",
        "And of course, you need to go to PetSmart, or some pet store, to get stuff for your dog.",
        "I do, I know.",
        "I have to get him food.",
        "And for those of us who may not have experienced something like this, is there absolutely no way for you to control your emotions under those circumstances?",
        "Oh, no, there's nothing I can do.",
        "I tried to speak to myself rationally.",
        "Like, a dog is not going to pop out of thin air.",
        "A dog is not going to attack you.",
        "But it is completely - you don't listen to the rational thoughts.",
        "Even knowing, at some point, that you had a phobia, this fear, you couldn't calm yourself down.",
        "No, absolutely not.",
        "It was horrible, and I felt like no one understood what I was going through.",

        "Is that common?",
        "It is common, and people do sometimes get better with time.",
        "They do spontaneously recover from bad experiences, but some folks do not.",
        "We don't really know how to predict exactly who will get better spontaneously and who won't, but when someone doesn't get better spontaneously, then it's very useful to try to get some help with it.",
        "And that part that she also said, nobody understands what I'm going through, I'm the only person in the world.",
        "Well, people do commonly feel that way, even though there are other folks that do have phobias.",
        "But part of the reason that they feel way is because many, many people don't understand, and they have not had that kind of experience, and they're not aware of the distress and the thoughts that are going on in association with the feared situation.",
        "It could be easy to make fun of.",
        "Yes, if you're not very charitable.",
        "Yeah.",
        "How common is it, and when does a fear become a phobia?",
        "Phobias are common in the population.",
        "There are many different types of phobias.",
        "What Jennifer was describing might be called a specific phobia, because it's very focused on particular kind of situation, in her case, big dogs, big, unknown dogs.",

        "population.",
        "But there are a lot of other phobias as well.",
        "For example, social phobia, which is considered different than a specific phobia, has to do with social situations in a personal performance, public speaking, that sort of thing.",
        "That's estimated as being maybe about eight percent on an annual prevalence basis.",
        "So...",
        "Eight percent of the United States population, that's a lot of people.",
        "That's correct, yes."

        "That's - agoraphobia is not considered a specific phobia, because it's kind of general to a lot of different situations, as you said, open spaces.",
        "And it's very often associated with panic disorder.",
        "And so, people with agoraphobia will develop a very strong sense that something terrible is going to happen, and they can't put their finger on exactly any particular threat, and so they will often avoid going outside into open spaces, public places, because it seems more likely for them that that feeling will occur in that situation.",
        "And they could feel safer in the house or the apartment or whatever it is, yeah.",

        "It has helped a little bit, to where I can actually kill tiny ones.",
        "Happy thoughts, Michael Kozak, is that going to help?",
        "Ordinarily, the kind of treatment that has been found to be most helpful involves confronting the situation that you're afraid of, providing, of course, that it's not dangerous.",
        "And part of the notion of a phobia is that the fear is mismatched to the actual threat of the situation.",
        "So, for example, in the case of spiders, most spiders are not particularly dangerous.",
        "There are few exceptions, but in general, they're not.",
        "And so, the treatment that has been studied very extensively and found helpful involves doing some exercises, confronting the situation that bothers you."
