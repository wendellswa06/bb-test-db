        "So, if I were working with somebody, I would probably focus on that kind of approach, actually, similar to what Jennifer described, where she would actually enter situations where there were non-dangerous dogs, and get used to them.",
        "If she stayed there for - without withdrawing, her distress would spontaneously decline, providing she didn't avoid and run away.",
        "And I would say, for the same thing, I would probably do with spiders.",
        "In fact, I've worked with folks who had spider fears, and generally, you would start with something easier, maybe some insects that are dead, or some spiders that are dead, and then gradually work to live ones and maybe larger ones, until the person is able to confront what you would think would be the worst harmless spider that they would encounter without distress.",
        "Sadie, is that approach something that you might want to try?",
        "Oh, I definitely will try.",
        "When he told me that, I got scared even thinking about doing that.",
        "I'm afraid if I kind of do overcome it a little, I'm afraid if I see one and then I freak out because I'm really, you know, like, it'll come back.",
        "Well, get maybe a professional who can help you with that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But I'm going to try that.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "OK.",
        "I really need to.",

        "One other thing, she said the origin may have been, you know, she saw another adult - as a child, she saw an adult who was afraid of spiders.",
        "Can it be communicated like that?",
        "Sure.",
        "The - many people who have phobias cannot recall a particular incident that prompted the fear, but they - fears can be communicated vicariously.",
        "There's actually evidence with studies of chimps, for example, where if the one chimp is afraid of something and the other one observes it, well, then, when you present that item to the chimp that was a witness...",
        "The second chimp, yeah.",
        "They are afraid.",
        "So, that's an example of fear being communicated vicariously.",
        "I wouldn't suspect that just because you saw someone be afraid of something that you would automatically develop a phobia.",
        "But you might.",
        "(Soundbite of monk chanting)",
        "Oh, how funny.",
        "But we do profit from observing what other people do, and if you see someone withdrawing or acting as if something is dangerous, will you get that information and take that in?",
        "So, it makes sense that you could develop a fear that way.",

        "It's when it starts to affect the way you live that doctors might call it a phobia.",
        "An article in Sunday's Washington Post talked about how to understand your phobias and offered us several tips for living with them.",

        "And I just wanted to follow up on what we were talking about just before the break.",
        "Is - we learn that if somebody else is afraid of something, we should be afraid of it, too.",
        "Is this an evolutionary response?",
        "I mean, is this how we learn to - well, you know, we don't have to put our hand in the fire, we know it's hot, if somebody is afraid of it?",
        "There's some evidence that there might be some evolutionary advantage to developing certain fears.",
        "For example, it's been observed that certain themes come up with phobias.",
        "You notice that there are people reporting spider phobias and snake phobias, small animals.",
        "On the other hand, you don't see a lot of folks who come in with phobias of, let's say, electrical outlets.",
        "Right.",
        "Even though...",
        "They're much more dangerous.",
        "Even though they are very common, contemporarily, and people often have had experiences of getting a shock, and yet, they haven't developed phobias the same way that you seem to see them with spiders and snakes.",
        "So, people have actually studied this and have done some conditioning experiments, and have found that it is easier to condition fears to certain sets of stimuli, like snakes and spiders, that have some significance in the way of threat, if you were trying to survive in a different environment than we are in now.",
        "So, that might be hardwired somehow?",
        "So, there's probably some preparation.",
        "Actually, the term that's used is prepared learning.",
        "So, it's you are more prepared to learn a connection between A and B, if it's a snake or something like that and a punishment, or an aversive situation, than other situations.",
        "So, that's called prepared learning."

        "And from then on, it was pure terror and screaming, and I happened to be staying at my aunt and uncle's house for the weekend because it was Mother's Day weekend and my mom wanted some time off.",

        "So, I was able to get from snakes, and I - snakes is one of those things where you don't usually come across them.",
        "So, I have not sought any kind of behavior modification.",
        "I have no desire to become friends with snakes.",
        "If it was something with spiders, which I guess part of the case study that I was involved in after this episode - other children had crabs and spiders, is what they hallucinated, and mine was snakes.",

        "So, it's a hard response.",
        "It's hard to control.",
        "It's - I really feel out of control if I even come across a snake that's on a cover of a book.",
