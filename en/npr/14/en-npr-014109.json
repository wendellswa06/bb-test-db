        "Yeah.",

        "And it's easy for someone outside to say, you should do this.",
        "It's not so easy to muster the courage, to approach those situations that are very distressing.",
        "So, I think, you know, usually there's some preparation that's involved before helping a person to confront things.",
        "What you often hear is just about the exposure, sort of the dramatic thing, you have to go and shake hands with the snake.",
        "But that's usually toward the end of a therapy, where all the preparation has occurred, and that person is now ready to take that step and confront the feared situation of their own accord."
