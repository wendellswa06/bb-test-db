        "Well, the bee is less dangerous than if they get all distracted and don't pay attention to the traffic.",
        "And they can actually - their distress and distraction from there that's part of their fear can be interfering with their practical functioning.",
        "So, I don't know if that occurs with you, with your driving, but it might be worthwhile to think about trying to get some help, so you don't have to put up with this for four more years, waiting or hoping that it might spontaneously decline."
