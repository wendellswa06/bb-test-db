        "And in a way, I think that was her tacit way of giving me her blessing, to not just to investigate other twins but to really see them all through the prism of my own life.",
        "And to ask the hard questions about why, despite our intense closeness and it remains very intense, it's also been difficult at times.",
        "And so, short answer is that it's a little bit hard for her.",
        "She's a writer for the New York Times.",
        "It's a little bit of hard for her to be exposed, when it wasn't her choice to write the book.",
        "But that said she has edited every word, she's read it twice and she - I think her greatest act of love is that, she let me publish it, frankly.",
        "Well, there's also a recurring message from you to her in this book that you miss the closeness she shared as girls.",
        "And that you miss her now, even though you remain close.",
        "There's probably an easier way for you to send her that message…",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "…than publishing of a big book.",
        "But was that one of the things you wanted to do?",
        "Yes.",
        "You know, I think that's exactly sort of how I ended up in it.",
        "It is a clumsy way of doing something.",
        "I maybe should have found the courage to do otherwise, but I really hadn't.",
        "I think that the two years of writing this book were a sort of love letter to her and a way of saying, I need more of us.",
        "I missed the way that we used to be as kids.",
        "The sort of, the lack of complication that when we were together as kids there were just - there was no sub-text, there was no issue of identity.",
        "We were just together.",
        "We did so many of the things the same way, the same time.",
        "You know, we weren't interchangeable, we were definitely different people, but I would say that being together was effortless.",
        "And in the last few years, I would say it hasn't been.",
        "And I don't want to speak for her, I mean, she speaks for herself in the book.",
        "I actually interview her for the book.",
        "But she really feels like at a certain point, she was aware of the fact that her own identity was blurred by the fact that we were doubles, in a sense, all our lives.",
        "And that she needed to say, I need my own turf, I need to be to have my own sense that my friends, or the friends that we have in common, are uniquely mine.",
        "And that I have my own world that's separate from you.",
        "It's something that can happen to twins anytime in their lives, where usually you think about separation from a mother, from a parent happening in adolescence.",
        "That's sort of the time we're all used to it - you make your break.",
        "With twins, as I have learned through my research and talking to so many, it can happen very late.",
        "It can happen early.",
        "But it can happen in your 40s, it can happen in your 50s, where there has to be a time where you say, I'm letting go little bit.",
        "And I think I was very resistant to Robin letting go.",
        "And this book taught me that it's time.",
        "You know, I - and I must say I read your book.",
        "I'm both - I'm the mother and daughter of fraternal twins…",

        "You really are growing up alongside someone in many ways, and in that sense, the temptation for comparison is almost - it's almost too much to bear for a lot of people.",
        "But when you look like someone else, you're a constant kind of side show.",
        "And it doesn't mean that everyone's obsessed with you, but there's always the curiosity.",
        "It's understandable.",
        "And you started with all these questions that are so - kind of for us, they're so tired, but believe me, I'm asked them to this day over and over again.",

        "As she says in the book, she just hates the gimmick.",
        "It's not what she loves about being a twin.",
        "And I also tell this anecdote about how we have this mutual friend who ran into Robin on the street, talked to her, for 20 minutes they had a conversation and then emailed her a few minutes later and said oh my God, the whole time I was talking to you, I thought you were Abby.",
        "You know, that might be a funny story, kind of like what's the big deal?",
        "It wears on you, because suddenly that reminds you that maybe you're not singular in the world; that the distinctiveness, there's sort of an anxiety of distinction.",
        "Am I really known, not just noticed?",
        "There's someone in the book, an expert named Joan Friedman(ph), who talks about the difference between being noticed and being known.",
        "As identical twins, you're really noticed a lot of the time, and that doesn't necessarily happen with fraternals.",
        "Although I have to tell you, I think sometimes people just aren't paying attention, you know?"

        "I am mistaken for Robin probably three or four times a week, literally, and it's the question of how do you handle it?",
        "You have to - you have to be ready for that, because even if you're in a rush just to go somewhere, you're going to offend someone if they think that you're Robin, and you don't respond in some warm, welcoming way.",

        "I need a little distance now.",
