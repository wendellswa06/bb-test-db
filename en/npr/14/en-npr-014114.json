        "Your DNA is the same.",
        "Your DNA actually isn't just - doesn't inform you just biologically in terms of your traits, it informs your choices.",

        "We chose kind of similar men to marry.",
        "It's not exactly the same, but it often is very similar because we're informed by the same kind of genetic information.",
        "And so it's sort of artificial to say, well, we have to choose different things because our bodies are telling us, kind of, to go in the same direction.",
        "I remember being with my twin cousins - are you getting a sense of my family genetics here?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "It's pretty amazing.",
        "Another set of fraternal twins.",

        "And her sister, who was reading a book, said: Goodbye, athletic twin.",
        "And they had become so identified by their differences that there was no room for the athletic one to be a reader or the reading twin to be a jock.",
        "You know, in fact, I interview the Paul twins, Alexandra and Caroline.",
        "Alexandra actually was a regular on \"\"Baywatch,\"\" and her twin, Caroline, came out as a lesbian and was a firefighter.",
        "So they ended up very different directions.",
        "But when they were growing up, they were both exactly that.",
        "It was one was athletic, one was the intellectual, and they felt like they had no choice but to kind of embrace those labels.",
        "Later in life, they said that was ridiculous.",
        "It was something in a way that was foisted upon them, and then they felt like it had to be self-fulfilling.",
        "Many of the people in my book who have studied twins and who counsel twins, therapists, talk about the danger of labels.",
        "And so many parents I talk to, and I even see in my own family, they that - this is the easy twin; this is the cranky twin.",
        "This twin is the social one; this is the reticent twin.",

        "and there's an intimate relationship that occurS between them that I'm certainly not a part of.",
        "and it's very interesting, and I wouldn't say it's difficult, but it certainly isn't for everyone, I don't think.",
        "You know, I'm glad you asked that question because I really think that spouses of twins really could be a book in of itself.",
        "It is such interesting territory.",
        "It is - I know you're saying it's not hard, but I know from personal experience it can certainly be tricky - and I cover it a lot in the book.",
        "Because just as you're saying, you're kind of getting two for one, and you have to sign on for that.",
        "And many of the people I spoke to said you either get it, or you don't, and a couple twins said if you even think about getting the way of that relationship, watch out.",
        "I happened to - like our host here, I married a man who has identical twin sisters, and that has made things so much easier, because Robin and I have our stuff, and he just gets it.",
        "He's used to it.",
        "He has sort of the twin-empathy gene, but not every husband or wife does.",
        "Well, you also talk a lot in the book about twins who find it hard to have a romantic relationship, who haven't found the intimacy they have in their twinship in romance.",
        "Exactly.",
        "It sort of becomes the paradigm of closeness, and it sets a very high bar.",
        "There were really many twins I interviewed who said they thought they'd never get married because there was no one else they'd rather be with.",
        "There was no one who they enjoyed as much.",
        "And you know, that's in a way a good problem to have.",
        "And some people listening said, you know, I'm sobbing for you, but it does get complicated when, kind of like intimacy can get in the way of other intimacy.",
        "And that's what happened with some twins is that in some ways, they're very good at intimacy because they've had it all their lives.",
        "In some ways, they've never developed the other muscle to have romantic relationships or even friendships that are intense or are fulfilling because they were so used to just having it when they woke up every morning or even when they got out of the womb.",

        "I did.",
        "I mean, there are quite a few friends that we had that said being with Robin and I was kind of a nightmare.",
        "Robin and I were also kind of - we didn't just look indistinguishable, but we were performers - and as I say in the book, you know, being identical twins is already a performance.",
        "You don't have to even open your mouth.",
        "You're already a little bit of a show, especially growing up in the '60s and '70s where there weren't that many - there weren't so many twins as there are now.",
        "We kind of were a phenomenon.",
        "And then to perform, it's kind of redundant, and I'm sure we drove everyone out of their minds.",
        "But one of the things that we did often on our play dates - they weren't called that then - was that we would have a friend over, and I think it was untenable to be with the two of us because you, kind of, were - it was like you were the odd person out of the club.",

        "He did, and he's very honest in the book about it, and I think again, that's a whole other book is siblings of twins.",
        "There is no way really to compete with that relationship, and so either you stake your own territory, or you kind of accept it.",
        "My brother did remarkably well, considering that I think we were a formidable pair.",
        "And he's obviously very supportive, but he even admitted to me in the book, now - which I had never known - that when he calls one of us, he calls the other; that when he visits one, he visits the other; that he in a way is always tallying in his own mind, almost reflexively, to make sure he's kept things equal.",
        "And do you think that's because one or the other of you would be insulted if you felt that he was getting closer to the other one?",
        "You know, I think if he - if you asked either Robin or I who's closer to my brother, we each might answer that and say I am.",
        "He's done a very good job in that regard.",
        "You do have a sense - even though Robin are not competitive in the sense that everyone predicts that twins are - there is a sense that you are glancing to your right or to your left all through your life.",
