        "Why the discrepancy do you think?",
        "Well, this is fascinating.",
        "I've had about a dozen interviews in the last day and I can't ever remember two studies having such similar results and having it being painted as so controversial.",
        "You know we did a study back on June and July of 2006 in which we tried to compare the death rate before the invasion with the death rate after.",

        "Normally, when we talk about death in the American Civil War, deaths in the holocaust, we're not just interested in deaths from bullets.",

        "And the war in Biafra, the war in Congo, 90 percent of all deaths were from the disruption not from the violence itself.",
        "So we found a death rate after the invasion 2.4 times higher, that is, mortality a little more than double.",
        "And this new survey found the death rate before and the death rate twice as high after.",
        "They also - and Ties was - Ties Boerma was very, I think, honest about this in the paper and was quite clear about it a moment ago.",
        "They knew they had underreporting.",
        "For example, before the invasion they had a death rate of about three deaths per a thousand people per year, that's about half the death rate in the United States and they knew it was too low.",
        "Most of the neighboring countries are more around five.",
        "In our survey we had found 5.5 and so they adjusted it up.",
        "So we actually agree on what the death rate was before the invasion.",
        "We agree on what the death rate was after the huge contrast between these two studies is that we think virtually all of that increase was from violence and they believe that only a third of the increase in mortality was from violence so…",

        "Probably what you're saying is your difference in World Health Organization's number is, if for example somebody died of a heart attack because of stress the stress you suggest may have been brought on by the conflict.",
        "Well, actually I'm not saying something quite that innocent.",
        "What I'm saying is that we interviewed households and we found a much higher, more than doubling of death rate after the invasion, and when we asked people how did your loved one die, the vast majority of the new excess deaths, in fact, the majority of all deaths were from violence.",
        "When this WHO and statistical bureau of Iraq survey was done and these government employees asked people how did your loved die, only about one in six deaths for them was said to be violence after the invasion.",
        "So for one reason or another we have pretty dramatic difference in the fraction of the excess deaths that were from violence.",
        "Hey, is there anyway to resolve this, do you think?",
        "You know the great thing is yes.",
        "This is a very easily resolved by National Public Radio because if we're right in our Lancet study of 2006, if National Public Radio were to go out to a handful of cemeteries across Iraq and every cemetery has a ledger were they keep track of who dies, the name, the date and they look at the death certificate and most ledgers they write down the cause of death.",
        "And if we're right over that first three years of occupation most deaths nationwide should have been from violence.",
        "And if this new WHO survey is correct only about one in six deaths will be from violence.",
        "And I would think, without doing a fancy scientific survey, people could go out and pretty quickly get a pulse on the causes of deaths in the last few years and decide which of these surveys is roughly correct.",
