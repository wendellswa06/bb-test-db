        "government to keep track of the wreckage in Iraq?",

        "I like to think of their responsibility as one of minimizing civilian harm, which is what they claim to do.",
        "So, I'm less concerned about what they're counting than that they're counting the things that they need to count in order to learn and make good on the vows to minimize civilian harm.",
        "And there's been some interesting developments on the ground in Iraq just in the last couple of years on that front, where I think the U.S.",

        "And that begs the question of whether or not - it really raises a more fundamental question, which is why do you want to know the numbers of civilian dead?",
        "And depending on why you want to know the numbers of civilian dead, you're going to have different requirements for your accuracy and you're going to have different corollary questions.",
        "So if you want to know the overall costs of war, then perhaps, surveys that include all causes of death and show you the change in the overall death rates or what you need them, and maybe to the person accuracy is not vital for that question.",

        "And if you're trying to do operational learning from a military perspective, it may be most important for you to identify the areas in which the largest number of civilians are being killed - that you really focus in on correcting the situation.",

        "I remember very well a couple of different conferences with military officials where everyone was questioning the method and the motive of the IBC's approach.",
        "And it wasn't until the first Lancet survey came out that everyone said, oh, well, goodness.",
        "The Iraq Body Count is so much more reliable.",
        "So the - our targets keep shifting.",
        "And I think the fundamental point is that if we really wanted to know, we could do all source data compilation and we could combine all the different methods that we know; each have their individual flaws.",
        "And we could get fairly, good gross approximations of the kind of humanitarian impact from war.",
