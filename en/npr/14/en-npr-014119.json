        "Let's see if we can go now to - this is Michael, Michael with us from Hickory, North Carolina.",

        "But I live up in Plackman Point(ph), in a rural area, and I'm happy with it like that.",
        "But I know it's got to change, and so you have to accept change, I guess.",
        "So like everywhere else, it's just a mix blessing, you know?",
        "Mixed blessings and silver linings have become the local specialty in St. Gabriel.",
        "Mike Pesca, NPR News.",
        "This is Talk of The Nation Science Friday.",
        "I'm Ira Flatow.",
        "With an ever-increasing population, it seems to be getting harder and harder for our planet to sustain us.",
        "And the signs of wear and tear are everywhere from soaring, food and energy prices to rising carbon dioxide levels to dwindling biodiversity.",
        "But can we turn the ship around?",
        "Well, my next guest thinks so.",
        "But it's going to take a change of attitude and a lot of effort.",
        "Joining me now to talk about his ideas for how economics and science and technology can help take some of the strain off the planet, is Jeffrey Sachs.",
        "He's director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University and special adviser to the U.N.",
        "secretary-general.",
        "His new book is \"\"Common Wealth: Economics for a Crowded Planet.\"\" And he joins us here in our New York Studio.",
        "Welcome back to Science Friday.",
        "It's great to be here, Ira.",
        "Good to see you.",
        "You've put those three challenges right up there at the top, overpopulation, global warming, and poverty.",
        "We are stretched, just as you said, and we're starting to bounce off the walls right now.",
        "Look at how the rapid economic growth in recent years has driven up oil prices to astounding levels.",
        "And just in the last year, we've had a doubling of food prices.",
        "Now, we can't predict exactly when and where these stresses are gonna hit.",
        "But it's, like you said, the wear and tear is pretty much everywhere now.",
        "Virtually every part of the Earth's systems, whether it's the water, whether it's the food production, whether it's the climate, whether it's the fisheries, whether it's the survival of other species.",
        "All of these factors are showing up with the flashing red alerts.",
        "But sometimes you feel that nobody is watching, at least none of our political leadership, because we go on and on, as if nothing has changed and as if there's no danger, thinking that normal economics is going to carry us through and it just won't.",
        "Some people get frustrated and think this problem is so big.",
        "Where do you tackle it?",
        "I think, like any good problem solving, you have to take it into its component parts, understand what the base of the problem is, understand what the nature of solutions might be.",
        "I start with the idea of a crowded planet, 6.7 billion people, now with enough economic productivity that the average output per person is about 10,000 dollars per year in the United States, of course much higher, in other countries much lower, but on average 10,000.",
        "So, with 6.7 billion people and 10,000 dollars of output per person on average, that's 67 trillion dollars of economic activity well over a 100, perhaps two or 300 times what it was when we got started on industrialization a couple of centuries ago.",
        "Well, this is all brand new for us because it's come so fast.",
        "Our institutions, economic principles, a way we observe the Earth have not caught up with all of the pressures we're putting on the Earth.",
        "And so, we don't really know what we're doing until we focus on it.",
        "Hey, do you think, speaking globally about global climate change and global warming, we keep hearing all the time that unless the developing countries, the big countries like China and India come on board and decide, especially China, if that is going to adopt pollution control and CO2 caps, that there's nothing that you know, no matter what we do, it's not going to really make much of a difference."

        "China now emits more carbon dioxide than the United States, as best we can tell.",
        "The cross-over point is approximately this year 2008.",
        "And China is still booming which means that with an economy that has been achieving economic growth of, say, 10 percent per year, that means a doubling period of seven years.",
        "Every seven years, the Chinese economy is doubling right now.",
        "So, they will far surpass us in total emissions of these greenhouse gases.",
        "We're still far ahead in emissions per person, but China is more than four times the population of the United States.",
        "Of course, the atmosphere doesn't care about per capita.",
        "It doesn't care about who's doing it.",
        "It cares about the total emissions.",
        "And that's why I say it's a matter of arithmetic that the United States, China, and other major emitters like the European Union, Japan, Russia, and so forth, are going to have to get together to take this on.",
        "And Ira, I think the point is that even where we are today, 67 trillion dollars of output, that's already enough pressure that if we carry on, we can't sustain where we are.",
        "But we're not stopping here with China's growth, with India's growth, with continued growth of the world's population.",
        "It's quite clear that we will absolutely run over a cliff in terms of the damages to the environment, to other species, to the ecosystems, to water availability, to oil availability, and so forth.",
        "We have to change course.",
        "But how do you - I'm talking with Jeffrey Sachs, author of \"\"Common Wealth: Economics for a Crowded Planet.\"\" How do you tell people who don't have what you have, hey, I want what you have?",
        "You can't keep me from saying, you know, you can't keep me from getting what you have.",
        "Well, you have to give up something.",

        "It's not a whim.",
        "A place that has no electricity right now, that has no access to an automobile, it means that a child dies before the child can get to a clinic for one dollar medicine.",
        "And we have millions of children dying of extreme poverty right now.",
        "So I don't tell them that at all.",
        "And I find the idea of somehow balancing the environment on the backs of the poor a horrendous idea that also won't work.",
        "What we need to do, Ira, is find ways to combine the legitimate desire for improving material life with the realities of the physical environment, and what we've had often is an unfruitful debate between those who deny the environmental harms, that's basically the Wall Street Journal editorial page, it's basically the Oval Office until very, very recently, and those who deny the value of economic development.",
        "But we don't help them to get the basic technologies already existing so they can double or triple their food supply, and that's the last D of the RDD&D.",
        "It's the \"\"diffusion\"\" part.",
        "We have to put to work the technologies that we have.",
        "Markets won't do it for the poorest people of the world, because the poorest people can't access the inputs on the market.",
        "And so the only way we can stop that or slow it down is to fight every single case and make it incredibly challenging for this administration to engage in mass deportation.",
