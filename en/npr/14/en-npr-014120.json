        "But in terms of politics, is there anything particular about being left handed that makes for better political skill?",
        "When it comes to something like political speeches, you're more likely to be integrating the literal elements of speech with the more figurative elements - the symbolism, visual imagery - and these are all very important when it comes to inspiring the electorate.",
        "In view of the fact that both of these candidates are left handed, would your research tell you whether they should pick a left-handed or a right-handed vice presidential candidate?",
        "Maybe they should pick a righty, so that there'd be one of each.",
        "Well, there's actually some research to show that the mixed handed are more likely to incorporate new information and update their beliefs and refresh their global perspective.",
