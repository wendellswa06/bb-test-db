        "Now, at the same time, world demand has been soaring.",
        "And that's because of the big growth in China.",

        "That's what we call our Subsidized Grain to Ethanol Program in the United States.",

        "And that's the perfect storm.",

        "Whereas in the United States, so we kind of had the market running around, lost public confidence, had the Three Mile Island and stopped building nuclear plants.",
