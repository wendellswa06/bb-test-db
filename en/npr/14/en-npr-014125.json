        "Yeah.",
        "On my stories - again, I can only speak from when I was working with the tabloids.",
        "But all of my stories, especially, the high-risk stories had to have three sources.",
        "And many of those sources had to take lie detector tests.",
        "They had to sign contracts.",
        "We had to have extra documentation, photographs to support their claims, because if what they were saying was false, the tabloids would go down.",
        "And that's why there are not a lot of lawsuits that are against the tabloids.",
        "The tabloids are generally ridiculed for their tactics.",
        "But the whole time that I was there, there was not one lawsuit or legal letter.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Was the job fun?",
        "Yes.",
        "I have to admit it was fun.",
        "I was young, and I was naive, and I loved the adrenaline involved, and I loved walking into the office and not knowing where I was going to be or what celebrity I was going to have to be following.",
        "And one day, I walked into the office and my editor said, Marlise, is your passport in order?",
        "And that was the one question I always longed to hear.",
        "And next thing I knew, I was flying off to Cairo to follow a celebrity, or I'd head off to London, or just be on planes all over the United States.",
        "And for me, that was exciting.",
        "That was - it was an adrenaline rush.",
        "So why did you quit?",
        "I couldn't justify what I was doing anymore.",
        "There eventually came a point where I was asked to write a headline involving a photo that I could tell that the photo had been doctored.",
        "And I took a look at it and I said I'm - I believe that this, in my opinion, this photo has been altered.",
        "And I'm afraid I can't write to this headline.",
        "And at that point, a lot of the competition was gone as well.",
        "In 1999, David Pecker came along and he bought American Media.",
        "And he bought out the National Enquirer and Star and Globe.",
        "And he also formed In Touch, Hello, OK.",
        "And there was this monopoly.",
        "And overnight, I was sitting next to my enemies in the same tabloids that I was trying to scoop week after week.",
        "And suddenly, here we were, friends.",
        "And for me, that really took away a lot of the excitement, and the competition was gone.",
        "So I couldn't justify it any longer.",
        "Well, Marlise Kast, thanks very much for being with us.",
        "Thank you for having me.",
        "Marlise Kast is the author of the book, \"\"Tabloid Prodigy.\"\" You can read about her first day on the job at the Globe at npr.org/talk.",

        "Well, it sort of - like a lot of people, I ended up in celebrity journalism not by intending to be in celebrity journalism, but to start off in newspapers.",
        "And I went to Columbia School of Journalism in the early '90s, when, really, newspapers still were thriving and there was a viable business there and a lot of jobs.",
        "And really, that's how I started.",
        "And just on a whim, I came out to Los Angeles, started working for People magazine in the mid '90s.",
        "And it's interesting, looking back, I was just, you know, listening to your guest and she was working at the time when the old-school tabloids - and I think it's very clear that we should define what tabloid means.",
        "I think that that word is thrown around a lot.",
        "And I was just sitting there and I actually, you know, Googled, and I said what's the definition of tabloid, anyway?",
        "And the only one that really fits to seem to be - that fits what we're talking about here is the fifth definition I see at dictionary.com.",
        "And it says luridly or vulgarly sensational.",
        "And I think that you have to make a distinction between celebrity journalism, celebrity media and tabloid media.",
        "And I think the big distinction is that, you know, what you're printing - do you believe it's true or not?",
        "And I think that a tabloid doesn't believe it's true and doesn't care if it's true.",
        "And a good example of that is - there's a couple of magazines now that are, sort of, wolves in sheep's clothing - Life & Style Weekly, In Touch Weekly.",
        "They sell for a dollar ninety-nine, a full dollar fifty cheaper than your Us Weekly or People magazine.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And they're glossy.",
        "They look pretty.",
        "They have pretty full-color photography.",

        "Now, I tell you, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie just went on a vacation to France together, had a great time.",
        "They are probably going to adopt another kid in the next year.",

        "Oh, and you long have you been playing the puzzle?",
        "The National Enquirer, the Globe, the Weekly World News, Star, the old-school tabloids aren't doing well because they are packaged in serving an older audience.",
        "But I just want to be clear that there is a distinction and I think that because a lot of the glossy magazines that are out there now - there are six glossy celebrity weeklies now, where they used to be just one, People magazine, then there were two, with Us Weekly and People.",
        "But now, there's all these imitators and I think it really confuses people where they don't even know what a tabloid is anymore.",
        "Well, does \"\"My Twisted Night with Brit,\"\" the headline on the cover of your current issue, doesn't that kind of fit the description of lurid?",

        "She was sort of the classic American success story: a girl from Louisiana who makes it big.",
        "And then she has a fall.",
        "And we did a cover story about how she essentially had a naked pool party on the top of the Standard Hotel.",
