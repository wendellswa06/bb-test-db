        "And perhaps there's something comforting in seeing someone who is more beautiful than you or richer, who has really the same human problems as you do.",
        "And I think so - in a lot of ways, the soap opera that has become the celebrity media, just connects with people on a very, every man level, every woman level.",

        "A lot of people who work at Us Weekly started of at newspapers and no one wants to see newspapers go away.",

        "There's been a lot of days where I've looked at some of these celebrities and I say, why are you living here?",

        "Now, no one wants to be assaulted or hounded or harassed.",
        "That's horrible.",
        "But I think if it's getting to the point where it is driving you crazy, you should step out.",
        "On the other hand, they should be allowed to live where they want to live and to conduct business as usual and go get a cup of coffee or something without the amount of paparazzi.",
        "If you - and I have to admit that I've been interested lately and it's a new interest for me.",
        "But from reading the tabloids that I've read lately, my overall opinion is, my God, this is disgusting.",
        "And if you ever see a picture with the paparazzi in the background, there are so many of them surrounding these people.",
        "You can't conduct a normal life that way and some of these people are too young to really make the decision, you know?",
