        "There's already a fence 14 miles long called the Tortilla Wall that separates the southwestern California from Mexico.",
        "Tell us about it.",
        "When was it built?",
        "The fence was built back 10, 15 years ago, I believe, beginning.",
        "But it's a series of three fences that essentially run from the Pacific Ocean about 14 miles inland, past San Ysidro, which is the main - actually, the biggest port of entry for the United States from Mexico.",
        "What does it look like?",
        "It's pretty intimidating, actually.",
        "From both sides, there's a - the main fence is concrete and steel that runs the United States most part of the line.",
        "And then there's two other fences behind that.",
        "These things are equipped with cameras and seismic sensors underground and on the fence itself.",
        "And lots of Border Patrol guys on ATVs and dune buggies and horseback.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "I know you've also talked with people on both sides of that fence.",
        "What do they think about it?",
        "The folks that I've talked to on the United States side, it's just part of life.",
        "It's there.",
        "They know it's there.",
        "They know that people get around it, under it, over it.",
        "On the Mexican side, if you talk to people in Tijuana and along the border, they see it as, frankly, kind of an affront.",
        "I've talked to folks down there who say - I asked them what it means to them.",
        "They say it's a sign of racism.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And all we want to do is go to the United States and work.",
        "But everyday, we look up at this thing and we have to pass through it to go to work.",

        "Depends on who you talk to.",
        "If you talk to the Border Patrol, of course, tells you that the number of illegals that they've captured has gone down from 530,000 in 1993 to about 127,000 in 2004.",
        "And that's just along this portion of the border.",
        "That's just along this portion of the border.",
        "But there are also, as you know, many ways to get around it.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "In the desert, the opponents of more fencing say it just pushes people in the desert.",
        "Last year, the number of dead in the desert went from about 330 a year ago to about 500 folks that were trying to cross the desert east of San Diego.",
        "And then you have 40 tunnels that were found over there underneath the fence in the past five years.",
        "And the Border Patrol says that one of the growing ways around it is Mexican nationals posing as fishermen and coming around the San Diego Bay.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So there are definitely ways around it.",
        "So, and if you're trying to get through that big crossing point, you mentioned, how long does it take if you're coming from the Mexico to the United States?",
        "It can take anywhere from an hour to several hours.",
        "The radio stations in Tijuana will broadcast, for instance, how long the border waits are.",

        "Exactly.",

        "That's right.",
        "And if you walked along the line every morning of folks coming into the United States from Mexico, they know that if they're at a certain shop on the side of the street there, it's going to take them 45 minutes.",
        "They know if it's backed up to the bridge there, it's going to take them an hour.",
        "Heh.",
        "And it's really is like commuting traffic in every other city in the country.",
        "Now, the proposals for this new fencing, in addition to this so-called Tortilla Wall, there's I guess about 60 miles of fencing at various other sports along the 700 or so miles of the U.S./Mexico border.",
        "But this is calling for hundreds of miles of stuff.",
        "And it sounds like the same kind of similar kinds of technology that you were talking about, you know, infrared cameras, motion sensors, devices to detect whether there's a tunnel being dug.",
        "That's my understanding, Neal.",
        "As you know, on other parts of the border there are bits and pieces of fence that are pretty raggedy, and anybody can get on, under, around them.",
        "The proposal in Congress would make it modeled after the 14 miles here in San Diego, which is significantly more formidable.",
        "And as I understand it, though, it requires - it's going to require an awful lot to coordinate all of these different sensor information.",
        "You know, to get all the information from all these different devices.",
        "And well, you know, I guess it depends how close to, you know, some disruption along the fence.",

        "He's with us from his office in Seattle.",
        "Nice to have you on the program as well.",
        "Well, that's a good point.",
        "Actually, last week, I talked to some Border Patrol folks about what they have technology wise out there now.",
        "And I'll give you an example.",
        "They have about 6,700 motion and seismic sensors along the border.",
        "They've got 413 cameras.",
        "A hundred and fifty-five mobile units with infrared cameras and night vision and things like that, that monitor the stretch of the border."

        "That's a good question.",

        "So that kind of favors, you know, halting the traffic - the illegal traffic across the border.",
        "But to do it for the entire length - and I believe you'd have to do something similar to this for the entire length of the U.S.-Mexican border - I still wonder if it would be effective, because the terrain goes through deserts and mountains, and I don't see how it's humanly possible.",
        "I mean, for 14 miles in an urban setting, where you have houses on both sides of the wall, this is - we are twin cities, San Diego and Tijuana.",
        "I mean, we are like, you know, Minneapolis, St. Paul.",
        "And so, it's easier to maintain it in an urban zone than in the wide-open spaces.",

        "Any estimate yet on what any of this hundreds of miles of fencing may cost?",
        "Billions, it would seem to be.",
        "Well, the Senate last week passed an amendment that would add 370 miles of fence that would cost about $900 million, or about 3.2 million a mile.",
        "The House - the separate House bill, would call for about 700 miles of fence, I believe, that would cost about 2.2 billion, which everybody thinks is a very small, a very low estimate, just based on the cost of the one in San Diego and elsewhere.",
        "I think what's going to happen is sometime after the Senate bill passes, probably this week, they'll go into conference and sort this out.",
        "And it may end up fenced somewhere in between those links, or who knows, maybe not at all.",
        "Bob Keefe, thanks very much for your time.",
