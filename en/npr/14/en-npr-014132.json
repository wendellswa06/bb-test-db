        "From the practical aspect, when as much anywhere from a third to a half of the illegal immigration is from visa overstays, I just don't see that being a particularly effective way to control that.",

        "However, on the areas where you have a fence, let's assume it was 90 percent a fence, that reduces the amount of area that you have to patrol to one-tenth.",
        "So if you concentrate your human resources on the parts that are not fenced, you've multiplied your effectiveness dramatically.",
        "It's a rather simple proposition.",
