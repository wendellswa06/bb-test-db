        "Well, Mark Trahant, what do you think?",
        "Would that be a good idea, to just open the border?",
        "No, I think you want them to come in the front door, through the border, where you can keep track of folks.",
        "I do think that we go through this debate in our country's history from time to time, and it's a regular repeating cycle.",
        "And we're just doing it again.",
        "As we did in, I guess most famously, back in 1924?",
        "Sure.",
        "The pressure is always greater.",
        "And, unfortunately, one of the things that I wrote about Sunday is, when this happens, it ends up being at a time when the economy goes south.",
        "So, those pressures are intertwined.",
        "And, Charles Krauthammer, you wrote in your article that the way it works now, the United States - and you sort of mentioned it again here - has no choice about who comes, as opposed to an immigration policy that selects for engineers, doctors, teachers, people that we want to come to the country.",
        "Well, precisely.",
        "We have, as I wrote in the column, we're sort of like in a position of an NFL team with the first million draft picks of the - millions of people around the world who want to come to America, who are languishing in lines at consulates all over the world, with endless processes to get a green card and who end up coming here in very small numbers.",
        "Why don't we admit them in larger numbers?",
        "If we can shut the border with Mexico, which is essentially open, we can decide who comes and when, with what skills.",
        "We are squandering one of the great assets of America, which is it is a magnet for the best and the brightest around the world, and would allow us to pick the kind of immigrants at whatever level of skill and education we want.",
        "But right now, we have essentially forfeited those decisions and left them entirely in the hands of people who come across the border at night.",
        "John, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Can I follow up on that?",
        "Yeah, go ahead please."

        "This is actually something - I think there may be some agreement here - well, except for the fence.",
        "Instead of putting your resources into the fence, I'd put a lot more into the State Department and to be able to get people to be processed across the world in a lot greater numbers, in smarter ways.",
        "I hear you, what you're saying, Mark Trahant, but how does that stop another 11 million people from walking across the border with Mexico?",
        "I think one of the reasons 11 million people are here is because there's a neat, orderly process to get in now.",
        "So there's so many barriers to them, many of the people who come across are low-skilled people who, under the program that Charles Krauthammer just described and you agreed with, wouldn't qualify?",
        "Well, I just was in the Yakama Valley where they need people to work, too.",
        "So it's a combination of - the combination of skilled workers and unskilled workers.",
        "But that 11 million people you take as a hard number, as much as half of that came on Visa overstays.",
        "So those folks would be here anyway.",
        "And Charles Krauthammer, he has a point, Visa overstays and, again, even if there's an effective fence, fishing boats, people can find other ways around and through.",
        "How many per boat?",
        "I mean, what we're talking about is taking a river, a torrent, which is totally out of control, and turning it into a few streams and trickles.",
        "Of course, they will still be people smuggled in at night on small boats, people who dig a tunnel under a fence, how many of those are possible?",
        "And how narrow a choke point is created when you do that.",
        "I mean, it seems obvious you will have these small streams and trickles, but those are obviously controllable by the kinds of resources and the people we have at the border.",
        "And what we have, this completely open space now, is completely uncontrollable.",
        "So yes, there will be very small trickles who will make it and that will happen and it will have generally no impact as a micro event on America, as a whole; whereas the huge numbers who come in now and who are here illegally has a huge effect - a macro effect on America, on the culture, on the language, on services - as we heard in that caller - all over the country, particularly in the southwest, but in the major cities everywhere.",

        "Hi, Margaret.",
        "I would just like to say that however much we spend on a fence, if we spend a million, a billion, a trillion, as long as our standard of living is so much higher than those around us, people that are poor will want to try to get here.",
        "And they'll, you know, break the law to get here or risk their lives.",
        "If we spend that amount of money on helping people in other countries raise their standard of living, they won't want to come here because, you know, they want to stay where their family is and where their language is.",
        "And I think that would be a better use of resources.",
        "I agree that if Mexico, tomorrow, acquired the standard of living of the United States, the pressure on the border would disappear; but that's a pipe dream.",
        "I believe in NAFTA, which over perhaps half-a-century or a century may accomplish that.",
        "But in the meantime, we've got half-a-century and a century.",
        "I'll give you a counter-example.",
        "Australia has a huge standard of living compared with all of its neighbors, but it doesn't have a flood of immigrants.",
        "Why?",
        "It's an island.",
        "If it had a frontier like ours with Mexico it would have had exactly the problem that we have.",
        "So it has what we are proposing, a physical barrier, namely ocean, God-given, which protects them from waves of illegal immigration.",
        "And what I'm arguing is we have that everywhere except for one stretch, which is where the flood of immigrants is coming from.",

        "And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And Mark Trahant, I wanted to ask you about another point you made in your piece, I guess it was yesterday.",
        "And that is the symbolism of this fence along the border with Mexico and the idea of the United States walling itself off from the rest of the world.",
        "Right, that's what troubles me the most.",
        "It's not just this one issue, but we're in this period of time where we're starting to move toward lots of walls and fences.",
        "Here in the Northwest, we're having a great discussion about whether or not you should need a passport to go into Canada and back and forth.",
        "And it's interesting to me, because I talked to my colleagues on the other side of the border and they laugh and say, it's not as much of an issue in Canada because Canadians have passports.",
        "They don't think of it the same way; whereas here it's a big deal because so few Americans have passports."

        "But what I would do is to say, yes, it's going to be aesthetically ugly and perhaps a bad symbol, although that would be a misinterpretation.",
        "But I would declare that, on the day the wall was completed, on the day the golden spike - the golden chain link is placed right in the middle where the two halves meet, I would begin legalization for all 11 million in America.",

        "Where there isn't a fence, the further out from town you go, it's like where I am today there's like a two-strand barbwire fence that anything could come through.",

        "Where there is a fence and cameras, it's easy to catch them.",
        "So to whatever extent that helps, fences do make it easier to catch the aliens.",
        "And what I've heard though is, people cut through the fences, people even blow holes in them?",
        "Well, the fences like in San Diego and where I work and such, they vary in height and stuff, but they're pretty much a solid metal fence.",
        "And sometimes, yes, they will blow torch holes through them or jump over them or something.",
        "But to do that takes more time and energy and it's easier for us to catch them.",
        "Whereas where there's no fence, like out in the desert there's just a barbwire fence, groups of 20 or 50 come cruising through; they drive vehicles through with drugs and aliens and there's just nothing.",
