        "He says it's possible for speculators to drive the price up, but it's just as easy for speculators to drive the price down.",
        "So why is it that we only hear about speculators when the price is rising?",
        "Why don't we ever hear people shouting about how speculators are driving down the price of oil?",
        "Well, that doesn't make good media coverage, and it doesn't certainly make good politics.",

        "He's a speculator.",
        "So I found an economist named Dan Murphy.",

        "He crunched a lot of numbers, and he came up with an answer.",
        "How much did speculators affect the price?",
        "They played a negligible role.",
        "Nothing?",
        "So yeah, I would say it's pretty much negligible.",
        "So if it wasn't speculators, what was driving up the price?",

        "Then you go to deep-water offshore off the coast of Brazil.",

        "And so on, all the way up to oil that costs more than $100 a barrel to get out of the ground.",
        "So here is what sets the price of oil.",
        "You take all the oil people are buying today.",
