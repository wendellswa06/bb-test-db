        "And the engines have worked before but not at Jupiter before.",

        "Well, this is the crazy thing.",
        "It takes 48 minutes for a radio signal to come from Jupiter to the Earth.",
        "So in fact this entire thing will have happened before we ever hear about it on Earth because it's 35 minutes for the rocket and 48 minutes for the radio signal.",
        "But as the engine is firing, there will be tones coming from the spacecraft that will say, hey, I've switched on the engine.",
        "And they can also measure the Doppler shift - this is a slight change in frequency of the radio signal coming from the spacecraft - and that will tell them that it's slowing down.",
        "So they'll get a tone at the start and a tone at the end.",
