        "He joined us by Skype to explain his team's research into what they call multi-sensory food perception.",
        "I suppose flavor is probably one of the most multi-sensory of our experiences - or our everyday experiences - because it does involve taste and more smell than we realize.",
        "But all the senses come together to kind of give us that one unified experience of flavor.",
        "So some of the things you've done in your research, the connections with taste, say, smell and even how things look, that makes a sort of intuitive sense.",
        "But I was really surprised to hear there was a link between taste and hearing."

        "All of the things we think of as kind of the texture of foods are actually being experienced as much by the sounds we hear.",
        "What's even more surprising, I think, is that the sounds in the environment in which we eat and drink have an impact too.",
        "And that could be everything from, you know, listening to the sounds of the sea maybe enhancing the taste of the seafood that you might eat - foods that we're working on a lot at the moment and it's very exciting to us is it's kind of the synesthetic sound.",
        "So we find that when we give people sweet tastes to try or bitter tastes that they all normally match those tastes with different sounds, so sweet tastes seem to make people think more of high-pitched sounds.",

        "Could you give us an example of one of those pairings?",
        "A dark chocolate or a coffee-tasting dessert, then something like a Pavarotti \"\"Nessun Dorma,\"\" with kind of much more low-pitched sounds seem to be the perfect complement to help bring out those kind of bitter tastes in the dark chocolate or in the coffee.",
