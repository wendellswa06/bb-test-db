        "So, anthropologists and writers and historians, Steve, have been exploring the idea of rituals for decades.",
        "But I was surprised to find there's actually very little quantitative research into the effects that rituals have on our lives.",
        "And when you say rituals, you mean like the \"\"Happy Birthday\"\" song, the cake being carried out, the candles being lit and blown out?",
        "The whole deal, all right.",
        "Precisely.",
        "I recently came by some interesting work by Francesca Gino at the Harvard Business School, and along with Kathleen Vohs, Yajin Wang and Michael Norton, they've just completed the first rigorous quantitative study on the effects that rituals have on eating.",
        "OK.",
        "What did they find?",
        "So they ran a series of experiments, in one of them, they give volunteers chocolate bars and they ask some of the volunteers to perform a ritual.",
        "Now without unwrapping the candy bar, they said break the candy bar in half, then unwrap one half, eat the candy, unwrap the other half, and then eat the other half of the candy.",
        "OK.",
        "Now you're going to tell me what the result is.",
        "But while you're doing that, I have this candy bar here that I'm going to work on.",

        "So go on.",
        "Go on.",
        "Keep talking.",
        "So they told the other volunteers to eat the candy bar exactly as they would like.",
        "And Francesca Gino told me there was a huge difference in the experience of people who had performed the ritual.",

        "When people engage in rituals - very simple rituals - we see that, in fact, what they tasted was more flavorful, they savored it for longer and they would be willing to pay a higher price for what they just ate.",
        "Wow.",

        "What about stuff that doesn't taste so good?",
        "So they ran the same experiment with carrots, Steve, and they found the same thing happened.",
        "So across the board, rituals seem to increase anticipation and make people more mindful of what they were eating.",
        "Performing a ritual before you eat a carrot apparently makes the carrot more tasty than it was before.",
        "So the researchers then said, is it possible it's just performing some kind of physical activity before you eat that makes the difference.",
        "So they had people perform these random physical gestures, and they found that didn't make the difference.",
        "They also found that watching someone else perform a ritual did not have any effect.",
        "You had to do it.",
        "You had to follow a very specific script.",
        "And it was doing the ritual every single time that gave the ritual its power.",

        "Yeah.",

        "My husband looked at me the other day as I was making my morning coffee.",
        "And once again, I put the milk that was at a certain level, for 66 seconds in the microwave, and he asked me about it.",
        "And I said this is my morning ritual and I believe that it's making me having a better time when I drink my coffee.",
        "And he looked at me and said, why don't you describe it as OCD behavior?",
        "So Steve, when she says OCD behavior, of course, she's talking about obsessive compulsive disorder and that's a very serious disabling disorder.",
        "And I guess the difference between a ritual and OCD is in the case of the disorder, you have the ritual taken to such an extent that it becomes disabling.",
        "So the question to ask really is: is the ritual helping you or is it hindering you?"
