        "And Sean, let's go through the list.",
        "First off, who's the most significant?",
        "Well, that would be Mullah Khirullah Khairkhwa.",
        "He's one of the founding members of the Taliban.",
        "He was a refugee growing up in Pakistan and doesn't really have much of a formal education, though he's actually described as extremely intelligent.",
        "And he held a number of positions during the Taliban rule, such as spokesman, interior minister and governor of the western province of Herat.",
        "And he's alleged to have had direct association with Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar, who's the head of the Taliban.",
        "And his file also says he was friends with President Hamid Karzai.",
        "And he was picked up in early 2002.",
        "OK, so who is next in the top tier?",
        "Next would be Norullah Noori.",
        "He was captured in the fall of 2001.",
        "And he also held a number of civilian posts in the Taliban regime - including the Governor of Northern Balkh Province.",
        "And his file states that he also commanded Taliban forces in northern Afghanistan, even though he claims he never had any military training.",
        "And also his file states the U.N.",
        "suspects he was involved in the murder of thousands of Afghan Shiites.",
        "And there's a third man who is a high-ranking political figure as well right?",
        "That's Abdul Haq Wasiq.",
        "Correct.",
        "And he's currently in his early forties and studied at Madrassas, in Pakistan.",
        "And he ultimately became the deputy head of Taliban intelligence.",
        "His cousin was actually the intelligence chief at the time.",
        "And Wasiq was captured in a sting operation in the fall of 2001.",
        "And when he was captured, he claimed to have been trying to help the U.S.",
        "capture Mullah Omar.",
        "But he's also accused of having Al-Qaida members train Taliban intelligence and having ties to a number of other Islamist groups.",
        "So those first three were part of the Taliban's actual government.",

        "And what do we know about Abdul Nabi Omari?",
        "He also studied at Madrassas in Pakistan and fought against the Soviets in the 1980s.",
        "And then he returned to Pakistan for a while for further religious training.",
        "He bounced in and out of the Taliban government and claims he was actually recruited by the CIA in 2002 to help find Mullah Omar and Al-Qaida members.",
        "And he's arguably the least significant of the five detainees, but it appears he was released because of his connections to the Haqqani network, who are aligned with the Taliban and based in Pakistan.",
        "And they're the ones actually believed to have been holding Bergdahl for much of his time in captivity.",
        "So what is the risk these men are going to return to the fight?",
