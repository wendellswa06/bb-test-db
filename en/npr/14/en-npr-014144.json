        "And now, we're still beginning to understand that as well.",
        "So you can detect this amyloid plaque, which is there if there is Alzheimer's, but might also be there even if there's not?",

        "That's what we're on the threshold of being able to do.",
        "What we've discovered over the last eight years that we've had amyloid imaging is that this isotope is actually attaching itself to fibular forms of amyloid.",
        "We believe that an abundance of fibular amyloid may trigger the cascade into Alzheimer's disease, but we also know there are some people who can walk around with a head full of this fibular amyloid and still stay normal.",

        "The local hospitals are in terrible shape.",
        "So we are paying a big price of Somalia being allowed to turn into a failed state.",
        "But, on a more positive note, there are some encouraging data of people being reached, and we are talking about close to a million Somalis are being reached, but a million against 3.7 million Somalis at risk.",
