        "A lot of commercial fish, he says, is actually imported; 84 percent of the seafood eaten in the U.S.",
        "And some studies say that maybe a quarter of fish out there is mislabeled.",

        "Schreibman has been developing it for years.",
        "It recirculates the water from any municipal water source, and it's small enough to go pretty much everywhere.",
        "That's why he calls it urban aquaculture.",
        "Our systems are so designed that we could use saltwater or freshwater or anything in between.",
        "We can use temperatures close to freezing or warm temperatures.",

        "So remember we talked about the fish tank?",
        "This is the fish tank, right?",
        "Schreibman is using a slightly tweaked version of the same filter system to grow plants on the surface of the water in the fish tank."
