        "I think that this, and perhaps providing additional incentives, for states to permit exploration off their coasts would be very helpful in the short term in resolving our energy crisis.",
        "Days later Senator Barack Obama fired back in Jacksonville, Florida, where drilling isn't such a popular idea.",
        "It would have long-term consequences for our coastlines but no short-term benefits since it would take at least ten years to get any oil.",

        "The companies have to probe the seabed to find out what's there, then there's years of exploratory drilling; if, says Simmons, anyone can find rigs to do the drilling.",
        "The problem is that the worldwide capacity to building rigs now has a backlog going out to about 2013.",
        "And we won't add enough rigs to even start to replace the very old rig fleet that we have.",
