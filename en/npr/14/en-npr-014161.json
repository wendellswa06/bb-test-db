        "Tony, that's such a great question because some of these job fairs are asking people to pay a little a bit of money to come in.",
        "If 5,000 people line up to get 50 jobs, someone is profiting.",

        "There are others.",
        "They're less than they were, but they're still are holding value.",

        "You don't know anything for sure.",
        "There are other stocks, Tony, that really there are questions to be raise about their evaluation, about their basic fundamentals, and I think that if we look at some of the bank stocks and some of the auto stocks and there's some other things where certainly, there maybe less value than there was, and if there is less value don't believe that because the stock is trading less than a dollar that you're going to get a bargain.",

        "People who have bad credit ratings, who have not been current with their mortgages - there are number of things that put a lot of these 12 percent of the people outside of the safety net of help.",
        "Well, you know, the other question, it seems to me, Dr. Malveaux, at least one that you can hear if you follow it in the press on television and radio, and well, as well as in print is this argument over who should be helped or the people who need it.",
        "It's agreed, everybody needs it but who is - for lack of a better term - worthy of being helped and who is not.",

        "I mean, I'm hurting because maybe I'm laid off but I've got a reasonable mortgage that I can pay.",
        "You, on the other hand, got a second and then you got another and you refinanced, and our two houses are sitting next door to each other worth about the same amount of money, you owe half a million dollars, I owe 200,000 and I've been paying.",

        "At the same time - and when I get help, I'm your next door neighbor, I don't default that helps the person who's next door because, a vacancy next door is going to make my property value go down.",
        "So, we're all interconnected here.",
        "But there are lots of people who are feeling that there are some inequities here and those are the things that I think the legislation and the courts will work out.",

        "These equity questions aren't going to go away, but if I'm in a neighborhood where I've been the good guy and six of my neighbors haven't been, I don't benefit everything if the next thing I know, their doors and windows boardered up around me because my property value goes down too.",
        "Our time is up but that's one of the failings of the stimulus plan and the mortgage relief plan, isn't it?",
