        "Well, Texas has a very large influence on the rest of the nation.",
        "Texas is one of the largest states that decides its curriculum on a statewide level and purchases textbooks on a statewide level.",
        "So publishers actually publish their books to the Texas mandates.",
        "And Texas buys 110 percent of the enrollment right out of the chute so textbook manufacturers can recoup their investment right off the bat and end up selling those books in other markets.",
        "And how does that the process work?",
        "The school board doesn't write the textbooks.",
        "No.",
        "The board actually has experts that first write a draft of the standards, and the elected state Board of Education then revises those standards.",
        "And the publishers then need to write textbooks that meet the standards that were - are passed by the Board of Education.",
        "And much of your documentary is debates in the Texas School Board over these exact standards.",
        "It's an open and lively conversation.",
        "Indeed, yeah.",
        "It's a very lively conversation.",
        "In Texas, members of the state Board of Education are elected from large districts.",
        "The film focuses on a few them, including Don McLeroy, who served as chairman.",

        "From your perspective, what was this debate all about?",
        "Oh, the debate from my perspective is all about restoring scientific integrity to the teaching of science.",
        "And so in the evolution debate, there were two standards that were added in the section on evolution, and the two standards just challenged some of evolution's most glaring weaknesses in explaining the fossil record and the complexity of the cell.",
        "And so it leaves open, scientists say, through the backdoor consideration of creationism and smart design - intelligent design, excuse me.",
        "You know, intelligent design.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, I totally disagree with that characterization of opening the backdoor.",
        "What we're doing is just putting in strong science standards.",
        "The science magazine, you know, the American Association for the Advancement of Science reported after we passed the standards that new science standards for Texas schools strike a major blow to the teaching of evolution.",
        "And really, they're right because what they do is, when they highlight these weaknesses, now the textbooks have to explain these weaknesses.",
        "And there was one standard added about the fossil record to explain the sudden appearance in stasis and sequential nature of groups in the fossil record.",
        "There was another one that had the students analyze (unintelligible) scientific explanations concerning the complexity of the cell.",
        "And if you - Darwin, in his book \"\"Origin of Species\"\" said that the fossil record was the greatest difficulty with his theory, and it's still a great difficulty for his theory.",
        "It doesn't support it.",
        "And then, he didn't even realize that the cell needed an explanation.",
        "I mean, what we've learned in just phenomenal since the days of Darwin.",
        "I mean, he goes into no enough details to try to explain things about the complexity of the cell.",
        "The good news is our Texas students are now going to evaluate for themselves.",
        "They can test for themselves to see how strong the evidence is.",
        "A big blow to the teaching of evolution.",
        "You say - at one point, you're quoted in the film when you were chairman as saying the power that you held - given the publishing facts that we heard just a moment ago, the power that you had was mindboggling."

        "Well, of course not.",
        "I don't think it's very nice.",
        "Actually, let me clarify.",
        "First of all, it wasn't - my opponent did not ran that ad.",
