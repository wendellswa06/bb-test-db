        "Yes.",
        "I cannot express how frustrating it is to be an educator from Texas.",
        "I started out thinking I want to be a teacher, and I'd want to teach history, geography, things like that in the state of Texas.",
        "And as I progress through the teacher program at Texas Tech, I realized that I wouldn't have a say in what I got to teach my students.",
        "Even I'm not teaching science or evolution, what I got to teach is completely mandated by the state, and I didn't agree with it.",
        "And it's very frustrating to have people who are not educators telling me or telling any educator, what I can or what we can or cannot teach those children.",
        "And if we don't agree with it, there's nothing we can do about it.",
        "Their children may not pass the state exam.",

        "Yes, there are.",
        "Actually, the person running against Don, Thomas Ratliff really wanted to give a lot of the power back to the teachers, and one of his platforms is really to take the politics out of public education and really - and let the experts in the field and the teachers really dictate what's in the curriculum.",
        "I think Truman and Dewey in '48.",
        "Well, I did say that.",

        "I read Stephen Jay Gould and Dawkins, and I have all their books, and I've read and thought seriously about it.",
        "But I think the caller has a really good point.",
        "Why in the world should somebody at a state level to decide?",
        "Right now, the policy is state-by-the-state legislators.",
        "It's not by Mr. Ratliff or anybody on the state board education decides that the teachers have to teach what's in the standards.",
        "This is all really fairly recent.",
        "When - my wife grew up in Houston.",
        "I grew up in Dallas.",
        "We both, basically, have the same education.",
        "There were no state standards, but there's a thing that the - all educator - if you want to debate this, go to your education establishment, the leaders in the education world because they're the ones that have come up with this standards-based reform to try to help educate our students.",
        "And that this is a result of standards-based reform, the standards are the thing that frustrates so many teachers.",
        "And I agree with them.",
        "I think - I don't mind having it go back to the local control.",
        "I thought it was disingenuous in the campaign that Mr. Ratliff would bring this up when he has no say-so over it.",
        "All right.",
