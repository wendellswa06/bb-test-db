        "United has argued it needs to replace its pensions with cheaper alternatives in order to attract investors to help it exit bankruptcy.",

        "It isn't the plans in themselves, but it's that total compensation package.",
        "It's a relatively easy thing to go after also, because the world is changing, and fewer and fewer companies are offering them.",
        "If the pension deal between United and the PBGC is approved, United says federal and bankruptcy law prohibits the unions from striking.",
        "The unions say that's only true if their contracts are intact, and tomorrow United may be back in bankruptcy court seeking to nullify at least two union contracts.",

        "You know, we just heard from one of our reporters that women who have been serving in Iraq are much closer to combat than women have been in previous wars.",
        "What kinds of new issues does that bring up for them?",
        "Well, I think that's very true.",
        "First of all, women in this military have become totally integrated and are serving side-by-side with men in units.",
        "Often times, though, women are really a small minority of those who were in those units.",
        "And it poses a lot of issues for them, safety issues are one in which women can be concerned about, going to the bathroom, for example, in the middle of the night.",
        "It's very dark in - on these bases in Iraq.",
        "And they're so much fearful about going to the bathroom both because of Iraqi potentially ambush, but also for whoever else on their own base might be around.",
        "So that's one small arena in which their service with men in a fully integrated military is different."

        "This is - not an insignificant portion of the women that we've seen have experienced sexual trauma, both before the Iraq conflict, and we're seeing a significant numbers of sexual trauma happening in Iraq.",

        "It extends the gamut of all of that.",

        "Are there any figures that can help us understand what percentage of women veterans have gone through something like that?",

        "But what happened in the last decade is that these other groups who get a lot more attention - doctors, economists, scientists - have begun to realize that the traditional neighborhood, and particularly urban neighborhoods, are much more sustainable environmentally, much more successful economically and much, much better for us in terms of our health.",
