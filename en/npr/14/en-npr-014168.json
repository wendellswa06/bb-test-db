        "Exactly how strong it is in terms of material is unclear.",
        "And I think the Iranian interest in this is the Saudis, as we know, are very much involved in trying to unseat Assad, who is extraordinarily important to Iran.",
        "And Iran coming in and providing support to follow Shia is a way of distracting the Saudis.",
        "And in that sense, the Iranians have been terribly successful because we have reports of a 150,000 Saudi troops on the border, a large number of aircraft and ships and everything being pulled into Yemen.",
        "Everything that's being pulled into Yemen is not being focused on Syria or, for that matter, ISIL.",
        "So as an Iranian gambit, to pull the Saudi's away from what they consider more important, it was a very good gambit.",
        "Their fundamental deep interest in Yemen is marginal.",
        "Of course, you were the U.S.",
        "ambassador when the Cole was attacked in Yemen in 2000.",
        "The recent attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris came from al-Qaida in Yemen.",
        "What are the implications for the United States if there's a government in Yemen that is not aligned with U.S.",
        "counterterrorism efforts?",
        "There's no question that that's going to be devastating to our ability to operate against al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.",
        "An irony of all of this, though, is that one of the Houthi's prime targets is al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, and al-Qaida knows this.",
        "And whether or not ISIS was behind the attack on the mosque over the weekend, it really had all the hallmarks of al-Qaida.",
        "The best for al-Qaida is - to the extent that everyone is focused on the Houthi and everyone else - al-Qaida has a vacuum.",
        "We are now out.",
        "Our ability to do drones is going to be at least degraded by not having anyone on the ground.",
        "So that everyone's going to be way too busy to pay much attention to them, and they're going to be able to operate with greater impunity.",

        "I'm not at all convinced that there is a Saudi military solution to this.",
        "It's going to be a political solution, and then we are going to have to put the same amount of time, attention, resources into helping Yemen succeed as we put in to trying to defeat al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.",
        "Ambassador Barbara Bodine, who is now the director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University, thank you so much for being with us.",
        "My pleasure.",
        "The threat of potential pipe bombs going to prominent Democrats and a news outlet like CNN prompted President Trump to dial back his partisan rhetoric, at least temporarily.",
        "The president was restrained during a campaign rally in Wisconsin last night.",
        "By this morning, he was back on the offensive.",

        "This is exactly the sort of message one expects to hear from a president at a time when the country's frazzled nerves need soothing.",
        "Like presidents before him, Trump urged partisans not to demonize their opponents and TO settle their differences peacefully at the ballot box.",
        "When it came time to draw contrast with the Democrats, Trump self-consciously turned down the temperature from his usual scorched-earth rhetoric."

        "Tonight, around 2 AM Eastern time, if all goes according to plan, a 820-pound NASA spacecraft will collide with a comet, setting off an explosion that could produce a crater the size of a football field.",
        "The collision will take place 83 million miles from Earth and it's intentional.",
        "A second spacecraft will be taking pictures.",
        "Scientists hope the mission, called Deep Impact, will reveal the raw material inside comets.",

        "Carey Lisse has been working on the Deep Impact mission for six, going on seven years of his life.",
        "He says he's a logical guy, but he was still nervous when the spacecraft was sitting on the launchpad.",
        "And, frankly, though he can think of no reason to doubt that everything will go as planned, he's a little nervous about the collision, which will happen at 23,000 miles an hour.",
        "The hard part of our experiment is making sure the spacecraft hits the comet.",
        "It's the size of the Appalachian Mountains.",
        "It sounds big to you and me, but it's tiny compared to the solar system.",
        "It's about 14 kilometers acr--long and about maybe seven wide, and we're doing this 90 million kilometers away from us.",
        "The hard part is actually making sure we hit the thing.",
        "The spacecraft was released last night from the Deep Impact mother ship.",
        "Scientists call the little one the Impactor.",
        "It's carrying over 300 pounds of copper, and its job is to get in the path of the comet.",
        "The comet is called Tempel 1, and scientists want to hit it sunny side so that they can get a good view of the explosion and what they hope will be a giant crater.",
        "In the final hours, the Impactor will have to steer itself.",
        "David Spencer is the mission manager and an engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",
        "He says the comet is a bit of a moving target.",
        "We're encountering Tempel 1 just as it reaches its closest point to the sun in its orbit.",
        "And at that point, the comet's at its most active.",
        "It's got volatile material that's been underneath the surface, and as it gets heated up, there are small explosions or outbursts on the surface of the comet.",
        "Each one of those explosions makes the comet dance around.",
        "So trying to impact this comet is kind of like trying to hit a knuckleball.",
        "It's not going in a smooth path; it's dancing around.",
        "Total mission cost is $333 million.",

        "Well, I'm confident that we're going to hit the comet, so that's not really a worry.",

        "I think that's my biggest fear.",
        "A ka-thunk with just a sputtering of debris would still be interesting he says.",
        "Comets are sometimes called dirty snowballs, but no one knows if they have the consistency of densely packed snow or ice or something airy and light.",
        "The material inside is thought to be among the oldest in the solar system, relics from a time over four billion years ago when the planets formed, material scientists have never really seen before."
