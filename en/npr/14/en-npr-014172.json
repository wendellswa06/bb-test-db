        "So I guess the question is how did it actually get on that bag.",
        "Well, when people become violently ill, the virus is aerosolized, and it lands, anywhere.",
        "So when you're in an enclosed space like a bathroom, like most of us are when we're ill, and the virus goes up in the air, it lands on the countertops, toothbrush, everywhere.",
        "And then if we don't clean those surfaces in that environment, we can transmit disease.",
        "Well, how long can it stay on your toothbrush or your light switch and then be - still be contagious?",
        "We have - there are varying reports on that, but it's estimated that at least two weeks the virus can stay alive on a normal surface.",
        "Two weeks?",
        "Yeah."

        "Is it something special about norovirus so that it can survive so long on, you know, outside of the human body or outside of a host?",
        "It's a beautiful pathogen, and it knows how to spread itself very well by aerosolizing.",
        "That's why the onset is so extreme, and that's why a lot of people unfortunately pass away from the virus, because they can't survive the onset.",

        "Does it sort of hibernate?",
        "Do we know?",

        "Well, the norovirus actually has the lowest infectious dose of any virus known.",
        "It only takes 18 viral particles to get an infection, which is practically nothing when you think there are over a billion of the viruses in one gram of feces.",

        "And from determining it was the cookies and what the cookies were in, we were able to put the piece together.",
        "But it took three interviews with the teammate that - excuse me, with the team players to actually get out the information that somebody had gone into the bathroom and retrieved the bag.",
        "I bet they felt bad about that.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Oh, it was horrible.",
        "I could - I was speaking to the person, and she started putting it together.",
        "She's like, oh, oh, no. It's the bag, isn't it?",
        "It's my fault.",
        "I'm like, no, no, no. We're not - we don't know anything yet.",
        "We're just trying to put this together.",
        "And, oh, yeah, you could see her connecting dots, and she was upset, of course.",

        "Is it really like a sort of detective work-type of field?",
        "Absolutely.",
