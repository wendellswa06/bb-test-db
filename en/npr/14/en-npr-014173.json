        "And it was sort of only a matter time until the court agreed to hear it.",
        "Essentially, this is a challenge to the lethal injection protocol under the sort of constitutional question, is it cruel and unusual punishment under the Eight Amendment that would need to require it to be struck down?",
        "Currently, 38 of the 39 states that use the death penalty, with the exception of Nebraska, have essentially some version of a three-drug protocol.",
        "And a lot of recent studies - medical studies - have shown, and then recent executions have sort of borne out the fact that the three-drug protocol may in fact cause horrific pain to the prisoner before he dies; and that in fact the first drug in the protocol may mask that pain so that we don't actually see how much he's suffering.",

        "They have certainly staid some executions subsequently.",
        "But for instance, Justice Scalia has been very clear that this is not a decision that suggests that there is a moratorium, and that it doesn't mean that every other execution will be staid.",
        "So we have all the states and the state courts sort of in a hodgepodge of postures trying to decide how best to sort of honor the Supreme Court's decision to hear this case, but not really clear what it is that is in fact going on.",
        "It seems to me that this case is about lethal injections.",
        "But isn't it hard for people and their views on capital punishment itself not to get kind of tied up in all of that?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, one of the things that's become very interesting as a strategic matter, Alex, is that the fight over the lethal injection protocol is, you know, sort a mask for a larger fight about the death penalty.",
        "And in fact, one of the ironies here is that what could come out of this case, presumably, is a kinder, gentler way of killing people that wouldn't at all satisfy death penalty opponents.",
        "So it's a very, very strange sort of twist in a larger drama about whether or not we should be executing people at all to sort of be fighting over a nicer, sweeter way to execute them in the first place.",
        "And does a kinder, gentler way exist, other than this cocktail that has been used?",
        "You know, it's very interesting.",
        "One of the things that happened is that this cocktail has been used for decades without really reexamining whether medical science had kept up.",
        "And one of the things that, for instance, Justice Souter has said at oral argument in similar cases in the Supreme Court is we no longer kill dogs this way.",
        "It's illegal to kill animals the way we're killing people in this country.",
        "Clearly, there's a disconnect here.",
        "And I will add that the creator himself of the lethal injection protocol that we use today - his name is Dr. Jay Chapman - he himself has said we can do much, much better if we're really interested in doing away with cruel and unusual executions.",
        "You know, we could just use an anesthetic.",
        "Other pro-death penalty groups have said, you know, we could just use carbon monoxide.",
        "We could use an overdose of barbiturates.",
        "So in fact, we're all sort of in agreement that even if we are for the death penalty in general, there are better ways to go.",
        "But somehow, this protocol sort of got locked in and hasn't changed over decades.",
        "It's an interesting - as I said, it's an interesting strategic problem in addition to a moral problem."
