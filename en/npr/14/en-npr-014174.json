        "The move to tribalism in this moment is suggestive of deep fissures that are making it harder to do things that have unified the country in the face of real threats in the past, and that's worrisome.",

        "Like, how would you describe the mood there?",
        "Well, last week was a particularly intense week around this matter in that there were two big breaking news stories that were happening almost simultaneously.",
        "The release of the grand jury report into abuse at six of Pennsylvania's eight dioceses in August triggered a very heated statute of limitations debate in the legislature.",
        "There were victim advocates trying yet again - they've been trying annually since 2002 - to try to get a change to state law that would allow them as adults to sue the Catholic church for what had been done to them.",

        "Well, there are a couple of perspectives that, you know, I've tapped into.",
        "I started writing about this on and off in 2002 as a reporter, and what I noticed was initially a lot of anger toward us, and how dare you bash the church?",
        "And that has faded significantly in the last several years as I've done more reporting, as more grand jury work has come out, as I've done my own investigative work on this.",
        "It is overwhelmingly a different story.",
        "I hear from people who describe themselves as Catholics who are now disaffected, who are angry, who want to side with the victims, who say, enough is enough with the bishops.",

        "There's a deep distrust, I think, and shock that this institution seems to have shown such a pattern internally of very, very bad behavior and no sanction.",
        "Is there a sense that the federal investigation is a step in the right direction?",

        "I think many, many people, including people who didn't necessarily agree with Mattis on everything, felt that he was a stable figure.",

        "So I think there's a lot of alarm around the world and in Washington, including from a lot of Republicans that miss - that a lot will be missing when Mattis goes.",
        "Whether we think this was a mismatch with the president in the first place or not, his resignation leaves the Pentagon in flux, leaves the national security team in flux and notably comes as the White House chief of staff is in flux and the attorney general and the U.N.",
        "ambassador and the interior secretary.",
        "Reihan, is this a whole lot of chaos at the moment even by the standards of 2018?",
        "Well, truthfully, I would argue that when you're looking at the Pentagon in particular, there already was a lot of roiling turmoil partly because Defense Secretary Mattis - he was not someone who was especially deferential to the civilian authorities in the department.",
        "He tended to listen to folks he had served with in the military.",
        "He tended to be somewhat closer to them.",
        "And so already some of those traditional lines of authority within the Pentagon didn't look like they do under other presidential administrations.",
        "And this is something we see elsewhere in the administration, too, partly because President Trump - his inconstancy, his inattention to detail means that you oftentimes have turf battles within the administration.",
        "And, you know, hopefully the president will find a defense secretary who is more aligned with his policy priorities, but it really is hard to see that happening anytime soon because there are many folks who would be eligible for this kind of role, who have the experience - the bureaucratic experience and what have you - who might be reluctant to serve in such a chaotic administration.",

        "Let me turn you both to the looming midnight deadline on government shutdown.",
        "Why do we keep doing this?",

        "Well, but - right, but then he went to Mitch McConnell and basically gave his blessing to passing a bill that would have kept the government open on February 8.",
        "So that was the against-the-shutdown point.",
        "And then under pressure from talk show hosts - Senator Bob Corker said today, we're being governed by talk show hosts.",
        "He said, whoops, I can't do that.",
