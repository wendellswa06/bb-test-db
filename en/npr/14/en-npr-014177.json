        "But if you watch the segment, it doesn't seem like it took much coaxing for him to say, you know, terrible, terrible, terrible things, and mock, you know, stereotypical Asian accents and say the N-word and say terrible, terrible things.",
        "It didn't seem like he was uncomfortable with saying those things.",
        "In the case of the Arizona segment that Paul talked about, you know, yes, the front end - like he was playing someone.",

        "But it didn't take much coaxing for the people in that room to say terrible things - terrible, racist things.",

        "However, when he - in the first episode, he, Sacha Baron Cohen, goes to an art gallery in Los Angeles.",
        "And he gets this art - he embarrasses her on camera for - it doesn't seem like there is much aim to that.",
        "And when he plays an NPR-loving liberal, you know, and he goes to dinner at these Trump supporters' houses, there doesn't seem to be anything productive that comes out of that.",
        "So it's a pretty interesting - but I do think that every single segment has its own - you know, you can judge each segment on its own merits.",
        "The only thing productive, I thought, was comedy.",
