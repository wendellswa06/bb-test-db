        "The second thing to say, when you asked voters in 2002 about how they felt about George W.",
        "Bush and whether that was going to impact their votes in the midterm election, you had about 30 percent of voters say they were going to vote in a way that would suggest support for the president after 9/11, in the midst of the war.",
        "Now, it's about 30 percent who say they want their vote to represent the fact that they are discontented, unhappy with the way the president is going about the war on terror.",
        "So that's a tremendous change.",
        "So both of those key indicators are real positive for Democrats, Tony.",
        "How does that play out for those who are running in the GOP, in particular?",
        "Does it suggest that the coattails of President Bush are no longer there?",
        "Or is it more a matter of the fact that he is a lame duck president?",
        "Well, I think both are true.",
        "But they play into each other in an interesting political dynamic.",
        "First and foremost, I think people are looking at the polls.",
        "So what you hear from Republicans on Capitol Hill is they can't rely on the president to come and win votes for them, much less raise money.",
        "They do think he has some capacity in terms of being the big personality.",
        "But they don't necessarily think he's going to influence the middle of the road voter anymore.",
        "In fact, they think that association with the president is going to lead that middle of the road voter away from them.",
        "Even the party loyalists are starting to relate to people who would be challenging in '08, so relating more to, for example, Senator John McCain, relating, for example to Senator George Allen, Republicans who are likely to be in the mix looking towards a 2008 Republican presidential nomination.",
        "That takes away from the power of this president, and is why he is at this point just about a lame duck.",
        "Let's talk about some of the Senate races that are on the map.",
        "Certainly, Pennsylvania is one, Ohio is another, Maryland yet another amongst several.",
        "Which ones do you see as the key races?",
        "Without a doubt, Tony, it's Ohio.",
        "And I tell you why the Ohio gubernatorial race is so key from the perspective of a Washington insider.",
        "The person who wins control of the electoral process in the state of Ohio likely holds in his hand the key to the White House for 2008.",
        "Why?",
        "Because as we've seen both in 2004, but also to some extent in 2000, Ohio is the key state when it comes to Red State, Blue State presidential politics.",
        "You've got to win it.",
        "Senator Kerry thought he had it for a little bit--went back to President Bush, and that's why President Bush got a second term.",
        "And so what you see with a candidate like a Ken Blackwell, who is now Secretary of State running there is that everybody is going to have to--and I think it's going to get national attention--national politics is going to be an issue in that gubernatorial race.",
        "So that makes that one unique.",
        "What about in Tennessee with Ford running?",
        "Well, now, I think lots of people have high hopes.",
        "It's a vacancy.",
        "It's the seat now currently held by Senator Majority Leader Bill Frist.",
        "And he's going to do well out towards Memphis, Nashville.",
        "The question is, what happens when you get over the Eastern part of the state towards Knoxville, even in the middle of the state, central Tennessee."

        "But Harold Ford is a name, and in some ways, if you listen to Harold Ford, he's running less out of concern over his race than he is about his family's scandals, problems that his--his family has been in politics forever.",
        "And the question is whether or not those family problems are dragging him down.",
        "He is a very popular man.",
        "He is going to be supported by the likes of Al Gore and every other Democratic politician in the state.",
        "But are the problems with his family and those scandals which extend beyond his father to his uncle and aunt, of such a magnitude that Harold Ford can't--it's interesting, it's not race; it's family.",
        "What a twist.",
        "There was a recent article by Ellis Cose in Newsweek that suggested that we have reached the tipping point with regard to African Americans involvement in running for political office.",
        "And the example that you just cited as a potential in the state of Maryland seems to support what he is suggesting.",
        "I think that's right.",
        "This is a very interesting thing.",
        "Ellis Cose, I thought, brought the moment into profile so that people who don't follow politics can realize, my gosh, there is a black man running for governor of Ohio; two black people might be running against each other for the Senate in Maryland; you've got possible Lynn Swan, the former Pittsburgh Steeler running for governor in Pennsylvania.",
        "It just doesn't go on.",

        "At some point, it loses its magic.",
        "I mean, you think about it, a city like Los Angeles, they're on now to a Hispanic mayor.",
        "You think about New York City, they went through a black mayor, they're on, which takes us to a different era, a different magnitude in terms of the exercise of politics with regard to race in America.",

        "Automobiles are the lifeline of most of America and the bedrock of Motown's economy, but in recent years, the auto industry has faced many challenges from high costs at home to competition from abroad, it's also been an industry that is given opportunity to many African-Americans.",

        "She was leading the Marine Corps's all-female 4th Recruit Training Battalion at Parris Island, S.C., when she was fired in 2015.",

        "In her new book titled \"\"Fight Like A Girl: The Truth Behind How Female Marines Are Trained,\"\" Kate Germano with journalist and Army veteran Kelly Kennedy gives her side of the story.",
        "When I talked to them, Kate Germano began by describing the environment she says she encountered when she arrived at Parris Island.",
        "The compound where the Marines were trained, the female recruits were trained, was so separate from anywhere else on the base that it had created this sort of lax leadership by the senior men on the depot.",

        "We had all kinds of sort of run amok discipline issues that weren't being dealt with the right way.",

        "And you were able to fix that in short order.",
        "Like, the whole question of marksmanship, for example - that women went from a 67 percent qualification rate at the rifle range to 92 percent, a rate that rivalled that of the men.",
        "And, in fact, the men's qualification rate went up.",
        "Why do you think that is?",
        "Well, I can tell you that, for decades, the women had underperformed because there were lower expectations for what they could achieve.",
        "And I don't want to claim responsibility or kudos for it.",
        "My Marines helped put a plan together to change what the female recruits were doing and how they were performing.",
        "And so we just put a plan together to have discipline and hold them to higher standards and make sure that at every opportunity, we were training and coaching rather than simply screaming at recruits for 13 full weeks of boot camp.",

        "And then I got fired."

        "One of the things that you say in the book, though, is that the real issue was that they didn't want you to succeed.",
        "And when you did succeed, that challenged their expectations.",
        "What you say in the book is that no matter how we work to overcome decades of apathy and low standards for performance within my battalion, there were men at the highest levels of command on the recruit depot who expected, even wanted the women to fail because they didn't want to see women fully integrated into the corps.",
        "And there were women who fell so fully in line with the status quo that it never occurred to them to see what the female recruits could achieve.",
        "But why would they want the women to fail, though?",
        "Well, you have to keep in mind that this was right at the same time that the Marine Corps was conducting their integrated task force experiment.",
