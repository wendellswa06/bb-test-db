        "It's a very difficult question, but how do you take this report from the AP that the claim is that they have executed all three of these soldiers?",
        "The narrator indicates that the soldier has been killed and that is a response to the communicae that they had earlier on - I think it was in mid-May - that if the searches of the soldiers will not be stopped by the American military, they will execute the soldiers.",
