        "The work is called Tale, T-A-L-E.",

        "And also the shame and humiliation of not being able to hide it, that it's so apparent in one's own being.",
        "In the late 1980s and early '90s, Smith was dealing with the death of her sister and many of her friends from AIDS.",
        "So the struggles of the body were on her mind.",

        "I just don't think they're aware that the way that they were raised and their religion and, you know, anything that has to do with how they see appropriate roles for women - that that's coming out in policy, and that affects our national defense.",

        "Well, what do you think is going to change it?",
        "It's going to take two things.",
        "First and foremost, there needs to be pressure from people on the outside - people who can tell their congressmen and women why this is such an important issue.",
        "But there also really needs to be a greater degree of scrutiny on why the percentage of women in the Marine Corps is so small.",
        "Because at less than 9 percent of the total force, women are never going to be able to rise to the positions of authority and power that we need to impact policy.",
        "So I think it's going to take those two things to really change the way gender is viewed in the Marine Corps and make it more safe for women to serve.",

        "She's also an Army veteran.",
