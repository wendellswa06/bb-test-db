        "Yeah.",

        "They're denying that it happened.",
        "They're saying, oh, it was for something else, but this thing stinks all over the place, and it's certainly not something condoned by the black newspapers.",
        "I mean, this is just a terrible incident, and obviously, there was some influence buying here with the minister as well as with the so-called freelancer who placed the story in the Birmingham Times.",
        "But what does this say, Walter, to the idea of really two institutions that have, over the course of the last decade, taken some big hits, and that's the church and the media.",

        "That is a clearly a violation of any kind of journalistic ethics and standards, but it's very widespread.",

        "He compared the Department of Homeland Security to a Nazi Gestapo and called the President a liar during a speech here in New York.",
        "His suggestion of President Bush being the greatest terrorist in the world was quite frankly, talked about this weekend over the course of Meet the Press when Barak Obama, Senator Barak Obama was on and he was asked whether or not, as often African Americans are asked whenever another African American of prominence has something to say, you almost have to feel like you are wanted to denounce that person to be okay in some corners.",
        "But, Tim Russert asked Obama about the announcement here and whether he thought it was appropriate to call the President of the United States the greatest terrorist in the world.",
        "Laura Washington, when you hear Harry Belafonte and see him taking this hard line stance, days of old we should note Mr. Belafonte was always on the front lines, even during the Civil Rights movement and has never held his tongue.",
        "The suggestion is that perhaps he's gone too far now, what do you think?",
        "Well I think you have to look at each case.",
        "For example the Gestapo statement, what he actually said is, as I understand, We've come to this dark time in which the new Gestapo of Homeland Security lurks here, where citizens are having their rights suspended.",
        "He's basically calling the Homeland Security, not so much as a Gestapo but an institution that is in his mind, using Gestapo tactics.",
        "And I don't have any disagreement with that.",
        "I think the value of Harry Belafonte is he's not running for office, he doesn't need anything from anybody he's got enough money.",
        "He can speak out and get attention to issues.",
        "And he's being rhetorical.",
        "I mean obviously he's using terminology that he knows will get attention.",
        "And the case that he's trying to make is what we need to hear.",
        "And the case is that we have spying going on in this country, have government sponsored spying going on in this country and it needs to be addressed.",
        "And he's been a voice against that.",
        "Walter Fields, any concern that he, as was Bill Cosby when he made his controversial statements, clearly there are people who disagree with these statements.",
        "But there are many, many who agree with these statements but they allow these people to be a lone wolf, if you will.",
        "What about the bravery of others who will step up and say, Yes, and he's not alone, we support this.",
        "Shouldn't we be seeing this more?",
        "We should and historically that's always been the problem in these instances.",
        "If you take Mr. Belafonte's remarks, particularly from a global context, when you think historically about WEB DuBois when you think about Paul Robeson, who always managed to address issues in the United States from a more international context, this is what Harry Belafonte is doing.",
        "But like those men, they were alone in terms of raising their voices and what that does.",
        "It unfortunately it isolates those individuals and those individuals then unfortunately, become prone to attack from others for a number of reasons and not necessarily that statement.",
        "So I think, what I hopefully we will see is more institutions in the black community begin to speak on issues, particularly about Iraq.",
        "Because we've been really silent.",
        "If you look at the black church, they came out early on, some Bishops, addressing this issue of invading Iraq.",
        "But it's been silent for the most part, on this issue of what our country is confronting overseas.",
        "So I think you know from my point of view, hopefully we'll come to a day when we can have this discourse in the community that, raises above a single voice like Mr. Belafonte's.",

        "Well, it's not language I would have used.",

        "This is the part I zero in on because those are those kinds of Nazi tactics and that undermines what America stands for and that's what he seems to be lashing out again.",

        "I mean the people that come to mind immediately, Adam Clayton Powell comes to mind.",

        "Well, yeah, you wouldn't necessarily think of it right off the bat, but they both share a complete fascination with the human brain.",
        "Scientists, of course, want to study it and figure out how it works.",
        "Magicians, though, want to trick it and make it believe the impossible.",
        "So the reason that the magicians were invited to this meeting is that a lot of scientists, and neuroscientists in particular, started realizing that these magicians have a huge wealth of information.",
        "And they've honed these tricks over hundreds of years and tested it out in front of audiences all over the world.",
        "So they're good.",
        "They're good and tricking the brain, and neuroscientists want to know how they do that.",
        "Right.",
        "So I mean, I guess there's some serious things about consciousness and attention and things that you can learn from tricking the brain.",
        "Yeah.",
        "One of the main things that they talked about, these two magicians that performed, a big, important thing was attention and how they're able to kind of twist your attention and manipulate it.",
        "One of the magicians, Apollo Robins(ph), when he started talking, you know, there was this big spotlight on the front of the stage, and he was nowhere to be found.",
        "And he said, you know, spotlights point out something that you should be looking at, and that's where your attention goes, but here he was, off in the shadow.",
        "I think at that point, he was actually pilfering through the pockets of some of the attendees and stealing their wallets and watches, and yeah…",
        "Well, that's a good thing to keep in mind and also to watch out for pickpockets.",
        "I guess thieves could do that, as well, but I doubt that they'd come and talk to the group."
