        "Yeah, that was the really amazing thing about this study is they were looking at individual brain cells.",
        "You know, out of the hundred billion or so in our brains, they were able to pinpoint one that responded when Halle Berry's picture was flashed up on a screen.",
        "So they were using electrodes to kind of eavesdrop in on the activity of these cells.",
        "You know, okay, so many eons ago, I was in graduate school in psychology, and I remember hearing something about the grandmother cell, this idea that there was a single neuron in your brain that would respond to a particular person.",
        "Is this the same thing?",
        "Yeah, well, it's kind of - not a lot of scientists think that's actually how it works these days.",
        "For one thing, you know, if you did just have one cell that recognized your grandma, you'd be in trouble if it died, and you might run into problems in your everyday life.",
        "But it's more of a question of how many of these cells are important for recognizing something.",
        "The idea that just one would be, by chance, the one that these scientists found, you know, and they're only looking at a hundred or so, is not so likely.",
        "And it's also the thing that they weren't able to test these neurons' responses to everything.",
        "So they were only able to show a subset of pictures.",
        "And it's pretty likely that these neurons are kind of pulling double duty, in a sense, and responding to Marilyn Monroe and then also something like your toenail clippers at the same time.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "So yeah, it's - I think people are more interested these days in figuring out how big these circuits of cells are.",

        "I think that's for obvious reasons.",
        "9/11 had occurred, and it became an option now.",
        "The Bush administration obviously also went in the direction with a very small group of individuals at the top of al-Qaeda's leadership to use enhanced techniques and make Americans responsible for those interrogations."

        "We had a guy on the show named - under the pseudonym Matthew Alexander who was a military interrogator in Iraq.",
        "He said they came in using new techniques after the enhanced interrogation techniques were no longer acceptable, and befriending people, even in real-time scenarios - they were talking about people who were marching out of there, had information about people who were about to set off vests that were going to kill hundreds of people.",
        "In real-time scenarios, their techniques worked, and he said torture did not.",
        "I'm skeptical of the interrogation techniques that are used in Iraq.",
        "Those are decisively different from those that we used at the black sides run by the agency.",
        "And I think, if you were - I mean, the agency doesn't talk about it publicly.",

        "officials that water boarding does work.",
        "I'm - you know, anyone who's been involved in interrogations and debriefings would certainly tell you that the best way is that if the opponent - if the individual wants to cooperate is the soft approach.",

        "They often, in fact, are there because they are quite willing to die.",
        "Now, if you are confronted with a situation where the individual does not wish to cooperate, which I believe was the case, for example, with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed or the 9/11 mastermind.",
        "Then you believe that you have an ongoing, possibly mass-casualty terrorist operation.",
        "I think the senior officials, be they Democrat or Republican, are going to be very, very tempted to use force because, again, I suspect that the track record on this at the CIA sites is such that - I'm not sure that a senior administration in a difficult situation would say, no, I don't believe it.",

        "Well, it's my opinion that a lot of the Geneva Convention accords were drafted for nation-state battles, one large nation-state against another, in the hopes that, you know, one force, if capturing the other forces, that they'll be civilized and, you know, treat them with some respect.",
        "Now...",

        "Until those laws are superseded, they do apply.",
        "And, in fact, that if you violate them, you're committing a war crime.",
        "Well, and perhaps that's indeed accurate, and I think it's a difficult situation for any American leader to get in, and I do think we have an obligation of knowledge and civility, and we want to bring that model to the world.",
        "But I also know that, without extracting information by any means necessary, in my opinion, we're dealing with a group of people that have no regard for their own life, let alone regard for other human beings, we're going to see a continued escalation, and I believe it's a mistake to start tying the hands of the American administration because of commitment to things more noble.",
        "I agree.",
        "I think it is noble, but I think it's a bad decision to draw a line in the sand when, in fact, Mr. Obama has not been confronted with some of the intelligence and some of the urgency of the situation that require these unprecedented methods."

        "And the deniability of foreign liaison operations is very easy.",

        "However, again, if you add up all the plusses and minuses, I think it is, again, highly likely that the future administration, the Obama administration, if, again, confronted with the situation that really scares them, I think they'll go back in the direction of rendition.",
