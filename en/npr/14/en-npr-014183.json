        "This was an act of terror, and a particularly cowardly act of terror, aimed at innocent civilians, aimed at people going about their lives who had no idea what was about to hit them.",
        "Smith's varied interests are reflected in both the style and substance of her art.",
        "Her sculptures have been made in everything from paper to bronze.",
        "She's done prints, drawings, paintings and several books, one just out by Kelsey Street Press.",
        "Smith's work also breaks with traditional ideas of what materials can be used to make great art, says Siri Engberg.",
        "Engberg is the curator of Visual Arts at the Walker Museum in Minneapolis, where Smith's current show originated.",
        "Her interest in materials, I think, is just so key to an understanding of her work, to know that there really isn't in her mind any hierarchy of materials.",
        "So a bronze sculpture for her is no more important than something made out of newspaper, or something that's been made as a drawing or a print.",
        "There's no medium more important than another.",
        "It's just what she happens to be interested in at the time.",
        "But increasingly, Smith has grown interested in the natural world.",
        "Here's how I'm thinking.",
        "It could be here.",
        "Oh, rather than - so sectors are out now.",
        "Curator Engberg and Smith continue to discuss the installation of the show, standing near a lyrical circle of bronze crows on the floor.",
        "The sculptures were inspired by an actual incident where a flock of birds fell down dead from the sky in New Jersey, presumably because of pollution.",
        "I thought, oh, this is a bad moment that these animals are dying like this.",
        "But it also made my work switch from being predominantly figurative to being more nature oriented.",
        "But Smith is still taking familiar imagery and giving it a new twist.",
        "She got interested in fairy tales and did several images of the wolf in Red Riding Hood.",
        "There is a little girl in a cape in the show.",
        "But look closer, says curator Engberg."

        "Her face is covered in hair.",
        "And it was actually kind of her re-imagining of what might happen if the wolf and Red Riding Hood were to have a child.",
        "And there are a lot of these re-imaginings of traditional stories that we think we recognize, and then realize we don't recognize those characters at all.",
        "As she's gotten older, Smith says she is growing more interested in the environment and the world around her.",
        "The older you get, the less you're involved in your kind of internal, personal, psychic trauma or something and you're more just sort of being out and about and seeing your interrelatedness to other beings and to your environment.",
        "Smith says she would like to do more work that is present in public spaces, the way the Mexican artists like Diego Rivera were involved in their communities.",
        "Given the power of her work to provoke, it's interesting to imagine what Smith might contribute to the public square.",

        "And what details can you give us?",
        "Well, what I can tell you is NATO has been in command for just little more than a month now.",

        "And we are trying to in place security there in a way that will allow development and government services to touch people's lives in the way that it just hasn't happened in southern Afghanistan in the past - in many places, anyway.",

        "We've inflicted heavy losses on Taliban insurgents in the past few days.",
        "The operation continued this morning, after extraordinarily heavy fighting from one of our units engaged there.",
        "They called for close air support.",
        "Support came in the form of a couple of ISAF that the U.S.",

        "Sure.",

        "And then we now have regional commands in the west, in the north in the capital region, operating very strongly in the south, and then looking forward to assuming command in the east here.",
        "NATO put out a statement today about this incident, and I was interested to read in it about the importance of air power, because you are encountering Taliban fighters in these villages - in these remote and difficult fighting area - and that air power, I gather, is the factor that turns many of these battles in your favor.",
        "Well, went to extraordinary lengths before Operation Medusa in this very important district of Qandahar that I speak of, to minimize the potential for civilian casualties by talking to village elders, and, indeed, all but advertising the operation.",
        "But in the heart of a fight, air power is a decisive advantage that we don't hesitate to use and won't hesitate to use in the future.",
        "Is it such a factor that this is what you're counting on to turn the fight against the Taliban, because they must know those hills pretty well?",
        "I mean, I would think they would have some tactical advantages just in terms terrain and ability to blend in with the local population.",
        "Well, in the heart of a fight, air power can be decisive, but we're not fighting for fighting's sake and just to kill the Taliban.",
        "That's not what will give us what we're looking for down there, establishing a security presence very much in partnership with Afghanistan security forces, who get better every day - particularly the army.",
        "But we want to establish a presence that has almost a psychological or inspirational affect, if you will.",

        "This meeting has got like 30,000 people.",
        "How do you go and find the interesting things?",
        "And was there - did people walk away with one thing and say oh, this year, now we know that the brain does X?",
        "You know, there are a few themes that I could kind pick out of the noise at this meeting.",
        "It seemed like a lot of the new studies were focused on how good exercise is for the brain and how eating right is also very good for the brain.",
        "So that seemed to be a theme.",
        "There was, you know, a lot of interest in that, and it seems like something they were interested in sharing with the public is that, you know, exercise and eating right is good for your body, but it does a lot to your brain, too.",
