        "Well, I think you've pretty much summed up all the gruesome details.",
        "This daughter of his was apparently locked up in an incredibly elaborate - I read somewhere there were eight different doors one had to access, including one that could only be opened electronically, in this dungeon for 24 years, and that he, for at least some period of that, had sex with her, I guess raped her three times a week, fathered seven children, and, apparently, was, in fact, raping her in front of the children.",
        "And this went on for years and years, and only, ultimately, was discovered when the 19-year-old daughter was so ill that she had to be rushed to the hospital, at which point he turned himself in.",
        "So this is truly, even on the scale of epic, horrible, horrible gruesome stories, this one is just brain rattling in its scope, and, as you said, I think he's now facing charges of rape and incest, false imprisonment, and something called murder through failure to act if it turns out that he was involved somehow in the death of this infant, who he then helped in incinerate.",
        "His lawyer, Rudolph Mayer, says he may try the insanity defense.",
        "Based on what we know, does that seem unusual?",
        "Well, you know, one of the things that's difficult is that we don't know - at least I don't know very much about Austrian law and how the insanity defense differs from the insanity defense here.",
        "But I think that this if fairly typical of - if you think of the kinds of folks who try to invoke the insanity defense, Neal, it really is people - it's the Jeffrey Dahmers.",
        "It's the David Berkowitz, Son of Sam.",
        "The kinds of people who do such horrific things that almost by definition they appear to be insane.",
        "And so I think it maps well onto that sort of trend of cases that are so harrowing, so gruesome, that you almost have to say, of course this person was insane because nobody, nobody, nobody who knows right from wrong could ever contemplate such horrific acts.",
        "Yet, he hid this crime in his basement for 24 years.",
        "His wife was forbidden to go down into the basement.",
        "People who lodged at the house agreed before they did so that they would never go into the basement.",
        "Doesn't that show that he knew something was wrong down there?",
        "Well, it's interesting, and it really goes to the heart of the conversation we're going to have about how the legal definition of insanity is quite different from the medical definition of insanity, which is, in itself, quite different from what you and I, I think, are talking about.",
        "This sort of colloquial notion of what is right and wrong, and what does it mean to sort of hide your conduct, to seemingly know that what you're doing is wrong?",
        "And those things don't all actually dovetail.",
        "One of the complications in the long, long history of the insanity defense, both in this country and long before, for hundreds of years in Europe, is it is very, very hard to get a psychiatrist, a doctor, a lawyer, and a layperson to even sit at the same table and talk about insanity in the same ways.",
        "Let's bring the conversation a little closer to home.",
        "In this country, as you mentioned some of the outstanding people who've tried in the insanity defense, but it's widely believed that this is far more popular with television lawyers than with real ones.",
        "It's an option of last resort and rarely succeeds.",
        "And that's such an important point, probably the most important point because these cases tend to really churn up incredible anger and outrage.",
        "And then, you see enormous sea changes in legal policy and in legislation as a consequence of these cases.",
        "The trial of John Hinckley, who was on trial for attempting to kill President Reagan.",
        "As you'll remember, he was trying to do that out of an act of love for the actress Jodie Foster, and, when he was found not guilty by reason of insanity, the outcry in this country was so enormous that you'd have thought that this sort of thing happens every day."
