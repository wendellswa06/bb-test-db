        "Hi.",
        "I'm Susan from Albany, New York, and I want to preface my question saying I never was a Clinton supporter, but Barack Obama has identified Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, \"\"Team of Rivals,\"\" as one of his favorites, and I wondered if you saw any influence of the book on his choices or you could make any predictions based on the book.",
        "Ken?",
        "Wow.",
        "Well, I've long tried to stay out of the prediction business.",
        "I mean, I thought Jack Reed would be the vice president on the Democratic side.",
        "I was convinced Barack Obama was going to win the New Hampshire primary.",
        "So I'm pretty wrong on mostly everything and that's why I'm on the show.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But you know something, I mean, obviously, Barack Obama had to weigh a lot of things.",
        "Barack Obama had a resume gap to fill and that was on foreign policy experience, and, you know, whatever Joe Biden does or does not bring to the ticket, Biden has been in Senate foreign relations, he's been in the Senate since 1973, he has tremendous foreign policy experience, a strong debater, as I said earlier, a good attack dog, and I sense that there's a comfort level.",
        "And a lot of people are talking about, you know, John McCain perhaps picking Mitt Romney.",
        "They don't seem to have that comfort level.",
        "Romney and McCain went after each other during the primaries.",
        "If McCain is going to use Hillary Clinton's comments about Obama in his commercials, you know the Democrats will have a field day repeating, regurgitating what McCain and Romney said about each other.",
        "So obviously, there is a comfort level when you pick a team.",
        "And so far, it seems like Obama is very comfortable with the person he has chosen as VP.",
        "And, Ken, we have Doris Kearns Goodwin with us right here.",
        "No, we don't.",
        "It's the old Woody Allen joke.",
        "That book will be committed to memory by next week, so...",
        "That's right.",
        "Yes, sir.",
        "I was going to go with Truman but that's obviously not correct.",
        "Can I make a guess?",
        "Let's see if we can get - here's an email, this is from Richard in Cleveland.",
        "Hillary threw her support to Obama.",
        "What is Obama doing to get Hillary's supporters appeased?",
        "I'm looking forward for Obama to make his case for himself on Thursday night."

        "Well, I mean, look.",
        "If the roles were reversed and Hillary Clinton were the nominee and if we were spending all this time talking about what Barack Obama wants and what Barack Obama's people want, I think there would be an outrage from the Hillary Clinton people saying, look, I'm the nominee, not him, let's focus on me.",
        "So I think Obama has been very magnanimous about this - what's been a distraction for him.",
        "He has not shown any irritation.",
        "He has not criticized.",
        "But the Clinton people do feel that Obama has not done enough to raise money for Clinton.",
        "And Hillary Clinton - you know, it's interesting, right after Hillary Clinton gave that great speech last night, her campaign sent out another fundraising email saying, you know, it was a great speech, but please give money to us.",
        "When everybody was holding up the Hillary Clinton signs last night, on the bottom, it did not say, barackobama.org, it said hillaryclinton.org.",
        "So it was very interesting that there still seems to be two different camps there.",
        "But again, obviously, I suspect, just as Hillary Clinton did last night, Barack Obama's speech would not only talk about what he intends to do as president, what American people need to hear, but a very gracious, I suspect, reach out to Hillary Clinton.",
        "He's already said that he thought her speech last night was outstanding.",
        "Well, it was certainly a great speech.",
        "Anyway, we're talking with our political junkie, Ken Rudin.",
        "If you'd like to read his political column, say, some reason you think that may be helpful, you can find the Political Junkie column at npr.org.",
        "He's with us every Wednesday here at the Newseum.",
        "Today he's in Denver.",
        "Next week he'll join us from Saint Paul in Minnesota where the Republicans hold their convention contest.",
        "We're expecting Senator McCain to announce his vice-presidential pick on Friday of this week to try to take whatever steam may have built up by the Democrats away as quickly as possible and get the Republicans back on the front burner.",
        "And of course, you'll find coverage of that right here at NPR and on npr.org.",
        "You can listen to coverage of the convention at npr.org, and tonight, at many of these NPR radio stations - I'll get that straight.",
        "You're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "And let's get Kat on the line, Kat calling us from Grand Junction in Colorado.",
        "Hello.",
        "Hi.",
        "What I'm taking away from watching the whole thing this week is the kind of hope that we've all been needing for so long, and also, I think it was Deval Patrick who called for us to let go of our cynicism.",
        "I have been fighting this for so long.",
        "So many people have become so cynical about our political process and the direction our country has gone in the past failed eight years.",
        "What I'm hearing from Deval Patrick and the other speakers who are so inspirational, the governor of Montana and Hillary Clinton herself, is that we need to let go of the cynicism and really, really put our hope into - back in Barack Obama.",
        "So Kat...",
        "And it's something I intend on doing."

        "So Kat, you're looking for inspiration hope rather than red meat?",

        "Thanks very much for the call, Kat.",
        "And that replicates an argument that's been ongoing within the Obama campaign, Ken.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean, it obviously was a brutal primary campaign but Barack Obama can be very inspirational.",
        "I think one of the reasons he will be the nominee officially tomorrow - officially tonight, actually, is because he is inspirational and he sells hope.",
        "Hillary Clinton in the past has said he needs more than rhetoric.",
        "John McCain, of course, has tried to pick up on that theme, but you know, there was a lot of hope in 1988 for the Democrats in Atlanta.",
        "Michael Dukakis came out of the convention with a 17-point lead.",
        "So it would be very interesting to see.",
        "Even if the party sounds united coming out of Denver, even if the polls show a bump, you know, the Republicans are coming back next week.",
        "It would be very interesting to see when all is said done, after the two campaigns, after the two conventions are over, what the numbers will look like.",
        "And then you have a very compact general election campaign.",
        "Let's see if we can get another question from here in the Newseum.",
        "Hi, my name is Zach from Tempe, Arizona.",
        "I just want to know why the elitist question has been such a big deal during the primaries in this whole election on both sides.",
        "Isn't the whole point of the primary, isn't the election to find the best, most qualified candidate?",
        "And wouldn't we want a member of the elite as a president or is it just a question of status or attitude?",
        "Well, elite is one of those loaded, you know, pejoratives.",
        "I mean, you know, you don't want somebody to be elitist but - theoretically, I mean, Franklin D.",
        "Roosevelt was an elitist, John F.",
        "Kennedy was elitist, and yet they still spoke for the common man and common language.",
        "So I think it's just something they like to throw out at people.",
        "And then when you talk about Barack Obama's education - I mean, the thought of somebody, you know, being born in Hawaii to white and black parents coming out as an elitist is pretty remarkable.",
        "But you know something, I think the McCain people know that they have a great orator in Barack Obama, and I don't think they know how to deal with it.",
        "And so what they decided that elitist would be the kind of word that you want to throw out there.",
        "And it certainly was the kind of charge that worked against John Kerry, too."

        "That's true.",
        "I mean, but of course, you know, anybody who is windsurfing on vacation is something that exactly what fell into the hands just of the Bush campaign.",
        "George W.",
        "Bush was sold as somebody you'd like to go out and have a beer with, while, you know, John Kerry also was windsurfing.",
        "Well, you guessed...",
        "I think Truman and Dewey in '48.",
        "And we can expect so much tomorrow night, or tonight, rather, when Joe Biden, the new vice-presidential nominee, takes the stage along with Bill Clinton.",
        "A little less clear what Bill Clinton's going to have to say.",
        "Let me just tell you also, before we run out of time, that you should know that the delegates right now are all in their hotel rooms, they are now coalescing, they deciding who's voting for whom, and so when the roll call begins later this afternoon on the floor, you know, somebody from, you know, the state of Colorado, will come out and say, Colorado cast its 12 delegates for Hillary Clinton and 11 delegates for Barack Obama, whatever.",
        "So right now all the delegates are meeting in their rooms going over those numbers right now.",
        "We suspect that there will be an initial roll call, a tally of states at the convention, and then, again, the speculation is that Hillary Clinton will come out and call to stop the roll call vote and say Barack Obama's nomination should be made by acclamation.",
