        "Exactly.",
        "And when we saw Michelle Obama and we saw the Obama children on the stage Monday, it obviously - we talk about when John Kennedy said in his inaugural speech in 1961 that a torch had passed to a new generation of Americans, it almost seemed fitting that Ted Kennedy was speaking on Monday.",
        "Barack Obama will speak on Thursday, and a new torch is passing to a new generation of Democrats, let alone Americans.",
        "And we saw that emblemized, as you mentioned, by Michelle Obama's address on Monday night where she tried to portray herself and her husband as humble products of the American Dream.",
        "(Soundbite of Michelle Obama speech, 2008 Democratic National Convention)",
        "In this great country, where a girl from the South Side of Chicago can go to college and law school, and the son of a single mother from Hawaii can go all the way to the White House.",

        "You know, it's funny, and yet I saw a lot of comments by Democratic partisans who said that the Democrats were not tough enough on Bush and McCain.",
        "They were not tough enough on the Republicans.",
        "I thought, I mean, from my standpoint, and I was on the floor - standing up, though, I mean, I'm not lying on the floor...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I was standing up on the floor at the convention, I thought it was a perfect mood to begin a week of party activity.",

        "I mean, there were a lot of tears.",
        "You know, nobody expected to see him there.",

        "And for all the complaints about there's no red meat, well, you certainly had the red meat last night on the stage.",
        "Right.",
        "With Joe Biden, it's clear, I think, as everybody agrees, the first three hours of Joe Biden's speech are always the most dynamic, I think everybody enjoys that the most.",
        "But you know, Hillary Clinton made it clear how she feels about Barack Obama and again, a tremendous speech last night.",
        "There's more question about Bill Clinton because his remarks about Barack Obama had been far more tepid, far more reserved than his wife.",
        "And you know, if anybody seems to be most upset about the result of the Democratic nomination, who the Democratic nominee will be, it seems to be more Bill Clinton.",
        "So it will be very interesting to see his reaction, his body language when he speaks."

        "Right.",
        "Ted Stevens, who's been a senator since 1968, longer than any Republican in the history of the Senate, is under indictment for a corruption scandal.",
        "He's always won re-election by overwhelming majorities.",
        "But he's under indictment, there's a cloud over him.",
        "But yesterday's primary was interesting.",
        "He won, pretty handily, over 65, close to 70 percent in a field of six candidates.",
        "But some Democrats think that's the best thing that could have happened to them because Ted Stevens remains very vulnerable.",
        "You have a very popular Democratic opponent, Mark Begich, the mayor of Anchorage.",
        "So it could be bad news for the Republicans, but I think most people feel that Stevens won by a larger margin than anyone expected.",
        "And there's one congressional seat in the state of Alaska, that one in the Republican side.",
        "That primary is a squeaker.",
        "Well, that's very interesting.",
        "Don Young, who was actually - actually, Don Young became a congressman in 1973 after Mark Begich's father, Nick Begich, died in a plane crash.",
        "I mean, it just shows how closely everybody is involved in Alaska.",
        "But Don Young is also under an FBI investigation.",
        "Talk about giving some favors to campaign donors, and he barely squeaked by - we don't even know, it's not even official yet, but he has like a hundred-vote lead or something like that over the lieutenant governor of Alaska, who, by the way, was endorsed by the governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin.",
        "So the Republican Party is really split in Alaska.",
        "It's a state that has been in GOP control for a long, long time.",
        "But again, as we talked about the new change on the Democratic presidential front, there seems to be a change coming on in Alaska, as well.",
