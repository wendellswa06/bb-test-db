        "Let's get another question from here at the Newseum.",
        "Hi.",
        "I'm Susan from Albany, New York, and I want to preface my question saying I never was a Clinton supporter, but Barack Obama has identified Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, \"\"Team of Rivals,\"\" as one of his favorites, and I wondered if you saw any influence of the book on his choices or you could make any predictions based on the book.",
        "Ken?",
        "Wow.",
        "Well, I've long tried to stay out of the prediction business.",
        "I mean, I thought Jack Reed would be the vice president on the Democratic side.",
        "I was convinced Barack Obama was going to win the New Hampshire primary.",
        "So I'm pretty wrong on mostly everything and that's why I'm on the show.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But you know something, I mean, obviously, Barack Obama had to weigh a lot of things.",
        "Barack Obama had a resume gap to fill and that was on foreign policy experience, and, you know, whatever Joe Biden does or does not bring to the ticket, Biden has been in Senate foreign relations, he's been in the Senate since 1973, he has tremendous foreign policy experience, a strong debater, as I said earlier, a good attack dog, and I sense that there's a comfort level.",
        "And a lot of people are talking about, you know, John McCain perhaps picking Mitt Romney.",
        "They don't seem to have that comfort level.",
        "Romney and McCain went after each other during the primaries.",
        "If McCain is going to use Hillary Clinton's comments about Obama in his commercials, you know the Democrats will have a field day repeating, regurgitating what McCain and Romney said about each other.",
        "So obviously, there is a comfort level when you pick a team.",
        "And so far, it seems like Obama is very comfortable with the person he has chosen as VP.",
        "And, Ken, we have Doris Kearns Goodwin with us right here.",
        "No, we don't.",
        "It's the old Woody Allen joke.",
        "That book will be committed to memory by next week, so...",

        "Hillary threw her support to Obama.",
        "What is Obama doing to get Hillary's supporters appeased?",
        "I'm looking forward for Obama to make his case for himself on Thursday night.",
        "Well, I mean, look.",
        "If the roles were reversed and Hillary Clinton were the nominee and if we were spending all this time talking about what Barack Obama wants and what Barack Obama's people want, I think there would be an outrage from the Hillary Clinton people saying, look, I'm the nominee, not him, let's focus on me.",
        "So I think Obama has been very magnanimous about this - what's been a distraction for him.",
        "He has not shown any irritation.",
        "He has not criticized.",
        "But the Clinton people do feel that Obama has not done enough to raise money for Clinton.",
        "And Hillary Clinton - you know, it's interesting, right after Hillary Clinton gave that great speech last night, her campaign sent out another fundraising email saying, you know, it was a great speech, but please give money to us.",
        "When everybody was holding up the Hillary Clinton signs last night, on the bottom, it did not say, barackobama.org, it said hillaryclinton.org.",
        "So it was very interesting that there still seems to be two different camps there.",
        "But again, obviously, I suspect, just as Hillary Clinton did last night, Barack Obama's speech would not only talk about what he intends to do as president, what American people need to hear, but a very gracious, I suspect, reach out to Hillary Clinton.",
        "He's already said that he thought her speech last night was outstanding.",
        "Well, it was certainly a great speech.",
        "Anyway, we're talking with our political junkie, Ken Rudin.",
        "If you'd like to read his political column, say, some reason you think that may be helpful, you can find the Political Junkie column at npr.org.",
        "He's with us every Wednesday here at the Newseum.",
        "Today he's in Denver.",
        "Next week he'll join us from Saint Paul in Minnesota where the Republicans hold their convention contest.",
        "We're expecting Senator McCain to announce his vice-presidential pick on Friday of this week to try to take whatever steam may have built up by the Democrats away as quickly as possible and get the Republicans back on the front burner.",
        "And of course, you'll find coverage of that right here at NPR and on npr.org.",
        "You can listen to coverage of the convention at npr.org, and tonight, at many of these NPR radio stations - I'll get that straight.",
        "You're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "And let's get Kat on the line, Kat calling us from Grand Junction in Colorado.",
        "Hello.",
        "Hi.",
        "What I'm taking away from watching the whole thing this week is the kind of hope that we've all been needing for so long, and also, I think it was Deval Patrick who called for us to let go of our cynicism.",
        "I have been fighting this for so long.",
        "So many people have become so cynical about our political process and the direction our country has gone in the past failed eight years.",
        "What I'm hearing from Deval Patrick and the other speakers who are so inspirational, the governor of Montana and Hillary Clinton herself, is that we need to let go of the cynicism and really, really put our hope into - back in Barack Obama."

        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean, it obviously was a brutal primary campaign but Barack Obama can be very inspirational.",
        "I think one of the reasons he will be the nominee officially tomorrow - officially tonight, actually, is because he is inspirational and he sells hope.",
        "Hillary Clinton in the past has said he needs more than rhetoric.",
        "John McCain, of course, has tried to pick up on that theme, but you know, there was a lot of hope in 1988 for the Democrats in Atlanta.",
        "Michael Dukakis came out of the convention with a 17-point lead.",
        "So it would be very interesting to see.",

        "I just want to know why the elitist question has been such a big deal during the primaries in this whole election on both sides.",
        "Isn't the whole point of the primary, isn't the election to find the best, most qualified candidate?",
        "And wouldn't we want a member of the elite as a president or is it just a question of status or attitude?"

        "Well, elite is one of those loaded, you know, pejoratives.",
        "I mean, you know, you don't want somebody to be elitist but - theoretically, I mean, Franklin D.",
        "Roosevelt was an elitist, John F.",
        "Kennedy was elitist, and yet they still spoke for the common man and common language.",
        "So I think it's just something they like to throw out at people.",
        "And then when you talk about Barack Obama's education - I mean, the thought of somebody, you know, being born in Hawaii to white and black parents coming out as an elitist is pretty remarkable.",
        "But you know something, I think the McCain people know that they have a great orator in Barack Obama, and I don't think they know how to deal with it.",
        "And so what they decided that elitist would be the kind of word that you want to throw out there.",
        "And it certainly was the kind of charge that worked against John Kerry, too.",
        "That's true.",
        "I mean, but of course, you know, anybody who is windsurfing on vacation is something that exactly what fell into the hands just of the Bush campaign.",
        "George W.",
        "Bush was sold as somebody you'd like to go out and have a beer with, while, you know, John Kerry also was windsurfing.",
        "And the truth of it is, certainly the popularly cited numbers, are so infinitesimal, that, as you say, it only happens on TV.",
        "The study that everyone I think cites to, when we talk about how rarely this is used, is that only less than one percent of defendants actually plead insanity.",
        "And of that, only one quarter of that one percent are ever acquitted on that basis.",
        "Let me just tell you also, before we run out of time, that you should know that the delegates right now are all in their hotel rooms, they are now coalescing, they deciding who's voting for whom, and so when the roll call begins later this afternoon on the floor, you know, somebody from, you know, the state of Colorado, will come out and say, Colorado cast its 12 delegates for Hillary Clinton and 11 delegates for Barack Obama, whatever.",
        "So right now all the delegates are meeting in their rooms going over those numbers right now.",
        "We suspect that there will be an initial roll call, a tally of states at the convention, and then, again, the speculation is that Hillary Clinton will come out and call to stop the roll call vote and say Barack Obama's nomination should be made by acclamation.",
        "Ken Rudin, thanks very much.",

        "This all happened at the al Rawduh Sufi mosque in the northern Sinai.",
        "Egypt's chief prosecutor, Nabil Sadek, said in a statement today that between 25 and 30 people carried out the attack.",
        "They set off bombs at the mosque and then fired at worshipers as they tried to escape.",
        "No one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, but Egyptian security forces have been trying to uproot ISIS affiliates in the Sinai for the last four years.",
        "And ISIS had targeted Sufis in the past.",
        "Sufism's a branch of Sunni Islam that the Islamic State sees as heretical."

        "I mean, the Sinai region has been besieged for years, according to one account that I read, that some similar violence has unfolded in that area like every few weeks in recent months, that some - a thousand members of the Egyptian security forces have been killed there since 2013.",
        "Why is that?",
        "I mean, first of all, you have to recall that the Sinai part of Egypt has unique character and a unique history.",
        "It was occupied by the Israelis, and then the Egyptians got back from the Israelis.",
        "It's always been an area with security concerns.",
        "And Egypt has seen armed insurgency in its recent history - 30, 40 years.",
        "It ebbed and flowed.",

        "And in many ways, the insurgency has found fertile ground to grow, particularly since the current president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, when he deposed the elected president of Egypt in the summer of 2013.",
        "It was expected that the insurgency would grow.",
        "And now, we're obviously talking about a - an ISIS presence.",
        "So, you know, the terrorist threat in the Sinai, although it had existed in various forms in the past, now that, you know, you have affiliates of ISIS, it has obviously taken new and bigger significance.",
        "Do you see this moment as a turning point?",
        "Does it say something about Egypt's ability to prevent insurgents in the country, or is it something specific to that region?",
        "And the other question is that, you know, Christians, as we know, have been targeted in the past, but this is the first major attack on a Muslim congregation in Egypt.",
        "And does that say something also?",
        "The issue of terrorist attacks and terrorism in Egypt, this is a very, very, very serious situation, not just in the Sinai but in various parts of the country.",
        "Remember that there have been attacks in recent years even in Cairo, where the central government is obviously seated.",
        "But the scale and the toll of this particular attack is unprecedented.",
        "The official figures are talking about over 300 people killed and over a hundred injured among them children.",
        "So it is a major challenge for the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in all manner of ways.",
        "It casts doubt over the policy that he has tried to pursue to combat terrorism.",
        "And a lot of voices will be telling him that, look, your strategy for combating terrorism is not working because combating terrorism, yes, you have to be tough using the army and the police, but there are other components, including basically local political participation and opening up the system.",
        "And so far, since 2013, it's been - Egypt has been run by an iron fist, not allowing for that kind of participation.",
        "And very briefly before we let you go, it's been designated a military zone.",
        "Egyptian and Western journalists have had difficulty entering there.",
        "In fact, I don't know that there are any Western journalists there.",

        "Probably not.",
        "It's very difficult to get the full picture.",
        "But you'll get a lot of news outlets, obviously, because of the importance of Egypt, have invested a lot of time and effort to actually build contacts and network of contacts with local Egyptians everywhere.",
        "So in terms of military information, unless it filters through the filters of the government, it doesn't come out.",
        "So you have to have alternatives.",
        "It's now that those contacts that you build as a journalist have become very, very important because at least they help give you an alternative view of what's happening."
