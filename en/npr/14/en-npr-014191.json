        "As NPR's Eric Westervelt reports, many of the refugees are unsure how to start to rebuild their lives.",
        "So this is such an inconsequential number, but I think it really, really does churn up enormous anger and outrage, a sense of terrific injustice and, as we'll probably talk about, a feeling that people fake it, that they fake insanity in order to sort of trick the system, and that's where the blowback comes in.",
        "And the fact is, even if they get off as a result of insanity, they may end up spending more time in a psychiatric institution, which may be no bed of roses, than they might have at a prison.",
        "That's right.",
        "Certainly, the notion that people fake insanity, are acquitted by a jury, and they're out next day molesting little girls again is such a far cry from the reality.",
        "But again, I think that there's a real, some kind of visceral response that happens, that all it really takes is one John Hinckley or one Andrea Yates, the Texas mother who killed her children so horrifically, to prevail on an insanity claim, and people really clamor to get rid of it all together.",
        "Joining us now from New York is Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz.",
        "He's defended several clients with the insanity defense, and nice to have you back on the program.",

        "It certainly must continue to exist in view of a person who's lived his whole life law-abiding, and he develops an Alzheimer at the age of 80.",
        "And, at the age of 85, he hugs somebody thinking that that person simply is accepting his hug.",
        "And he doesn't understand his own strength, and he kills him.",
        "Nobody would want his tombstone to say felon.",
        "He was a sick man who killed out of a biological medical disease.",
        "That's an extreme case, but it shows us why we must preserve some kind of insanity defense.",
        "It doesn't mean that people who commit these kind of horrendous acts and then, after the fact, try to justify it by some hard-to-diagnose condition that sounds more like evil than it does like sickness, should have the benefit of an insanity defense.",
        "But we surely shouldn't abolish it.",
        "And insanity, we should also remember, is a legal term.",
        "It's not a medical term.",
        "It's completely a legal term.",
        "There's no medical definition of insanity.",
        "And indeed, even the statistics we heard previously have to be explained a little bit.",
        "Yes, only one percent of defendants invoke the insanity defense, and that's for a very obvious reason.",
        "The vast, vast majority of defendants who would be insane at trial are also incompetent to stand trial.",
        "So they never, ever reach the legal system.",
        "They are filtered out by incompetency to stand trial.",
        "If you have somebody who is completely out of touch, say my Alzheimer's sufferer, he would never get near a trial.",
        "He would never be indicted, he would certainly never be prosecuted, and he would never be brought to trial.",
        "He'd be filtered out earlier and either committed to a mental hospital or some treatment facility.",
        "So, when you think about those people who raise insanity defenses, they have to be people who first, are found competent to stand trial, that is, pass through that barrier and then claim that, although they're now OK, they were not OK when they committed the crime.",
        "That's why it's so rare.",
        "And when they committed the crime, they also have to admit they did it.",
        "Well, no, they don't have to admit they did it.",
        "You can claim the alternative, you know, when I borrow - I didn't borrow your plate.",
        "And if I borrowed it, it was broken.",
        "If it wasn't broken, I gave it back to you.",
        "You can plead in the alternative.",
        "You can say, I didn't do it, or I didn't have the mental element to commit the crime.",
        "But if I did, I was mentally ill and insane at the time.",
        "I mean, there are cases that go both ways.",
        "As the Hinckley case, which seems like an injustice on one side.",
        "And then, there's the John Du Pont case, that I had something to do with on appeal, that went the other way.",
        "John du Pont, a person who was so clearly and certifiably mentally ill, he killed his best friend when he honestly believed his best friend was the body of a Russian agent, who was designed to come and kill him.",
        "And he killed in what he believed was self-defense.",
        "Everybody acknowledged that he was paranoid-schizophrenic.",
        "But because Pennsylvania, post-Hinckley, changed its law and created a new category called guilty and mentally ill, he was found guilty and mentally ill.",
        "And, as far as I know, he's currently still serving his prison sentence.",
        "There are a number of states that, I think after Hinckley, abolished the insanity defense all together, at least four in this country, I think."

        "Well, you know, they try to do it.",

        "And the criteria for release is that they're no longer a danger to themselves or to others.",
