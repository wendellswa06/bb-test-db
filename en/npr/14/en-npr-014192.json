        "If you think about the statistics we started with, which is a quarter of one percent of the folks who plead this actually prevail.",
        "And then look at the statistics of the number of people who are under the legal definition of insanity being found competent to stand trial and then tried.",
        "I think there's a huge mismatch there.",
        "Dahlia Lithwick, senior legal correspondent and senior editor at the online magazine slate.com, also legal correspondent for NPR's Day to Day and for Newsweek magazine, with us today from the studios at the University of Virginia.",
        "That used to be, for a period mid-century in the last century, there was a time when we really did defer to our mental health experts to sort that out.",
        "And shortly after the Hinckley trial and certainly through - slightly earlier than that, in the 70s, we got away from that.",
        "There became a real feeling that we had deferred far too much to mental health experts, that two experts would find two different things.",
        "As the caller says, the standards were so wildly different about what mental health meant, that we entrusted this to a profession that couldn't actually get the job done.",
        "And so we've really drifted back toward the original McNaughten rule that we've talked about.",
        "This ability to discern right from wrong.",
        "And even that differs from state to state and jurisdiction to jurisdiction.",
        "So I think there is a huge problem with both deferring too much to experts to sort our these questions, and also now, a system in which we, perhaps, don't defer enough.",
        "Kevin, thanks very much.",
        "Thank you, sir.",
        "Christopher Slobogin believes there should be a narrower definition of the insanity defense.",
        "He teaches law at the University of Florida's Levin's College of Law, and he joins us now from his office in Gainesville, Florida.",
        "Nice to have you on the program today.",
        "Good afternoon, Neal.",
        "And how would you change the way the insanity defense is currently applied?",
        "Well, I'm not against giving exculpatory effect to people with mental disability.",
        "But my problem with current insanity tests, that, as was just mentioned, has to do with an inability to appreciate that the act was wrong or an inability to control behavior.",
        "The problem with those tests is, if they're read literally, they excuse far too many people."

        "If you take the Fritzl case, for instance, it could easily be said that he didn't appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct.",
        "He may have even thought it was OK to do what he was doing.",
        "And he might also be able to say, honestly, he felt strong urges to commit the act.",
        "But the same can be said with respect to many people who commit crimes.",
        "And it's not enough to say that most criminals do not have mental disorder.",
        "Because, given the broad definition of that term, many people who do horrible things can be said to have a bonafide mental disorder.",
        "So what I would do is, instead, change the focus of the inquiry in these cases to what the precise reasons for acting were.",
        "And so what I would do, for instance, is compare people with mental illness to people who are not mentally disabled.",
        "A person who is not mentally disabled, who thinks he's acting in self-defense, should have a defense.",
        "I think all of us agree with that.",
        "And I would argue, so should a person with mental disability.",
        "Even if it turns out that because of his delusions, he has misperceived the situation.",
        "So, as is often the case, including with the du Pont case that Professor Dershowitz mentioned a little bit earlier, if a mentally ill person thinks his victim is out to hurt him, he should have a defense.",
        "But what if he thinks, like the Son of Sam, that he's getting instructions from his neighbor's dog?",
        "Somebody else told him to do it?",
        "That - based on what I know of that case, he would not have a defense.",
        "And, in fact, Son of Sam was not found insane, which I think suggests that juries are more in line with what I'm suggesting than what the literal language of the insanity test reads like.",
        "Going to the John Hinckley case, as another example, there supposedly, even if you believe the defense, his belief was that, if he killed Reagan, Jodie Foster would fall in love with him.",
        "Even if you believe that to be true, that's not a justifiable reason for killing someone, no matter how mentally disordered he may have been.",
        "Or the Andrea Yates case, which we all know about.",
        "The woman who drowned her five children.",
        "She was clearly suffering from schizophrenia.",
        "But if, as the prosecution alleged, she killed her children because she couldn't handle the stress of dealing with them, then she should have been found sane, not insane.",
        "Only if you believe the defense, which claim that killed her children to make sure they went to heaven, rather than hell, would she possibly have an excuse under the approach that I'm advocating?",
        "So this would narrow the application.",
        "Dahlia Lithwick, how do you think it would change the way we see this played out in courtrooms?",
        "I guess it's a tricky question because trying to figure out the motives of someone like Andrea Yates seems to me so problematical.",
        "We know, certainly, that that part of it seems almost the easiest.",
        "If you're worried about fakery, it's almost easier to fake that you got instructions from your neighbor's dog.",
        "I think - my own feeling is that the test, the sort of hybrid test that we have now, that both encompasses the ability to ascertain right from wrong, the original McNaughton test, with a prong of it that I think is crucial, which is this impulse control prong.",
        "The prong that says - the colloquial way of thinking about it, Neal, is, if there were a policeman at your elbow, would you be able to stop yourself.",
        "And the more liberal states use that as a gloss on the original McNaughton test, the right from wrong test."

        "It seems to me that impulse control test is another way of asking, I think, the same question, which is, if you really, really know that what you're doing is wrong, but you cannot keep yourself from doing it, I'm willing to say that's also insanity.",
        "And I think that might be an easier way or a more elegant way of answering this what seems to me much more nebulous question about motive.",
        "Christopher Slobogin, with that uncontrollable impulse, where would that fall in your definition?",
        "This is such a thorny problem, and we don't seem to have a good system to resolve it, and so we're sort of seeing different things tried all over the place.",

        "Thanks for your time.",
        "Well, I have a huge problem with that test.",
        "Even though, I guess intuitively it makes sense to exculpate someone who really couldn't help themselves.",
        "The problem is that many criminals can credibly state that they felt very strong urges at the time they committed the offense, and that would include people, for instance, with pedophilia as well as people with schizophrenia.",
        "In other words, this inquiry into whether someone's volitionally impaired is very difficult, and I think it's fair to say that mental health professionals would much rather deal with motives than with trying to figure out whether an impulse is irresistible or merely not resisted.",
        "And so, numerically, how much do you think your definition would change things?",
        "Well, to tell you the truth, I'm not sure it would change it drastically.",
        "My test would not require a person to be bouncing off the walls.",
        "It would just require that the person show that the mental disability led them to have - the least, lead them to think that they're about to be harmed.",
        "And would it effect those that Professor Dershowitz said would be found incompetent to stand trial, the Alzheimer's patient, say?",
        "Well, that person would clearly have a defense because, in that situation, at least my understanding of those facts, the person didn't even intend to commit a crime.",
        "And, of course, a person who is not mentally disabled has a defense in that situation, so I think so should a person with mental disability."

        "Some studies suggest that all jurors are doing is deciding, in their gut, whether the person is crazy or not, and then, they may add in to the calculus the type of crime committed and combining those two factors, come up with a verdict, And a lot of times it's not really explicable, given the pertinent insanity test.",

        "And so he has now been at the top level that he can be at, has the most open privileges that they offer at the hospital, but he is not being allowed to get forward with his life.",
