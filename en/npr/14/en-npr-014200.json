        "That seems to me to be a bit of an imbalance.",

        "It featured a risque photo of Trump's wife, Melania, from years ago.",
        "And so it went.",

        "It was not supposed to be secret, Khrushchev didn't mean it to become secret.",
        "It's called secret because he was preparing it in secret, knowing there would be very hard to deliver it because he wasn't sure what would be the political and the monoculture attitude towards it.",
        "So that's why it's considered a secret speech.",
        "And the reason, then, it was not widely advertised, after the speech although it wasn't concealed from the people either, was that when the information about the speech started coming out, and there were pretty drastic uncovering of Stalin's rimes of the Gulags, of millions and millions of people who went to prison during Stalin's regime, the reaction of the nation was, the nation was stunned.",
        "It was an anxiety, it was not, sort of, happiness that we uncovered the truth about ourselves, Russia, the Soviet Union uncovered the truth about itself.",
        "Not so much fear, but just absolute anxiety.",
        "And the sad consequence is, at least the immediate ones, is that the secret speech became indeed secret because the nation, although wanted freedoms, it also didn't want to discuss how horrible pre-freedom situation was.",
        "So people were coming back from the Gulags after the speech, after 1956, they were given new jobs, they were reinstated in the communist party, they were getting pensions, but they were not supposed to discuss it anywhere, what are the things they went through.",
        "And this was, kind of a predicament of Russia.",
        "It opens up and then closes itself down, and sort of this cycle continues.",
        "And one of the things you say in this piece is that Russia's failure to deal, to cope, to understand and bring fully out the crimes of Joseph Stalin, leads to, has repercussions to this day.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And, it's not so much even the information that Russia doesn't have.",
        "For example, when Mikhail Gorbachev came into power in 1985, he declared his policies of Glasnost, and then the Soviet people learned everything that they was there to be learned about, to be learned about Stalin.",
        "But the problem is, since the nation, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and I'm a great fan of Boris Yeltsin, the next President of Russian, post-Soviet President, post-communist President of Russia, but he was also the exile from the party.",
        "He was also the member of the party.",
        "And if the Soviet system was corrupt and thus collapsed, then when the Yeltsin system came in and became equally corrupt, it's very hard to actually deal with the problems of the past when the problems of the present are piling up.",
        "We're talking with Nina Khrushcheva, the great-granddaughter of former Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, who, 50 years ago this month delivered the famous secret speech denouncing Joseph Stalin.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News.",

        "I think it is a little too strong, but if we go this way, probably two, three years from now we're going to be, it would be exactly the right word to use.",

        "So you have to get your pride somewhere.",
        "And Stalin, especially now when the Gulags are no longer, you can look back and think, well, it was the time, it was the order that Stalin provided, the prices were going down, we were respected around the world, and so on.",
        "And since you don't have to pay for it with your own life, in a way you could afford, 50 years later, that in fact, that was a great time.",
        "Because you, you're not afraid of your own life anymore, and so that really brings the reemergence of Stalin.",
        "And current President of Russia, Vladimir Putin does play on that quite well, because he does see himself, not as a brutal dictator, he actually doesn't want that part of Stalin to be part of his personality, but the fact that he can bring order to the country, the respect on the world's stage, and that he takes from Stalin, and talks about that.",
        "One of the big differences between Putin and Stalin, well, there are many, but one of the big differences is that the current Russian leader is not, doesn't seem to be an ideologue.",
        "Well, he is in a sense, but he's very mild ideologue, only for the, he's a very pragmatic ideologue, so he does it for his own pragmatic purposes.",
        "Oh, there are many, many differences, I by no means want to say that Putinism today is what Stalinism was, absolutely not, by no, because Putinism is a hybrid of a lot of different things.",
        "And, you know, Putinism also, some think that also takes from the Yeltsin years, that as anarchical and maybe corrupt they were, there was still some hope that Russia would eventually become the West, because that's what it wanted to be, a democratic country.",
        "So Putinism is not Stalinism in any way.",
        "And, if Putin is ideological, only in a sense that he brings dictatorship of law and order.",
        "He wants to bring Russia back into the world's stage.",

        "It's either Russian orthodox religion or communism, the ritual values that we highly believe in, he took this faith away.",
        "And that I think he will never be forgiven for.",
        "And he's in somewhat of a predicament as, probably we will always be in a predicament, because for the hardliners, for those who want Russia to be at any cost, to be the greatest country on earth, even if it would kill half of its population, he cannot be recognized exactly because he took the faith away, and he wanted to open up, and he, you know, and he brought bourgeois Pepsi Cola to Russia, and the first washing machine, and what not, opening up the borders.",
        "And for the liberals, for the liberal reformers, he would always be a dictator, because he also participated in the building of Stalin's regime, and he also sent people to death.",
        "And he was also a Stalin man, up to a certain point.",
        "So he would always be sitting in this sort of foundation pit, in a way, because he wanted good for the country but he came out of the system that by definition is despotic.",
