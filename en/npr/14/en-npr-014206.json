        "You can hear a whoop and brief applause, rare at a sober diplomatic press conference, and suggesting the emotions of this moment.",
        "Secretary Kerry showed increasing emotion himself when he sat down with us afterward.",
        "Kerry was visibly weary when he arrived.",
        "He's been walking on crutches after a recent accident.",
        "But he was ready to answer his critics, who are many.",
        "The Iran deal faces a tough vote in Congress.",
        "Restoring relations with Cuba drew fierce questions, too.",
        "Some weeks ago, we spoke with Marco Rubio, who's running for president, one of the Republican candidates, who said that if elected, he would reverse the Cuba policy, that he would break off diplomatic relations with Cuba.",
        "Can the next president, in practical terms, undo what you have done?",
        "Well, any president has obviously the ability to make a decision.",
        "Congress obviously has ability to have an impact on that.",
        "But I think it would be a terrible mistake.",
        "The vast majority of the American people believe this is a very good thing to do.",
        "It doesn't make sense.",
        "I mean, we had diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.",
        "We had diplomatic relations with then-called Red China.",
        "You know, we have to have relationships with countries to do business.",
        "And American citizens get hurt when we don't do that.",
        "Although Secretary Kerry is not yet ready to push for normal diplomatic relations with that other nation, Iran.",
        "Well, could I imagine it?",
        "I'm sure I could conjure up some imagination - but has to be way off in the future with a huge amount of changes from where we are today.",
        "There's a reason John Kerry has to say this.",
        "World leaders and U.S.",
        "lawmakers worry about far more than Iran's nuclear program.",
        "In fact, this debate never was entirely about nuclear weapons.",
        "It's also about what else Iran might do in the region.",
        "Critics argue that a nuclear deal with its end to economic sanctions freeze Iran to pursue its ambitions across the Mideast.",
        "Secretary Kerry insists Iran will have to change its behavior.",
        "Well, Iran has to engage with the world and make it clear that it's going to stop supporting terror and stop exporting weapons to terrorists and engage in activities that join the community of nations in a constructive way.",
        "Well, that leads to another question, also.",
        "Will the nuclear deal make Iran in effect more powerful?",
        "Because Iran has given up some nuclear research progress in exchange for $100 billion in unfrozen assets and a lot of other benefits.",
        "Well, it's given up a lot more than that.",
        "I mean, Iran without a nuclear weapon is a very different Iran than one with one, and this is why many of us are so amazed at the reaction of some people.",
        "Israel, for instance, is much safer without an Iranian nuclear weapon.",
        "And we believe that what we have done in this deal and even before this deal in the last two years is roll back Iran's nuclear program.",
        "Before we became engaged with Iran, they had a two-month breakout time.",
        "Now they'll be going to a year breakout time.",
        "Is Israel safer with a year, or aren't you?",
        "I mean, this is pretty straightforward.",
        "So I believe over time, we will show people in the Congress and elsewhere in the country that Israel, the Gulf states, the countries in the region are much safer with this deal than without it.",
        "Iran will also have a much larger economy, presumably, which is good for the people of Iran.",
        "But won't that allow it to project its influence even more forcefully throughout the region?"

        "No, for a number of different reasons.",
        "First of all, a lot of people are ignoring the fact that there's a pretty natural divide between Persia and the Arab world.",
        "There's also a divide between Shia and Sunni, Sunni being the vast majority of the Arab world.",
        "In addition, there are other stakes here, which will change things, in that if Iran continues to support these bad activities, we have agreed with the Gulf states that we are going to push back intensely.",
        "We're going to do additional training with those Gulf states.",
        "We're going to provide them with counterterrorism training, with special forces operational training, with cyber, and with other capacities.",
        "So the region will gain in stability.",
        "If Iran chooses to engage in these activities, they're going to find a very different pushback than has existed in the previous years.",
        "When Kerry speaks of the Gulf states, he means Iran's Arab neighbors.",
        "Some have opposed U.S.",
        "cooperation with Iran, their historic rival.",
        "That means they broadly agree with Israel, whose prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, denounced the deal on NPR News last week.",
        "All of this leaves Kerry arguing the United States will keep pressure on Iran.",
        "So we are going to engage with others in making sure that we hold Iran accountable to standards that it must be expected to live up to.",
        "Do you feel you are actually freer to push against Iran than you were before?",
        "Absolutely, in many - well, not freer in the sense of I believe we're free to do this because that's clearly not part of our agreement.",
        "All we did was negotiate a nuclear restraint.",
        "And the reason is very straightforward.",
        "If you're going to push back against Iran, it is better to push back against an Iran without a nuclear weapon than one with one.",

        "The attorney general visited a UNICOR facility where inmates were making military uniforms out of camouflage material, and she also had some private meetings with inmates.",
        "This is all, Michel, part of efforts designed to help inmates return to society, focus on getting them ID cards, make it easier for them to try to get jobs and reconnect with their families, and as you heard Attorney General Lynch say, make it less likely for them to commit new crimes.",

        "But Michel, the path forward here in Congress is still very unclear.",
        "There're critics on the left who say the bill doesn't go far enough, and on the right, people like Arkansas Republican Sen.",
        "Tom Cotton say, the government should not be helping free criminals who could come back to society and hurt innocent people.",
        "And of course, at the White House level the president has some of his own power here.",
        "He's granted clemency to a few hundred inmates of - over the course of his tenure, and officials there say, we should expect more pardons and commutations later this year.",
