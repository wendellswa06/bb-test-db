        "Every app that I've tested so far tells you towards the end that there is no guarantee that we can protect your data completely.",
        "Usually, when you do this you do this, you do this in person with a researcher or on the phone.",
        "You have the opportunity to ask a number of questions.",
        "You have the opportunity to demonstrate that maybe you don't quite understand what you're signing up for.",
        "Now, the informed consent process with the apps - they do ask you a number of questions to verify that you understand everything that you've just read, but these questions are yes-no questions.",

        "This means that the institutions where they are based in - they need to have an independent ethics board review the work to make sure that the people who are partaking in it are properly informed about the risks, are aware of how everything will run, that the questions are valuable questions that are being asked and that we're not conducting a study of little value.",

        "That's a question that a lot of analysts are asking right now because Debaltseve was the center of some of the heaviest fighting in the weeks leading up to the peace talks.",
        "So it was a known problem, and yet, Debaltseve is not even mentioned by name in the Minsk document.",
        "It only mentions that the cease-fire was supposed to start on Sunday in certain areas of the Luhansk and Donetsk provinces.",
        "Elsewhere, this document does say that the two sides will withdraw their heavy weapons from a line that was decided back in September when the first cease-fire was negotiated.",
        "But there's ambiguity here, and that seems odd given that the document is very specific in other places.",
        "The cease-fire wasn't supposed to take effect until nearly 60 hours after the document was signed.",
        "Everybody must have known that the fighting was going to continue during that time.",
        "I mean, is there an implication here that that extra time was allowed so the separatists could finish the job on this town and capture it?"
