        "What's clear is that he's gained enough confidence that they felt that the dangers of an intervening outweighed the potential benefits, and he was willing to go up against his generals and his Defense Department.",

        "There's some possibility if we set aside the budget fights to do something serious and just change the subject.",
        "E.J., your wish list?",
        "I have a very similar wish list, and I really hope he does talk about shared economic growth and equality and the decline of economic mobility.",
        "And I think he is going to call for an end to these budget fights.",
        "He's consistently said we can't be running budget policy on a constant, unnecessary, emergency basis.",
        "The question is, how can you end that?",
        "And it'll be interesting to see if he puts something on the table that would end it, and also I want him to warn that if we cut and cut this year, we could endanger a very fragile recovery.",
        "And of course the Republican reply coming from Senator Marco Rubio.",

        "That's roughly twice as many as he got in Michigan, which apportions its delegates by the outcome in each congressional district.",
        "Now, because of party rules, it is possible that Romney could lose some of those Arizona delegates if they're challenged at the Republican convention.",
