        "What wasn't working?",
        "Practically everything, I mean the fit wasn't working.",
        "Because the female has, of course, a narrower waist and a shorter torso, they found the body armor was too long.",
        "It was bruising their hip bones.",
        "They could not sit down without the body armor riding up like a cage and sort of covering their chin.",
        "They couldn't tighten the shoulders enough to get a close enough feel to the chest.",
        "They felt like the sides and the top, they were vulnerable.",
        "There were openings where they weren't being protected.",
        "Because they just couldn't adjust it well enough, so just making a smaller size of the male body armor wouldn't work?",
        "Not exactly because, as you know, a female has curves.",
        "So we needed to do something to the outer shell of the armor to bring it closer to the female body.",
        "We decided to add the plate that they wear on top of it, put it on the outside with a side plate opening, so it would curve over the chest.",
        "We also narrowed the shoulders because the soldier finds that - a female soldier had trouble with the current body armor because when they placed their weapon on the shoulder, there was no place for the end of the weapon to hold.",
        "Now that the shoulder is narrower, they can fit the head of the weapon right up against the shoulder of the body armor.",
        "So before the body armor got in the way, they had to sort of shove aside.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, as the women at Fort Campbell have been making these test runs with the new design, what have you been hearing from them?"
