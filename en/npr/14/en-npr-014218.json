        "If you want to do development, you need defense, but if you want to bring only defense, it won't work.",
        "You need to show people that if the area is safe, we can do development.",

        "Nelson is a single mother.",

        "They got off the bus, which is directly across the street from her apartment complex, and her and her three children - it was getting dark.",
        "She wanted to get them home as quickly as possible because they weren't used to being out after dark.",
        "So she did what she said a lot of neighbors in her community do, which was she crossed from where the bus stop was located to a median in the center of the four-lane state roadway.",
        "And she says that's when her son ran into the road, and she ran after him.",
        "And she, her son and her youngest daughter were then struck by the hit-and-run driver.",
        "And her son died of injuries from the accident.",
        "The driver had been drinking.",
        "He was partially blind and had a criminal record.",
        "When police finally caught him, he ended up spending just six months in jail.",

        "Now, Nelson's apartment complex is directly across the street from the bus stop, a bus stop that primarily serves that complex.",
        "But the nearest crosswalk is a third of a mile away.",
        "And so that night, tired after missing the bus and rushing to get three kids home to bed, Nelson crossed in the middle of the road.",

        "Well, I'm not going to make a legal judgment about that.",
        "But one irony of the situation is, when I asked county officials if they were planning to address the safety issue here - and by the way, the state Department of Transportation, it's really their route, and they should be taking care of this - neither of them will answer the question of whether they're going to fix this situation because, they say, we can't talk about it because of the possibility of pending litigation - which means if they were to go out and fix the problem, it would be a tacit acknowledgment that the problem existed.",
