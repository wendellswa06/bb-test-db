        "If you're going to talk about controlling costs, doesn't that open you to the same argument that was made against the White House and against the Democrats in Congress - they're trying to restrict our health care, they're trying to make sure that we can't get the health care we need, that kind of argument?",
        "No.",
        "You know, the principle behind what we try to do - and I'll give you one other real-life example - with our state employees, the costs were going through the roof so we created a new system.",
        "We said, look, you can go anywhere you want, but if you choose to go somewhere that's really expensive with poor results, you're paying more.",
        "And if you choose to go somewhere that has better results and is more efficient, you'll pay less.",
        "People now have an incentive to make wise decisions and comparison shop.",
        "And even in the rudimentary form it's in in Minnesota, it works.",
        "But there were conservatives over the past couple of years who found it terrifying that the government would get involved in deciding which treatments were effective, which treatments were not worth the money.",
        "Well, again, the ultimate goal here isn't for anyone to decide which treatments are good or bad.",
        "But you're deciding what you're going to pay for and how much.",
        "No, but as a proxy for outcomes people sometimes want to pay for best protocols, but that isn't the ultimate goal.",
        "The ultimate goal is to say we're going to pay for better outcomes.",
        "If you go someplace with bad outcomes and it's really expensive, you'll pay more of the bill.",
        "Well, let me ask another thing that perhaps you can offer advice on.",
        "We can presume that Republicans in Congress will vote to repeal President Obama's health care law.",
        "We can presume that repeal will not go very far, since Democrats still control the Senate and the White House.",
        "And as that battle goes on, there will be the question about whether there is something Congress might pass that might improve the health care situation.",
        "If asked for one piece of advice, whether large or small, what would you suggest that people in Congress consider in the next two years?",
        "Payment reform and stop paying for volumes and procedures and start paying, at least in part, for better health care outcomes."

        "Take that pilot program and actually make that something broad that applies to millions of people.",
        "Yes.",
        "The pilot program's interesting and it's, in general, might be of some value, but it was tucked in there, I think, to satisfy some of the Republicans and doesn't have, I don't think, broader, deep impact.",

        "Sure.",
