        "Good morning.",

        "We have word this morning that the United States has asked Switzerland to extradite movie director Roman Polanski.",
        "A hearing will be held in Switzerland before any decision is made.",
        "Mr. Polanski has been a fugitive from the United States for 31 years now.",
        "This report contains graphic material.",
        "If you don't want him to snap at you, don't ask Steve Cooley, L.A.'s no-nonsense district attorney, why it took three decades to arrest Roman Polanski for forcing sex on a 13-year-old girl.",
        "He wouldn't surrender himself.",
        "He fled this jurisdiction to avoid sentencing.",
        "He fled the jurisdiction.",
        "So it took this long because he was a fugitive.",
        "If a fugitive returns to face punishment on his own, that's often taken into consideration, says former assistant D.A.",
        "Robin Sax.",
        "Usually, cooperation from a suspect is going to be beneficial to a suspect or defendant in a case.",
        "But in Polanski's case, the nature of his crime might have trumped everything else.",
        "Sax, who specialized in prosecuting sex crimes against children, says if Polanski had not plea-bargained his offenses down to one count - unlawful sex with a minor - he could have faced some serious jail time for the other counts on which he was indicted.",
        "There would've been a life sentence or a very serious punishment, in this case.",
        "I mean, here you have rape of an intoxicated person, sodomy of an intoxicated person, oral copulation of an intoxicated person.",
        "This isn't like one random, out-of-the-blue act that could have been misinterpreted.",
        "Now, the question is how to defend a 30-year-old case.",
        "Mark Geragos is a nationally known defense lawyer who has represented several high-profile defendants such as Michael Jackson, congressman Gary Condit and singer Chris Brown.",
        "Defending Polanski now, Geragos says, is going to be even harder than it would have been had he gone to trial in 1978.",
        "He's in a demonstrably different position than he was back in the '70s.",
        "In the '70s, you did not have 24/7 cable, you didn't have the blogosphere, you didn't have people kind of up in arms.",
        "And it was a different milieu, if you will, and I think that that's a very difficult process for him."

        "That said, Geragos says the D.A.",
        "should be more mindful of what Polanski's victim wants.",
        "Now 45, she's said repeatedly she's tired of the publicity and is ready to get on with her life.",
        "But Geragos says in this case, the victim's wishes mean nothing.",
        "It's almost a schizophrenic thing on the part of the public.",
        "On the one hand, the public is saying - and voting into law constitutionally, here in California - that the victim's got a right to have a voice in the process.",
        "And yet in this case, when she voices what she wants in this process, the people are saying, well, we don't want to hear from her.",
        "Given the circumstances, former prosecutor Robin Sax says the 76-year- old Polanski is almost sure to serve some jail time if he comes back - but probably a lot less than he would have if he'd gone on trial three decades ago.",
        "That's what I see happening.",
        "I don't think that this is going to turn into years and years of litigation.",
        "I think everyone has too much to lose.",

        "The centerpiece of Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain's campaign has been his 9-9-9 tax plan.",
        "Former Pennsylvania senator and Cain rival, Rick Santorum, has been focused on a different number, 99.",
        "That's how many counties there are in Iowa.",
        "And this past week, Santorum reached his goal of visiting every last one of them.",
        "But Iowa Public Radio's Kate Wells reports, it's not clear yet if the achievement will make a difference with voters.",
        "For Rick Santorum, typical campaign stops aren't packed halls or sold-out dinners.",
        "They're more likely to be a dozen voters and a couple boxes of donuts.",

        "Senator Santorum, please give us some remarks."

        "I don't know of any other candidate for president - I know, not this time, that's hit 99 counties.",
        "Heck, I think I'm not too sure all the candidates combined have been to Iowa 99 times, but we've worked, obviously, harder than anybody out there...",
        "All 99 counties visited and yet, just five percent of Iowa Republicans back Santorum, according to the latest Des Moines Register poll.",
        "With his ultra-conservative stances on abortion and same sex marriage, he's trying to remind voters of another social conservative.",
        "You know, four years ago, Mike Huckabee was 17 points out of the lead and ended up winning the Iowa caucuses.",
        "Just coincidentally, in the same Des Moines Register poll that was just released this weekend, we happen to be 17 points behind and so we feel like we're definitely within striking range and...",
        "But there's just one problem with Santorum's formula, says voter Helen Kind (ph).",
        "How come they didn't win?",
        "When asked if the most important thing in a candidate is the ability to beat President Obama, Kind says that's correct.",
