        "It would be about the size of the tip of your little finger and weigh only one to two grams.",
        "And if you see one of these plants in the wild, the fruit are so inconspicuous that you may not even see them.",
        "Even if they tasted good, getting enough to make a meal would be tough.",
        "So the first farmers were always in the lookout for larger varieties.",
        "Evidently, one day some early Mr. Green Jeans stumbled upon a plant that had undergone a genetic mutation.",
        "This apparently was a new mutation occurred very recently in terms of evolution, and it made a big impact when humans saw it and selected it.",
        "The mutation occurs in a gene called faciated.",

        "If you were to make a cross section of a tomato fruit, one of the big fruit you see in the supermarket, like a beefstake tomato, you'll see there's a number of compartments in there.",
        "These compartments have triangular shapes.",
        "There's a little dividing wall, and the soft flesh and seeds are in between.",
        "Wild tomatoes only have two to four compartments.",
        "And these large tomatoes have anywhere from five up to 20 of these compartments.",
        "So, in these tomatoes, the faciated gene can't do an effective job of keeping a lid on the fruit's size.",
        "When this gene is normally expressed, it's basically controlling and not letting the compartments go above a certain number.",
        "It's sort of a stop sign saying, stop here.",
        "You already have two or four compartments.",
        "So that, in the way, we should be grateful to the faciated gene for preventing the occurrence of giant killer tomatoes.",

        "Okay.",
