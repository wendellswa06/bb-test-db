        "The safety of its entire operations rested on the performance of a leaking, modified, defective blowout preventer.",
        "One of the problems cited by the committee was already well-known: The blowout preventer's blind-shear ram, the shear thats supposed to cut through the pipe and crimp it, can't actually cut all the way through if certain sections of drill pipe are in the way.",
        "A loose hydraulic fitting was letting fluid leak out.",
        "The blowout preventer had been modified; one of the modifications effectively crippled one of the five components in the blowout preventer.",
        "A piece of test equipment had been substituted for a ram that couldve helped to stanch the flow of oil.",
        "And there weren't good records of the modifications, so after the blowout, engineers couldnt figure out why robots weren't able to make the undersea control panel work right.",
        "And another control panel didnt work because it had a dead battery.",
        "Stupak said that disabled an emergency backup called a Dead Man Switch.",

        "Well, there are a whole series of things.",
        "He was really sent over to clear out what the White House saw was an intelligence agency at the top that was leaking information, it was undermining the Administration's position, not just on weapons of mass destruction looking backwards, but also the way the war was running, and particularly leaks that took place just prior to the 2004 election.",
        "He also went over with a sort of mandate to follow through on some of the findings of the early investigations about the failures before 9-11 and WMD.",
        "But he took with him a group of staff people who were from the Republican staff for the House Intelligence Committee, which he chaired, and they were former CIA people.",

        "Is it your understanding, though, that the President was unhappy with the kind of house cleaning that Porter Goss engaged in at the CIA?",
        "I think you have to call it not just the President, but the White House, because the Vice President, Dick Cheney, took an extremely firm interest.",
        "In fact, Porter Goss was looked on as his choice to go over there.",

        "One is dental plaque is a biofilm which is a very, very difficult thing to penetrate.",
        "So that's one of the reasons we chose the chewing gum.",
        "The mechanical action of just chewing gum has been shown to help break up that biofilm.",
