        "Well, since that time North Korea's set off, what, two more nuclear tests and a number of missile tests.",
        "So I think that all presidents, when confronted with somebody transgressing their red line, begin to say, well I didn't say what I would go do.",

        "Well, of course to the Iranians it probably has something to do with it.",
        "Now, the fact of the matter is that when it comes to red lines, the Israelis are in no better shape than the United States.",
        "By the count that Graham Allison of Harvard has taken and a great chart he's put together, the Israelis have moved their red line on Iran's nuclear program about seven or eight times over the past 15 years, things they said they could never tolerate the Iranians doing, and then the Iranians turned around and did them.",
        "But as you suggested in the opening, at this point there is some optimism among American and Israeli officials that the sanctions that they have put in place and that the Europeans have put in place are really beginning to bite into the core of the Iranian economy, which is to say their oil import revenues.",
        "And their revenues were, over the past month or so, were some of the lowest they've seen in nearly a quarter century.",
        "So the question is: Can that pressure actually affect the nuclear decision-making?",
        "And so far it hasn't.",
        "So far it hasn't.",
        "There's nothing to suggest in the various negotiations, there's been, well, procedural advances here and there, but on substance there seems to be no shift whatsoever.",
        "On substance this has gone absolutely nowhere.",
        "There was early optimism at the beginning of the year that the Iranians suggested that some elements of the proposal that the United States had put in place, which was to close the one facility that is the best protected, it's called Fordo, it's deep in a mountain in Iran, and it's where they're producing the kind of fuel that you could convert to weapons grade most quickly, and ship that fuel out of the country and do - take a number of other steps that would result in a gradual lifting of sanctions; the Iranians had initially indicated that might be the basis of a conversation.",
        "At their most recent set of negotiations, which were about three weeks ago, they basically went nowhere with that idea.",
        "And so we're sort of back where we were, which is that the Iranian capability is built up considerable and has recovered from something that I deal with at length in \"\"Confront and Conceal,\"\" which was the cyberwarfare program against the Iranian enrichment effort.",
        "This was what's commonly known as the Stuxnet virus, which was unleashed starting in 2008, 2009, and then because of a technical error became public in 2010.",
        "And if you look at the Iranian production records on nuclear fuel, you'll see a dip in 2010, but they've gotten past that now, and they are clearly moving ahead to produce their fuel at a pretty rapid clip.",
        "And there is, during the president's recent visit to Israel, seeming agreement between Washington and Jerusalem that the red line still has some months left to run.",
        "Well that's true, but you have to remember that the Israelis and the Americans still define their red lines differently.",
        "President Obama has said repeatedly that he would not let Iran get a nuclear weapon on his watch.",
        "He has been less specific on the question of whether they could get a nuclear capability, and the difference is important.",
        "A capability means the ability to go produce a weapon in fairly short order, even if you haven't turned the last screws.",
        "The Israeli red line is really set at the production of fuel, because their view is that once you've got the fuel in hand, actually producing a weapon can be done in a room basically the size of your radio studio and that you'd never see it."

        "Well, I wouldn't have described it that way.",
        "I think what it does do is it illustrates the enormous complexity of this tremendous number of sanctions that are imposed both by the U.S.",
        "and by the U.N.",
        "and by executive order and by Congress, how complicated it is.",
        "But for me, the central point is that sanctions aren't self-executing.",
        "They don't work absent a negotiating strategy to use them with.",
        "And that means you have to be clear about what steps on the Iranian part would induce you to raise which sanctions.",
        "If you don't do that, if your political system is allergic to that and is frozen against it, then sanctions can in fact be self-defeating because then the other side says, well, it doesn't matter what I do, I'm just going to be facing this same set of problems.",
        "Well in that case you're talking about political paralysis at the congressional level that no matter what the president does, Congress is going to impose sanctions?",
        "Well, particularly at the presidential level, but I think that's more broadly applied to both the whole - to the whole American public.",
        "We are not clear in the United States about what our goal is in Iran, and we need to be much clearer about whether it has to do just with nuclear issues or whether it also has to do with human rights, Iran's behavior in Lebanon, Iran's support of Hezbollah and indeed regime change, which is the usually unstated goal of some people.",
        "And Iran's support of the Syrian president as well."
