        "Yeah, of course.",
        "And as we go through all of that, that litany, though, isn't that the essence of negotiation, you sit in a room with somebody and say, if you do this, we will do that, you don't give away your position ahead of time?",
        "No, but you have to know what it is you would do, what you're - you know, what you're prepared to do, and at times say that.",
        "Otherwise having the sanctions just holds you back.",
        "They can bring somebody to the table.",
        "As David said, these things are really starting to hurt the Iranian economy.",
        "But they can't get you to agreement unless you're prepared to say this for that, this - you know, this action will produce this response on our part.",
        "And doesn't that take two parties, though, the Iranians to say we will do this in exchange for that?",
        "There's no question it does, and we haven't seen that kind of flexibility or preparedness on their part.",
        "But that doesn't excuse us from the need on our part.",
        "I mean it is so easy to say the Iranians are impossible, they're so hard to negotiate with, they don't really want an agreement.",
        "Some or all of that may be true.",
        "But unless we're prepared to deal on our side, we're not going to get anywhere.",
        "And...",
        "So unless we're prepared to hear at some point, yes, we can't start negotiation?",
        "Not start but succeed.",
        "I think there are two issues here on our part.",
        "One is: What sanctions would we be prepared to lift in exchange for what action on the Iranian side?",
        "That's the first one.",
        "And number two, which maybe is at least equally important, is we have to recognize that they are going to demand and to keep the right to enrich uranium in the context of a demonstrably peaceful program.",
        "And, you know, their argument has been for years the non-proliferation treaty gives them the right to enrich.",
        "Well, it doesn't give them the right to enrich, it gives them the right to enrich in a peaceful program and for peaceful purposes, and they cannot show that their program has been peaceful because there are 17 years of violations of the IAEA, et cetera.",
        "So - but we have to recognize that there is no way to yes unless we're prepared to allow enrichment under proper safeguards."

        "The IAEA, the CIA and others suspect Iran's scientists there have conducted a series of experiments to develop various non-nuclear technologies needed to create an atomic bomb.",
        "Recent satellite photography shows big changes in the landscape there -buildings torn down, roads pulled up - that suggest to some that Iran has something to hide.",

        "And I think something that's important to point out is that the U.S.",
        "military option is really only good for preventing Iran from producing the fuel, because right now, we can bomb Iran's nuclear facilities to prevent them from enriching uranium.",
        "But once they have the sufficient enriched uranium, the game's over, because at that point, our only military option would be invading the country, overthrowing the government, searching the entire country for enriched uranium, which obviously isn't a good option, isn't an option that any president would consider anytime soon.",
        "How long until Iran has enough highly enriched uranium for one, or a small arsenal?",
        "And right now, the best estimates are, depending on Iran's behavior, we have somewhere between two and 14 months.",
        "Two and 14 months.",

        "Yeah.",
        "It is a big window, and it does depend on Iran's behavior, to some degree.",
        "So the best estimates are that right now, if Iran made the decision to enrich from 20 percent to 90 percent, that it take them two months or so to produce one bomb's worth of material.",
        "But the problem is that even if they don't make that decision, they're putting more centrifuges online.",
        "Their stockpiles of low-enriched uranium are increasing.",
        "They're putting more advanced centrifuges online.",
        "So all of these things are shrinking their dash-time to a weapon.",
        "And at some point, their ability to dash to the first weapon will be shorter than our timeline to respond, which also creates a decision point.",
        "And I think that's the 14-month window that people are looking at.",
        "David Sanger, to get back to red lines, does anybody consider that one nuclear weapon, even a handful of nuclear weapons is a significant change?",
        "Well, it's a significant psychological change, because at that moment, the president's ultimate red line - which is that he wouldn't allow Iran to become a nuclear weapon state, has been passed.",
        "But as a practical matter, one nuclear weapon doesn't do you a lot of good.",
        "Think about the North Koreans, in this particular case.",
        "They only began to test once they amassed enough fuel to make six or seven, because if you only have enough fuel for one, and you set it off in the test, you're obviously - have left yourself pretty vulnerable.",
        "So the Iranians, even if they intend to go make a weapon - and, of course, they deny that that is at all their goal - they would not simply go off and do a single one.",
        "And I think that's why the point that is being made that you would - they would want to have a short dash time to a small arsenal of weapons is the right one.",
        "Now, I was at the IAEA just about a week ago, and I sat down with them and went through the report that they turned out in November of 2011 that looked at what they called possible military dimensions of the program.",
        "And that is to say all the questions that they've raised to the Iranians about work that would only be explained by working on weapons - you know, working on nuclear triggers or other elements that you wouldn't use in a civilian power program, but you would use in a weapons program.",
        "They turned that list public in 2011, at the end of 2011, in the hopes that that would sort of embarrass the Iranians into answering their questions.",
        "That didn't work.",
        "And I think their big fear right now is that they're simply not going to get the answers to those questions, and so there are two big mysteries here.",
        "How long will it take Iran to produce enough fuel to build a handful of weapons?",
        "The second one is: Do they have the technology now to produce a weapon that you could fit on a missile?",
        "And the answer to that seems to be probably not.",
        "It's unclear whether it would take them a year or two years or three years to get that.",
        "And let's go back to Matthew Kroenig, and the implications of an attack on Iran are so difficult.",
        "There would be repercussions from Lebanon to the Persian Gulf that people say, look, we have to give diplomacy and sanctions every chance to succeed before we even consider this.",
        "Yeah, well, I think it would be helpful to take a step back and look at all the possible options.",
        "So there are really only three possible outcomes to this crisis.",
        "First, we could get a diplomatic settlement.",
        "Second, we could simply acquiesce to a nuclear-armed Iran, or third, the United States or Israel could take military action."

        "And now, clearly, if we could solve this diplomatically, come to some kind of mutually satisfactory diplomatic settlement, that would be best.",
        "I just think that that is unlikely, and the window for diplomacy is closing, as the president has said many times.",
        "So when the window finally closes, that means that the United States is going to have this difficult choice between living with the dangers of a nuclear-armed Iran for decades to come, or taking military action.",
        "And the president has said many times that he's made his decision, that he will use force if necessary to stop Iran from building nuclear weapons.",
        "And I think that that's the right decision.",
        "So the military option is not a good one.",
        "There are many risks and dangers, as you point out.",

        "Do you see the options the same way and the logic the same way?",
        "Well, they are, if you reduce them to the starkest outlines.",
        "But the real world never behaves that way.",
        "And I think this whole discussion, starting from your introduction with David Sanger, suggests a really important point, which are that red lines are a really lousy way to doing foreign policy, that the real world doesn't work like that.",
        "I think what we can - the most important outcome would be that might be mutually acceptable at this point might well be that Iran has sort of an existential nuclear capability, but not an actual one or declared one.",
        "And that, while it is by no means a good outcome for us - it's a horrible outcome - is, in my view, much less horrible than the consequences of going to war.",
        "So when you say that, in other words, a situation where Iran has the - all the components to construct a deliverable nuclear weapons, or a number of them, but has not tested or done so.",
        "That's right.",
        "A lot of people call this the Japan option: Everything's there.",
        "It's sort of a screwdriver turn away.",
        "But - and there...",
        "And at that point, presumably, these sanctions - which are still going to be in effect - are still crippling Iran's economy.",
        "That's right, but - and again, they're only useful if you can use them to get some kind of a deal at the negotiating table.",
        "When - and the current Iranian government may not be capable of doing that.",
        "I entirely recognize it.",
        "But this is the first time that we have been able to engage the world, and it's an important achievement of this administration, in raising the cost in a really painful way to the Iranians, of pursuing this capability."

        "David Sanger?",
        "Yeah, I wanted to just leap on Jessica's very good point about the Japan option.",
        "And I was the Times bureau chief in Japan for six years, and, you know, this would be perpetually debated back and forth.",
        "And in the end, the reason the world lives with the Japan option - and Japan's not the only country that has basically everything that they would need to go do it and the engineering talent, clearly, to build a weapon - is that the world's fairly confident in not only the political intent of the country, but that it's enough of an option society that you'd have a real sense if they were deciding to make the decision to go for a bomb.",
        "I think the concern one hears about Iran is that we don't understand very much about how decisions are made.",
        "It's not a very transparent system.",
        "And so if a future leader in Iran decided to go produce a weapon, it's not clear whether or not the United States would know about it.",
        "And, of course, that's sort of what happened in the North Korean case.",
        "Or they could slip into a case kind of like Pakistan, which was a case where we saw the capability for years, and then one day got taken by surprise when they actually did do a test.",
        "And I think that's the reason that the Japan option worries so many people when it comes to Iran.",
        "And Matthew Kroenig, it worries, in particular, Israel, for whom this is not an abstract question, but an existential one in the sense of its very life is at threat, at least it believes so.",
        "Yes, so I think Jessica's right, that if we could get Iran to stay with the Japan model forever, indefinitely, that that would be an acceptable option.",
        "I just think there's really no reason to believe that Iran would stay at that level of capability.",
        "We know that Iran's strategic goals are to, first, be able to deter its adversaries, or Israel and the United States from attacking.",
        "And second, to be the most dominant state in the Middle East.",
        "This is something that they're very explicit about.",
        "Getting nuclear weapons gives them both of those things.",
        "Having the Japan model, having a bunch of nuclear facilities does not allow them to deter foreign attack.",
        "It doesn't allow them to become the most dominant state in the Middle East.",
        "So I don't think that that's a sustainable solution to this problem.",
        "But if the other - at the same point, it doesn't prompt American and Israeli attack.",
        "It doesn't prompt Saudi Arabia and others perhaps to start nuclear weapons programs of their own, which could eventually threaten Iran.",
        "That's right in the short term, but the concern would be that Iran wouldn't stay at that capability for the foreseeable future, that at some point they would have strong incentives to weaponize, and then we would be forced back into this terrible choice of acquiescing or taking action.",
        "With a much shorter timeline?"
