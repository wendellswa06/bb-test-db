        "With a shorter timeline, presumably.",
        "I mean, the Iranians are doing some things to suggest that they might be willing to slow that timeline.",
        "They've threatened that they're going to deploy these more advanced centrifuges, but they haven't done that yet.",
        "They're not enriching above 20 percent yet.",
        "They're converting some of their 20 percent to fuel plates.",
        "So it all depends on Iranian behavior and how fast they push the nuclear program.",
        "And, Jessica Mathews, that brings us back to the diplomatic options, and you're suggesting that perhaps the United States - let me be clear, are you saying the United States should make these positions public?",
        "We're willing to do this for that?",
        "No.",
        "I mean, almost never is it because again you're forced back into that's the sort of diplomatic equivalent of red lines.",
        "You've got - you negotiate in private, but you have to be prepared politically to recognize when you've succeeded and to take steps to accommodate and to understand what the other side's bottom line is.",
        "And a big part of - let me be clear.",
        "We are not the major problem here.",
        "Iran is the major problem.",
        "But there is a big problem in U.S.",
        "policy, which is we have not become clear yet for ourselves or to them that we would accept enrichment under some appropriate conditions, very stringent conditions.",
        "But we're going to have to do that if we have any hope both of sustaining a global sanctions regime and of getting some kind of Iranian agreement if they are prepared to deal.",
        "We're looking ahead to what may be a looming crisis with Iran.",
        "Our guests, Jessica Mathews - you just heard - is the president of the Carnegie - wrong piece of paper - president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
        "She's with us here in Washington.",
        "Also Matthew Kroenig, professor of government at Georgetown University, former adviser on Iran policy in the Office of Secretary of Defense, and David Sanger, the chief Washington correspondent of The New York Times, is with us.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And, David, let me ask you.",
        "In this context, is an Iranian ability to enrich acceptable to, well, some of the people - to the United States, to Israel, to the president's Republican critics?",
        "If you ask them in public, their answer would be no because the United Nations' resolutions all call for a full halt of enrichment.",
        "But when you ask them with microphones off, you get an answer much closer to what you just heard from Jessica, which is, of course, the world could live with a limited enrichment capability if Iran agreed that the amount that it would enrich each year was limited to X amount, and then it would ship out additional material that wasn't being used in civilian reactors or use it in some way - keep it in some form that it could not rapidly be turned into bomb fuel.",
        "In other words, that the United States and its allies would have plenty of warning if it was being turned into bomb fuel, and that means very rigid inspections.",
        "But there are two issues, I think, our conversation has brought up.",
        "One of them is suggested by Jessica's very good explanation of the difficulties of doing the diplomacy here, which is the United States so far has done this in bits and slices, and it has never stepped back and said, here's what a grand bargain would look like of a total relationship between the United States and Iran.",
        "And, of course, the two countries have a lot of interests in common.",
        "One of the reasons they haven't done that is that there's no confidence that the Iranian system could handle it.",
        "In other words, that the supreme leader who's presumably making all of the decisions here, Ayatollah Khamenei, would be prepared given his own mindset about his country's revolutionary agenda to take a total deal with the United States.",
        "But the second problem that's suggested by this is it's a lot easier to get Congress to approve putting new sanctions on.",
        "That's an easy vote for everybody.",
        "But getting Congress to then agree to back off on sanctions as the Iranians backed off, that would be more difficult.",
        "And, Matt Kroenig, as you look ahead to that possibility, it is extremely difficult, yet the other option, that military strike, and a lot of people say, look, it may not work, and at best, it will not destroy.",
        "It will delay Iran's nuclear program."

        "Well, that's absolutely correct that there's no guarantee that a strike would prevent Iran from developing - from ever developing nuclear weapons.",
        "But if we simply stand by while Iran builds nuclear weapons, we'll be guaranteed that they have nuclear weapons.",
        "So what a strike does is it creates space for a lot of things to happen where Iran ends up permanently without nuclear weapons.",
        "So there is a significant strategic benefit, and there are also costs and risks, as you pointed out.",
        "But there's also a lot that the United States can do to manage and mitigate those risks.",
        "So it's not a good option.",
        "I would not say it's a good option.",
        "But again, when you compare that to the risks of living with a nuclear-armed Iran, including possible nuclear war against Israel and possible nuclear war against the United States, the Department of Defense estimates that Iran could have ballistic missiles capable of reaching the East Coast of the United States by 2015.",
        "So these are real serious dangers, and I think the military option while not a good option is something that we should do to prevent from Iran developing nuclear weapons.",

        "no longer recognizes President Nicolas Maduro, but he has survived a failed military uprising and many other challenges now as officials have arrested a would-be vice president of the government bidding to replace him.",

        "point of view.",
        "Until last year, he was under secretary of state for political affairs.",
        "Our first question, what are the vulnerabilities of Maduro's government?",
        "Well, first, they obviously don't enjoy broad support among the population.",
        "They do have a core group of support, but if forced to stand in election, they would lose.",
        "Which is why they have avoided that, or attempted to manipulate or manufacture the results of elections.",
        "Secondly, they are dependent, for their long-term viability, on their relationship with the Venezuelan armed forces, which is what the Trump administration and others have focused on at this point.",
        "When you talk about the dependence on the armed forces, I'm reminded of that old saying, that one definition of the government is they have a monopoly on the use of force.",
        "Correct.",
        "When all else fails, they have that.",
        "Correct.",
        "So that is a vulnerability, if the United States and others can cause the military to be pried away from the government somehow."

        "Up to this point, the tools have not been sufficient.",
        "Really, beginning on January 23, when Juan Guaido declared the presidency vacant and declared himself the president under the constitution, the hope at the time was that that would be sufficient to flip the military.",
        "It did not work.",
        "Then the opposition, working with United States and other countries, decided that focusing on humanitarian assistance and creating a confrontation at the border between Colombia and Venezuela over the delivery of humanitarian assistance would create a rebellion within the armed forces.",
        "That did not work.",
        "Then the administration decided that sanctioning the state-run oil company, PDVSA, and effectively sending a clear signal to the armed forces that revenues would be cut off and their access to the Venezuelan gravy train would end would convince the military to flip.",
        "That did not work.",
        "There's also been an effort to focus on individual members or former members of the military.",
        "Some of them have been sanctioned.",

        "The purpose, obviously, is to send a signal that those members of the armed forces that choose to work with the opposition, if they are under sanctions, will have those sanctions lifted.",

        "It's not so much working the streets of Caracas as it is watching institutions like the armed forces and ensuring that the Maduro government has a very clear understanding of where dissent lies within the armed forces and what, if any, major groups are preparing any kind of political action against the government.",
        "The Russians have provided significant sales of weapons to the Venezuelan government, along with purchasing large quantities of oil and gas and inserting themselves into Venezuela's oil and gas industry.",

        "He spoke of game-changing weapons, and this is the Syrian strategic reaction, more important than a rocket strike in what he describes as occupied Palestine.",
        "So the escalation continues.",
        "The escalation continues, and as I'm sure you also read, either in the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times, Russia is talking about giving the Assad regime a more advanced, more sophisticated air defense system, which perhaps would have been able to prevent the Israeli airstrikes and more to the point from an American vantage point, might give the president some pause if indeed he is thinking of allowing American airstrikes at some point down the road.",
        "Interesting, that news came out just as secretary of State John Kerry was in Moscow arranging a conference a month from now to discuss cooperation on Syria.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And you know, the thing we always have to remember, Neal, and forgive me if I delve back into history a little bit, but some 60-or-so odd years ago the then Prime Minister of Israel David Ben-Gurion, who had had a very good relationship with the French president, Charles de Gaulle - and Israel had enjoyed a very good relationship with France and had enjoyed French support shortly after the declaration of independence - at some point a few years down the road, France began edging away from Israel and becoming more and more friendly with Arab states, because it needed oil, because it needed natural gas.",
        "And Ben-Gurion wrote an anguished letter to de Gaulle, the essence of which was, I thought we were friends.",
        "And de Gaulle sent back a rather terse note to the effect that people have friends, nations have interests.",
        "And the big question right now is where do Russia's interests lie.",

        "I don't see where it's particularly in their interest to do so.",
        "It is in their interest to act as though they would support that, but I can't see them making any serious contribution toward an end of the hostilities there.",
        "And as we look at the prospects, though, of their ally in Damascus, he may not be toppled anytime soon, but he is unlikely to be able to resume full authority over the country in anything like the way he had before.",
        "He may be reduced eventually to a rump state of his Alawite minority on the coast of Syria, which would include the Russian naval base there at Tartus.",
        "Aren't the Russians worried about backing a losing horse?",
        "Well, they may be, and I think your assessment is exactly right.",
        "I don't see how Assad can ever hope to re-establish control over Syria.",
        "But you know, again, delving even further back into history, we look upon Syria today as being a singular state when in point of fact it was a state that was only created shortly after the First World War; it became a French protectorate, and the state that we know as Syria today is actually a relatively recent invention.",
        "It is made up of all kinds, as we know, made up of all kinds of parties who really do not get along very well together.",
        "And American history, over the last few years in particular, ranging back to the time when we saw the overthrow of the shah in Iran, it's one thing for the United States to favor human rights, as it should; it's one thing for the United States to favor democracy, as it must; but we should have learned in Iran, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Egypt, and now in Syria, that the overthrow of a dictator does not necessarily mean his replacement by a democratic state."
