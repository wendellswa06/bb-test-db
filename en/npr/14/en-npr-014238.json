        "On Monday we spoke with Rami Khouri of the Daily Star in Beirut, who told us this conflict in Syria involves the Sunni-Shia divide, the battle between conservative monarchies and secular Arab states, between a long-oppressed majority rising up against the ruling Alawite minority, and the - of course the old Cold War divide between Russia and the United States.",
        "He described it as the largest proxy war of this century.",
        "And there an awful lot of interests involved here.",
        "There are indeed.",
        "I can tell you I was in Israel just a few weeks after the uprising began, so what are we talking about now, I guess about a little over two years ago.",
        "That's about right, yeah.",
        "And I spoke to some very senior Israeli officials at that time who to my enormous surprise were not all that thrilled at the prospect of the overthrow of Assad.",
        "And the point that was made to me repeatedly was, you know something, ever since the Golan Heights agreement was reached, the sort of stand-down, the truce between Syria and Israel that was negotiated by Henry Kissinger back in 1974, I think it was - we, the Israelis, have had a very quiet and stable relationship with Syria.",
        "He's - hello.",

        "And also joining us is NPR Music's Lyndsey McKenna.",
        "We're not all that sure that the people who are going to replace Assad, if in fact they do, will have the same kind of relationship with Israel, and the fact of the matter is the people who are supporting Assad right now are the Shia.",
        "The people who are opposing him are the Sunni states, as you correctly pointed out a moment ago.",
        "But, you know, the grave danger is that you're going to have among those people who are fomenting the uprising and who are leading the opposition now, are many al-Qaida members, are many people whose opposition to Israel is perhaps not as pragmatic as Assad's has been.",
        "Another history lesson.",
        "One of the fundamental flaws of American thinking about Vietnam was lack of consideration about just how much the North Vietnamese were willing to sacrifice for victory.",
        "And the United States thought in a war of attrition if you killed X hundred thousand people, that would be enough.",
        "It turned out the United States did kill all those people, and it was not enough.",
        "The North Koreans were willing to pay that price."

        "I think you've summarized it extremely well, Neal, and in doing so I think you've made the case that President Obama is sort of implicitly making.",
        "He made a misstep when he talked about that red line and suggesting that the United States would become more directly involved militarily if in fact it could be shown that the Syrian government has used chemical or chemical weapons or poison gas.",
        "The fact of the matter is, as the president considers what the outcome will be, no matter who wins in Syria, even if those whom we regard as being most favorably inclined toward the United States were to win, it's not altogether clear that they would be able to sustain control of Syria.",

        "There is then the prospect, and in just a few seconds there's no answer to this, of standing by and watching another 70,000, another 80,000 people killed with nerve gas?",

        "interests are not directly involved in Congo, or at least don't appear to be, we've done nothing about it, absolutely nothing.",
