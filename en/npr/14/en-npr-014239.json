        "They, you know, presumably, they could use chemical weapons.",
        "I'm not technically skilled enough to know how difficult it is to put chemical weapons in the nosecone of one of these missiles.",
        "But, you know, the fact of the matter is even though the Israelis have this much vaunted iron dome process - and what's the other anti-missile program?",
