        "I don't think a whole heck of a lot to be honest with you.",
        "And we've had a couple of isolated incidences of that in the past and have terminated our relationship with folks.",
        "We've talked to heads of companies who are really concerned about turning over this information.",
        "And they've said it's just not worth doing business there; seems like you're OK with this trade-off.",
        "Well, we're OK with it.",
        "And, quite frankly, we've taken a very serious look at Vietnam because the labor rates are actually cheaper in Vietnam, but we're unable to find a scenario that worked for us to move any of the manufacturing from China.",
        "For us, the problem is the labor rates in China are roughly equal to what the health care costs are in America.",
        "Are there any products that you've taken care to produce in the United States instead of China because of the trade-off you have to make when it comes to the intellectual property?",
        "Sure.",
        "So we do manufacture in the U.S., but I would say, you know, it's roughly 15 to 25 percent depending on the year versus China.",
        "But it's really hard to be competitive with the pricing when your competitors are also buying from China and also buying from India.",
        "So when I hear you talk about this, it seems like intellectual property concerns don't seem to be at the top of your list in terms of concerns or things that you're worrying about when you look at your business and when you look at your manufacturing in China.",
        "Trump is absolutely right.",
        "In general, they're taking our IP.",
        "They don't respect our IP.",
        "And I think something should be done.",
        "And it's something the prior administrations didn't stand up for at all.",
        "Where I disagree is I think the tactics are wrong, and I think that leading us into a trade war is disruptive to supply chains and, you know, potentially not good for the Republicans in the midterm elections.",
        "What I think the administration should do is back channel communications, negotiations, have a summit and use the international organizations such as the WTO.",
        "That's the World Trade Organization, yeah.",
        "Yeah, WTO, yes - to try to effect change without throwing a wet blanket on the overall economy.",
        "That's Dan Eberhart.",
        "He's the CEO of Canary, LLC, an oil field services company based in Denver.",
