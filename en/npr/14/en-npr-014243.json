        "Robert, before we turn to the Republicans, do you think that this is make or break for John Edwards?",
        "I do believe it's make or break for John Edwards.",
        "He has pretty much has put all of his stock into Iowa.",
        "He has pretty much said that if he is able to put off a commanding lead, if you will, in Iowa, that will springboard him from a financial standpoint, but also from a political standpoint into New Hampshire and South Carolina.",
        "Look.",
        "I mean, Iowans know John Edwards.",
        "He has been around the block twice now.",
        "He was there in 2004 for obvious reasons.",

        "He has visited every single country.",
        "There are 99 counties in Iowa.",

        "You know, Farai, this is - I agree with Donna.",
        "This is an absolutely phenomenal campaign.",
        "You know, 2008 is already turning out to be almost like 1948, where it is just a rollercoaster ride.",
        "And it reminds me of that super duper rollercoaster ride at Six Flags, where you laugh nervously all the way up and you scream like a heck all the way down because you just have no idea where you're going to land.",
        "You're right.",
        "I mean, this is a race, frankly, between Governor Romney and Governor Huckabee.",
        "Mayor Giuliani, for the most part, has not campaigned in Iowa.",
        "He's pretty much weighing to Tsunami Tuesday on February 5th, particularly, in Florida.",
        "Huckabee recognizes that this is, frankly, his moment in the limelight, if you will.",
        "Remember, five months ago, Farai, no one knew who Mike Huckabee was.",
        "He was at the bottom of the polls, down there with Kucinich and Mike Gravel and some other folks.",
        "But now, he has surged, and he is trying to capitalize on that surge by saying, look, I'm an outsider.",
        "I'm a former governor of Arkansas.",
        "I'm just like you.",
        "Romney, for the most part, is trying to say, look, I'm experienced.",
        "I've been on the national scene before.",
        "My father has been here many, many times before as former governor of Massachusetts - excuse me - of Michigan as well as, obviously, someone who runs for president back in 1968.",
        "It is really neck and neck.",
        "There is only going to be about 100,000 people, registered Republicans in the Iowa caucus that are going to decide who the next winner will be on the Republican side.",

        "Good morning.",

        "Naval Academy thesis adviser.",
        "That's amazing.",
        "Why did you do that, and how did you go that deep?",
        "I don't know.",
        "I just - I have a curiosity about this whole situation, and I really wanted to get to the bottom of it.",
        "So I - you know, the easiest way to say it is no stone left unturned.",
        "You say, you know, you want to contribute to the investigation, but how are you different than a journalist?",
        "I don't know if I'm that much different than a journalist.",

        "What has gone on and what is going on with Trump and his orbit of people he's dealt with over the years and ties to Russia and Ukraine and all these different matters?",
        "Often when people are doing this kind of thing, they have fact checkers, and they have editors that go over their information, especially if you're a journalist.",
        "Do you have anyone that edits you or anyone that you work with that helps you verify the information?",
        "There's some fact checking.",

        "What kind of effect do you think it will have given that television is such a huge industry in America?",

        "We, the viewers, look at television and we think, oh, great, our favorite show is coming up.",
        "But networks, obviously, are getting their revenues from the shows that they put on the air.",

        "And the advertisers then snap up the inventory that they have to sell to put commercials on the air.",
        "If you - advertisers - you see, networks make promises during this period to the advertisers - how many episodes of the show is going to run, how many times you - your commercials will run during each show.",
        "Now if the writers go on strike, and there are promises that have been made to these advertisers, that potentially is a big economic problem for the networks, and thus for the advertisers and thus for everybody who works on either side of the coin.",
        "So it sounds like what you're saying is that there's a certain level of negotiation that has already gone on around the advertising side.",
        "And advertising has to be a huge industry in American society, as it relates to television and otherwise.",
        "Absolutely.",

        "And during the upfront, that's when these promises get made and the big advertising deals get signed.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "Well, I disagree with Donna in a sense where this is a make-a-break for Huckabee in a sense where I think if he comes in the straw in number two position in Iowa, he still is able to maintain, if you will, some of the Huckaboom is what they're calling it.",
        "I think it's a little bit different, frankly, when it comes to Romney because, keep in mind, if he loses Iowa and if he loses New Hampshire - and because McCain is surging in New Hampshire - and remember, the New Hampshire media market is in the backyard of Boston - that is really hard for Romney to maintain, if you will, some of the credibility that he is the most authoritative, the most experienced person in this race besides Mayor Giuliani.",
        "So I disagree with Donna.",
        "I do believe that if Mike Huckabee comes in second or maybe even the third in Iowa, he still is able to springboard over to New Hampshire and obviously on the South Carolina and Nevada."

        "Here's why: it's because, obviously, there's a lot of independents out there that sway the elections one way or the other.",
        "And if, in fact, Mayor Bloomberg is in the race, the Giuliani campaign says, well, wait a minute here.",
        "That is our worst nightmare simply because independents typically go with an independent.",

        "He's a 300-pound gorilla right now, where he is the man on the scene.",
        "He is the one leading in the national polls.",
