        "How do you think that that's going to play out, Donna?",
        "Is it going to help Republicans either in the presidential race or in future Congressional races?",

        "It's not a victory for the Democrats.",
        "It's an - it's a defeat for the nine million uninsured children in this country that relies on the federal government for help in meeting their health care needs.",
        "I would hope that the president and the Democrats can find time this legislative season to work out a compromise.",
        "They're not for our part.",
        "The Democrats want to expand the program to cover more children.",
        "The president is opposed to the tax increases in the bill, which I can understand given his pledge.",
        "But this is an opportunity to help nine million uninsured American children.",
        "This is a bill that has strong bipartisan support.",
        "And I hope that they authorize and then extend it for another five years and not just three months.",
        "Robert?",
        "It's a floating number out there.",
        "I mean, the president is saying that six million people will be insured by this extension to March of 2009.",
        "The Democrats are saying that they want to extend this.",
        "You know, they won't stop fighting for this until 10 million people are insured.",
        "To answer your question specifically, Farai, I don't know.",
        "I don't think anyone really knows as whether or not this is going to play in the presidential cycle, if you will.",
        "I do believe that Senator Clinton and probably Senator Edwards both have campaigned on very populous campaign platforms, if you will, will probably use this to their advantage especially John Edwards."

        "Look, the bottom line is that there are people out there that are uninsured, people that are living paycheck to paycheck, and a lot of these people are kids.",

        "Absolutely.",

        "For example, one of the problems that women face at times are urinary tract infections.",
        "Well, that's something that we can fix in terms of not fancy, but just decent places for women - and men to urinate.",
        "You also looked into pregnancy because critics pointed to the fact that a woman could get pregnant as, again, some kind of justification for why women shouldn't necessarily be integrated into all the combat arms.",

        "Yes.",

        "You looked into women's physical capabilities.",
        "And the standards are supposed to be the same, so if a woman can meet the test then she can get the job.",

        "Yes.",
        "So let me give you an example.",
        "When we looked at basic training back in the beginning years of the war in Iraq, we were all of a sudden putting everybody into heavy armor right away, and we found that women were more likely to develop pelvic stress fractures.",
        "But what we found is that if you build women up gradually so that their bones have a chance to adapt, which may take a little longer than for men, then their rate of injury goes way down.",
        "Again, it's not rocket science.",
        "It's sort of common sense.",
        "We've just spent several minutes talking about how it takes women longer to heal from certain injuries than men, that infrastructure needs to change in order to address women's health needs.",
        "So that's a lot of research that points to the difficulty of integrating women into combat.",
        "A lot of people who have maintained that position might look at your research and say - exactly, that's why women shouldn't be in combat.",
        "Rachel, women are in combat.",
        "They have served with distinction, honorably, for a long time and most especially in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "But to do it, they really have to struggle at times, and they will because women in the military will hang tough.",
        "They won't tell people about the - if they have a urinary tract infection unless they absolutely have to.",
        "They'll figure things out on their own, but what I'm trying to lay out a path here for is let's make it more likely for women to succeed in both the occupations they've been in and they've been successful in and the really strenuous occupations that are open to them now.",
