        "We take this idea from a new book, where Carrie Jones and Megan Kelly Hall compiled a collection of stories from writers called \"\"Dear Bully.\"\" Later in the program, we'll remember the engineer who created the container, and as a by-product, globalized trade.",

        "This is a man who was known as the torture lobbyist.",
        "This is a man who lied to the federal government, lied to the FBI, lied to Congress and, you know, cheated on his taxes.",

        "Well, here's the thing.",
        "Part of the issue that we have here is that there is not a universally understood definition of whether this - to be anti-Semitic, just like we don't have a definition as to what racism is.",
        "So people can call someone anti-Semitic, they can call someone racist without really giving a coherent definition.",
        "What the congresswoman actually did - and perhaps inelegantly - is she has criticized the relationship between the United States and Israel.",
        "Some people think that that automatically makes you anti-Semitic.",
        "Some people see those things as being legitimate public discourse.",
        "I think, problematically, the Democratic Party needs to recognize that you have different perspectives on these issues that have to be respected, and you have to respect someone's freedom of speech."

        "What's your take on this?",
        "They couldn't vote for it, those 23 Republicans, because in the words of Congresswoman Liz Cheney, this was a sham House resolution vote.",
        "It did not address the issue that was front and center - these anti-Semitic comments.",

        "There are enough Republican votes to sink this emergency declaration, Gayle, and how much of a political hit to the president could that be?",
        "That would be a terrible mistake by Republicans because this situation is all about securing the border.",
        "And we saw that when the Supreme Court has ruled on this in the Visa Security Program, they understood that Congress had granted the president broad authority to make decisions like this under statutory authority when it concerns national security.",

        "This will be a rebuke to the president that he so desperately needs.",
        "He'll move to something else for the next couple of months.",
        "But the problem is this is eventually going to end up in the courts, and depending on how the Supreme Court sort of determines what the president can and cannot determine, we may end up with this idiotic wall anyway.",
        "But I'm glad to see that some Republicans have enough spine to stand up to the president at this particular point.",
        "And perhaps maybe down the road, this wall can be delayed until it'll never occur."
