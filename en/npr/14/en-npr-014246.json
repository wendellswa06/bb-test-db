        "And also, you know, this would really validate much of the reason for which he came back to Cleveland - one, to bring his home state a championship for the first time in over half a century.",
        "But also, just to bring inspiration to black youth like himself who - on this Father's Day - grew up without a father, who see him as someone who can provide them the inspiration to continue on with their lives and to be successful and - no matter what path they choose.",
        "And so I think that this win would do a lot more for people in Northeast Ohio and Cleveland.",
        "And kids would look up to Lebron James, really, than the fans who just want to see the Cavaliers win.",
        "And finally, what about Steph Curry?",
        "I mean, he's - no pun intended - kind of the golden child.",
        "Do you think there is quite as much at stake for him?",
        "You know what?",
        "I think that there is, in the sense that he has been anointed kind of as the new face of the NBA.",

        "He has not been the enjoyment to watch that he was during the regular season.",
        "So I think that this is going to speak to his early legacy and remind people that, you know, this is a really difficult game to play.",
        "You can't make it look like it's a computer game all the time.",
        "All right.",

        "I spoke with Guthrie and the film's director, Jenna Ricker, about the difficulties women faced in racing during the 1960s and '70s.",

        "No, it's great.",
        "Tony Hulman, who had rescued Indianapolis Motor Speedway from oblivion after the Second World War, said that he was going to go ahead and say, gentlemen, start your engines - because the mechanics started the engines.",

        "I'll start your engine.",

        "You know, I thought, oh, come on.",
        "Why don't you just say it?",
        "And then as the project grew and as the film was reaching completion, when it got to that part, I would always well up a little bit because I thought, yeah, damn straight in company with the first woman, you know.",
        "And so it was an interesting progression for me around that whole statement.",
        "And you kind of laugh today thinking, God, what was the problem?",
        "But it was, it was a big deal to have to change the call of the race, to have to admit a woman on the field.",
        "I mean, only a few years prior to Janet coming to Indianapolis, I mean, women weren't allowed in the pit area.",
        "And it was a sports writer along with a couple of other writers who sued the track to get access to do their job.",
        "So she definitely broke ground.",
        "You did an interview that we see in the film with Howard Cosell.",
        "He was one of the biggest names in sports journalism at the time, maybe the biggest name.",

        "But let's not beat around the bush anymore.",
        "And, Janet, your career came to an end shortly after that - officially - with your retirement.",
        "Well, by 1983, I decided that if I continued spending every living moment looking for a sponsorship to continue at the top levels, I was going to be jumping out of a high window.",
        "So I turned my attention to writing my book, and I moved to the mountains of Colorado to do that.",
        "And the book was published in 2005 to - if I do say so myself - considerable acclaim.",
        "Sports Illustrated called it an uplifting work that is one of the best books ever written about racing."

        "When you finally do that, it's a moment you'll never in your life forget.",
        "But the following year, when I formed a team myself at the very last moment and ended up with a Top 10 finish, that was a very good moment also.",
        "Jenna, I want to ask you the same question about Janet.",
        "What do you think her best moment has been in this life?",
        "From a storytelling perspective, as a storyteller, when she has to pull together her own team in 1978 at the last minute and with a month to go, all of these people get behind finding a way to help her succeed, from George Bignotti helping with the car, her crew members Jim Lindholm (ph) and Kenny Ozawa and the other guys that came up from NASCAR.",
        "When you see that there is these people that believe in what she believes and get behind it, it's really stunning.",
        "And it's a beautiful moment in her life that, to witness it in archive and to see her come across that finish line with a broken wrist, with everything she's put into it, she says in the film, you know, I felt on top of the world.",
        "And I feel like that's one of those moments where every time I feel on top of the world watching her do that.",
