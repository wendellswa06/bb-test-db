        "You're right.",
        "And for somebody from L.A., it's really tough to hear.",
        "But you know, what's right is right.",
        "Let me bring another question to you, Greg, about this before we go on to another topic.",
        "Because it's hard to talk to talk about Boston being the world champions.",
        "I understand.",
        "Going into this series, many sports writers, as we just said, had the Lakers winning in five or six.",
        "So much for that.",
        "But you know what?",
        "There was once a racial element to the rivalry between the Celtics and the Lakers, to be honest about it.",
        "But this series turned that racial dynamic on its head, didn't it?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's so funny.",
        "I have like people - I'm from New Orleans, and I have a lot of people who hate the Celtics from the '80s.",
        "There's one guy in particular, my neighbor, couldn't stand the Celtics.",
        "Now he finds himself supporting the Celtics.",
        "Just a - I guess that before a whole generation's different.",
        "Before, they thought of the Celtics as just being a white team, but now it's led by a black coach, predominantly black team.",
        "So I think, you know, a lot of people who had these biases of the Celtics for racial before, I've noticed a lot of people have changed.",
        "I didn't really care for the Celtics growing up neither, but I can't help but, you know, support a team that plays actually great defense.",
        "That's why the Lakers couldn't respond, they don't like getting hit in the mouth.",
        "The Celtics will hit you in the mouth and they went to those battles.",
        "And you've got to respect people like Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen and Paul Pierce, and they've gone through the battles this year.",
        "I think that type of play in a team gravitated those who were Celtics haters in the '80s, and now they are Celtics supporters.",
        "All right.",

        "This week, he was fired very unceremoniously in the wee hours of the morning while he was actually out here in California on a road trip to play the Angels.",
        "Now there's been a lot of fallout from that firing, suggesting that the Mets and general manager Omar Minaya handled the whole thing very poorly.",
        "In fact, that's what Randolph himself said, not how he would have handled it.",
        "What's going on there now?",
        "Well, as far as I can - let me just say this.",
        "There is no way to spin this thing positively.",
        "It was a horrible firing.",
        "I mean, 3:15, I'm thinking Minaya has been watching too many Hillary Clinton commercials or something like that.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But there's no good way to spin this.",
        "If you're going to fire him and you give him the whole Father's Day thing excuse, then do it before that, if it's not - and do it before the road trip.",
        "I mean, did he have to pay his own airfare back?"

        "And - but this is not the first time that a New York team has mishandled firing or fired somebody before then.",
        "You think about - looking at football, I mean, the Giants would have been smart to, a few years ago, to can Fassel, after that collapse in San Francisco.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Instead of giving him another four and twelve year.",
        "And as for the Jets, don't get me started on the missed field goals in Pittsburg, otherwise we would have been spared the four and twelve, Herm Edwards, we can only score three points, this is all we've got.",

        "At three o'clock in New York Time, 12 o'clock here.",
        "And we should say, that it was after their game against the Angels.",
        "So it wasn't like he was awakened in the middle of the night and said, you're fired.",
        "But the real question is, did he deserve to be fired, no matter what time of day it was?",
        "Well, I think their problem was that the entire team felt the pressure for Willie, they pressed too much to try keep his job.",
        "And that's a distraction.",
        "So did he deserve to lose his job?",
        "Maybe, but at the same time, it is a distraction, it's still a cloud that was hovering over the team's head, and I think they were pressing.",
        "So just rather just probably keep Willie there or just, you know, cut the relationship now and let the players not be stressed out about it and hopefully, you know, get out of their funk and not press any more, because they have a new - they have an interim manager, and they're not going to be pressured to, you know, just perform.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So I think that Willie did a good job.",
        "But at the same time, it still was a cloud over the heads for the players, and it was a big distraction.",
        "They really like Willie, but they tried too hard.",

        "All right.",

        "On one leg, winning the U.S.",

        "Fourteenth major, third U.S.",
        "Open history, but he's hurt.",

        "Did you see it, Chad?",
        "I saw bits and pieces.",
        "It was unbelievable, what I saw, unbelievable.",
        "Now, what do you think about him taking off and what the impact that will have on the rest of the tour?",
        "Well, it's his long-term health, so he pretty much has to take off.",
        "I don't know what - I think people will still watch, but it won't be the same.",
        "At the same time, no Tiger means that you've got an open field.",
        "You really don't know what's going to happen.",

        "In 2007, he was sitting in a limousine when shots were fired into the vehicle.",
        "His then Denver Broncos teammate Darrent Williams was killed.",
        "He died in his arms.",
        "So what's he doing hanging out at the clubs still?",
        "Well, I don't think you're ever going to get these guys away from the club.",
        "I mean, we've had - and I will stay on top here, I promise - we've had other instances in Vegas of NFL players getting in trouble.",
        "So you can only - as Lane Kiffin said, you can only educate them so much.",
        "You can't baby sit them.",
        "So people - guys are still going to go to Vegas.",
        "It's a shame what happened with Javon, who - the incident you mentioned, since the Darrent Williams, case, he really does not seem to be the same person."
