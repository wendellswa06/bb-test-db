        "So they are the type of people that they need and run out of when they've got, you know, the fire activity that they see this summer.",
        "Are the Australian, American and Canadian approaches to firefighting sufficiently similar that you can swap personnel like that?",
        "Well, they certainly are.",
        "And we've been swapping personnel particularly with United States since the year 2000.",
        "So we've done quite a few deployments from Australia to the U.S.",

        "Large fires, certainly fires on the edge of what was the traditional season.",
        "So the hot part of summer now we're seeing larger fires earlier and later.",
        "And I think that's replicated in North America.",
        "I think that's why we've been over there helping large fires that burned for many, many days and over a lot of area.",
        "So that's certainly a trend in the last 20 years or so.",
        "Yeah.",

        "So Guy, here's the question, why did the Iraqi government decide to send troops into Basra in the first place?",
        "In a sense, it was a conflict that's been brewing between the three largest Shiite political parties and their respective militias over the past year.",
        "Basically, the city of Basra has been and continues to be a place that has been run by these different Shiite militias, two of them loyal to the Iraqi government and one of them loyal to the Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr.",
        "It's called the Jaysh al-Mahdi, or the Mahdi Militia.",
        "So essentially, the Iraqi government has been under pressure by the U.S.",
