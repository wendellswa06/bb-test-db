        "Right.",
        "In fact, the defense secretary, Robert Gates, and the president both called it an example of the Iraqis taking the lead.",
        "You know, essentially, that it shows the Iraqi army can carry out these kinds of operations independently, and that the Maliki government is taking on some of these militia groups.",
        "But then, when it turned out they couldn't take on these militia groups or not take them on successfully, U.S.",
        "military officials said, hey, this is disastrous.",
        "Congratulations.",
        "Thanks a lot.",
        "So was this easy for you to figure out?",
        "How did it happen?",
        "Well, they've been saying that privately, of course.",
        "And, you know, really they couldn't have stopped it.",
        "I mean, what happened was, the Iraqi prime minister and his top commander in southern Iraq, a major general called Mohsen al-Faraji actually approached Petraeus and his staff a few weeks ago.",
        "They laid out the details of their plan, but U.S.",
        "military officials have told me that they weren't in a position to stop Maliki from doing this because they've essentially been hounding him to go down to Basra and take care of the problem.",
        "Well, the main issue they had with Maliki's plan was, they felt it was overly ambitious, and they weren't confident that the Iraqi government and its army could take on the better trained and the battle hardened Mahdi Militia.",
        "And in fact, one U.S.",
        "military official I spoke to said, even though there's a truce now, this is the beginning of a long struggle over control in southern Iraq between these competing militias.",
        "So what is it that the U.S.",
        "military analyst you spoke with said was the hopeful sign?",
        "Well, first it should be made clear, Alex, that the Iraqi army lost.",
        "It's not a stalemate.",
        "No matter how the government in Iraq spins it, the Iraqi army was routed by the Mahdi Militia.",
        "But at the same time, it was the largest Iraqi military operation since the Saddam Hussein era when they invaded Kuwait in 1991.",
        "I mean, the Iraqi army moved thousands, as many as 10,000 soldiers down to Basra.",
        "They moved weapons and vehicles hundreds of miles, and they launched a pretty sophisticated operation.",
        "And so even though they were defeated, the fact that they could actually do this, operationally, is an enormous improvement over where the Iraqi army was even six months ago.",
        "But Guy, isn't this analysis, well, the logistics worked, but when they got there they lost the battle?",
        "Isn't that really military lipstick on a military pig?",
        "Well, you could look at it that way.",
        "But at the same time, you could say, the Iraqi army got the logistics down.",
        "They obviously didn't get the planning and the strategy down.",
        "And so some military officials are saying, look, in a year, in two years' time, when they're better trained and they're better strategic fighters, they might be able to take on some of these militia groups more effectively."

        "You know, Madeleine, I'm going to have to say it's less a matter of earning trust or deserving their vote.",
        "It's more in the realm of romance or inspiration, if you will.",
        "He's giving them a glimpse of something new, something open-ended, open-ended.",
        "He uses the word hope, of course, and we've heard that from him a great deal, politics of hope, a little bit of an irony because that was a term that Bill Clinton used a lot in 1992 as a man from hope.",
        "But you know, Barack is also about something else.",
        "Freshness, a promise, almost mystery.",
        "It is not so much about substance as it is about something else.",
        "And according to these polls, he has pulled even with female voters - with women, pulled even with Senator Clinton on that.",

        "He actually narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton among Democratic women in Iowa.",

        "And while women are among her strongest supporters and always have been, they are always also among her strongest detractors, including many women who are a lot like her in a demographic sense, people with a lot of income, a lot of education, strong career women.",
        "They have frequently not been the people who were best for her."

        "And there's a lot of helicopter support here, and I don't know all the details of how that happened in Katrina, but here the government and different states across Mexico have been donating helicopters as well as they have a large reserve called the civil protection, and those volunteers have joined Red Cross volunteers, and there's about 6,000 Red Cross volunteers that were mobilized early on.",
        "It's probably a lot more than that because every day here in front of the Red Cross headquarters in Villa Hermosa, you'll see hundreds of people gathered who are just spontaneous volunteers there, the people that no longer have homes, and they figure, well, we might as well help out everybody else during the day when we have nothing else to do.",
