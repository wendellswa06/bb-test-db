        "As for Senator Lugar's assessment that they've overestimated what they can do, I think it's a little early to say that.",
        "In the last few days I've been at several places around Baghdad where the offensives are underway.",
        "I've been out in Ramadi, where as you know, Anbar province has been the most remarkable reduction in violence.",
        "And there's no doubt that this surge is having an effect, that al-Qaida for the time being at least appears to be on the back foot.",
        "Can that be sustained?",
        "Probably too early to tell.",
        "It's worth remembering that the surge troops, the last of them, went operational on June the 15th.",
        "That's only about, as you know, 10 days ago.",
        "These offensives are likely to continue for 60 to 90 days.",
        "So I think it's fair to say that the military has scored some spectacular gains in Anbar, which I hope they can export to Diyala, and to the areas south of Baghdad, where al-Qaida have major strongholds, and we'll see where it goes.",
        "Can you tell me a little bit about the operation in Baquba?",
        "American commanders said that the one big difference there from previous operations was that they hope to get top al-Qaida leaders to block off their escape routes - to get them before they escape.",
        "Apparently that didn't happen.",
        "Well, there are various interpretations of that.",
        "Of course, one of them, and you hear it from some American midlevel officers up there in Baquba, is that the commanders flagged this offensive there in advance by saying that they have a major problem in Diyala province and that there would be an offensive there.",
        "That's kind of inevitable.",
        "Everybody knew where the trouble spots were.",
        "Everybody knew that the surge troops - if I can call them that - were being brought in to deal with those trouble spots in particular.",
        "So to say that they flagged to al-Qaida in advance that they were coming is slightly unrealistic.",
        "It seems to me that we can't really have it both ways.",
        "The United States is an open society.",
        "We require of our military leaders that they be as transparent and open and candid as possible.",
        "They have been fairly candid about this, and that, of course, has told al-Qaida they're coming, and al-Qaida, at least at the leadership level, has fled.",
        "But the commanders were saying they know pretty well where they've gone and they'll pursue them.",
        "They have more troops to do that now than they had before.",
        "Well, given what you say about the conditions and about the open access to all this information, is it reasonable to ask if a surge of 30,000 additional troops can work in any case?",
        "I don't think that we have the answer to that yet.",
        "We know that there was never going to be more than an additional 28,000 or 30,000 troops available.",
        "By the end of 2006, when the surge was ordered, it was pretty clear that this war was going to be lost if there wasn't a change in direction.",
        "As of right now, we're only about, I would say, halfway or a third of the way into the period of offensives under the surge.",
        "And as I said, it's difficult to judge how far it's going to go.",
        "I think what you can safely say is that the political surge - best to say, the political surge by the Baghdad leadership of Nouri Kamel al-Maliki, the prime minister, then fellow Shia leaders and the Sunni leaders, that political surge has not happened.",
        "And since this is intended to create a political breathing space for the Baghdad political leaders to unite around some kind of national contact program for national reconciliation, it really doesn't matter how much success the America military they may have on the field if they don't have a partner in the political leadership in Baghdad.",
        "Okay.",

        "He acknowledged that the filibuster was a long shot, but believes the choice to send the new justice to the high court is just too important not to debate.",
