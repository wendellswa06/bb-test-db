        "And oftentimes, I think we just get so stuck in trying to create a similar pattern, so we can understand it.",
        "And that's why it was important for us to have those 70 stories.",
        "Because while there is a truth of pain and compassion in almost every single one of them, there's also those different truths of how people have coped, how it has affected them, what their strengths were, you know?",
