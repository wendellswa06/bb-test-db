        "I do see that.",
        "What may be happening to some degree, not just in California but elsewhere, is conservatives who've had some suspicions about Governor Romney, just like they did about Mayor Giuliani and Senator Thompson, are realizing that if they don't rally behind Romney, John McCain will likely be the Republican nominee by later this week.",
        "I don't know if this late realization is enough to stop McCain, but it seems to be tightening up the race a little bit to the point where both candidates are going to be spending at least a little bit of time here.",
        "And obviously the campaigns wouldn't fly their candidates all the way back out across the country if they didn't think that there was still some uncertainty about the result here.",
        "California just matters more now than it has.",
        "I saw one piece that said this is the most important California primary since 1964, which was Goldwater versus Rockefeller.",
        "Does that square with what you think?",
        "Well, you can make the argument that this is the most important California primary ever.",
        "Because after years of trying to make ourselves more relevant by moving up on the primary calendar, this is the first time we've ever been the scene of not just one but two contested party primaries and two seriously contested party primaries at that.",
        "Let's go over the mathematics of this for a moment, if I may.",
        "There are 53 congressional districts in the state.",
        "On the Democratic side the delegates are three to six per district, and they're divided up proportionally, so the candidates can split them up within in districts.",
        "But on the Republican side, within a district it's winner-take-all.",
        "And the effect of that is to make even the Democratic-leaning districts important to Republicans, right?",
        "Because you can really scarf up some Republican delegates there.",
        "That's right.",
        "In the past, Republicans in California actually awarded our delegates on a winner-take-all basis at a state level, which means if you won the entire state of California by one vote you ended up with a treasure trove of delegates to the national convention.",
        "Let me ask you, Lillian Roberts, to complete this sentence for me, if you would.",

        "There was Sergeant Ranahan, who donned Army fatigues and made armed patrols of the backyard for enemies.",
        "There was Wounded Songbird, a thoughtful Native American warrior.",
        "Panetti would dress up in cowboy outfits and swagger around Fredericksburg, Texas, where they lived.",
        "Kase says, Panetti's paranoia about the devil got so bad that his wife had him committed to a mental hospital in Waco.",
        "She committed him, and she told the doctors that now he had this delusion about the devil.",
        "And like many people with paranoid schizophrenia, he developed a very specific delusion, and this was all about religion.",
        "He was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and chronic schizophrenia.",
        "A Texas judge granted Panetti's wife a divorce, and she moved back to Wisconsin with the three children.",
        "After a couple years, Panetti began dating a new woman - a Fredericksburg waitress - got her pregnant and eventually married her.",
        "This would prove a disaster."

        "At the time of Panetti's trial, the legal standard was that if a defendant was ruled competent to stand trial then they were also competent to represent themselves in court, but the Panetti trial put that standard to the test.",

        "Panetti's lawyers appealed, arguing that the mentally ill man should never have been allowed to represent himself, but both the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and the Federal Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Panetti had knowingly waived his right to counsel.",
