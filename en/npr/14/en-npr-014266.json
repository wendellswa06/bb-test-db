        "Although I'm a Christian, I cannot worship a god of vengeance.",
        "Although God is said to have destroyed the Earth in the in the flood story, at the conclusion, God regrets this choice and promises to never again do such a thing.",
        "This is deity that affirms the Earth, not one that seeks to bring it to a hostile end.",
        "Finally, we asked you to tell us what you learned and who taught you about money.",

        "My father paid us and paid us well for the time we worked for him.",
        "In return, we were expected to buy our own clothes, pay for school activities and other extracurricular activities.",

        "One problem: it was all invested with Bernie Madoff.",
        "She has written about the fury, anxiety, and clarity that followed, first in a blog called The Bag Lady Papers and now in a new book by the same name.",

        "That's sort of the first thing - I mean, the patriarchs were polygamous, Jesus himself was celibate, Paul - the Apostle Paul - also celibate and said, well, get married if you have to, better to marry than to burn with passion, but best to stay unmarried completely.",
        "These recommendations are not really relevant to those of us who are trying to work out an egalitarian, romantic, pragmatic family life.",
        "And so, that was the first point.",
        "The second point was, although the Bible does condemn homosexuality in a few places, it's not that many places, and there are good arguments that say that what the Bible is condemning is actually very wicked, depraved, craven, licentious behavior, and not what we would call modern committed homosexual relationships at all.",
        "And then the third part of the argument is that both the Old Testament and the New Testament in different ways argue for family, for committed relationships, for social stability, for a kind of loving unit that reflects God's will.",
        "And there's really no reason why gay people shouldn't be able to partake in that as well.",
        "And the - a lot of people would say, the Bible begins defining marriage though with Adam and Eve."

        "And, you know, Abraham fathered children with both his wife and his wife's servant.",
        "Jacob, the father of the 12 tribes of Israel, was a polygamist married to two sisters and had children with their servants.",

        "And I do think that sound reason tells us that there's something different about union between a man and a woman.",
        "Just the mere fact that they're able to reproduce and that homosexuals are not is something that's kind of a glaring, natural phenomenon.",
        "So, that's my opinion on the subject.",
        "Aaron, a lot of people would point out that people over the age of 55, 60, 70 can get married, if they're a man and a woman, in many a state of the Union and they're not likely to have children either.",
        "I think that has more to do with deterioration of the body in death than it does design.",
        "And there's clearly a difference in design between the sexes, which is what makes the continuation of our species possible, you know.",
        "And to make an argument that there's not a difference between a male and female couple and a same gender couple, I think it's kind of silly, you know, because there is a difference.",
