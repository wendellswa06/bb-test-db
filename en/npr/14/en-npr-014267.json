        "Lisa Miller's cover essay in Newsweek magazine is titled \"\"The Religious Case for Gay Marriage.\"\" Albert Mohler writes, now, just wait a minute.",
        "In the Old Testament, he argues, the notion of marriage deeply rooted in its procreative purposes on unambiguously heterosexual.",

        "Neal, glad to join you.",
        "And what's your basic response to Lisa Miller?",
        "Well, it's a fascinating conversation that she started, and if Newsweek's intention was to start a conversation, they have certainly succeeded.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "You know, the first word I would think of here is audacious.",
        "And listening to Lisa Miller speak - and she's very articulate as she speaks about Newsweek's interest in all this - the word audacity comes to my mind because, let's face it, what the sum and substance of this cover story really attempts to do is to say that Christians have basically been wrong for the better part of 20 centuries in understanding the Scripture and that the vast majority of believers in this country are wrong in believing that same-sex marriage is prohibited by scriptural injunction.",
        "And that's no understatement.",
        "I mean, you're talking about an extremely thin slice of a very far-left denominational core that is even contemplating same-sex marriage.",
        "What is really interesting here is that Newsweek decided to write on the religious case or to try to propose a religious case for same-sex marriage.",
        "And I think it's fairly safe to say that among the vast majority of believers, it's falling flat and to no surprise.",
        "And Lisa Miller can make her own her arguments, but just to point out that for nineteen centuries or so, a greater part of them, a lot of Christians were wrong about slavery, too.",
        "A lot of Christians were not only wrong but horribly, inexcusably wrong about slavery, and especially about slavery that is race-based, the kind of chattel slavery that was known in the horror of slavery, \"\"the peculiar institution\"\" as it was called in the United States.",
        "You put slavery in a larger context, in a global historical context, and the vast majority of human beings, it can be argued, were slaves rather than slaveholders or masters.",
        "You can go back to Marx and Lenin arguing in \"\"The Communist Manifesto\"\" and \"\"Das Kapital\"\" that anyone that - who lacks the ability to produce capital is a slave.",
        "When the Scripture talks about slavery, we need to be honest about what it is and isn't talking about, the same way we would have to be very honest about polygamy.",
        "I'm not going to deny for a moment that the patriarchs were polygamists, but that could be a separate conversation.",
        "It is to say, though, that the irreducible core of marriage in the Bible, both testaments, is that it's heterosexual, and that it is tied to procreation and that's the simple issue there, as at least two of your Aaron callers have recognized.",
        "Indeed, and we'll get more callers in on the conversation.",
        "But the institution of marriage, as you've just suggested, has evolved over the years, over the centuries.",
        "It's very different today than it was in the time of the patriarchs.",
        "So, well, the institution can change.",

        "Well, the institution has certainly changed.",

        "The one irreducible issue is that it has always been - and by the way, even where the Scripture has never reached, even where the Judeo-Christian Scriptures have never had a direct influence, by natural law and by natural reasoning, the institution of marriage as a heterosexual institution privileged for procreation and the raising of children has been central to civilization.",

        "They change over time.",
        "Marriage has changed so much that the patriarchs and their multiple wives wouldn't recognize what my husband and I try to do every day as marriage.",
        "And what's so great about the Bible, what I find so inspiring and moving about the Bible, is that its truths speak to us over 2,000 years, that we can be flexible and we can say, OK, what it says about slavery, we're not going to accept that anymore.",
        "Interestingly, we've decided not also to accept what it says about divorce, which is much stronger in the New Testament than whatever it says about homosexuality.",
        "We've said, OK, well, we're not going to care about that either because half of Americans are divorced.",
        "And it's beautiful to look at the Bible as this living document that applies to us even as we change through history.",

        "Well, so the hard thing is there's so many rules.",
        "And it's the whole thing of what rule - how do I decide which ones to follow and which ones not to.",
        "So, the thing for Christian for me is that it offers a lot of comfort and a lot of - in the New Testament, it's the idea that it's a freedom from the law and so God is love and all of that.",
        "He's the most important and it's OK to not be perfect.",

        "The law is that which shows us our need for Christ.",
        "The New Testament shows us the provision whereby Christ came to pay the penalty for our sins.",
        "But the New Testament also presents Christianity as a way of discipleship, of following Christ.",
        "And in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus was certainly not suggesting that grace means there is no law.",

        "And in that, by the way, marriage is very clear.",
        "Jesus could not be more clear, actually.",
        "Whenever he confronts marriage, he speaks of it.",
        "In Matthew, he says from the very beginning, God intended it to be one man and one woman.",
        "And so, to follow Christ in discipleship means precisely to follow, you know, what Christ said - to act in obedience.",
        "Lisa Miller said when she was - and very helpfully, I appreciate what she said - when she was making her three points, she mentioned the authority of Scripture and she said you either believe, as Alan Segal, she cited, believes, that it's more or less a human book marked by history, and we correct it by our contemporary understanding.",
        "Or you believe as I believe and as evangelical Christians and what you'll find most conservative believers in the Judeo-Christian traditions, whether they're Orthodox Jews or conservative Protestants or traditionalist Catholics - what you're going to find is the belief that what we have to do is understand and interpret the Scripture, but with the goal of obeying it.",
        "Because we genuinely believe that it's not a prison into which we are forced by God, it's indeed his gift whereby he shows us how he would have us to live, not only for his glory but for our good.",
        "Lisa Miller - that point about Jesus, do you read that passage the same way?",
        "There are many, many parts of the New Testament where Jesus - I mean, they're so numerous, it's hard to even count them - reaches out to people who are on the margins, people who are outcast, people whose own social behavior defies convention.",
        "And he says come with me.",
        "That's his message.",

        "And it's a psalm that talks about God seeing your secret self, even when nobody else can see it.",

        "That the Bible contains truths that we apply to our lives - inspired truths that we apply with reason to our lives - and polygamy is not what we do now.",
        "Well, gay marriage isn't what we do now either.",
        "But loving relationships between two people for social stability, for the raising of children if possible, for loving each other the way God loves us - that is a sacrament in a lot of religions and there's no reason on Earth why gay and lesbian people shouldn't be able to partake of that sacrament.",

        "The only law Jesus gave us is to love God with all our hearts, minds and strength and love our neighbors as ourselves.",

        "He said on those two commandments, all the law hangs.",
        "He said that those two are a summary, a distillation.",
        "And indeed, they are so powerfully a distillation of the law that we learn from Jesus to read the law through those commandments, such that we begin, first of all, the priority of love of God and then love of neighbor.",
        "That means, by the way, that if we really love God, then we're going to follow his way for our lives.",
        "And if we really love our neighbor, we're going to want what is best for them.",

        "By the way, I want to belong to a church - I wanted this to be very clear - I want to belong to a church that includes heterosexuals and homosexuals and robbers and thieves and liars and gossips and all the rest, because in the New Testament we are told - Paul says this beautifully - he lists a whole list of sins and he says do you not know - homosexuality among them by the way - do you not know that those who practice such things are deserving of death?",
        "And then he says, but such were some of you - such were, basically, all of you.",

        "And it was so clear to me that there is such a difference between going to the courthouse and filling out the forms to get married at the courthouse versus what being married in the Church meant to me in the sense that I was making a commitment before my friends and family and before God that this is a union that was different than the marriage that I was conducting by the state.",
        "So, I guess my question is, I really don't see - I would not attend a church perhaps that would sanction gay marriage.",

        "And also, getting back to Lisa Miller's comment on the issue of divorce, I think that's done much more to destroy the institution of marriage - heterosexual divorce.",
