        "The country's Homeland Security chief, Michael Chertoff, says his department must focus first on catastrophes that could end thousands of lives rather than on preventing a bomb in a subway that may kill 30 people.",
        "Clark Kent Ervin might beg to differ.",
        "He's a former inspector general for the federal Department of Homeland Security.",
        "Ervin believes the United States must consider all the ways it's vulnerable to terror.",
        "I think that we are seeing a resurgence of terrorism, certainly in Western Europe and, indeed, worldwide, given the recent attacks in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt.",
        "I think this is a reminder to the whole world, it's a reminder to us, the American people, that we remain under threat of terrorist attack.",
        "While you were with the Department of Homeland Security, you were very up-front with what the department was doing right and what they were doing wrong.",
        "I'm curious, if you could--not the department so much as the country itself, people in general--what aren't we learning?",
        "Well, I do think actually that through congressional attention, through institutions like the Office of Inspector General, the Government Accountability Office, through the attention that the media gives to this issue, I do think that here and there, the American people understand that there are vulnerabilities in aviation still, there are vulnerabilities in terms of port security and certainly mass transit security we've come to further appreciate in the last few weeks.",
        "But I don't think that the average American understands in any kind of comprehensive way just how many vulnerabilities there are, how easy it is to exploit those vulnerabilities, and how determined the terrorists are to strike us again.",
        "And the tendency, I think, of the American people is to be very much focused on the moment.",
        "That generally has been a good thing, a good element in our culture.",
        "But I'm afraid that the downside of that is that we tend to think that if a certain period of time, which for us is a short period of time, has passed without any attack, that means that there's not going to be an attack in the future.",
        "The last time we were attacked was almost four years ago, September 2001.",
        "For an American, that's an eternity.",
        "We can't come to the conclusion that because there hasn't been an attack in four years and because there's now a department called the Department of Homeland Security, we're safe.",
        "The fact that we haven't been attacked in four years, I think, is likelier to mean that al-Qaeda just has a very, very long time line, and they're determined to make the next attack even more spectacular than the last one.",
        "We should note that you no longer hold your post as inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security.",
        "In fact, the administration did not renew your post there.",
        "Many suggest that it was because you were too vocal in findings that you suggested were not in the best interest of this country and the best interest of the Department of Homeland Security by virtue of trying to shore up our shores.",
        "You pointed out many holes in security.",
        "If, in fact, that is true, what does that say to the American public in terms of the attempt at being safe and the realization that in order to do so, you have to look at this with a microscope?",
        "Right.",
        "It's true that the administration did not renominate me when my appointment expired at the end of last year, December of '04.",
        "But actually, the real fault, frankly, lay with the Senate, with two senators in particular, the chairman and the ranking member of the Senate Governmental Affairs--now called Senate Homeland Security Governmental Affairs Committee.",
        "Neither Chairman Collins, nor Senator Lieberman would ever permit the committee to vote on my nomination.",
        "So to his great credit, the president at the end of '03, my first year in office, gave me a recess appointment, and when the White House resubmitted my nomination at the beginning of '04, again, Chairman Collins and Senator Lieberman refused to permit a vote out the second year as well.",
        "And that said...",
        "Why do you believe they did that?",
        "Do you believe it was because you were exposing flaws in the system?",
        "You know, when Renee speaks about the limited - the online registry and the way it sort of more narrowly tailored in New York.",
        "Unfortunately, you know, we researched this pretty extensively, and we looked at every state's online registry and read the laws to figure out who would qualify to be on the registry.",
        "Most state registries actually don't do that kind of narrow - they don't narrowly tailor who's placed online.",
        "They typically put anyone who's registered as offender online."

        "Donald Trump is a non-traditional president, and one of the traditions he's broken is the usual link between economic well-being and presidential job approval.",

        "Most of the positive trends did begin on his watch.",
        "Moreover, Garin says many Americans suspect Trump's policies primarily benefit corporations and the wealthy, a suspicion that was reinforced by the newly signed tax bill.",
        "For a president who ran on a populist platform, voters now see him more and more not looking out for the little guy but looking out for the people at the very top.",
        "Trump argues public attitudes towards the tax bill and perhaps his presidency will improve early next year when the vast majority of workers will start to see savings in their paychecks.",
        "But Garin insists public sentiment is likely to get worse if Republicans push for changes to popular entitlement programs as House Speaker Paul Ryan has suggested.",
        "I think what's likely to happen over the course of the next year is not just disappointment among voters that they got a little and the people at the very top got a lot, but the things they count on like Medicare and Medicaid are at risk because there is a need now to offset the cost of these huge tax cuts that have been given to corporations and the wealthy."
