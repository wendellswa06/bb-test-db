        "And in the process of that research, we started collecting stories of former sex offenders who are having a particularly hard time reentering the community.",
        "And so, we started to investigate.",
        "And what we found along the way was, you know, not just that, the laws that you mentioned, the registration community notification, residence restriction laws have a pretty severe impact on former sex offenders.",
        "The laws - there's very little evidence that they are actually preventing sexual violence and there is some evidence that they may be doing more harm than good.",
        "And we felt like that was a very important report for us to release.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "More harm than good, how?",
        "Well, these laws, as you mentioned before, are based on some myths that we have about convicted sex offenders.",
        "Myths that I had myself before I started doing the research, that previously convicted sex offenders pose sort of the greatest danger towards our children in terms of sexual violence.",
        "And that, you know, previously committed sex offenders have a really high recidivism rate.",
        "What I found while I was researching this report is that 87 percent of sex crimes every year are committed by individuals who have no previous sex crimes convictions.",
        "And three out of four sex offenders, convicted sex offenders, did not re-offend within sort of 15-year period upon release from prison.",
        "So, while there may be previously convicted sex offenders who pose some risk to the community - and we want them to be monitored, and maybe we want them to be subject to some form of these laws - there are, by focusing all of our attention only on previously convicted sex offenders, we're really ignoring sort of the larger picture of sexual violence in this country, which is that, again, most sex crimes every year are not committed by someone who has a sex crime conviction.",
        "And another important point or part of this is that most sex crimes, over 90 percent of sexual abuse against children is committed by someone that child knows or trusts, or love.",
        "And so, stranger danger isn't - it's part of the problem, but it's not as big a part of the problem as I think is widely believed.",
        "And so, again, when we focus all of our attention on previously convicted sex offenders, we're not able to really focus the public resources and have the public debate we need to be having about the real picture of sexual violence in this country, and what we can do to prevent it, and what we can do to make sure that there are no more victims."
