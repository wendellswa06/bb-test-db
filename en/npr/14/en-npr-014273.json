        "You also write that these registries of - it's very difficult to get off once you're on and, in some cases, you're on for life.",
        "Yeah, that's true.",
        "You know, when we started in 1994, the Jacob Wetterling Act was the first federal law that dealt with sex offender registration and that required sexually violent offenders to register for a period of 10 years.",
        "That's where we started.",
        "Where we are today is, you have - you're expanding the scope of the registry in the sense that you have a number of individuals on there who committed non-violent offenses like public urination or consensual teenage sex, and you also - increasingly states are moving and federal laws moving to require lifetime registration without the ability to petition to get off regardless of how long you've lived in a community offense-free or any evidence you might present of rehabilitation.",
        "(Soundbite of protests)",
        "You know, interestingly enough, I don't believe it had anything to do with that.",
        "If anything, I understand from their staffs that both Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman appreciated the work that I did as inspector general.",
        "Ostensibly, the reason was that I was not aggressive enough in investigating a single alleged instance of wrongdoing.",
        "When I was the inspector general at the State Department, I explained to the staff of the senators that I did not investigate that matter because I didn't have jurisdiction to do so.",
        "And I just kind of note the irony there.",
        "I was criticized by many for being too aggressive in investigating wrongdoing at the Department of Homeland Security, and these two senators ostensibly--and I think that's the key word--held me up at Homeland Security because they thought that I was not aggressive enough in a single instance at the State Department.",
        "What are some of the issues that you brought forth, even as early as 2002, when you talked about federal marshals being hired at the last minute, some of them falling asleep on the job, some testing positive for alcohol and drugs while on duty?",
        "In 2003, you talked about the ability to sneak explosives and weapons past security screeners in 15 airports and the like, and the list goes on, including misappropriation and squandering of moneys spent on, for instance, lavish parties for outfits like Boeing, contractors for the government.",
        "As you take a look at the situation, do you see it better today than you did two, three years ago?",
        "If not, what has to be done to correct some of these situations?",
        "Well, I'll start with the positive.",
        "I do think--and I've said this before--that Secretary Chertoff is generally off to a good start.",
        "In particular, I applaud him for this what I call--what he calls risk-based, consequences-based approach to Homeland Security.",
        "We just can't protect ourselves against every conceivable threat.",
        "So rightly, he says that we need to focus on those threats that are likeliest to materialize and those, that if they were to materialize, would have the greatest impact in terms of death and injury and economic damage.",
        "So I think that's exactly right.",
        "That said, many, if not all, really, of the problems that I called attention to a year or so ago remain.",
        "In '03, we did undercover investigations at airports around the country to see how easy it was to sneak deadly weapons past the screeners.",
        "We found that--the exact results were and remain classified--it was far easier to do that than it should have been.",
        "As you probably know, just a few months ago, my former office did the very same tests at the same airports and basically found that there have been no improvements.",
        "So things haven't changed in that regard.",
        "In terms of air marshals, there continue to be problems.",
        "For example, air marshals have to identify themselves to get discounts at certain hotels when they travel, and they must stay at only certain hotels.",
        "And so obviously, that's a vulnerability because it makes it easy for terrorists to know who they are, and that compromises their anonymity.",
        "So it's going to take a long time, I think, to turn the department around, to make it the effective counterterrorism tool that it was intended to be.",
        "Six months ago, you suggested that our public transit systems were extremely vulnerable and then, of course, we saw the incidents in London.",
        "When we take a look at the situation here in the United States, it does not seem that we are being proactive enough with some of the issues that many people, quite frankly, have pointed out as vulnerable points for terrorists.",
        "Well, I think that's right, Ed.",
        "I think generally speaking, we, our leaders, have not approached the issue of homeland security with the seriousness, sobriety and urgency that I think we need.",
        "Now I want to be clear, I'm not suggesting that we can protect ourselves 100 percent against terrorism.",
        "We can't absolutely prevent it."

        "But what's inexcusable is our not doing everything possible to protect ourselves.",
        "And so, for example, just to go back to that undercover investigation at airports, we made a number of recommendations in that report, among which was the wide deployment of technology, like backscatter technology, which essentially is an X-ray that permits screeners--that would permit screeners to see through people's clothing, so that if there are weapons hidden on the body underneath the clothing, those weapons would be clearly revealed.",
        "Now obviously, there are privacy implications to that, but those can be mitigated.",
        "There's technology that can transmit the body into a cartoon stick figure so that no one's sensitive parts are shown, but any metal objects, any guns or knives can readily be detected.",
        "Now that would reduce to virtually zero, if not zero, the ability of passengers to conceal deadly weapons on themselves.",
        "That technology exists.",
        "It costs money, obviously, to deploy it, but it seems to me that we cannot afford to scrimp when it comes to the national security of the United States.",
        "There is a huge question now floating about racial profiling and whether or not, based on the events over the course of the last few years, that should be something that we allow for, if appropriate information is handed down.",
        "How do you see that?",
        "Well, I think that's an excellent question, Ed, and I must say that I have really wrestled with that in the last few weeks.",
        "Being an African-American, being a member of a racial minority group, I'm especially sensitive, of course, to racial profiling issues and, indeed, you know, the recent attacks in London, the July 21 attacks in London were perpetrated by East Africans.",
        "One of the bombers on July 7 in London was of Jamaican descent.",
        "So, you know, I, myself, and you, yourself, would be under suspicion if racial profiling were undertaken here in this country with regard to potential terrorists, so that troubles me.",
        "On the other hand, it seems to me that the fact of the matter is that at least in the last few years, these terrorist attacks have been perpetrated by an identifiable racial and ethnic group, and so in a sense, we would be undercutting ourselves if we weren't to give extra scrutiny to people who fit that stereotype.",
        "If the largest number, the lion's share of identified terrorists in the last few years were blonde-hair, blue-eyed Anglo-looking males, then it would make sense, it seems to me, to pay particular attention to them, but that's just not been the case.",
        "So it's a very difficult question, but I'm afraid that I think we have to consider it, given the circumstances and given the stakes.",
        "How are you doing?",
        "I'm afraid to say that I think it's just a question of time for a number of reasons.",
        "First of all, the terrorists have made it clear that they intend to attack again.",
        "Bin Laden himself, his deputy, Al-Zarqawi in Iraq, others have made it clear that they intend to do that.",
        "And given all the vulnerabilities that we have in an open country like America, given the lack of urgency that we've had in the last few years, it's very easy to perpetrate an attack.",
        "And so as I say, I think the reason we haven't seen one sooner is because they want the next attack to be even more spectacular than the last one.",
        "Clark Kent Ervin, former inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security, we thank you very much for joining us today.",
        "Greatly appreciate...",
        "Well, it's my pleasure, Ed.",
        "Thank you for having me.",
        "Clark Kent Ervin is the former inspector general for the federal Department of Homeland Security.",
        "He's currently director of the Homeland Security Initiative at the Aspen Institute.",
