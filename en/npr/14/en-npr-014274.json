        "And again, there are a number of individuals on there who really never needed to be on there in the first place, either because they committed a crime that we tend not to think as a sex crime, again, like having consensual teenage sex, or who just never pose much of a risk to the community.",
        "So, you've got these overbroad and overlong registration requirements.",
        "And again, what you're deluding then is any public safety impact they could have.",
        "Because you just have too much information on the registries and it's not meaningful.",

        "Exactly.",
        "And, you know, in our report, in our recommendations, we support police registration.",
        "Again, there's not - we're not clear exactly how police are using the registries, but we do think it's important that police can have a list of names who they, you know, and if they - but we also really want states to actually create laws that are more narrowly tailored and, again, more meaningful.",
        "Because if you just have a list of names for police that just has everyone's names who's ever committed a sex crime on there, law enforcement's going to be overwhelmed, it's going to dilute their ability to monitor those offenders who need monitoring in the community.",
