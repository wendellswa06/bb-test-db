        "Sarah Tofte, he's challenging your recidivism statistics, which are a lot of your argument.",
        "Exactly.",
        "You know, recidivism, you know, I do agree with Steve on a few things.",
        "One, it is difficult to measure recidivism.",
        "We do know that sex crimes are some of the most underreported crimes.",
        "We do also know that, you know, recidivism - we're measuring it by re-arrest or re-conviction rate.",
        "States and the federal government, sometimes they do it differently depending on the study.",
        "And that's the best sort of verifiable data we have out there.",
        "And you know, the most authoritative study that most experts, who I spoke with, will cite is a study that looked at over 30,000 previously convicted sex offenders - individuals convicted of sexually violent offenses.",
        "Now, depending on your offense category, the recidivism rate can fluctuate.",
        "Overall, three out of four offenders are not rearrested or reconvicted for a sex crime.",
        "But there are certain categories, for example, adult men who molest preadolescent boys who have maybe closer to what Steve was saying, 35 percent to 40 percent recidivism rate.",
        "But I do want to say, you know, we understand.",
        "We do understand that parents want information about who are - who may be previously convicted sex offenders who might pose a risk to their children.",
        "And so, Steve was talking about looking up on the registry to find out if the babysitter has a sex crime conviction.",
        "And, you know, for us, you know, first of all, what we'd like to say is that, you know, states have to really narrowly tailor these laws.",
        "If they're going to have online notification, if they're going to do registration, they really need to make sure that the individuals that are on the registry pose some sort of risk to the community.",
        "And they have to figure out a way to do better-targeted need-to-know sort of notification systems.",
        "You know, law enforcement has to have - states need to pass better laws, mandating law enforcement community notification, again, done in a very targeted way.",
        "And for parents that want information about those that are living in their community, who their children are likely to come into contact with, then we think good community notification done by law enforcement officials will give them the information they want from the online registries.",
        "Would you trust the police to give you that information in a timely manner.",
        "The police are like any other bureaucracy…",
        "Exactly.",
        "…they're sometimes highly inefficient and wrong.",
        "Understandable.",
        "And we have to start - but, you know, we have to start - again, I say, crafting better - the laws out there right now are not doing what they should be able to do.",
        "And we have to have a more meaningful community notification laws.",
        "And, you know, one of the reasons why we have, why online notification is so difficult is because it really has such a severe impact on the former offenders that are placed online.",
        "And let me ask Steve Roddel about that.",
        "Is there any way for anybody to get off your registry?"

        "Well, there are plenty of ways.",

        "There are states here in my own state of Indiana, we have 10-year, we have 15-year registrants, we have lifetime registrants.",
        "So it depends really on the type of crime that they commit.",

        "You know, I've been contacted a number of times and most recently about a situation where, in Alabama, they had a - one of the highest level of offenders - most predatory offenders had lived in a neighborhood for six months before the state had made a determination to do a community notification.",
        "And when they finally did that notification, the guy had moved out for four months.",

        "You know, in our report, we interviewed over 200 former offenders.",
        "And for them, sadly, the stories were very similar.",
        "Once they're placed on an online registry, that information is just out there for anyone with an Internet connection regardless of whether they need to know it or not.",
        "And unfortunately, that information gets used to drive people from employment, to drive them from their housing, to drive them out of communities.",
        "And the reason why it's really important that we help people, former offenders, reenter into the community successfully is because when they reenter successfully, that means no more re-offending.",
        "And when there's no more re-offending, there's no more victims.",
        "And, again, that's what we all want.",
