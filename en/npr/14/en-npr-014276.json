        "We appreciate it.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Thanks very much.",

        "And there are the other kinds of cases, which seems excessive but still that a mistake in this regard to find that your next door neighbor is a dangerous person.",
        "That's important information for people to know.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Again, we understand that parents want to know this information and parents want to do whatever they can do to protect their children from sexual violence.",
        "One, we're concerned that by focusing almost all of our public attention and the public debate on previously convicted sex offenders, again, we are not looking at the larger picture of sexual violence.",
        "And the fact that the majority of sex crimes are not committed by previously convicted sex offenders, and it's happening within the home.",
        "That's a discussion that we have not had -we don't talk a whole lot about in the media.",
        "Legislators don't talk a whole lot about that picture of sexual violence.",
        "But, you know, for us, that's why, in our recommendations - we were very careful with our recommendations because, again, we understand that the desire to know and to protect your children from people who may be a danger to them.",
        "And so, that information, you know, when you have police registries, you can go down to the police station and get that information; or if states are going to have community notification, they have to do a more carefully targeted law enforcement notification.",
        "And they have to do - if they're going to do online registries, you know, they really need to restrict it to those that have been individually assessed to pose a risk.",
        "And they have to format it in a way that actually gives parents the information they want because I have actually spoken to a number of parents who say they go on their state's online registry, and they're overwhelmed with the information.",
        "There are thousands of entries.",
        "And again, there's very little information about what you should actually do with that information and how, once you've known, now that you have the information, how you protect your child.",
        "So I think parents want meaningful information.",
        "And at the same time, parents want a safe society.",
        "Pretty good.",
        "And like, you know, we have said before, when sex offenders and former offenders are allowed to reintegrate into the community and we - they have stable housing and stable employment, and they're not dealing with harassment, they're less likely to re-offend.",
        "And, again, that makes us all safer.",
        "And that is the goal, I think, that everyone shares.",

        "Hands-off sex crimes such as Peeping Tom or exhibitionism are registerable offenses in South Carolina and will become registerable offenses when the Adam Walsh registration and notification policies that were enacted last year nationally go into effect.",
        "In 2009, as I understand it.",
        "By 2009, states can put those changes into effect now.",
        "And that one of the main changes of that federal legislation is to require and compel states to register children as young as 14.",
        "Many states register children younger.",
        "In South Carolina, for example, there's no lower age limit, although they try to keep children under the age of 12 off of our lifetime sex offender registry.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And are these registries limited to people involved in incidents or crimes related to children under the age of 18 or what somebody - what a rapist of an adult woman, would they be on the list too?",
        "Yes, yes.",
        "Rapists would be on the list, as they should, if the law's going to target sex offending.",
        "But the focus is certainly on offenders whose victims who are younger.",
        "And that is another way in which these policies really unfairly target juveniles because, of course, their victims tend to be younger because they are younger.",
        "And many states fail to make any distinction between a 45-year-old who had sex with a 13-year-old, and an 11- or 12- or 13-year-old who had sex with a 13-year-old, or even a younger child.",
        "There seems to be this idea that if you have sex with a child regardless of your age, you must be a pedophile and you must be a high risk for re-offending and require a high degree of supervision, and that simply not the case for many sex offenders than it is, especially not the case for juvenile sex offenders.",
        "And is it the case, in your experience, as Sarah Tofte was telling us earlier, that the great majority or the vast majority of offenses against children are by people they know and love and trust?",
        "Yes.",
        "There's very clear research from every country that conducts research on sex offenders that shows that the majority - the great majority - 89 percent of sex offenses are committed by someone who the victim knew and knew well.",

        "This is something that they grow out of.",
        "And so placing a 17-year-old's name on a registry for the rest of his life might engender some more positive feelings for the mom whose children were molested.",
        "But it's unlikely to benefit the rest of society given that if this kid had been treated, he probably would not, you know, he very likely would not go on to re-offend.",
        "And so, with his name on the registry for the rest of his life, he's also not going to be able to get a job.",

        "Many people feel that, you know, once you've offended, you're always going to be an offender and you're always going to be at risk.",
        "And nobody can - there's no amount of testing, you know, that could make me say this person will never ever in his life re-offend.",
        "But given that most sex offenses are committed by first-time offenders, given that the vast majority of adolescent sex offenders, and even the majority of adult sex offenders did not go on to re-offend, I think we do need some much more targeted, specific laws that really target the higher-risk offenders and that don't ruin the chances of low-risk offenders for successfully reintegrating into society.",
        "I mean, there are, you know, there's children as young as 12 on South Carolina's lifetime sex offender registry.",
        "They're not going to be able to stay at their schools probably - they have to move.",
        "I know of cases where families have moved out of state to try to get a better situation for the children after they have successfully completed years of treatment and lived offense-free…"
