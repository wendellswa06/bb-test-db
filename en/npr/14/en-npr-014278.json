        "Well, we're just learning in dribs and drabs really what's been going on.",
        "I was in Somalia on Sunday and Monday, actually, and did not hear until late Monday, early Tuesday, about the strikes in large part because it's very difficult when you're in Mogadishu to get credible information from southern Somalia.",
        "Oftentimes we're relying on people who are eyewitnesses, and so we just simply did not hear from eyewitnesses that night.",
        "We heard other things in Mogadishu, of course.",
        "We heard, you know, terrific gunfire, explosions in different parts of the city, and so we thought we were the story here in Mogadishu when in fact the story was going on in southern Somalia.",
        "Well, just to remind people of recent events.",
        "On Christmas Eve, I think it was, Ethiopian forces spearheaded an advance into Somalia, driving out the forces controlled by the Islamic Courts Union which had sort of taken control of much of the country of Somalia I guess beginning last June.",
        "And in a surprising tactical defeat for the Islamic Courts, their forces were routed from Mogadishu and relocated down toward the south of the country near the Kenyan border in a place called Kismayo.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "Kismayo is the southern seaport in Somalia.",
        "And the thing is - the very interesting thing that happened, or didn't happen, I should say.",
        "You know, the Islamic Courts, they pledged to fight.",
        "They pledged to put up a big resistance against the Ethiopian troops and the Somali troops.",
        "They pledged to do so in Mogadishu.",
        "They did not.",
        "They left under cover of darkness.",
        "They pledged to do so in Kismayo.",
        "They did not.",
        "They left under cover of darkness.",
        "And so they traveled farther south.",
        "And what is believed is that whenever they have moved, whenever they've retrenched, they've split up.",
        "Some have gone in one direction.",
        "Others go in a different direction.",
        "Some in the group want to stay and fight, others want to try to figure out a way to melt over the border some place, or go to sea, or just get out of Somalia by any means necessary.",
        "So what's happening is that the Ethiopian-Somali troops who are chasing these Islamist fighters farther and farther south in Somalia are chasing smaller and smaller groups that are becoming more and more disparate.",
        "And these are not just Somalis, but they apparently include some people who came to join the fight.",
        "We've heard of course broadcasts by al-Qaida lieutenant Ayman al-Zawahiri calling for people to join an Iraqi insurgency-like fight in Somalia, and these apparently include people from overseas as well as some people the United States has been arguing have been protected by Islamic Courts Union people.",
        "People they say are responsible for the attacks on embassies in Kenya and Tanzania back in 1998.",
        "That's absolutely true.",
        "The United States has for a long time maintained that there are leaders of al-Qaida who have been given safe haven in Somalia by the Islamic Courts Union, who of course control southern Somalia and Mogadishu these past six months.",
        "The Islamic Courts Union has always denied this, but, you know, anti-terrorism has been the focus of U.S.",
        "efforts on the Horn of Africa for quite some time, as well as Ethiopia's interest.",
        "Ethiopia got into this war in large part because they felt threatened by the Islamic Courts Union, the more radical elements of the Islamic Courts, who were calling for jihad against Ethiopia and who many believed were being led by outsiders who essentially, as they put it, had sort of commandeered the Islamic Courts Union and pushed it into, you know, a very belligerent direction.",
        "Have we heard - the history of U.S.",
        "air strikes on alleged terrorist leaders has been mixed.",
        "Sometimes of course they have worked.",
        "Other times they've killed a lot of people who turned out not to be involved in anything.",
        "Have we heard anything about casualties, who was hit, what kind of people they were?"

        "Well, you know, we've heard some voices that are emanating from southern Somalia at this point.",
        "All we've heard is that many people have died.",
        "We don't know what many means, though.",
        "You know, this is a very difficult area to gauge and there are an awful lot of vulnerable people, and I'll tell you why.",
        "One reason why it's difficult to gauge is because southern Somalia, particularly near the Kenyan border, can be very heavily forested, which is one of the reasons why many of the fighters are believed to be in that area because it's harder to find you in the forest.",
        "But at the same time, you know, this is also an area that was heavily, heavily damaged in recent weeks by flooding in southern Somalia.",
        "As you know, flooding just was devastating this past rainy season in Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, and so it led to a lot of displaced people, internally displaced people in Somalia.",
        "So in this area where the air attacks apparently occurred, this is an area that is already home to more than 4,000 displaced people, according to the U.N., and many of those people are out of the reach of the U.N.",
        "and other humanitarian organizations.",
        "That 4,000 also include 400 refugees who were expelled from Kenya recently and sent back to Somalia in large part because Kenya is very concerned about which Somalis are coming over the border and whether they can vouch for everyone who's here.",

        "He's suspected of being a mastermind of 1998 bombings of two U.S.",
        "embassies in neighboring Tanzania and Kenya.",
        "And the two other guys who are also allegedly al-Qaida leaders who were with him were also suspected of bombing a hotel in Kenya in 2002.",

        "And we heard reports today of attacks by helicopter gun ships.",
        "If those were American helicopter gun ships, presumably they would come from naval bases from ships just off the coast.",
        "Right.",
        "That too is not clear, but we are talking to military officials who say reported that there are helicopter gun ships resuming attacks Tuesday, today, against suspected terrorist holdouts in southern Somalia, and so they would presumably be coming from either Kenya or Djibouti.",
        "Probably Kenya.",
        "And is this - what are you learning about - this was a completely fluid situation as these people were leaving Mogadishu and going down south trying to stay away from the pursuing Somali and Ethiopian forces.",

        "They knew they were heading towards the border with Kenya and they were watching them very closely based on intelligence that, while they won't discuss how they got the intelligence, was clearly fairly good intelligence.",

        "But we get the impression, the distinct impression that they're operating in the area, as well as the CIA.",

        "They also believe that these guys are very good fishermen - in fact, they posed as fishermen before the embassy bombings of 1998 - and that they could get on any one of a hundred or several hundred (unintelligible) and just cross over the border by water - by one of the fishing boats.",
        "And let me ask you also, in the war between the Ethiopian-led forces on behalf of the provisional government of Somalia and the Islamic Courts Union forces, the Islamist forces, the belief of many people in Somalia, if not everybody, is that the Ethiopian side has been backed by the United States.",
