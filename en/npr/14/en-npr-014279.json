        "It'd be kind of fun, so...",
        "And it's really interesting: the chefs who had the emphasis on the kind of communal and family and atmosphere, versus the folks who basically say, I would be there, you know, in my kitchen and making perfect filets of salmon - or something like that.",
        "Well, there were really two camps when I was interviewing the chefs.",
        "There were the ones that had sort of the memory meals.",

        "There were lots of things that I've never even - I don't think I'll ever get to eat, or I've never heard of, as I interviewed.",
        "I said, how do you spell that, and what's that?",
        "No, I didn't because through me, these chefs are revealing themselves.",
        "So it wasn't for me to judge, or it just was for me to allow them to be who they are.",
        "And they sort of reveal our aspirations, right?",
        "I mean, if this is what the best of the best would eat at the end, right?",
        "Does that make sense, Bill?",
        "Well, I guess it shows that, like, after hours and hours of serving these high-end meals, in the end, oh, I want oyster with no condiments.",
