        "Now collapsed in our definition means that the catches of these species, or what we're able to extract out of the ocean regarding these species, has declined by 90 percent or more since the historical maximum.",

        "By biodiversity we mean the total sum of species in the ocean, so this ranges from the tiny microscopic plankton that feed the larger plankton that feed the fish larvae that grow into large fish that feed us.",
        "The whole food chain in the ocean, if you will.",
        "And what the seafood part of it is is just a tiny fraction, actually, of that large chain, but it's the fraction that we see that we perceive, because that's what's landing on our plate and what's feeding the planet.",
        "Now if we look back much larger over many different species, we have a timeline of 1,000 years in one part of our study for species ranging from plankton all the way to whales.",
        "If you look at species loss there over that historic time period, we see that actually 38 percent of species are collapsed and 7 percent of the species we had data for were extinct in the regions.",
        "Meaning they were not found at all anymore, and that had some grave consequences for fisheries but also for habitats and for water quality.",

        "We were all surprised.",
        "We were surprised by the rate of decline, and concerned, obviously.",
        "But also surprised by how much the results from very different data sets were matching up.",
        "We looked at four different types of data: experiments, historical data, fisheries data and data from marine reserves and fishery closures, and in the end they all told us how important biodiversity really is in supporting fisheries and supporting water quality in other ecosystems (unintelligible) that are so vital to humanity.",

        "Authority, authority, authority.",
        "Well, we certainly take some of the messages that are in this report about biodiversity being different in different parts of the world, and certainly the areas with inherently low biodiversity, like the polar ecosystems, are particularly fragile and we need to be cognizant of that.",
        "But the overall message that all global taxes supporting fisheries will be collapsed by 2048 we think, number one, the projection is incorrect based on what we would consider to be imperfect data.",
        "And secondly, it doesn't comport with the trends that we see, particularly in the United States, where we see a flattening out, in fact an up-tick in the proportion of species that are fished at the right levels and stocks are sustainable rates of harvest.",
        "So we don't see this sort of pessimistic view that stocks are necessarily all headed to collapse by that period of time.",

        "Are you saying that you're reading the same data but not agreeing with the analysis, or you don't agree with the data itself?",
        "Well, there's two factors.",
        "Number one, we don't agree that fishery catch is necessarily reflective of the underlying fishery population.",
        "I'll cite an example.",
        "Georges Bank haddock, which is a very important species on the East Coast of the United States, had a historical maximum catch of 150,000 tons in 1965.",
        "The reason that catch was so high was it was large domestic fishing and over-fishing by foreign fleets that were on our coast.",
        "Now those foreign fleets are gone.",
        "The catch in 2003 was 12,000 tons, which was eight percent.",
        "But the stock size is high and building now and the stock is under regulation.",
        "So by just looking at the catches you get a misleading view, particularly in areas of the world where we have had effective fisheries' management in stocks rebuilding.",
        "So we don't - number one, the metric - because you're taking this worldwide view, it's sort of the lowest common denominator metric, and we have much better data in the developed world on the actual underlying stock sizes.",
        "And so by interpreting just catches you may get a skewed view, particularly in areas of the world where we're rebuilding stocks.",
        "So we don't buy that.",
        "In the United States, currently about 26 percent of the stocks that we regulate are in an over-fished condition.",
        "Now an over-fished condition is only 50 percent of its biomass - that is our long-term goal.",
        "And in fact, the fraction of stocks in an over-fished condition is declining, not increasing.",
        "And so the worldwide trend that is supported by this statement that all global (unintelligible) are currently fished would be collapsed is not correct in terms of the patterns that we see in the United States and elsewhere in the world.",
        "Patrick Sullivan, where do you weigh in on this?",
        "Well, it's pretty dramatic seeing the change that's going on there, and I think, like Steve said, there's a lot of good messages that can be taken out of it.",
        "I found the paper pretty interesting in terms of the biodiversity part of it, but I was quite taken aback by the projection of collapsed fish stocks by 2040.",
        "It's just hard to believe.",
        "Look around at what's happening with the United States.",
        "Things seem to be well, so you start thinking, you know, is the diversity higher in certain areas like in China, so forth?",
        "You know, China leads the world in terms of fish production from fishing, and conceivably it has higher (unintelligible) there.",
        "So conceivably, something like China could skew the results.",
        "But you really wonder, you know, what role the U.S.",
        "can play in this and how it would affect sort of the world picture.",
