        "But I was difficult for me to actually find the source materials that were used to do the analysis, so I don't have anything to rebut from it.",
        "I mean one of the pictures I'm looking at is seeing the cumulative effect, overall, which shows like 50 to 80 percent of the stocks are currently collapsed.",
        "And I really have a hard time believing that that's so.",

        "Well, when we see this, you know, I represent a group of fishermen and conservationists and we look at this as another call to action that we need to do a better job of managing our ocean fish.",
        "And I just want to take a couple of clarifying points to what Steve Murawski was saying.",
        "First of all, when he was - I don't dispute his number - 26 in change of over-fished stocks, but what we're really talking about is we manage to a level called maximum sustainable yield, and that means 40 percent of historic sizes.",
        "And then, when he says 50 percent, that means we're looking at below 20 percent of historic sizes.",
        "So over-fished stocks are severely depleted.",
        "Secondly, we've taken a look at his - the National Marine Fishing Service data, and we don't see this up-tick.",
        "We looked at data from 2001 to 2004, and when you look at stocks that they know are healthy, they've been assessed and they are not over-fished - that means depleted or substitute to higher over-fishing - there's been no change.",
        "There's 91, which is about 13 percent of the managed fish stocks in the United States.",
        "So we don't - we see a lot of reason for concern in the United States and, you know, we think that, you know, more needs to be done to address the issues that Dr. Worm and his colleagues have identified."

        "I agree with most of your points, really.",
        "And I agree that the United States has taken the right measures.",
        "About 10 years ago there was a new legislation introduced that was mandated to stop over-fishing very strongly and to rebuild fish stocks that have been depleted or lost.",
        "And obviously, that's a wonderful thing to do.",
        "It's a hard thing to do in practice.",
        "The result, 10 years later, is that we have 74 stocks that are requiring recovery.",
        "There's rebuilding plans for 67 of them.",
        "Three of those have been recovered to a level that is supposed to be maximum sustainable yield, and half of these are still being over-fished, meaning it has not been possible to curb fishing pressure enough to even give them a chance to recover.",
        "So I'm absolutely applauding the legislation and the idea of rebuilding fish stocks, because that's exactly what we're saying in this paper.",
        "Now, Steve, the example you give for Georges Bank haddock is one I give all the time, because it's one of the poster children, if you wish, of successful management.",
        "It resulted from the emergency measure of closing about half of Georges Bank in I think it was 1994.",
        "And in order to stop the ongoing collapse of (unintelligible) stocks, and it was a very successful measure.",
        "An analysis that Steve has done is actually part of our paper where we look at the effects of fishery closures and marine reserves in rebuilding biodiversity, in rebuilding fishery, rebuilding the stability of the system.",
        "And that analysis of course shows, according to what Steve was saying, that if you do the right thing, you get recovery and you get economic benefits relatively quickly, more quickly than people have thought from that.",
        "So that's a very, very hopeful message, and Georges Bank haddock is the good example for that.",
        "But it is an exception that proves the rule of global over-fishing that's going on despite better evidence in many different countries, including the U.S., although the U.S.",
        "is leading the track record here ahead of many other countries.",
        "I agree with that point.",

        "Or are we talking about the loss of the biodiversity, the food chain, where the fish are not getting enough to eat and what would end - and the pollution and whatever the causes of that is?",
        "Well, what I would say to that is that it's a really a cumulative effect of over-fishing and habitat destruction, pollution and climate change.",
        "Various panels that were working under the United States government or other panels that have come out with reports recently concluded those are the four major problems we have to tackle.",

        "Steve, would you agree?",

        "They serve as food for a variety of fish, marine mammals, birds, and they're being increasingly used to feed this aquaculture industry, and it's not a very efficient process.",
        "It's something on the order of two pounds of these forage fish for one pound of salmon produced.",
        "And we talk about ecosystem-based management, and one of the things that we think is the first step towards ecosystem based management is looking at those forage species and setting the catch levels with their larger role in the ecosystem in mind so that you figure out how much of that forage, either a sardine or a squid or something like that, needs to be left in the waters as food for the rest of the ecosystem.",
