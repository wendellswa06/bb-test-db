        "Chuck brings up a very good issue.",
        "And the place he's from, Alaska, is really a bellwether for good fisheries management, you know.",
        "The largest single species fishery in the world is Alaska walleye pollock, and it's well managed and stable in terms of catch.",
        "And so he's in a place in the world where, you know, good fisheries management is producing a surplus of fish.",
        "The economic issues that he brings up are very important.",
        "If you look at the total U.S.",
        "catch in the United States, it produces about $4 billion a year in value to fishermen.",
        "But on the debit side, we import about $11 billion of seafood, and much of it is in aquaculture production from Southeast Asia and from South America and other places.",
        "And so this competes directly with the wild-caught fish in many cases at much lower prices, and we have this problem in salmon and also in shrimp.",
        "We have a tremendous import of aquaculture-based shrimp into the United States.",
        "And so in some cases, we haven't been able to establish an ecologically sustainable aquaculture in the United States, or at least get a policy, and so we're exporting these ecological consequences around the globe.",
        "What we do need is a much more logical aquaculture policy in the United States that would allow us to produce more fish in a way that's much more sustainable in terms of the ecosystem.",
        "I think this has been one of the priorities that we've had legislatively to try to get authority to do aquaculture, particularly in offshore areas, in a sustainable way.",
        "Can I also weigh in (unintelligible)?",
        "Sure.",
        "I think this is a really, really important point.",
        "Salmon in Alaska is one of the prime examples for good management, as Steve has said, where the preserve the biodiversity of the stock complex - and they have a very resilient structure there - and I really applaud that.",
        "And I do see the problem there that consumers are not able right now to distinguish well between sustainable product, which Alaska salmon is, and an unsustainable product, which a lot of the aquacultured salmon is.",
        "And I think we need - as consumers, we need to get much more savvy in distinguishing between seafoods that are sustainable, both aquacultured and wild sea foods, and those that are not, because on both sides you have some that are sustainable and some are not.",
        "The Marine Stewardship Council at Monterrey Bay Aquarium came up with these consumer guides that can guide our decisions, make us more conscious of what we buy and how it contributes either to over-fishing or to the converse.",
        "And it's also healthier, the wild fish.",
        "It's got fewer pesticides in them, things like that, that are in the food that we feed them.",
        "Harvey Pekar said he knew how hard it is just to live ordinary life.",

        "You know, it's quite interesting.",
        "We just released a large study on the health benefits and risks of seafood that was conducted by the National Institute of Medicine.",
        "And what they actually found was that in terms of the heart-quality, actually cultured salmon is a little bit better for you than wild.",
        "And that seems somewhat ironic, but the fact of the matter is that cultured salmon is a little bit higher in Omega-3 fatty acids, and so these are the compounds that are related to heart disease.",
        "And so there certainly are issues of contaminants versus the heart-quality of seafood, but we can't necessarily look at all these issues as if they're negatives.",
        "My answer to that is you just take an Omega-3 pill once a day, and you've made up that deficit and you can go eat the fresh fish.",
        "Well, that's a good point, but where do these pills come from?",
        "Right.",
        "Omega-3 fatty acids come from wild fish.",
        "So I totally agree with you, there's not just food issues here, there's health benefits and a whole range of ecosystem benefits that come from fish and other elements of the marine ecosystems.",
        "And we just can't afford really, not just economically but for health benefits.",
        "There's a lot to lose these very, very valuable resources.",
        "Do we think that with the new Democratic Congress coming in that it might be friendlier to domestically produced fish, perhaps putting tariffs on foreign imports, helping out fisherman?",
        "In my view, it's a consumer responsibility.",

        "That's where they come in to grow up, or they go even further up like salmon or striper, and the other 20 percent eat that 80 percent.",

        "Lee Crockett, any reaction?",
        "Well, that's exactly true.",
        "The estuaries are the nursery grounds of some 75 percent of the federally managed fish, and they are under tremendous pressure from development, wetlands loss and dredging and sea grass loss and that sort of thing.",
        "So it's very important, and I think it adds to the difficulty in managing the ocean fish.",
        "Because of that pressure on the nursery habitats, I think we need to be much more cautious in how we manage our ocean fish.",
        "And Steve Murawski talked about Alaska.",
        "One of the things that they do in Alaska is they use precautionary management, so they put a buffer into the catch levels.",
        "They don't catch right up to the exact amount that models say they can catch.",

        "Gentlemen, any final comments?",
        "Any final thoughts?",
        "That was part of our study as well.",
        "We were not looking at just how fishing was declining but at some of the other components of the ecosystem that are so essential.",
        "And in the historical data that came from 12 estuaries and coastal regions around the world, my co-author (unintelligible) showed that 33 percent of the fisheries declined, but 69 percent of the nursery habitat declined.",
        "So there was an even much larger and more drastic effect on nursery habitats that are so essential, as the gentleman just said.",
        "And finally, there was a 63 percent also in the decline in species that were filtering the water and detoxifying wastes, and that caused all sorts of problems with water quality in these estuaries.",
        "So the fishery may be the most obvious one, but some of the effects on nursery habitats and filter function may be even more drastic, and because they have human health implications also are very important to many people, not only those who eat seafood.",
        "These are basically considered two different areas, the fish out in the ocean and the seafood in the estuaries?",
        "No, we just looked at them through different analysis, and this one particularly looked at 12 estuaries and coastal ecosystems like the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, the Adriatic and Chesapeake Bay, San Francisco Bay, lots of estuaries in the U.S., and it showed these numbers that I just cited.",
        "So the shellfish are in trouble.",
        "Yes.",
        "Shellfish closures went up by 235 percent over the timeframe we looked at, and harmful toxic algae blooms went up 450 percent.",

        "And I applaud Steve and others who are on the frontlines and try to enforce this.",
        "It's not easy, and nobody says it's easy, but it's got to be done."
