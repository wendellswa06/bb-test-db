        "And maybe this Zawahiri strike is an example of actually being able to trace the chain of custody of the audiotapes, videotapes that he has been recently making.",
        "But, you know, between the two of them, Al-Qaida's top leaders, Ayman Al Zawahiri and bin Laden have released something like 30 audiotapes and videotapes, since 9-11.",
