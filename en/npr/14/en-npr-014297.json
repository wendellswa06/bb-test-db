        "I mean, we often have how Jewishness looks to someone who isn't a Jew and who hates Jews, and in a book where there is some of that, I wanted the opposite too.",

        "But there's something else about Finkler that I go for in this book and accounts for some of the book's comic anger at this stage, and that's the whole business of being ashamed.",
