        "And Dan, when you set aside the storm damage, how big a difference is the boom that you're seeing right now from what you were seeing a few years ago?",
        "Four times, three times, three, four times as much.",
        "And are you confident that this is a long-term change and not just a short-term blip or a boom?",

        "Happy anniversary everyone.",
        "I know it doesn't feel like good times to an awful lot of people, but really this recovery began officially in June of 2009.",

        "The Federal Reserve was acting quickly to put lots and lots of money into the system.",
        "So they stopped the freefall in June of '09.",
        "So is the recovery measured from when we stopped losing quite so many jobs and started losing fewer jobs?",
        "Is that the turning point?",
        "No, you know, jobs tend to be a lagging indicator.",
        "We actually peaked with job losses in October of 2009 when we hit 10 percent unemployment.",
        "So the economic freefall stopped in June of '09, but the unemployment problem continued.",
        "And what we've seen since then, it's the National Bureau of Economic Research that is sort of the body that calls it and says this was the worst of the drop.",

        "So here you are, you know, years, literally years later, and we still have nearly 12 million people who are unemployed.",
        "And of those, even worse, you have more than one out of three who has been out of work for more than six months.",
        "That's a long time.",
        "That means your unemployment benefits are running out.",
        "You really start just taking any kind of work just to get some money coming in the house.",

        "A lot of that is tied to globalization, China's slowing down, troubles in Europe, but you're just not seeing a robust recovery where people feel good, and they want to take chances, and they want to rush forward."
