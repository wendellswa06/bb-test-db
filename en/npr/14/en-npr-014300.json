        "You know, if you're buying and selling at the same time, it doesn't matter if you sold and bought at the bottom or now because if you sold at the bottom, you didn't get a lot for your house, but the home you bought was really cheap.",

        "Now, remember we talked about in the winter of 2009 we had that big stimulus program.",
        "And a lot of that stimulus money for infrastructure has now gone through the system, and it's waning, and we've moved into this age of sequester, where the government has cut back, has set aside a bunch of funds that should have gone to more public spending.",

        "And a lot of that is tied to lower interest rates.",
        "You know, we've seen very low, historically low mortgage rates.",
