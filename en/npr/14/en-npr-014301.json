        "So if you're growing wheat, corn, all of that, it's a great time to be an American farmer, and it's also a terrific time to be in the oil and gas discovery business because all of those places - I mean we've heard so many sad stories in recent weeks about Oklahoma and the tornadoes, but they actually - you know, that is an area that is just absolutely booming with energy.",
        "You also pointed to an interesting statistic about auto sales that relates exactly to the point that you're making.",

        "So you're seeing SUVs because there are a lot of people in that sector of the economy, and also residential construction, so you're seeing more small businesses buying small pickup trucks and things like that.",

        "You know, there's no growth per se or no significant increase in the economy.",

        "But what happened in Decatur and so many cities in Illinois is they've lost manufacturing jobs.",
        "You had a Firestone plant that closed there.",

        "Gaming and tourism revenues are slightly higher.",
        "But our brightest spot, he says, is a high-tech boom now happening in our downtown, not on The Strip, which is still dominated by casinos, but in the old Vegas downtown.",
        "Young high-tech entrepreneurs are moving in and starting a small Silicon Valley here.",
        "Las Vegas has a long way to go, he writes, but it will end up being different because of the recession.",
        "I'm from Youngstown, Ohio, originally, and, you know, when I look at what the lost of jobs from industry, that when the steel mills, auto factories, those kind of things closed down, those jobs - job losses had been absolutely devastating.",

        "Wal-Mart, we'll hear a lot about this, this week because they're having their annual shareholders' meeting, and there are protesters there already in Bentonville, Arkansas, that are trying to call attention to the fact that a lot of Wal-Mart workers get help with food, you know, the - what we used to call food stamps.",
        "They also get Medicaid because their wages are typically for most clerks a little under $9 an hour, and that adds up to about 18,000 a year.",
        "If you have a family, that means you're actually living in poverty even though you're working full-time.",
        "So there's a lot of concern about wages.",
        "On the other hand, every economist will tell you that Wal-Mart has really helped with inflation and made it very possible for people to feed their families for low prices because Wal-Mart has kept down prices.",

        "Right.",
