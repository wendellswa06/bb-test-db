        "But she didn't volunteer for that.",

        "Well, I certainly would rather avoid them.",
        "Having said that, you avoid them not by simply voting for them, but by making sure that the reasons why people are concerned - and that's because our debt is mounting uncontrollably.",
        "This is four straight years of trillion-dollar-plus deficit, so we need to see the president lead on this issue.",
        "I think he has the ability to do that.",

        "So that's a better way to do it.",
        "But I would say sequestration, honestly, a lot of people would like to see across-the-board cuts.",
