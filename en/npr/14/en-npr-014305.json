        "Very surprising.",

        "Most importantly, a decline in the size of the labor force.",
        "That's been caused partly by discouraged workers who've given up looking for jobs, but Zandi says it's also due to demographic changes, a smaller stream of immigrants coming into the U.S.",
        "looking for work and an aging population retiring.",
        "Most recently, in the last few months and last year, most of the decline in labor force participation is among females and it's among college-educated white females.",
