        "I've read that there were widows of some of the miners who were killed who went to testify before Congress, and that's what ultimately led to, in 1969, the Coal Mine Safety and Health Act.",

        "So, what led to the - if we can just look back, when did those gates start to open up when we you the \"\"Deer Hunter,\"\" \"\"Apocalypse Now\"\" coming home?",
        "Well, that was - it was actually the late 1970s.",
        "So it was well after our part in the fighting in Vietnam had ended.",

        "That's kind of adventuresome and bold in a way, but it is also the kind of thing that leads to a picture that is not necessarily satisfying in the sense that we - that Hollywood has led us to expect.",
        "And again, you know, looking back, it seems that Hollywood was sort of working through those issues, at least with regard to Vietnam for several years, because if you, sort of, reach beyond the late 1970s and the '80s, you then saw \"\"Platoon\"\" and \"\"Full Metal Jacket\"\" and older films.",

        "But if these - films that are in the pipeline are following films that deal with war and terrorism and Middle East policy, that have not been successful, how does - especially as we go on to this peak movie season, how did the studios turn to market those films?",
        "Well, you'll note that one of those pictures, the most high-profile of them, is \"\"Charlie Wilson's War.\"\" That's a movie that is about the 1970s.",
        "It's about the - a historical event and that is, traditionally, how Hollywood deals with it.",
        "In fact, if you look back at the Vietnam era and you look at the kinds of war movies that were made - being made during that period, they weren't about Vietnam.",

        "Tora!",
        "Tora!\"\" and films about World War II.",
