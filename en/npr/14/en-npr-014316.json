        "And I think in some respects, it's also moot in regards to black people because - Dr. Henry Louis Gates had a recent special.",
        "He's been doing this \"\"African-American Lives.\"\" And he says — and, you know, he was able to tell these notables, whether it was Chris Rock or Tina Turner or a number of other people, their lineage and — as Africans in this country, we've seen how we all look, and it's jarring to see the reaction of someone, let's say, a Chris Rock who is brown-complected to be shown a white antecedent two or three generations removed.",
        "So, to me, whether we discuss Obama's identity or not, it's really a moot subject.",
        "It's always going to be based on who you look like, and it's going to be that whole quick reaction as to, okay, this is why we (unintelligible).",
        "If a policeman's going to accost you or if you're trying to get a cab, there you go.",
        "And I think Obama has already spoken about that.",

        "There was one Italian management consultant you spoke with who tried to offer a little comic relief.",
        "It's so bad, you quote him as saying, to save money, they've turned off the light at the end of the tunnel.",
        "I know you've been getting a lot of mail about this.",
        "What's in a name?",
        "You know, we asked whether African-Americans pay an economic price for having distinctly ethnic or black-sounding names.",
        "And you were on the show, you said if you have a name like La'Quiesha, you were in trouble basically.",
        "What kind of reactions have you been getting to that, and how do you respond to people who've been sending you tons of mail?",
        "Well, I'm going to remain steadfast to my beliefs because I go by what I've read and what I see anecdotally.",
        "And, you know, I got a lot of positive responses from that.",
        "A lot of people said, I'm glad that you said what you said, and I had some people that were just very irate.",
        "Probably someone who was a DeQuan(ph) or DeShawn(ph) was probably angry with me.",
        "Now, just to clarify what I said last time, I'm not condemning a person because of their name.",
        "It would be stupid to say that because you are named something, that equals problems for you in life.",
        "But I think that it is an indicator for where you may go in life.",
        "It doesn't mean that you should be hampered by it, but - and also, we should use some level of discernment.",
        "I mean, there is a definite difference between someone who is - like Barack Obama, as a politician nay-nay(ph).",
        "Barack Obama, this person, he can go to his African grandmother in Kenya and touch her.",
        "I can't do that.",

        "There are people who may sort of anglicize their urban fabulous names, and then there's other people who adopt African names.",
        "And so, you know, is it really just about choice?",
        "Is it about, you know, you're born with a name, but that's not the one that you have to keep, and you can make an economic or a cultural decision?",
        "Or is there something deeper to it?",
        "You know, there are a lot of things in play.",
        "I mean, when we were deciding what to name our two boys, we chose very — I don't know what you'd call them — very standard or anglicized names because that was what we liked, and I think part of it is what people like.",
        "But when you are talking about African-sounding names versus actual African names, I think there's also a cultural yearning at play, a desire to have a connection to a past and to a history that we don't necessarily get a lot of in this country.",
        "Debra, just quickly.",
        "Do you think that people who have names that are, you know, kind of invented, Africanized and who may not be treated as seriously in the workplace according to studies should say, hey, you know what?",
        "I need the money, I'm just going to change myself from DeShawn to Shawn(ph).",
        "I am not sure that people are choosing these names, A, because they think they're quasi-African and, B, because they feel a need for some sort of connection to Africa.",
        "I have - maybe I've missed some research, but from what I can tell, the names are just being chosen sort of by - now, of course, Raheem(ph) and names like that are different, but, you know, DeShawn - and my son is in kinder - first grade, and everybody in there but him has a name with an apostrophe in it, you know?",
        "Oh.",
        "So I'm not sure if people are harkening back to Africa.",
        "But that's a really tough one.",
