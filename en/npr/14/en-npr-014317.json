        "Yes, but it's not a coherent revolt against that idea because then there are others, including Angela Merkel, the chancellor in Germany, who says the only answer to the problem is more Europe.",
        "One of the surprises to me was I expected to find a lot of resentment of the Germans.",
        "Here are the Germans telling us how to run our affairs.",
        "Actually, that's not where the resentment is.",
        "And there was some interesting polling that the Pew Research Center did, which found, in fact, even in Spain and Italy and most of Southern Europe, people largely admired the Germans.",
        "And if they thought it would work, if they thought the German prescriptions would work, they'd sign up for them.",
        "It's no so true in Greece where they're feeling more pain.",
        "Where the anger is directed is against the bankers because people see lots of money being taken out of their pocket, out of their economy to bailout bankers and what this is like.",
        "The best analogy I came up with for Americans is, you remember, when we went through TARP and the bailout of the Wall Street banks, and we all hated that.",
        "Everybody on every side of the political spectrum thought, you know, this is really rotten, but we're stuck with it.",
        "Well, we had to go through that for about a year.",
        "Europe has being going through that for more than two years.",
        "Bit by bit, they've been doing TARP in slow motion and they're not done yet, and they hate every step of it.",
        "Now, what's its like to live in Europe today?",
        "Give us a call: 800-989-8255.",
        "Email: talk@npr.org.",
        "You mentioned slow motion.",
        "There's also this idea that after the TARP bailout, there was the stimulus package put forward by President Obama.",
        "They're talking about stimulus right now in Mexico City where the Group of 20 is meeting.",
        "It includes, of course, a lot of these big European countries.",
        "And the iceberg is slowly breaking in Europe because, initially, the approach in Europe led by Germany, which has the money and so, in effect, controls the first strings, Angela Merkel and her conservative party don't want to bailout the rest of Europe.",
        "So theirs was an austerity program.",
        "And that was also true of David Cameron in Great Britain even though Britain isn't in the eurozone.",
        "The pain has been so intense, including in Germany and Britain, that those governments are wavering on that.",
        "And so now everybody is talking about some way to combine growth and austerity, in a sense, in the same way that the Obama administration, that the American political dialogue has struggled to combine the idea of some stimulus followed by budget tightening.",
        "In Europe, it's the other way around, belt tightening followed by a little bit of loosening up of stimulus someplace or another because they desperately got to get some growth going somewhere.",
        "Euler's equation.",
        "Yeah, there's a lot of black humor in the financial districts in Europe these days.",
        "I got to tell you that after that my management consultant friend in Milan read the column, he sent me an email saying, hey, it was only a joke.",
        "I do think there's a light at the end of the tunnel.",
        "But he couldn't tell me where it was.",
        "Is there a light - I mean, the future as you say is feeling so constricted, especially for young people who are out of college or out of high school and have nothing to look forward to.",
        "Well, you know, the future really lies in this set of mind-numbing but rolling European summits over the next few weeks, the one that's going to be in Brussels later this month followed by whatever bailout happens after that.",
        "Europe should work its way out of this recession inevitably and inexorably and slowly, just as any free market economy or set of free market economies should by all the rules eventually work its way out.",
        "It's just taking so darn long.",
        "And they dodged a bullet in Greece, but there are more shells coming."

        "The problem of Greece was two-fold.",
        "One, if Greece ended up leaving the euro, being kicked out of the euro or collapsing out of the euro, then the principal that the eurozone is inviolable gets broken.",
        "And you have this terrible specter now, which is the real one, of a run on the banks, of people pulling their money out and putting it in safe places.",
        "Well, there is a slow-motion run on the banks.",
        "And that's going on.",
        "It's going on Spain, it's going on in Italy, it could go on in France, and they're out not out of the woods yet on that one at all.",

        "Well, the only thing that I was calling about, I don't have any specific stories, but one of the things that we have been talking with family and friends is that apart from the hardship of the measures of the - economic measures is that something that we feel that's very, very important is that a sense of democracy has been stripped out of the people.",
        "In Spain, it really doesn't matter who you are voting for or who is elected.",
        "The austerity measures that are in place are coming from someone else, and someone who has not been elected in Europe or let alone Spain.",
        "So that's one of the things that we have been struggling, and we are very worried about that.",
        "It doesn't really matter or we don't - people do not have the power to elect their representatives.",
        "And the - so the policies are coming from Berlin or Brussels, and - but the pain is being felt in - where is your family from in Spain?",

        "Yes, and it's a theme that I heard when I was in Europe.",
        "Again, the frustration with the failure of politics at home to solve these problems, the frustration with the fact of dealing with faceless bureaucrats, but also the frustration that it felt like a rigged game, that it felt like the only people who could really get their phone calls answered at the central bank in Frankfurt or the European Commission in Brussels were the big banks in Paris and Frankfurt and London.",
        "So there's almost a flavor in Europe right now of those early months of the Tea Party in the United States.",
        "But it's not a Tea Party exclusively off the right because, of course, you've got left-wing governments, right-wing governments.",
        "It's a Tea Party all over the map.",
        "But in Spain in particular, this is a country that was held back for so long by the Franco dictatorship, and the sense that, finally, released from those shackles, they had figured it out: prosperity, modern development, a modern state that Spain had really come of age.",
        "And that whole sense of regaining their balance, that's been lost."

        "One of the saddest stories I heard was actually from some Irish friends, who said, you know, for years - the Irish suddenly got used to the fact that they were actually importing labor for the first time in their national life, that they had Polish plumbers and Czech carpenters, and that all of their kids could look forward to good jobs in Ireland.",
        "And now, in Ireland, they have returned to the sad old tradition of kids getting out of college and beginning to look for work in places like Canada and Australia and having to emigrate for their futures.",
