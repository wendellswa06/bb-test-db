        "(Laughter) So the night mayor is an independent not-for-profit which helps ensure that the city of Amsterdam has a dynamic and vibrant but also safe nightlife.",
        "We really want to bridge the gap between the mayor and city councilors, small business owners - like nightclubs and festivals - but also city residents.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Was your job created because there were problems that you were trying to solve?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Actually, to be honest, really often, the role of the night mayor - whether it's in London, Amsterdam, similar organizations in Berlin - it's a reaction because there's a problem.",
        "In Amsterdam, people had the feeling that the city of Amsterdam was turned into an open-air museum, which was only there for tourists and not for the Amsterdamers themselves to go out, meet people, have a cultural, diverse nightlife.",

        "So in this entertainment district, we managed to get down alcohol-related violence by 25 percent and have a decrease in nuisance of any sort - littering, people shouting on the street, anti-social behavior - all the things residents can't sleep from at night - we brought that down by 30 percent.",
        "How'd you do that?",
        "Yeah.",
        "So there were three steps.",
        "The first one, we looked at the public space - how is lighting set up?",
        "How can we make sure that people feel more safe because the lighting is better?",
        "We also looked at, are there a lot of obstacles in the public space?",
        "Like in Amsterdam, as you have been here, you know that there's a lot of bicycles.",
        "So we transformed this district into a pedestrian area instead of having all these different forms of mobility crossing each other.",
        "The second step was installment of square hosts.",
        "Like stewards - they patrol the streets every Friday and Saturday night during peak hours of nightlife.",
        "They are seen as a non-aggressive intermediate, so they try to de-escalate the situation when there's a problem.",
        "They even give advice - what music is played in what nightclub to visitors that visit the area.",
        "And the third step we did was the instalment of a really simple, actually, web app where city residents could report their complaint.",
        "And the complaint would go directly to the first community officer, which is in the neighborhood - so who could really efficiently deal with these forms of nuisance.",
        "When do you sleep?",
        "I sleep normal hours..."

        "And that's what we did.",
        "I've heard a lawyer for the mothers say there were other steps that CPS could have taken.",
        "For instance, you could have negotiated the placement of a dozen or two dozen investigators on the ranch, rather than simply shutting it down and removing the children from their parents.",
        "Why not a halfway step like that?",
        "Actually, that is what happened.",
        "We gained access to the ranch and had about a dozen investigators there, and what we found were several pregnant young girls and young girls who had children already, and evidence that they have been the wives of much older men, and that we saw in our interviews, a clear pattern.",
        "The girls were being groomed from a very young age to become the brides of middle-aged men and have their children.",

        "That is correct.",
