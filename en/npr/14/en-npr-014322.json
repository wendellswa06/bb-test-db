        "Shawn, I've read a lot of reports that seem to indicate like a record turnout expected on Tuesday, like less than half of the folks in Wisconsin voted in 2010, but maybe 70 percent may show up on Tuesday.",
        "I've also seen the polls pretty narrow, even though Scott Walker has had the most money, spent the most money, and Democrats are - finally seem to be advertising on TV.",

        "Yeah, I mean, in terms of the fundraising numbers, it's not like what you saw last summer in our state Senate recalls, where there really was a pretty even divide in the fundraising gap between Democrats and union supporters, Republicans and business groups.",

        "They may be regretting it.",
        "If they are, you're not hearing those discussions.",
        "I think that if Governor Walker comes out on top on June 5th, that will be among the discussions you hear.",
        "But as I say, everybody's focused on - among Democrats - focused on Tom Barrett right now.",
        "You know, some of the people who worked for his main Democratic challenger in the primary, Kathleen Falk, have now shifted over to the Barrett campaign.",
        "And so you're not hearing those discussions publicly, but, you know, certainly if this was a shortened campaign season, we had basically one month between the primary and the general election, very shortened.",
        "And in the month prior to that, you had union-funded groups spending a few million dollars on behalf of the candidate that lost the Democratic primary."
