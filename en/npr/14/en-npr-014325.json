        "You know, it's blatantly clear that these cases are unfair.",

        "That's fair.",
        "Others would say it's unfair because some families can't afford it.",

        "Why do you think people had not, until now, been talking about the kind of inherent unfairness of some of these common practices?",

        "Yeah.",

        "So from where you sit at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, do you think there is a conversation among the people who run these institutes, these elite bastions of higher education that might actually change things in the long run?",
        "Well, I don't know that I hear any discussion about, for example, ending the influence of the development office or ending legacy preferences.",
        "I think these policies are, in a way, baked into the system, baked into the financial model, right?",
