        "That's huge, and that's the biggest margin, the biggest gap between any two candidates, let alone Romney in second place.",
        "And of course as we saw in 2008, when Romney was thought to do very well in Iowa, when he lost to Mike Huckabee, his support gradually, quickly diminished in New Hampshire.",
        "And so it is very possible that Newt Gingrich, if he wins Iowa, could win New Hampshire.",

        "Yes, not only - it's not only his job performance, his personal popularity, the latest ABC News-Washington Post poll had him 48 favorable, 49 unfavorable.",
        "The unfavorability of Barack Obama is similar to what Newt Gingrich's is.",
        "Of course Gingrich's positives are like 35 percent compared to the president's 48 percent.",
        "And the president in those polls handily leads Newt Gingrich, but it's a statistical tie, within the margin of error, between the president and Mitt Romney."

        "There's a two-minute Ron Paul Internet out there.",
        "There's two, three, four-minute ads that the candidates are putting out.",
        "And we're certainly going to see more of that in 2012, but these folks now are targeting their ads towards a very, very narrow primary or caucus audience in Iowa.",
        "But when push comes to shove in 2012, we're going to see massive spending on television because they're going to have to simply get more reach and get more reach among people who aren't necessarily, to use a term you like, political junkies.",
        "You know, the other interesting thing about that Mark Block - and sort of a lot of fun to watch the smoking person - there's going to be such a huge amount of advertising this cycle from such a huge amount of sources that the challenge for these candidates and groups, even if they have a lot of money, is to get their message to shine through.",
        "So quality and content is going to be even more important, and how do you somehow break through and get attention, and how does your ad attract free media."
