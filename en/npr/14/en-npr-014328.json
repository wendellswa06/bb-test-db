        "I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a Christian, but you don't need to be in the pew every Sunday to know that there's something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military, but our kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school.",
        "As president, I'll end Obama's war on religion.",
        "And he's addressing the president of the United States, but not ashamed to be a Christian - is this a veiled attack on Mitt Romney's Mormonism, do you think?",
        "You know, interesting, I don't know.",
        "And again, we're - you know, it's a Republican primary electorate.",
        "It's in Iowa, where it's going to be a fairly small number of places, and he thinks that this message can carve out support from a particular segment.",
        "So it's broadcast television, but it's highly targeted towards what are going to be relatively few caucus-goers.",
        "Ken?",
        "Ken, also, do you think perhaps part of the reason why it's such a late start and why they're not putting so much money into ads is that most of the candidates have been relying on debates to make their case?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "It's been - debates and drama have churned up news cycle after news cycle this fall.",
        "So I think we've had - I've lost count - 14 or 15 Republican debates, and there's always a little bit of news coverage the day before the debate and a little bit of news coverage the day of the debate and then a little bit of new coverage after the debate.",
        "That's churning up a lot of news cycles.",
        "And then we've had some drama with various candidates and campaigns that's also churning up news cycle, and it's made it, you know, less necessary for campaigns to go up on the air."

        "It's also the case, and it was really only the Perry campaign and the Romney campaign that would have had the serious resources to go up on the air, and you know, the Perry campaign went up, and the Romney campaign initially, either because of debates and drama or because they felt the Perry message wasn't getting through, didn't feel they needed to respond.",
        "Besides, he says, Baidu has its own code of ethics, which he describes as follows.",
        "So when those big players were - what was going to be the biggest player was sitting on the sideline, it was going to make it a - not a particularly heavy fall season or Christmas season for folks who own TV stations in Iowa and New Hampshire.",
        "But we know that President Obama and the Democrats are talking about perhaps a billion dollar campaign on his re-election behalf.",
        "Republicans are going to have to come up with a lot of money to come close to matching that.",
        "And they will.",
        "So the relative paucity of advertising that we've seen here in 2011 in Iowa and New Hampshire says absolutely nothing about what's going to be just a massive television advertising air war in 2012, not only by the candidates, not only by the parties, but by what's going to be a huge proliferation of outside groups as well.",
        "And some of those ads are up, not necessarily in the presidential race but in some of the senatorial contests.",

        "These groups, this kind of money is going to be immensely powerful, not just in the primaries, and we're just beginning to see it, but for the next year.",
        "Sure, these groups are going to be the big story of 2012 - how much they spend, where they spend it, and how their message is going to be coordinated in tune with the candidates who they're spending - whose spending is on their behalf.",
        "It really, really is the big story."
