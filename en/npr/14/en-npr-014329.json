        "Yeah.",

        "And it was the first spot of that campaign, which was also unusual for a presidential candidate to start a presidential campaign with negatives instead of the kind of soft positives that campaigns like to use first.",
        "Given the outcome of that race, did people draw conclusions about the usefulness of negative advertising?",
        "Well, I think they did.",

        "Not only OK, but advantageous to characterize your opponent before he had a chance to do it himself.",
