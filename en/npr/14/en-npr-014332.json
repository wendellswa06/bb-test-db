        "That's hot.",
        "And the temperature's rising.",
        "It is hot.",
        "And so imagine you're sitting in that degree temperature, and you turn on the tap, and all you get is salty water, and then the electricity goes out.",
        "And they've been dealing with this for 15 years since the U.S.",
        "invaded Iraq and promised them better lives, and they just haven't got it.",
        "So they've been demonstrating.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)",
        "(Chanting in foreign language, clapping).",
        "At this particular one, which is outside government offices in Basra, they're calling for the downfall of the Iraqi government.",
        "Now, that's something you hear a lot, but these protests are so widespread, they're a little bit different.",
        "One of the demonstrators, Haider al-Halfi (ph), who describes himself just as citizen, lists the reasons that they're out there.",
        "Now, he's saying that employment has increased; there are no public services.",
        "He said they want what the rest of Iraq has.",
        "And another demonstrator says they want dignity.",
        "And when you're talking about young men, what they mean by dignity a lot of times and in this case is they want jobs.",
        "And so unemployment has only been increasing.",
        "And God, I mean, hot weather is one time when it just raises all the sort of anxiety and tensions that you're already feeling.",
        "Can I just ask you about the location of this?",
        "You mentioned Basra.",
        "It's the second-biggest city in Iraq.",
        "The oil industry is there, and it's also really close to Iran, right?",
        "So are all those things factors?"

        "They absolutely are.",
        "In fact, you can stand on the waterfront in Basra and look across the bridge, and there is Iran.",
        "And Iran has always been a factor.",
        "Iran and Iraq, of course, fought a very bitter eight-year-long war in the '80s.",
        "But after the toppling of Saddam and particularly in the last four years, when Iran backed militias to come and fight ISIS, they've had increasing influence in Iraq.",
        "So the interesting thing about these protests is that a lot of these protesters were saying they wanted Iran out.",
        "They wanted all political parties out, but a lot of them are Iranian-backed.",
        "So they were criticizing Iran, which is something you don't see a lot of, and also criticizing foreigners.",
        "But part of the protest, too, because it's geared towards the lack of electricity, is Iran had been supplying Iraq with electricity, and it has cut that off in a dispute over payments.",
        "Oh, I see.",
        "So Iran - one reason that maybe they're not getting the power.",
        "What has the Iraqi government's response to this been?",
        "Because there was just an election, and things have not been settled there, so this is a weak government dealing with this, right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah - very tricky there.",
        "So Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, whom the U.S.",
        "backs, has sent troops, soldiers, counterterrorism forces.",
        "They're trying to protect oil installations and government buildings.",
        "In fact, there have been people wounded and several reported killed during these demonstrations across the south.",
        "He's also promised money, but that's the tricky thing.",
        "Every politician has promised money to the south, and they haven't delivered.",
        "And as for the elections, they were held in May.",
        "There were widespread allegations of fraud.",
        "They're doing a ballot recount, but still no government, still no word when it will happen, no word when the protests will stop.",
        "Talking to NPR's Jane Arraf.",
        "She's in Amman, Jordan, monitoring those protests in Iraq.",
        "Jane, thanks a lot.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Police in the U.S.",
        "have been using facial recognition software for years, usually after a suspect is caught on camera during a crime.",
        "Now real-time facial recognition is on the horizon.",

        "If they're connected to the right database, they could also guess your name.",
        "Terry Hartmann is at the booth for a German company called Cognitec.",
        "And what's new, he says, is how good these systems are getting at recognizing faces in real-world conditions.",
        "You can see all of these matches are different poses.",
        "The people aren't facing the camera straight on.",
        "You've got people with glasses.",
        "You've got the lady looking down.",
        "She's matched looking in a different direction.",
        "Link that to a national photo database, and it's pretty much the end of anonymity in public places.",
        "That's clearly the appeal in autocratic societies like China.",
        "But these systems are also being pitched to Western governments.",
        "Police in the United Kingdom are now scanning crowds for known troublemakers or wanted criminals.",
        "And the same tech is being offered to American police, says Clare Garvie.",
        "She tracks this issue for the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law.",
        "Every major company that sells to law enforcement in the U.S.",
        "advertises the ability to do real time.",
        "And we've seen a fair amount of interest on the part of law enforcement in purchasing these systems."

        "American police aren't buying the real-time systems yet, but Garvie says a few departments have requested funding to try them out.",
        "If police are hesitant, it's because the systems are pricey, and there's also the risk of a public backlash.",

        "As businesses recognize you coming into stores and coffee shops, at what point do our expectations fall to the point that the extension of the government into the area becomes less problematic?",

        "One sticking point, Hutchinson says, is that American cities often don't have enough of the kind of high-def digital security cameras that you need for facial recognition.",

        "But it won't stop there.",
        "I think the second step is obviously they're going to look at ways to implement facial recognition against known or suspected terrorists or people who are wanted.",
        "That'll be the obvious next step.",
        "And it is a pretty simple leap.",
        "The question is, which law enforcement agency will be the first to take that leap?",
        "Hutchinson predicts it'll likely be a deep-pocketed federal department such as Customs and Border Protection, which is already testing facial recognition at passport control in airports.",

        "And, if we have such a telescope, how do we find it?",
        "So the easiest way to find it is to look for the Big Dipper, head to the last two stars on the handle of the Big Dipper, and make an equilateral triangle out of those two stars - with a point heading north.",
