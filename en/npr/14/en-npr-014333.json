        "That's the incredible part.",
        "This supernova will reach peak brightness next Thursday, September 8th.",
        "And will be visible in small telescopes for the next year.",
        "And then by then, you'll start to need about a one meter telescope - professional class telescope - to follow it up.",
        "But then even the Hubble space telescope will still be able to view it for two to three more years after that.",
        "So this is one that's going to be studied for many, many years."
