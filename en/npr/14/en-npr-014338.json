        "Yeah.",

        "And one of the things that is interesting is - and I can see this down the line - is the real debate on whose property it is, in the sense that often these stories that are interesting enough to make it to the big or small screen usually involve the human element.",
        "And that means someone else's story that you are just writing about.",
