        "The patrol talked to the pilots and they'd push them out of audible range so that the Taliban would think they had left.",
        "The idea was to initiate a fight, have the Taliban attack, then they would call back the helicopters and then to kill the gunmen.",
        "But before they could sort of, you know, spring this trap, some of the new soldiers, who were pretty unaccustomed and, you know, they weren't acclimated to the heat and humidity, started passing out on the field.",
        "And it just became a prettytense and chaotic scene.",
        "They had to call in medevac birds to get them out of there.",
        "I mean, it's just beautiful.",
        "Wow.",
        "You know, I was in the compound at that time.",
        "I did not go out on the small patrol when they fought this running gunfight.",
        "There were two 82nd Airborne paratroopers and 12 of the new soldiers who went on this patrol.",

        "And I was - honestly, I was kind of wary of going out with the new soldiers.",
        "I had been out with the 82nd paratroopers who were incredibly proficient at their job.",
        "But I wanted to see how the first one unfolded before I went out with the small patrol throughout the day.",
        "That ended up being the only patrol that went out.",
        "They came back.",
        "And then they had to bring in more medevac birds for some people in the compound who passed out.",
        "They had to bring in resupplies of medical IV fluids and more ammunition.",
        "So the fight continued through the day because every time the birds came in and landed in a field behind the compound, they would shoot at the helicopters.",
        "And so the paratroopers would go out there to secure the landing zone, they'd trade fire with them.",

        "You know, we got I think it was a couple of months after we were there, we were in the process of doing the chains of commands with the outgoing unit.",
        "And so we were two brigades strong and they still took a chance and hit us at the ECP, and it was just crazy."

        "And I thought, you know, so what's wrong with these people, you know, that they would try to attack with that many, you know, different soldiers right there, you know?",
        "But that's how it was.",
        "And, you know, every now and then, on a regular, every morning, you'd get waken up to a VBIED going off outside of the wire, really close to the base.",
        "A lot of them made the news before we even, you know, had a chance to contact families and tell them we're all right, you know?",
        "It was like, holy cow.",

        "Because when we first got there, every time you rolled out the gate, you know, it's a lot of pressure, a lot of stress, a lot of tension, you know?",
        "And you never know what's going to happen.",
        "And then towards the end, things died down a lot.",

        "I think they get used to, you know, different units being there.",
        "But, you know, one of the things I also noticed is when we did a change of command with the unit that we replaced, it was crazy, like, they knew newbies were coming and they were ready for it.",
        "That's seemed to be the case - just let me ask Brian Mockenhaupt.",

        "And, yeah, it stands out when new soldiers come in.",
        "So they know when a new unit comes in.",
        "That's one of the most dangerous times is during those transitions because in those early weeks when the new troops don't know the area, they're not familiar with the local leaders, with the geography and all that kind of stuff, that's the most dangerous time for them.",
        "And it's also a time that the enemy is watching.",
        "And, you know, it's quite likely that they're going to hit them hard at that time.",
        "Reynold, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And Brian Mockenhaupt, there was a very tense scene at the end of that patrol where in an after action report, the sergeants from the 82nd Airborne Platoon were very critical and also their attitude was difficult for the men of 101st to accept.",
        "You know, these guys had had a long tour and that's when you could really see the mental strain.",
        "And they felt that this new unit's lack of preparedness had really endangered some of their men when they were so close to the end.",
        "And in this after action review, one of the soldiers in particular, Chris Gerhart, was a squad leader who was basically in charge out in the ground that day, he had some good comments for these new soldiers about things that they could improve on.",
        "But he also said, you know, I guess I'm used to being out there with more hard-charging guys.",
        "You know, and he is, by nature, he's a kind of abrasive, very aggressive soldier."
