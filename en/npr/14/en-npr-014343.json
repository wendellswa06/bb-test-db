        "My largest regret from my freshman year kind goes along the same lines with those you're just talking about, was not getting involved in a recreational club.",

        "But in a funny way, I think it's what got me started on this path to just seeing myself as somebody who could one day run a business.",
        "Because the little things that you do, to run a math club - where you have to coordinate a lot of people, you have to, you know, figure out what's going to be successful, you know, or would a lot of people like to see a lecture on the math of a Rubik's Cube or would they prefer to see something about the topology?",
        "And when you start thinking about it - what I was learning about was marketing, coordination, you know, leadership, being able to delegate tasks and stuff.",
