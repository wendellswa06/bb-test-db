        "Our research shows that you really can't hit the ball any farther with a maple bat than you can with an ash bat, but I think what players like about the maple bat is that they can take that out in the batting practice and they can put a hundred swings on that, and then the surface of the wood will stay nice and hard, and they can then use that in the game.",
        "Where, with ash, maybe over 100, 200 hits in batting practice, you might see the surface start to flake a little bit and the growth between the grains start to sheer off a little bit.",

        "There could be one slight performance advantage with maple, and it's somewhat counterintuitive, but maple tends to be a little heavier than ash, which not all people like.",
        "But it turns out that when you're trying to determine how far a ball can be hit, having a heavier bat can be a slight advantage.",

        "There's a variety of reasons, and I don't know that there's just one.",
        "First of all, because maple is slightly heavier.",
        "When you make a maple bat, you're looking for a wood that's going to be lighter weight, and the strength of the wood is proportional to its weight.",
        "So, when you select a lighter wood, then you also get a wood of lower strength.",
        "Then, people will also do things to the geometry of the wood.",
        "If you can make your - the handle or the taper region of the bat slightly smaller in diameter, you can save weight to there as well.",
        "That also weakens the bat.",
        "Another thing people will do is they will dry the wood out, and some of these aggressive drying processes can actually result in a permanent weight loss in the bat, but that tends to make the bat more brittle or lower its toughness.",
