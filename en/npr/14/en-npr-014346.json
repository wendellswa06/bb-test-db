        "Yes.",
        "Why do you - why do we think - Lloyd said, possibly, that we have thinner handles on the bats and then there's different moisture content in the maple that causes - there's two reasons why they splinter more than ash.",
        "And it's the structure of the grains, too.",
        "It's a closed grain wood as opposed to open grain wood.",
        "You can see the grains on an ash bat a lot clearer when you're grading that piece of wood than you can on a maple bat.",
        "But I agree with what he said about the moisture content, and we've always attempted to keep our moisture not anywhere below eight percent or something like that.",
        "We've also tried to keep our drying process, where we - we have a longer drying process.",
        "There's a lower temperature to try not to pull the moisture out of the wood really quickly.",
        "So, we've done some things to try to help with the strength of the wood for maple.",
        "Mm-hm.",
        "Grain orientation is important.",
        "And the thing that makes maple a good wood for durability, as far as the flaking of the barrel region is concerned, also makes it problematic for the strength of the bat in bending, because you - it's difficult to identify the grain direction in maple, at least in comparison to ash.",
        "It's also difficult to show that those grains are aligned with the length of the bat which increases its strength.",
        "Because we have - speaking about that, we have heard people comment on this, saying that an ash bat will bend a little bit more when it's stressed - when it hits the ball, whereas an ash bat doesn't so it has to break.",
        "Is there any truth to that?",
        "I mean, a maple bat will - a maple bat will resist the bending.",
        "Right.",
        "There - I guess the - from my perspective, the primary truth to that would be in the grain orientation, that if you have - and what we're - we have to recognize we're talking about natural materials, so you can't always guarantee that every bat is going to have the same type of grain or grain orientation.",
        "But to the extent that maple is more difficult to identify grain orientation, you're more likely to have a bat with poorly oriented grain, and when that grain is not oriented parallel to the length of the bat, it's more likely to break in a brittle fashion.",
        "Mm-hm.",
        "We talked to a scientist who was on a former Major League baseball committee a few years ago when they first started looking into this problem.",
        "And he said that the recommendation from that committee was to make the handles thicker and that would solve the problem.",
        "We had thicker handles.",
        "We know the Major League players coming up to the ranks want thinner and thinner handles.",
        "If we make them thicker, would that solve it, Brian?",
        "That would go some of the way, yes.",
        "I think you would see less of it.",
        "I don't think it would eliminate it completely.",
        "But the handle in baseball these days are - I think they're all under an inch in diameter.",
        "The other thing you could do would be to, I mean, not have the barrel be as large as some of these are, to limit it to maybe two and a half inches in diameter rather than two and five-eighths.",
        "That would help as well.",
        "And I think - but I think the moisture content, keeping it - not letting that moisture go below eight percent would also be a factor in helping out the - get that from breaking as often as it does.",
        "But there's really nothing you can do to keep it eliminated completely.",
        "I mean, you're still going to have that breakage in maple and, you know, in ash, just the way, you know, - just because it's a piece of wood.",
        "Well, keep in mind that this problem is perhaps more significant with the introduction of maple bats, but injuries of this type did occur when ash bats dominated the market.",
        "So when you talk about doing things like increasing moisture content or increasing your handle diameter, that may contribute to diminishing the injury rate, but it's not as if you're making it safe or unsafe."

        "I guess.",
        "But when we see these bats breaking like spears, some of the times they're pointing into the turf.",
        "You know, they're stuck in the - I don't remember ever seeing those in the old ash bat days.",
        "They look much more dangerous when they're flying through the air.",
        "Well, part of that is because with the introduction of the maple bat, you've got a greater proportion of bats failing.",
        "So you have a larger sample to select from or to observe.",
        "You hear that, Brian?",
        "I would agree with that, yes.",
        "I mean, when you're - when you have as much maple as in the Major League baseball right now, you're going to see a lot more than what it was even three and four years ago, when maple was maybe only 20 or 25 percent.",
        "These are the best dates.",
        "What was the second part of it?",
        "So, I remember there was a - I remember in spring training, there was a baseball player standing on third base who got 18 stitches from a bat that hit him in the arm.",

        "And only - I've been watching baseball 50 years.",
        "So I haven't seen everything.",

        "It's not just that maple is brittle, but you've got the grain orientation, you've got the weight issue.",
        "There's a number of things that are coming together to cause the problem and produce this greater number of bat failures that we're having than we've seen in the past.",
