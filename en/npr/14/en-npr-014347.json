        "Well, you can get ash from, you know, in New England states, you can get it down south, but the Pennsylvania ash just has that right mixture of flexibility, hardness, density that makes it a good bat.",
        "Our company purchased the sawmills in Pennsylvania back in the mid-'50s and has really brought in all of their ash from that area ever since, and it just turns out to be the best type of ash for baseball bats.",
        "What is there a bat where the trees grow, the tree's home that affects the composition of the wood?",
        "I think it's just the mixture of the soil and the terrain.",
        "We are in a very mountainous area here in northern Pennsylvania and southern New York that allows for better growing.",
        "You get bigger trees, and obviously, you need a lot of good growth, wide growth, because the player wants to see the growth rings and they want to see them to be evenly grown - even growth and they want width between the growth rings.",
        "And we just found that this area of the country is the best for that.",

        "When I get the game-used bat, both maple and ash, they're shaved down, the maple more so than the ash, so that the barrel is huge, but it snaps right at the handle.",
        "And so, you're wondering whether the shaving does something extra to make it...",
        "Yeah.",
        "Because they don't shave the ash in the same way they shave the maples.",
        "Interesting.",
        "Brian, Lloyd, any comment?",
        "They're doing that to save weight on the bat.",
        "So, you're doing that to have a lighter bat so it's easier to swing but the cost is going to be that the bat's going to tend to break easier when you hit it with the ball.",
        "I would just comment that, you know, if it's being shaved down it must be being shaved down by the player because if a player orders a specific model and, you know, and that calls for the diameter of the handle to be, you know, 15-16th and that's what the bat will go out as.",
        "If there's the same model on the bat and the handle of the maple looks smaller, it would be shaved down by the player itself."

        "I'm just scanning over the properties of elm.",

        "So, you may find that you have a failure problem for the impact that a bat has.",

        "Cricket bats are made out of willow, an English willow.",
        "Would that be something we'd look into?",
        "Well, there you have a very different mechanism.",
        "Cricket bats, it is a very lightweight wood, but the structure of the bat is very different and because of its geometry it's allowed to hold up .",
        "Now, there's also something else about the cricket bat.",
        "The handle is made of cane.",
        "So the blade and the handle are two different materials.",
        "And that's something that Major League Baseball has never allowed.",
        "It's always had to be a one solid-wood bat.",
        "Well - so, an increase in the handle diameter would be one thing.",
        "Now, that's a very dramatic suggestion, because so far, geometry has been the one thing that players could work with.",
        "But I would say there's other things that Major League Baseball could do that they haven't done that would - so the concern is, is that if you mess around with the design of the bat that you're somehow going to be changing the performance of the bat.",
        "And we've been able to show that if your bat is solid wood, the performance really is not going to change much by your species.",
        "So, you could do different things.",
        "You could laminate your bat, kind of like the way plywood is made, and that could increase the strength.",
        "You could reinforce the bat.",
        "You could put a composite on the outside of the bat.",
        "In fact, some people sell bats like that to a minor league teams, and they significantly increase the durability of the bat.",
        "And then, when the bat does break, it's even safer than an ash bat, because that reinforcement is able to keep the bat together after it cracks.",
        "Aren't you going to have the statistics problem then?",
        "You know, baseball lives by statistics?",
        "Won't you have to put an asterisk of the era of the new baseball bat or something?",
        "Well, that would - that's certainly the concern of why they haven't gone to other kinds of bats.",
        "But we've been able to test these bats in the laboratory under very strict conditions, and shown that there really is no difference in performance.",
        "The issue is what's going on in the barrel of the bat.",
        "And as long as that barrel is solid wood, whether that is laminated or reinforced in the handle, or thick or a skinny handle, those things really don't affect the performance of the bat."

        "They're really into the history of the game, and it's always been a one solid piece of wood.",
        "And I would think, if they're going to stay with the maple bat - and again, this is not only a management issue.",
        "It's a union issue.",
        "This has to be bargained to change any of the - either the specifications of the bat or the species of the wood.",
        "I would think they're going to go to some kind of a change in the specification so to - and just to limit - more limit the amount of times that these bats break, you know, but as opposed to banning the species altogether.",
        "There could be one other thing that the Major League Baseball could do.",
        "I think that the most realistic thing would be increasing the handle diameter.",
        "But they could require that particular wood species or wood profiles be approved, and that they be given some type of testing protocol to show how they would break, and then determine whether that mode of failure would be safe in play.",
        "We're talking about the physics of baseball bats this hour in Talk of the Nation: Science Friday from NPR News.",
        "So, when you say, statistics, does that include - mean the diameter of the bat handle?",

        "That would be one thing.",
        "But even so, you might take - or if you were to put this to a testing protocol, you - one thing would be the geometry, what is the diameter of the handle or the shape of the taper.",

        "Right.",
        "So if they break, people aren't hurt.",
        "And you could then study the way they break, and whether that's safe in a game.",
        "Well, as we - we've run out of time.",
        "But I want to just have the take home - one of the take-home messages that I've learned today is that maple does not work.",
        "I mean, there's no better a wood in a baseball bat than ash for hitting a baseball.",
        "It's all about, if I hear you correctly, the durability of the bat."
