        "And then in the end, he signed it anyway.",
        "As we just heard from Tamara Keith, the president said he was not happy about what was in the bill.",
        "He seemed to distance himself from much of what was in it.",
        "David, why is the president distancing himself from a bill that passed so overwhelmingly in Congress?",
        "Well, for the stated reasons.",
        "It doesn't give him his wall funding and because he heard something bad on Fox News.",
        "There's not a lot of thought that goes into a lot of these tweets.",

        "It was an irrational act.",
        "And again, I think it just shows how responsive Trump is to the moment, to what's said on television and how little he has really thought through almost any of his positions.",
        "And E.J., I mean, he did say - you heard in Tamara Keith's piece that he will never again sign a bill like this.",
        "He is not going to do it again.",
        "He probably will do it again, right?",
        "Ringer that's it.",
        "Try this one, to join the army, say.",
