        "It is in fact the result of literally hundreds of hours of negotiation with the Department of Justice and the campaign and other public health groups arguing that it's important that the statements be stark, be accurate and be detailed enough to have an impact when they're heard."

        "As a - an advertising design, this is a very weak one.",
