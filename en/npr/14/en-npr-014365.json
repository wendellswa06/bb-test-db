        "He continued fundraising and working for progressive causes and was a regular guest on MSNBC and other cable channels.",
        "In November, he easily won in a newly-drawn district that's 40 percent Hispanic.",
        "Grayson says that's because his progressive views appeal to his Latino constituents.",
        "They have social needs that generally mean that they ally themselves with progressive forces and, in many cases, represent and embody those progressive forces.",

        "Before entering politics, he made millions as the head of a telecommunications company and as an attorney who prosecuted contract fraud cases against defense contractors.",
        "Grayson says the reason he's developed a national following is, in his words: I just say what others are thinking.",
        "Asked, for example, about the prospects that the House might pass gun control legislation in the next session, he's skeptical.",
        "I think many Republican members of Congress are afraid that if they supported anything resembling reasonable gun control, they would lose the next primary, and the NRA would see to it they lost the next primary.",
        "It's those kinds of unvarnished comments that, in his first term, made Grayson a hero to many liberal Democrats and a villain to many conservative Republicans.",
        "In 2008, he won in a traditionally Republican district in the Democratic wave that elected President Obama.",
        "Two years later, he lost his bid for reelection by a wide margin.",
        "David Wasserman, an analyst with Cook Political Report, says in this year's successful election bid, Grayson's campaign seemed to tone down his activist image.",
        "Is there a chance he's a more civil member over the next two years?",
        "I think only time will tell.",
        "But there are some indications that he's a wiser person for having won and lost before.",
        "As for toning down his comments once he returns to Washington, Grayson says: Don't count on it.",
        "For example, here's what he had to say when I asked him if he thought Republicans could successfully appeal to Hispanic voters."

        "That's interesting.",
        "I never really thought of it that way.",

        "Grayson says the main way in which this term will be different from his first stint in Congress is that he's now in a safe district.",
        "He beat his opponent by 25 points - which means he's likely to be there for some time to come."
