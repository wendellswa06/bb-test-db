        "Like many women, Mathis had heard through friends about eating a little placenta every day in the weeks after giving birth.",
        "The placenta, sometimes called the afterbirth, is typically dehydrated, ground up, and put into edible capsules.",
        "Many midwives and doulas believe that because the placenta grows along with the fetus, it contains hormones and nutrients that can help a woman recover from childbirth.",
        "Some say it helps women breastfeed or can prevent postpartum depression.",
        "Mathis took the capsules for six weeks.",
        "It's hard for me to know what the effects were because I don't have anything to compare it to.",
        "But, I mean, I had great success breastfeeding, I had no problems with emotional instability.",
        "I definitely feel that it helped me.",
        "Mathis says the hardest part was just getting her placenta in the first place.",
        "Texas classifies the placenta as medical waste.",
        "And hospitals have liability concerns because placentas could carry infectious disease.",
        "But Mathis was determined to get it.",
        "Just after giving birth, she and her husband waited until nobody was looking.",
        "And we got it and put it in a cooler and threw it in a backpack.",
        "And my husband, you know, handed it off to the placenta handler in the lobby of the hospital.",
        "And that's not ideal, you know?",
        "And in my opinion, that's not acceptable.",
        "Mathis talked about it with her state representative, Dallas Republican Kenneth Sheets.",
        "Well, it seemed like an issue of freedom and liberty and just a basic right, so we decided that we'd take it on.",
        "It comes down to 50 percent in the 1970s and then it drops down even further in sort of the mid '80s under Ronald Reagan to 28 percent.",
        "Those candidates were Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Texas Governor Rick Perry and former Senator Rick Santorum.",
        "Each has been courting the Iowa GOP's large contingent of evangelicals and Christian conservatives.",

        "And, Elise, first tell us how did this come about?",
        "Where did this video come from?",
        "Well, there was a documentary filmmaker named Chris Barrett, who had just gotten some Google Glasses and he took them out on a stroll to test them out.",
        "Glass covers a users eye and with a small screen that can display email, text messages, even show you the weather.",
        "It also shoots pictures and video.",
        "Barrett said he filmed some fireworks at first and then, on the boardwalk after, he came up on the scuffle.",

        "Eventually, police show up and arrest the scrappers.",
        "And you can see the whole scene as filmed by Mr. Barrett.",
        "So what's the significance of this?",
        "I mean, there are tons and tons of videos of fights online.",
        "Sure, but since Google Glass is only available to a small batch of test users, we believe this is the first arrest caught on the Google Glass camera.",
        "Glass can do many things and video is one of them.",
        "And Google Glasses look a lot like regular eyeglasses if you aren't really paying attention.",
        "So how is this any different than what you could get by using a cell phone camera?",
        "It isn't.",
        "The difference is that the folks in the scene were captured without the knowledge that they were being filmed, essentially.",
        "Now, Barrett said that had he been using a Smartphone to film, he would have gotten beaten up because somebody probably would have noticed he was shooting.",
        "So, citizen journalism is certainly being made easier, which is exciting.",
        "But some fear citizen snooping is made easier, too."
