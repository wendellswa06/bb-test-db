        "Sheets wrote the new law that allows women to keep the placenta if they sign a waiver and don't test positive for infectious disease.",

        "The first were Hawaii and then Oregon.",
        "And yet, medical experts say there's no scientific evidence behind all the health claims.",
        "Anecdotally, some women say the placenta helped them, but experts say it's probably just a placebo effect.",
        "We don't have any studies on this.",
        "That's Dr. Catherine Spong, deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.",
        "Spong is much more interested in how the placenta functions during pregnancy, not after.",
        "The placenta is really the lifeline.",
        "It serves as the baby's lungs, as the baby's kidney, it has functions of the liver, of the GI tract.",
        "And interestingly, it also has immune functions and endocrine functions.",
        "Spong says her institute will spend $44 million dollars on placenta research over the next few years.",
        "Spong didn't feel comfortable offering an opinion on moms who eat placenta, simply reiterating that science doesn't support it.",
        "But Mark Kristal does have an opinion.",
        "Kristal is a behavioral neuroscientist with the State University of New York at Buffalo.",
        "He's been studying placenta-eating in mammals for 43 years.",
        "The overwhelming majority of mammalian placental mothers ingest after birth.",
        "In fact, many women point to this as evidence that humans should do it, too.",
        "But Kristal says not so fast.",
        "The reason many mammals do it is because there's a chemical substance in amniotic fluid and placenta that provides pain relief during birth.",
        "Kristal discovered it.",
        "It boosts the effectiveness specifically of opiate painkillers.",
        "So wouldn't this work in humans?",
        "Kristal says the chemical is there in human placenta, but it's fragile.",
        "Cooking and encapsulating placenta would actually destroy it.",
        "Kristal says eating it raw isn't a good idea either.",
        "Since placentas are also filters, there may be waste products in our placenta that are harmful or toxic.",
        "In fact, he believes humans have evolved away from eating placenta."

        "Most mammals that eat placenta give birth unassisted - but not humans.",
        "The advantage of socially-assisted birth is not only to help the mother, but it's also to pass information about childbirth from older, more experienced women to younger, less experienced women who might be helping.",

        "I think that they have backed down from that statement, and I think you should refer to the State Department for that answer.",
        "Yeah.",

        "And have they explained why?",
        "Primarily because we're a security risk to our own child.",
        "That's pretty much the bottom line.",
        "In other words, if they divulge things further, that it could further jeopardize Austin's case.",
        "Well, I think in more specifically that we are not in a position to be trusted with information, which, you know, for me, is just maddening - that I was barely competent enough to raise an excellent scholar and an eagle scout and a captain in the Marine Corps and an award-winning journalist, but I can't really be counted on to keep him safe now."
