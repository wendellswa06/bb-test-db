        "We have very good interest from our partners and the different companies there for our bid round.",
        "But Amr Adly, of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, says it's important to remember that most of the 148 standing agreements between Egypt and the energy companies were negotiated before the revolution, under the Mubarak regime",
        "And the regime itself was not accountable.",
        "The parliament itself was not legitimate in the sense that it was not really like fairly elected.",
        "And the parliament was not really supervising - it didn't have any power, really, like there's a real executive.",
        "And when nobody is following up how the officials are behaving, and the officials are not really accountable to anyone, then you may end up with the most absurd of all terms.",
        "Some terms that are now in question are part of the 2010 deal with BP for the extraction of deepwater Mediterranean gas.",
        "While many details of the deal have not been made public, it has many critics, says business journalist Nadine Marroushi.",
        "And a lot of people really are saying that the deal that was signed is financially not favorable.",
        "BP officials would not comment on the record about the 2010 deal.",
        "But Adel Said, of the State Petroleum Company, says it is fair and that the new era of hard-to-get energy requires new models of compensation.",
        "You know, now we have an exploration in ultra-deep water.",
        "And the investment is very, very high - it's a huge investment.",
        "So there is a certain type of model of agreements to match with the huge investments in such concessions.",
        "Still, Amr Adly says it's hard to know if the deals are fair because of the widespread lack of transparency in Egypt's energy sector.",
        "He says while the government does publish the official agreements with the international energy companies, many details - like the price of gas and quantities for export - aren't available to the public."

        "Not just the contracts but even like the financial details.",
        "So the whole idea is make things open, get some sunlight in and let's see.",

        "First, his hesitation to release his tax returns and then his acknowledgement last month that he paid a lower tax rate than many middle class families.",
        "Well, Mitt Romney's case offers a window into the changing nature of income and taxes in America.",
        "We're going to compare him with his own father, George Romney, an auto executive and Michigan governor.",
