        "AIG decided to pay the bonuses a year ago to more then 400 employees of it's small financial products division.",
        "This was the same division that created a lot of the complex financial products that later led to the companies meltdown and take over by the federal government.",
        "But AIG spokesman Nick Ashooh says, at the time, the company still thought it could fix the divisions problems.",
        "The fear was that the people who know these contracts and know the systems with financial products would walk out the door and leave AIG with, you know, almost $3 trillion of notional value of derivatives that near to be unwound.",

        "And also what that tells me is that perhaps AIG should go bankrupt, because a bankruptcy judge could, in fact, dissolve those agreements.",
        "But the federal government was worried that letting AIG go bankrupt would set off a chain reaction of losses throughout the financial markets, and so it engineered the bailout last September as a way of keeping the company solvent.",
        "As a result, some 80 percent of AIG is now owned by U.S.",
        "taxpayers who appear to have little choice but to meet the company's financial obligations.",
        "But if contracts can be broken by public anger and political pressure, then AIG may get out of paying the bonuses, after all.",
