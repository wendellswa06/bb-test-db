        "And right now I the - you know, and I hate to say the top three, but really in the top three Edwards is the only candidate that gives those of us who feel we're not listened to a voice.",
        "On the other hand, there are still folks like Paul Martin of Hampton who doubt Edwards' viability.",
        "The only reason I think Barack is along with Edwards for me is that Barack seems to be - has kind of momentum and I would like to see someone who can get in and can be voted in and will be an agent for change and won't polarize the nation like George Bush has and really kind of believe Hillary Clinton will do.",
