        "Hi, Melissa.",
        "Well, we heard mostly from medical professionals who were hired by the defense to do evaluations of Jose Padilla.",
        "And the two professionals was Dr. Angela Hagerty, who is a psychiatrist; also Patricia Zapf, who's a forensic psychologist.",
        "They basically agreed on what their assessment was.",
        "They say that they saw a person who had a lot of anxiety, especially when the time of - topic about his time in the Navy Brig came up.",

        "In some cases he would beg you to change the subject.",
        "And they saw him do this with them, also with his lawyers.",
        "And because of all this, they say that they believe that he actually has post-traumatic stress disorder, related to his time there at the Navy Brig in Charleston, South Carolina.",
        "And because of that, that post-traumatic stress disorder, they believe that he's unable to assist his lawyers in the preparation of his defense.",
        "Okay.",
        "And to - on the government side, who have they presented to challenge that evaluation?",
        "Well, the government has a doctor of their own from the Bureau - Federal Bureau of Prisons who has done his assessment.",
        "His assessment, as we've not really seen it yet - it's not been introduced into court.",
        "We've seen it referred to in some motions.",
        "He says that, basically that Padilla does not have post-traumatic stress disorder.",
        "He said there might be some evidence of personality disorder, but we don't believe that he has anything like a post-traumatic stress disorder."

        "We'll hear from him tomorrow.",
        "But today we had some pretty strenuous cross-examinations by the prosecution, especially of Dr. Hagerty, the psychiatrist.",
        "And they got her to admit that basically on the scale when they went through -with one of these evaluations on the scale, he got a zero - Padilla got a zero on post-traumatic stress disorder, which means that not one question which showed, that registered post-traumatic stress disorder came up positive.",
        "She said that that is often the case with people in this situation.",

        "Well, nobody really knows.",

        "And what they're afraid is if they go into Chapter 11, they'll actually end up falling into Chapter 7, which, of course, is liquidation, which means you just sell off the parts.",
        "The task force knows that there's a real risk here, and they know that this company could end up in bankruptcy.",
        "So what they've done is they've lined up some law firms, investment bankers to help find funding so that the company could continue to operate in bankruptcy.",
        "It's unlikely, it seems, that anyone would just allow the company to fail.",
        "Not only just GM have tens of thousands of workers, but there are all these suppliers, companies that give GM parts.",

        "Not really.",
        "You know, the problem with the dealerships is they have these franchise laws that protect them.",
        "So GM just can't get rid of dealers.",
        "They have to pay them a lot of money.",
        "They are trying to reduce the number of dealers, but that's going to probably happen through attrition because of the recession.",
