        "And they strategized what was the best way to close this up in such a way - before, what they would do is they would rush out and arrest everyone, and anyone connected to the network would scatter.",
        "And they strategically planned to roll this thing up, from the edges in, in such a way that they were able to - it finally culminated in the arrest over the weekend in Canada of the largest group, which was the Toronto cell."
