        "But, it's about time, I'm one person that wants to know how much do they really count for in my population?",
        "Abul Shalla is like a lot of Palestinians, he is ambivalent about Hamas.",
        "He once said, off microphone, that as somebody who's put money into this place, he's scared of a Hamas victory.",
        "If they win a majority in the legislative council, they could block any chance of peace talks.",
        "But at the same time, Abul Shalla is just as fed up as any other Gaza resident with the current government's utter inability to meet its citizen's basic needs, starting with safety.",
        "Abul Shalla's store, called Information Technology Partners is protected by thick, a mesh metal gate that pulls down from above his display window.",

        "Are you worried about a member of your family being kidnapped for money?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It turns out that Abul Shalla was kidnapped a year and a half ago by mistake.",
        "The kidnappers thought he was someone else and he wasn't held for ransom, but he was hit in the face with the butt of a gun, punched several times, thrown into the backseat of his own car and driven blindfolded to a refugee camp in the south of Gaza.",
        "What's strange is that the kidnapper's leader had no fear about letting Abul Shalla know who he was.",
        "The leader came in and said take his blindfold off and he goes to me, please come and sit down, so I came and sat down at this old sort of couch and I actually asked the guy, I said, okay, you know my name, can you please tell me who you are?",
        "And he said, no problem, my name is so and so.",
        "And I had, I was meant to have heard his name before because apparently he's a really famous troublemaker in town who's done this sort of thing so many times before.",
        "The capper to the story is that it seems one member of the kidnapping gang was a policeman.",
        "He drove Abul Shalla home after the kidnapping and as they were chatting, mentioned what he did for a living.",
        "Abul Shalla and his family decided against making any sort of official report of the incident."
