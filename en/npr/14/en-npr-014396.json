        "And as a result, the lenders who have loans that are backed by these homes are snatching away home-equity lines of credit or reducing them, because the home values have dropped and these loans are backed by peoples' homes.",
        "So, one federal regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision, sent out a guidance to their institutions that they regulate to say, hey, guys, you can't just take peoples' home-equity lines of credit without some reason.",
        "There are laws against this, like the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act.",
        "You know, all of these apply to this type of loan.",
        "And if you're going to do that and it is legal, you've got to do it the right way.",
        "So, there are rights.",
        "Consumers have rights with these home-equity lines of credit.",
        "What are they?",
        "Well, for one thing, say, for example, your home value has dropped.",
        "They can't contact you and say, this loan is due in full now.",
        "They have to follow the credit agreement that they have with you.",
        "If, in fact, they've snatched away your line of credit, there has to be a reason behind it.",
        "They've also got to give you notice.",
        "There are procedures that they have to follow.",
        "Now, if, in fact, your home values have dropped, yours in particular and those in your area, they can reduce it or take it away.",
        "If, for example, you have not been keeping the property up, then that could be a reason for them to remove the home-equity line of credit.",
        "If you got it under fraudulent circumstances, like, for example, you hiked your income, they can take it away.",
        "So, you know, interesting.",
        "We read that one bank, National City Bank, began offering its customers cash for closing out their home-equity line of credit, just get out of it altogether.",
        "What's the deal here?",
        "There's a cap on the number of H1-Bs issued every year, and a random lottery to award them.",
        "This means sometimes foreign graduates from top U.S.",
        "universities - places like MIT and UC Berkeley - can't get an H-1B visa.",
        "San Francisco immigration lawyer Gali Gordon recalls how a client of hers repeatedly lost the lottery.",
        "Well, obviously, when banks have home-equity lines of credit on their books, that is a risk to their portfolio, that you may not pay.",
        "And we know, increasingly, consumers or homeowners have been defaulting, not just on their primary mortgage, but also on these lines of credit.",
        "And so, what some institutions are doing, in this case, National, is saying, you know what?",
        "We don't want as much of this risk on our books, so let us give you some money to allow us to take this line of credit away."
