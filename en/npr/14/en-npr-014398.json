        "We sort of monitored him for a couple of months, leaving him on his own, and it got worse and worse with him locking himself out of the house, making keys, not remembering things, and that's when we made the decision that he wanted - he needed to be with us and be safe."

        "The second home health aide was a close friend, and that person was a little too unprofessional, so we didn't like that either.",
        "Our food bill doubled because that person ate whatever they cooked for Dad, and it just was not good financially.",

        "Louise, what about you?",
        "I agree, and I would imagine Andy will agree, too.",
        "It's - people that have written after Nazi Germany and talked about how people on the streets were suspicious of each other - you didn't want to say anything or make eye contact because you didn't know which way they were.",
        "There's a sense of relief when you find someone that agrees with you, a real sort of sense of angst when you find that somebody doesn't.",
        "Because it defines - it's not just how you voted.",
        "It wasn't a single vote or different political parties.",
        "To me, it's about your values and and how you look at the world and how you look at yourself and a kindness and a compassion.",
        "So it's a horrible fracturing, and I think Leon is probably being optimistic in saying, you know, a couple of decades.",
        "It will heal, but it's going to take probably a generation.",
