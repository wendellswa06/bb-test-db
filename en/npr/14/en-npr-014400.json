        "You've got the confluence of two things that have happened over, probably, the last say five to 10 years.",
        "The first would have been the housing boom.",
        "You saw an incredible run-up in prices on many homes.",
        "It afforded many people the opportunity to either get out of homes or cash in on homes that they had equity in in the city, and it also allowed many people who lived in the suburbs to move back into cities by selling the big houses that they own out in the burbs, and being able to afford maybe that more expensive downtown condo, or condo in a more desirable city neighborhood.",
        "The second thing is you - what's happening is that we are at the beginning of an unprecedented transfer of wealth in this country.",
        "The baby boom generation is retiring.",

        "They want to live downtown, they want to live in a neighborhood, they want to be able to walk, they don't want to drive as much anymore.",
        "And so those two things have conspired to move many families who have moved, who are largely white, but not entirely white, who had moved out of the city, who could afford to not be there anymore, to move back in.",

        "Not only do you lose your income each week - your paycheck is gone - but you're not contributing to Social Security.",
        "So someday when you're 80, your Social Security benefit will be less because you're not in the workforce.",
