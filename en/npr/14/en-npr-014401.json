        "You know, I did volunteer to take on the bulk of the work, but it turned out that I basically did everything, and a great amount of resentment arose, which is still to this day, five years after my father's death, exists; we don't speak.",
        "And I just wanted to mention that the person that you're talking to from the family who said she was talking to her daughter, that's so important because we never had that talk.",
        "And I think if we had had that talk before my father had his stroke, maybe we could've weathered this much better than we did.",

        "No, we were incredibly close, and we - no, unless between lawyers, we haven't spoken in five years.",
        "Wow.",
        "And I've heard that from - we had a service that helped us somewhat, and I heard that from the worker, from many of the families that he dealt with, and particularly because that decision, that talk wasn't had beforehand, and you know, they did not lock down who was going to do what, how it was going to take place, et cetera."

        "David Greene, those kind of tensions, you'd like to think that everybody sees their duty and pitches in.",
        "It's not always the case.",
        "You know, it's not, and people have their own reasons for not pitching in.",
        "Sometimes it's a reality.",
        "Sometimes it's just a sort of different view of responsibility.",
        "You know, listening to Bryce, it brings to mind one of the families we're talking to in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the Martin-Hawkins(ph) family.",
        "They are two women who are in their 40s who have joined forces to take care of their 87-year-old grandmother.",
        "She has a trust that was set aside, and so the family decided that some of that money should go to help her care.",
        "But the two - these two women were very worried about what other members of the family who weren't pitching in would think.",
        "You know, were they taking advantage of the situation?",
        "Would other family members not appreciate all the work they were doing?",
        "So they actually turned to an elder care lawyer to sort of answer some of these questions, and she advised them to actually structure, you know, sort of a legal document establishing that this money was being spent for her care, to avoid these tensions that might come up much later, you know, when she passes away, and decisions are made about, you know, where her money should go.",
        "So I think what Bryce was saying, you know, certainly resonates.",
        "I mean, there's a lot of value in dealing with, you know, potentially tough decisions and tensions ahead of time, having those conversations, maybe turning to a lawyer or an advisor who could kind of structure something that would avoid some really hard conversations down the road.",
        "And Marilyn, we were hearing about tensions within one generation, the siblings.",
        "What about intergenerational tensions?"

        "We've had a lot of response from people sending in their life stories about what's happened in their homes, and one of the things that comes through is there's a lot of anger in some households towards younger generations, where the middle - the sandwich generation feels like they're doing the best they can, taking care of the parents, and they've got, say, a 26-year-old son who's at home and doesn't really have a job.",
        "And there is a certain - obviously not every family, but there is certain component out there where there's becoming more and more intergenerational anger, I think, where young people feel, hey, you wanted me to go to college, I took on all this student debt.",
        "Now I've graduated in a world where there are very few jobs for young people, it's tougher for my generation, and if I need to chill on the couch a little bit, don't be so angry about it.",

        "The kids are saying you don't understand what's going on with my generation.",
