        "These laws go about the parent trigger in slightly different ways, in terms of the powers that they give parents.",
        "In some states, the trigger allows parent to convert the school - allows parents to convert the school to charter.",
        "In some cases, they can actually close the school and re-open it.",
        "In other cases, if the parents get a majority signatures, they can partner with another district or even the state to help run the school.",
        "So the triggers work in different ways, but they all have the same basic goal, which is majority rule among the parents at the school.",

        "I don't think we need a new law, but because in Virginia, at least, local school boards are the authorities that controls the schools.",
        "Parents who are active and engaged can advocate directly to the school board and effect a lot of change, with or without the parent trigger legislation.",
        "I hear what you're saying, Kim, but, Sean Cavanagh, in the case out there at Adelanto, the parent who's been most prominent in organizing this was the head of the PTA.",
        "Well, that's true.",
        "And I mean, one of the - I mean, look, it's hard to turn around a low-performing school and, clearly, having active and engaged parents is a key factor in doing that.",
        "One of the unknowns in all of this parent-trigger talk is, you know, if these laws remain on the books and go forward, how much interest will there actually be among parents in using the parent trigger?",
        "Or will parents simply say, look, I mean, this is a major effort we're undertaking.",
        "We really want to sustain this for how ever many years it takes to turn around the school.",
        "And that's what we just don't know at this point.",
        "But to have parents organized enough to get 51 percent to sign a petition suggest that they are, at least somewhat engaged and that there's a failure of communication between the leadership at the school and the leadership of the parents.",
        "Well, that's true.",
        "I mean, you know, as someone who has covered education awhile, I can't think of many issues where it's easy to get, you know, 51 percent of parents at a school behind - behind any effort.",
        "So, yeah, if you can reach - I mean, that's a pretty high bar.",
        "And so I've had some state legislators tell me in different states where they passed these laws, look, we don't expect a whole lot of schools to actually go with the parent trigger because it is such a high bar.",
        "So the fact that a school could reach that point - that point - I mean, suggests that there is a pretty strong amount of interest in, you know, doing business in very different way.",

        "A 51 percent vote works just as well in a local election as it does in the school overturning.",

        "Well, you know, I noted that issue has come about there, and it has certainly provoked some controversy and some divisions within the community.",
        "You know, I will say that I have heard from a lot of parents in Adelanto, who side with the school district, who do not support the parent trigger effort.",
        "But they say that, you know, their voices have not been heard during this process, so - but I mean, the larger issue is that these efforts can prove divisive in communities.",
        "And if, you know, if they were easy, I would imagine we'd be seeing more of these efforts going forward, but we're not.",
        "Sean Cavanagh, a reporter for Education Week, We're talking about parent trigger laws and one particular case, at Desert Trails Elementary in Adelanto, California, kind of the basis for the new movie, \"\"Won't Back Down.\"\" You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And let's go next to Karen.",
        "Karen on the line with us from Houston.",
        "Yes.",
        "I'm calling from Texas, and we do have a parent trigger law, but it is not a very strong law, compared to what's in California.",
        "And what I wanted to share is that under state law, currently, parents have rights such as - for instance, in a public school, you have a class size cap of 22-1 in K through four.",
        "You wouldn't get that if you were going into a, say, into a charter school or into a takeover situation.",
        "Parents would be giving up certain rights.",
        "So we have a whole section of our education code what relates to parent rights, but they don't apply - many of those rights do not apply to students who are in charter schools.",
        "So you really would be giving up something.",
        "Sean Cavanagh, is that right?",
        "Well, that could be in certain states.",
        "I think that what advocates of the parent trigger would, you know, respond by saying is that you might be giving up some of those things, but the advantages you get, the - perhaps, you - by converting to a charter, you get more specialized services, a curriculum that suits the needs of students, interventions that help the particular needs of students, perhaps a longer school day, things that current collective bargaining agreements may not allow.",
        "So what the caller is saying may be correct, but there's a flipside to that, and I think that what advocates of the trigger are against is, look, we're going after a charter conversions for a reason because we think that this is a way to transform schools that do not have history of success and need a fairly radical transformation."

        "And it's funded by Broad, Walton, Rogers, Gates, by big money.",
