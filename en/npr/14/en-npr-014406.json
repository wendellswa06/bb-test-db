        "Therefore, we should adjust ourselves to much less in the way of biological diversity in natural areas, and let's start thinking about how to get adjusted.",

        "...under-appreciated.",
        "That to me is defeatism in planting the white flag that we don't need to plant.",
        "We just need to take vigorous new efforts to create large protected, preserved areas and pay a great deal more attention on the totality of the surviving species of organisms on Earth, species by species, and learning how to hold on to them until humanity, well, comes to its senses.",

        "We'll also take questions from the audience here at the Paepke Auditorium in Aspen, and, well, why don't we start there, go to the microphone.",
        "This is a question for Sylvia: Sylvia, what sparked your passion to dedicate your life to the oceans and oceanography?",
        "I got knocked over by a wave when I was three, and the ocean got my attention.",
        "But what has held my attention for lo these many years is the life in the sea; horseshoe crabs on the beaches of New Jersey.",
        "And then when my parents moved to Florida when I was 12, there were horseshoe crabs, again, these creatures that have a history going back at least 300 million years, and they're still with us.",
        "And I think what has gripped my attention and really drives me right now is the recognition that on our watch, the fate of horseshoe crabs will be determined, perhaps, that we could lose them, or our actions might secure a future that includes them and us.",
        "The changes I've witnessed since I first splashed in the oceans, as I first went underwater in the Weeki Wachee River as a teenager and then off St. Marks River in the Gulf of Mexico with SCUBA for the first time, with two words of instruction: breathe naturally.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "And seeing the world where most people don't get to go.",
        "I've been as much as two and a half miles beneath the surface, and I long to go where Jim Cameron just returned from, the deepest part of the ocean.",
        "I mean, it's only seven miles, and people in this audience listening, you've been seven miles in the sky in airplanes, eating lunch and watching movies and things, taking naps.",
        "But underwater, there are only three people who have made that descent successfully and come back.",

        "Not lunch, mostly peanuts up there.",
        "Ed Wilson, let me ask you the same question that Sylvia just answered.",
        "Where did the passion come from?",
        "I think every child has a passion.",
        "You know, as Camus put it, all of a person's work is just that travel through the routes of art to those two or three great images in the presence of which his heart first opened.",
        "And mine included dreams, after reading - this was not preplanned promotion - reading the National Geographic.",
        "And from that, I dreamed as a little boy of 9 to be an explorer in the green hell of the tropical jungles.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "I dreamed of doing it, exploring it, you know, seeing those marvelous creatures that were displayed in the National Geographic especially, but also that I saw in the museums and the park, the Rock Creek Park in Washington during a two-year period our family stayed there.",
        "And I just transferred that at the earliest stages to going forth into whatever woods I could find, and I had beautiful woods in Alabama and Florida, armed with a fishing net, later with a snake snare and field guides and then finally, as soon as I could, as a new Ph.D. at Harvard I went to the green hell, and I've been living in that magnificent, dreamed-of environment, often, when I can, ever since.",
        "Chip, you're still at the microphone here, did you have another point?",
        "Yes, this is a follow-up for Sylvia.",
        "What - how much of the Earth's oxygen comes from the ocean, and how much CO2 does it sequester?",
        "That's a slippery question, and we're just beginning to get a grip on the significance of the blue part of the planet.",
        "But this is for sure: No blue, no green.",
        "Got to have water, and where there's water, there's likely to be life, as far as we know, and maybe elsewhere in the universe but certainly here.",
        "Just a few decades ago, like 30 years ago, an MIT scientist, Penny Chisholm and her colleagues found a tiny organism in the sea that had previously gone undetected, Prochlorococcus.",
        "Now we know it generates about 20 percent of the oxygen in the atmosphere.",
        "It's a bacterium, a blue-green bacterium, and we didn't know that it existed until those clever oceanographers were able to detect its existence, and now we know abundant it is."

        "So you hear estimates, anything from half to 70 percent, but we're still discovering so much about how the world works.",
        "But generation of oxygen is principally an ocean issue, and the taking-up of carbon dioxide, similarly, it's photosynthesis, generating O2, bringing down the CO2 and producing food, producing oxygen, and all life from Earth somehow is dependent on that process plus the newly appreciated chemosynthesis in the deep sea that doesn't require sunlight and is much more abundant and occupies much of the planet.",
        "Anyway, we really need to learn so much more before that straight question can be given a straight answer.",
        "Here's an email from Richard in Birmingham: It's just great to know that a native of Alabama and a University of Alabama alum has done so much to add to our scientific body of knowledge and has made such a contribution and continues to humanity.",
        "Thank you, Dr. Wilson.",
        "He adds: Roll Tide.",
        "I don't think that's a reference to Sylvia Earle's work.",
        "And this from Brian(ph) in Colorado: As a student at the University of Colorado interested in this area and creating change, what kind of career can I pursue to help?",
        "Where do we need people now?",
        "Ed Wilson?",
        "Well, let me put it this way: We are right at the crest of the crisis, or I should say the nadir, the trough of the crisis facing the world with reference to environment, and the necessity to stabilize population and consumption and distribute and preserve our resources in a way that will make the human population and the rest of life sustainable.",
        "So my advice to young people who are still searching is to find something in your career plans that has to do with environment, whether it's in law, whether it's in public health or coming close to the core of the issues, whether it's in the environmental science.",
        "I would like to suggest that almost any subject you take up in science - I'll excuse astrophysics and quantum mechanics - is going to have relevance in the deepening of the understanding that we must have in order to settle down on this planet for the centuries to come.",
        "Sylvia?",
        "I tell kids who ask me the question about the reasons for hope and all that that they are the luckiest to ever come along because for the first time, we know what we know, that a kid who's 10 years old with a cell phone has access to, you know, the Library of Congress, the history of life on Earth, so much that Charles Darwin would just be so thrilled to come and see what kids know today.",
        "You who are coming along have the future very much in your hands, and you're armed with knowledge that none of our predecessors had.",
        "Use it.",
        "Just recognize that this is the moment, as never before and maybe as never again, to really make a difference for all that is ahead.",
        "You know, this is a turning point, and you're right there in the middle of it.",

        "Yeah, I just had a question, and it's for either one of you or both of you, that it occurred to me that the number of species present at any given time on the planet might be a balance between the rates of extinction and the rates of new species evolving.",
        "And while the former certainly is going to occur more rapidly than the latter, has anyone attempted to get a handle on the rate at which new species are evolving?",
        "Ed Wilson?",
        "And I'll take my answer off the air.",
        "Oh, thanks very much, David.",
        "Yeah, we've given extensive examination to that, made intensive examination, and here it in the rough figures: Before the coming of humanity, averaged out over long periods of time and then excluding the previous great extinction spasms that occurred on four occasions in the last 450 million years, the average extinction rate of species has been approximately one in a million per year, and the rate of origin of new species has been roughly the same, one per million species per year.",
        "We have now jacked the extinction rate up by some three orders of magnitude - a thousand and probably approaching 10,000 - at the same time that we are eliminating the birthplaces in which species occur.",
        "So we're driving up the death rate of species, we are driving down the birth rate, and the result will be a depopulization(ph) of Earth's surface in living species during the next several decades that has not been matched for some 65 million years.",
        "And, Sylvia Earle, so many of those cradles are wet.",
        "Oh, maybe most of them.",
        "When you think about where life on Earth occurs, it's where the water is.",
        "Well - but the one interesting dimension of living things are the microbes that don't obey the same or - they have a different lifestyle.",
        "They adapt more quickly.",
        "They reproduce much more quickly, for the most part.",
        "I mean, there are exceptions.",
        "But, you know, the thing is we don't know what the microbes are doing in terms of how, in the great expanse of life, how they're faring.",
        "We're just beginning to discover that they're all around us in the air, like plankton, and in the sea, billions in a bucket of water, that we just - it's only on our watch that we've begun to appreciate their role.",
        "Change the chemistry of Earth even a little bit, you change that mix of microbes that both keep us alive, but they also could spell our doom."
