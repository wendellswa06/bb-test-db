        "This is the way it's going.",

        "But I think it does point to the fact that - especially in a community like ours, which has such a predominantly white culture and white population - that folks have very complicated and oftentimes repressed ideas and feelings about race and race issues.",
        "And it's really important that folks find an area that they can talk about this with some comfort and with people that they trust, and to really explore how they feel about race issues because that's really at the core of the problem of racism across our country.",
        "And would you describe, yes, there's been thoughtful responses, but there's been - is backlash too strong a word?",
        "Well, you know, clearly, there's two different types of negative responses that I get.",
