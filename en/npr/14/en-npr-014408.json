        "One man who knows firsthand about the surge is Marine Major General Walter Gaskin, one of the highest-ranking African-Americans in the U.S.",

        "In February, he returned from serving a year in Iraq.",
        "He headed the 25,000-member Multi-National Forces West.",
        "That force patrols the Sunni-dominated al-Anbar province.",
        "I asked General Gaskin how the surge affected his job in Iraq.",
        "Oh, it was tremendous.",
        "As you know, we got approximately about 4,000 additional forces to Anbar.",
        "But let me tell you what it gave us the ability to do.",
        "One, the partner went down at the — as low as the battalion and company level with Iraqi security force, to partner with the Iraqi police and the ability to secure the population centers.",
        "So, we have basically defeated al-Qaida and pushed them out of Anbar because we had additional forces.",
        "Now, when we spoke with you last September, General David Petraeus had just recommended the withdrawal of at least 21,000 surge troops.",
        "And then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates went further saying that the troop levels could be cut more to 10,000 by this year.",
        "What's the latest on the idea of the surge ending, and there being a further drawdown of troops?",
        "Maj.",
        "Gen.",
        "GASKIN: I think you recently heard that General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will talk in the near future about whether or not the forces should be withdrawn below the surge numbers.",
        "I believe that the surge forces were good.",
        "I believe that they gave us the chance to increase the capacity of the Iraqi security forces.",
        "And so, the association of mentoring and training is critical to (unintelligible) capacity and the self-reliance and the ability for the Iraqis to eventually take the lead.",
        "Looking ahead, when do you predict that the lead responsibility for security will be transferred to the Iraqis, and will that go in phases?",
        "Maj.",
        "Gen.",
        "GASKIN: I think you see that in every portions of the 18 provinces in Iraq, there will be only timeline that would eventually Iraqi control.",
        "And that is predicated upon the evolutionary and, in some cases, involvement of the government within that province.",
        "Well, I think if you will examine every one of those provinces on the timescale based on that development and that, as in Anbar, we have seen remarkable progress and improvement and capacity on all front, whether that be at the local government's level, whether that be at the travel engagement, or whether or not we're talking about the Iraqi security forces.",
        "And that thing is that you cannot separate it into a sort of a sequential thing.",
        "These things all happened simultaneously that results in stability and economic development that is running under the rule of law and connected with the reconciliation that has to occur in the national level.",
        "And I think that is - that they are making progress along that line.",
        "In this environment of examination of strategy, how was the overall recruiting going?",
        "Maj.",
        "Gen.",
        "GASKIN: Our recruiting is going extremely well.",
        "And, as you know, this is an all-volunteer service and that this generation, many a generation is outstanding group of young men and women who feel that they like to do things more than for themselves, and they would like to participate in the freedom of not only America, but those who want the opportunities that they love and cherish around the world.",
        "So, these young men and women come in to Marine Corps expecting to deploy, expecting to be the nation's 911, and expecting to follow the principles and ideas of our nation.",
        "So, I've have seen that the morale is good.",
        "I've seen that these young men and women have a very clear understanding of what we are trying to do in Iraq.",
        "And I think that they support that by their volunteering to be a part of the Marine Corps."

        "Are you worried that this sustained engagement would actually, you know, erode not only, you know, I guess possibly the spirit of your Marines, but also just of the families that support them?",
        "Maj.",
        "Gen.",
        "GASKIN: Well, you know, the thing is that what we should do as a nation is begin by thanking the young men and women for their sacrifice for the cause.",
        "It is no doubt that when we go up to operation, which is in Iraq or Afghanistan or anywhere around the world, it requires sacrifice and separation from our families.",
        "I think that's the uniqueness of the generation.",
        "And although we do everything we can to make sure that we minimize any of the problems associated with deployment, the reality of it is that in order to go off and do the things that our nation needed to do, it require us to be separated from our families.",
        "And so, our acceptance of the sacrifice should always be the forefront.",
        "And at the same time, we cannot forget those who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country by giving their lives.",
        "Well, General Gaskin, thank you very much.",
        "And that's pretty easy to dismiss, because you know that that's going to happen, and you know that there are those who are very hateful people across the world.",
        "What my interest is is connecting with the people in Duluth who would take a look at this - these billboards and this advertising campaign, and they're legitimately hurt or they're confused by it and they have a negative reaction to it.",

        "You know, what is the source of it?",
        "And I've had discussions in which sometimes people will point to something that happened to them 30 years ago, and that they felt, you know, it was a - it was kind of a life-altering experience.",
        "And they've kind of held that so tightly and kind of repressed that memory, and yet it defined how they view racial issues from that point forward.",
        "And so, you know, if we can have these broader dialogues and kind of get to the source of where people are holding this confusion or anger or hurt, that we might be able to, you know, help folks improve themselves.",
        "We wanted to read a couple of letters that were published into the Duluth News Tribune, the local paper there, this from a writer named Susan Valentine from Duluth: I'm writing concerning the anti-racism campaign.",
        "I personally find it offensive because I feel it is singling out one specific race.",
        "If people want to stop racism, there should be gatherings of ethnic backgrounds showing traditions, foods, beliefs, et cetera, showing the contributions their cultures have given to America as a whole.",
        "Race, gender, sexual preference and creed should not factor in.",

        "And I think that's a thoughtful response.",
        "It is a thoughtful response.",
        "And, you know, I think that, really, the message is it's hard to see racism from some place other than your own perspective.",
        "And, you know, every - most of the conversations I have, people have kind of come back to their own personal experience.",
        "And what this campaign is challenging them to do is to kind of look beyond that personal experience and have empathy for a person who is in a different situation.",
        "You know, the other interesting point about that letter and the point that the writer makes is that, yes, this is a campaign that makes broad generalizations about a group of people based on their race.",
        "But isn't that the experience of people of color, what they face all the time?",
        "And so, you know, as white people, we have this broad characterization, and it takes us aback because we are so unused to it.",
        "We're not confronted with that.",
        "And yet people of color are confronted with it day after day after day and in, many times, much more damaging and confrontational ways than this campaign."
