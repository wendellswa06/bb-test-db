        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "And, you know, my situation was, as you pointed out, clear-cut.",
        "I knew exactly what I was dealing with.",
        "It was an individual who was trying to murder a fellow officer.",
        "Sometimes it's not so clear-cut.",
        "I've been in numerous situations when I was a young officer where I could have shot, but decided not to because the posture of the suspect, because the way he or she was manipulating the gun in their hand, that type of thing.",
        "And also circumstances where officers shoot, they think there's a gun, it turns out there's not a gun.",
        "Then it becomes highly problematic.",
        "So...",
        "A case just in Texas in the last couple of weeks of an eighth-grader holding a realistic-looking toy, and it turns out that he was shot to death.",
        "Obviously, we're going to have to wait for the investigation to find out all the details there, but this happens too often.",
        "And wow, those officers must feel terrible.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, police officers sign up to protect the public from dangerous threats.",
        "And when, as in the case you just mentioned, everything appears to look like I have a serious threat.",
        "Here's an individual who has brought a gun to school, you know, guns in our sanctuaries.",
        "We cannot let this individual kill children.",
        "And then it turns that it is a not-gun or a replica gun or a toy gun, that's got to weigh very difficult on the officers.",
        "And anybody that's interested in learning about that particular case would do well to take a look at that chapter in the book \"\"Blink.",
        "The larger end of the spectrum, I suspect.",
        "And, you know, some of the 80 officers that I interviewed for \"\"Kill Zone\"\" had been involved in circumstances where they shot people, fully believing that the suspect was armed with a deadly weapon, and it turned out it was a replica or something.",
        "And the officers had a very, very difficult time dealing with that.",
        "Joining us now is Lawrence Mower, a reporter with the Las Vegas Review-Journal.",
        "He wrote a series last year on the use of deadly force by police officers.",
        "Among those he spoke with was David Klinger, who's also with us today.",
        "And he joins us now from KNPR in Las Vegas.",
        "So nice to have you on the program with us today.",
        "Thank you for having me, Neal.",
        "And I was interested, just given what David Klinger was just saying, yes, I think we hear about it often when police officers fire their weapons with tragic results.",
        "We don't hear about it when they don't."

        "No, that's true, absolutely.",
        "And these are still relatively rare incidents.",
        "Here we found that, you know, metro police, Las Vegas Metro Police, the big agency here, shoots their - you know, fires their weapons at people around 17 times a year, and they are relatively rare incidents.",
        "And relatively rare, nevertheless, it seems that at least there, the investigations that follow have - is it fair to say universally cleared officers?",
        "Almost.",
        "What we found was that: One, there was a lot of shootings here.",
        "Also that the department was very reluctant to learn from its incidents, learn from its shootings, and that they were reluctant to hold officers accountable for them.",
        "And really, the review process in place was fairly lax.",
        "In the last decade, Metro's review board had cleared 99 percent of officers who were involved in any kind of incident, serious incident like a shooting.",
        "And - but also, the criminal review process was fairly lax, also.",
        "Reluctant to do that because they feared for morale, because why?",
        "Well, it's interesting.",
        "The board that they had set up here - and they still do have set up here - was dominated by citizens.",
        "And what we found kind of interesting is we talked to the citizens, and they were very much, very pro-police.",
        "They had difficulty holding officers accountable for these incidents.",
        "Oftentimes, it was the officers on the board who were harder on their own officers than the citizens were.",
        "But, you know, what you've heard over time from police also is that, well, we don't want to second-guess another officer's decision to use deadly force because these incidents are so rare, and they're not as clear cut, often, as, you know, an officer beating someone up.",
        "Well, many officers would not justify that.",
        "So - go ahead.",
        "I was just going to ask David Klinger to come in and say, is that - is the experience there in Las Vegas, do you think, replicated across much of the country?",
        "In terms of the sense that most shootings are held to be justified?",
        "Yes."

        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "And a dispassionate observer who looked at the investigative case files of the vast majority of shootings would have to come to the same conclusion.",
        "There are some bad shootings.",
        "There's no doubt about that.",

        "There's a term of art called awful, but lawful.",
        "So sometimes officers are involved in shootings that don't really sound that good, but the law says it was an appropriate use of force.",
