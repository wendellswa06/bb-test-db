        "It is difficult; however, right is right and wrong is wrong, and I might be the minority when it comes to law enforcement officers, but I believe that the citizens that you serve should be provided with highly trained professionals so that in the event of a shooting, the question as to whether that officer was justified or not could be minimized.",
        "All right, thanks very much for the call, Burt, and Lawrence Mower, you wrote in your series in the Las Vegas Review-Journal several instances in which officers would have been perfectly justified, by law and by circumstance, to have opened fire, did not and proved to be right.",
        "No that's true, and your caller brings up a good point in that, you know, the vast majority of these things are legally justified and perhaps even morally justified, too, in the vast majority of the time.",
        "But what we found is that some of them can be avoided by tactics and really looking at, OK, did the officer place themselves in a position of danger.",
        "For example, we had a case here where officers trying to apprehend a - a person who was fencing stolen goods, they caught him coming out of the store.",
        "The person, the suspect jumped into the passenger side of a car.",
        "One officer went to the passenger side of the car to try to pull him out.",
        "Well, the driver took off.",
        "And now the officer is in a situation where they're being dragged, and the officer is in a situation where either you shoot to kill the driver and stop the car, or you, you know, let go and be crushed by the car potentially.",
        "So difficult choice.",
        "Absolutely, and that's a case where, you know, the officer was certainly legally justified and had no other option in that situation, but nevertheless, it could have been avoided, and other departments that have policies that say don't reach into running or - basically don't reach into vehicles.",
        "Well, Las Vegas police don't have that kind of policy.",
        "There was also a finding that you made that suggested that police officers involved in shootings, if they're involved in several shootings, well, yes, circumstances can mount, and someone can be unfortunate, but nevertheless, it does seem to form a pattern.",
        "Well, sometimes.",
        "What we found was that - I mean, some officers in a lot of shootings are in, for example, the SWAT team, where you might be more prone to have a lot of shootings, and you can't really make a moral judgment based on that or, you know, a personnel judgment."

        "But what we did find is patterns of officers being involved in multiple shootings, sometimes they had other disciplinary problems, and some of their shootings were, you know, problematic to say the least.",
        "One cop we looked at was involved in three fatal shootings in five years, and in each of those shootings, the person who was shot was a vagrant.",
        "There were no witnesses to any of the shootings, and the officer's judgment was highly questionable by people inside and outside the department.",
        "And yet the officer was allowed to stay on for a number of years until he was fired for disciplinary reasons.",
        "David Klinger, is it widespread that, as Lawrence Mower says, in the case in Las Vegas, that police departments are reluctant to try to draw lessons from their shooting incidents?",
        "What I found is that most of the agencies around the country are actually quite interested in drawing lessons.",
        "And for example my old agency Los Angeles, one of the things that they have been doing for many years is having essentially a tactical review of the incident to say what could the officers have done differently, if anything, in order to either reduce the likelihood of a shooting or to reduce the likelihood of collateral damage, you know, a citizen being damaged, injured, so on and so forth.",
        "In fact, I'm presently involved in a project with the Bureau of Justice Assistance, another branch of the United States Department of Justice, where I'm interviewing officers around the country and asking them what are the lessons that we can learn from your incident.",
        "And it's going to be fed back into American law enforcement, and this is at the highest levels of USDOJ.",
        "One of the things that I noticed that your - I'm sorry, the person you're interviewing isn't talking about is the way that police officers are treated after the shooting.",
        "It almost feels adversarial in nature.",
        "I was involved in a shooting myself a few hours off a training.",
        "It was covered by national news, and it was a huge incident.",
        "And, I mean, there was no doubt that I was in the right, but still the fact they take your gun away while you're on-scene, they put you in a patrol car, they separate the different people in the shootings.",
        "There's a way that they do it, but it just really feels like they're treating me like a criminal, and I'd like them to speak a little bit about that.",
        "David Klinger?",
        "Well, that's unacceptable.",
        "One of the things that I do and other people around the country do is train agencies about post-shooting protocols.",
        "And to disarm an officer at the scene, there's no reason for that.",
        "There's a time and a place to get the officer's weapon for evidence collection, and that's back at the station once the officer is safe, once the scene is secured, so on and so forth.",
        "There's got to be some sort of an adversarial process because there's always the question in our democracy whether an officer used deadly force appropriately.",
        "So there has to be a careful investigation of the facts.",
        "However, it doesn't have to be adversarial in the sense of trying to make it look as if the officer did something wrong."

        "When I say adversarial, the district attorney has to take a look at it, make sure everything's squared away.",
        "But I agree with the officer: If an agency is not treating the officer with the respect that they deserve - because after all, what happens is they trained the officer, they hired the officer, they gave him a gun, they said go out, and under these circumstances deadly force is appropriate - unless and until there is some evidence that the officer did something wrong, the officer shouldn't be treated like a criminal suspect.",
        "John, how long ago was this?",
        "It was back in 2005.",
        "Do you think procedures have changed?",
        "You know, after that happened, I'm sure they probably did.",

        "Thirty-eight shots were fired, and eight of them hit him, and he still lived.",
        "And - the person you were firing at?",
        "Yeah, the person still lived.",
        "They had to put him in a coma for a few days, and then he came back out of the coma.",

        "How long was it before you got your weapon back?",
        "Well, they give you on the (unintelligible), administrative leave for a week, and then you come back.",
        "You have to go see a psych first to make sure that you're OK, and that was pretty much it.",
        "And have you had any difficulties?",
        "No, no problems at all.",
        "Yeah, I mean, I think just the main thing, I just felt the way that they treated me at the time, I'm glad that Mr. Klinger spoke to that, that that wasn't correct.",

        "All right, thank you.",
        "And Lawrence Mower, that procedure he described, a week on the beach, administrative leave, is that what they do in Las Vegas, too?",
        "That's kind of the norm nationwide is that you give officers time to see a psychologist and really make sure you're OK because it's interesting, one of your earlier callers kind of talked about this was I talked to a cop who was involved in a - in combat in Vietnam, and he was later involved in police shootings.",
        "And he said that, you know, in combat it's - not that it's not traumatic, but that you don't - you often don't know who you're shooting.",
        "You don't know anything about that person.",
        "But if you're a police officer, you're going to find out everything there is to know about that guy through the, well, usually through the press and through your own - your department's investigation.",
        "You'll know that that person had a family, had loved ones, was loved by someone and it's - in my interviews with officers they - a lot of them really struggled with that."

        "And, David Klinger, we find - again our experience with the military is that there is a degree of, first of all, denial and then there's a degree of soldiers and Marines unwilling to report for counseling because - well, they fear, what it's going to make them look like to their fellow soldiers and Marines, and it's also they don't want to be pulled out in the line of duty.",
        "Does the same kind of syndrome affect police officers?",
        "I don't know that we could call it a syndrome in terms of how widespread it is, but certainly in my first study that I did for the Department of Justice, the one that led \"\"Into the Kill Zone,\"\" several officers did mentioned that they did not feel comfortable talking to anybody in the organization, particularly the police psychologist or psychiatrist because they did not believe that they would be treated well, i.e., they might be pulled off the line.",
        "Someone might think that they weren't capable of doing their jobs.",
        "And so yes, there is, at least, for some officers sans that because it could redound negatively on them professionally that they want to keep stuff close to the vest as opposed to go in getting the help of perhaps they might need.",
