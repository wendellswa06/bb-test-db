        "It was an inmate trying to escape and he was also a mental patient.",
        "He grabbed another officer's gun and shot that officer in the face right in front of me, and then fired a shot at me, and then we - he ran out.",
        "And I chased him out and eventually, well, there was a lot of shooting back in forth and he was eventually shot.",
        "That was obviously one of those cut-and-dried situations.",
        "The second one was not.",
        "The first one happened early when I was in my 20s.",
        "The second one happened in 2005, like the officer you just talked to a few minutes ago, late in my career.",
        "And it turns out the guy was trying to rob a Coke machine of all things, and I thought he was trying to - I thought the thing had taken his money so I came up unprepared for an aggressive personality.",
        "And when he thought that I was there to arrest him because - I didn't know it but in his vehicle which was parked there were items that he had taken from a burglary.",
        "I see.",
        "And so he assumed that I knew that.",
        "And at first he tried to stab me with a screwdriver.",
        "I used pepper spray in that situation.",
        "And then while he was under the influence of the pepper spray, I was trying to handcuff him and he managed to knock me down, get in the car.",
        "And it was one of those situations you talked about earlier.",
        "I was...",
        "Oh, being dragged?",
        "...I was being dragged, so I climbed up into the car in his lap, and the car was going backwards in a circle.",
        "And he managed to - I was trying to hold on to keep from the centrifugal force from pulling me out of the open door, and he — while I was doing that, he grabbed my gun and then, when I realized he had my gun, then I - we both struggled for the gun and it - I had the advantage of pressure being on top.",
        "And so that's how it ended up.",
        "That sounds terrifying to tell you the truth.",
        "The investigation that time, how long did that take?"

        "They arrived shortly after.",
        "And then, as a police officer, when they sit you down to interview you after a shooting, you expect that, but when they read you Miranda, you're not expecting that.",
        "I bet not.",
        "No.",
        "That - I just - I didn't know what to do at that point.",

        "So I did get an attorney.",
        "Everything turned out OK.",
        "And another ironic twist in my situation that we're in south Georgia, I was a white officer, the suspect was black, and the family immediately said that racism was involved but the organization that saved me really was the NAACP.",
        "And how did that happen?",
        "We just have a few seconds left.",
        "Well, real quickly, I was born and raised here.",
        "I've been in law enforcement here my whole life.",
        "And apparently, someone from the national organization came down to conduct an inquiry and when he talked with the representatives from chapters in two local communities where I had worked, they basically told him they knew me, they knew my family, they knew my work history.",
        "And I had, in 25 years, I had never had a claim of racism or excessive force and then the boy had an extensive record.",
        "So that - he got on a plane and went home.",

        "And in ideal circumstances, you can build it up like a muscle by exercising it steadily over time.",
        "You mean you purposely put yourself in a situation where you need some willpower to overcome it, so you practice it?",
        "Yes, you can do things - you start by making small changes in your life.",
        "In one of the studies we did, we just had people work on their posture for a couple weeks, and that then produced changes on all sorts of things that had nothing to do with posture because you just get used to correcting your own behavior and bringing it up to your goals and standards.",
