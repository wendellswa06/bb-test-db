        "Under the ground you have something called geological pressure and this pressure, sometimes, can be abnormally high.",

        "There are thousands of mud volcanoes on the earth.",
        "What makes this mud volcano very different is that this one was almost certainly triggered by drilling a gas exploration well."

        "Yes.",

        "It's a sight to behold, I mean, reading through the various literature and looking at pictures does not prepare you for seeing this thing.",
        "It has a crater in the middle of it, a vent, which is 50 meters wide with mud and gas and steam coming out of it.",
        "Is the land in danger of collapsing if this water runs out?",
        "I mean what is going to happen there?",
        "Geologically?",
        "It is collapsing and so we've recently published a paper - we're working with Indonesians.",
        "They have taken accurate GPS measurements, which can measure a fraction of a centimeter of downward movement.",
        "And they have also used satellite images to see whether the land has gone up or gone down.",
        "It is of course going down.",
        "The weight of the mud, and because you are taking mud and fluid from underneath the ground, is causing the area to subside.",
        "The maximum rate, if you like, are four centimeters a day.",
        "That equates to something like 14 meters a year and if you multiply it by ten years, you can quickly extrapolate the worst-case scenario.",
        "And so my point is you really have to look at this new data because it shows that the area will eventually be impacted by the mud volcano, it's not just the area covered by mud."
