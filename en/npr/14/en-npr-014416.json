        "Results were announced yesterday, and Islamic cleric Hasan Rowhani was elected with a commanding 50.7 percent of the vote.",
        "The win strikes a blow for conservatives.",
        "Rowhani was considered the only moderate candidate in the election.",

        "Thank you.",
        "So, turnout was very high, I understand - over 70 percent.",
        "And Rowhani's closest rival, the mayor of Tehran, only took about 15 percent of the vote.",
        "Did the outcome of this election surprise you at all?",
        "It did.",
        "The Iranian presidential elections tended to be un-free, unfair and unpredictable.",
        "And this outcome was certainly unpredictable in that over the last decade in Iran, moderates and reformists had really been purged from the corridors of power.",
        "And given what took place in 2009 with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's contested re-election, I think many people, including myself, were skeptical that they were going to respect the integrity of the ballot box.",
        "And so Rowhani, of all the candidates, was the lone voice of moderation.",
        "And I think for the Iranian people it was a positive outcome.",
        "Let's learn a little bit more about this man and his background.",

        "Susan Bevan, thanks so much for talking to us.",
        "Well, he really is a consummate regime insider.",
        "He was someone who was an acolyte of the father of the revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini.",
        "He's been very close to kind of the pillars of the modern-day Islamic republic, the current supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei, former President Hashemi Rafsanjani.",
        "And Rowhani's's most recent significant position, he was head of Iran's - essentially Iran's national security council.",
        "And more importantly than that, he was Iran's chief nuclear negotiator.",
        "So, this is someone who has an intimate understanding of the nuclear file.",
        "And given how integral and how central this nuclear program has come to Iran's regime, I think it is advantageous for them to have someone who is so intimately involved in this issue."

        "Huge.",
        "I mean, this is an issue which I think preoccupies the vast majority of Iranians because they're not only chafing under internal mismanagement and corruption but they're also chafing under an incredibly draconian international sanctions regime.",

        "sanctions against Iran's central bank, a European oil embargo, six U.N.",
        "Security Council resolutions.",
        "So, the quality of life of most Iranians has dropped precipitously during the era of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.",
        "And so when Rowhani promised moderation, implicit in that was, you know, he was going to be the candidate that was going to resolve some of these international differences in order to lessen the sanctions.",
        "So finally, the issue of Iran's nuclear program.",
        "This has been a sticking point, creating tension between the U.S.",
        "and the West.",
        "Is that likely to change now?",
        "Tactically, I think certainly.",
        "Because you now have a president in Tehran in Rowhani who isn't going to be denying the Holocaust and calling for Israel's demise.",
        "He's a smooth-talking moderate, so tactically there's going to be differences.",
        "The big question is how much Rowhani can affect the strategic principles of the Islamic Republic, which have historically been resistance against the United States, belligerence towards Israel and this kind of non-compromising, inflexible nuclear position.",

        "Opponents of abortion rights see this as perhaps the best opportunity in decades to reverse the 1973 Supreme Court decision making access to abortion the law of the land, and one of the reasons they think that is that what used to be a philosophical or ideological divide has become a partisan one, with Democrats overwhelmingly lining up in favor of abortion rights and Republicans overwhelmingly lining up in favor of more restrictions or even an outright ban.",
        "And that's one reason that Susan Bevan, the national co-chair of The Republican Majority for Choice, announced that she and her co-chair Susan Cullman would be shuttering the organization after some 30 years of operations.",
        "Last week, they wrote an op-ed in The New York Times entitled \"\"Why We Are Leaving The G.O.P.,\"\" and Susan Bevan is with us now from her home in Washington state to tell us more.",

        "You make the point in your piece that - I don't know that this was ever a, say, 50-50 voting issue for Republicans, but there was a time when there were many prominent Republicans who identified with access to abortion as a right.",
        "Why do you think it got to be that way?",
        "There's a number of issues, I think, that we have as a country that have affected the party, that have affected this issue.",
        "We have primaries where the most passionate single-issue voters basically pick who will be the nominee for your party for whatever race they're running and whether it's president, senator or representative.",
        "And then, of course, we have the gerrymandering of the districts, which augments the ability of those single-issue voters to vote and then the lack of term limits.",
        "And so these elected representatives just have to keep going back to the same well over and over again on the same issues that make the single-issue voters happy, and they don't have to vote their conscience or what the vast majority of their electorate would want.",
        "I think some might say that if you believe that access to abortion is an important issue, why not just become a Democrat?",

        "Well, last summer, I said, for the first time in my life, I will vote for a Democrat for president because the current president scares the heck out of me.",
