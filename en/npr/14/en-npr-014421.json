        "It did not, in fact, get nominated for Best Picture, but Viggo is up for Best Actor.",
        "I think part of what happened is it came out much earlier in the year, people tended to forget about it.",
        "And it was tough, tough year.",
        "There were so many great movies that, not only got hurt in award season, but also at the Box Office because everybody releases into the end of the year, and there's this huge clutter and the moviegoer doesn't know which way to look, let along the Academy Award viewer.",
        "I don't think the fact that Viggo has been fairly outspoken and political issues is hurting him, he is much loved in this town.",

        "And you could really emote with the characters.",
        "So I'm wondering why it did not get more nods.",

        "And a lot of this evil is sort of creeping in from an unseen place and sort of - I don't want to get too metaphorical about it, but it sort of etches the helplessness on the people.",

        "I think it is a little weird.",
        "There may have been mistake in the execution of the marketing of \"\"American Gangster\"\" in that you thought it was as much sort of Russell Crowe's movie as it was his.",
        "It's Denzel's movie all the way, and it was sort of defined academy performance in terms of having a good sort of period little to it, having a great range of performance, and I think you and I are among many people disappointed that Denzel Washington won't be in the mix this year."
