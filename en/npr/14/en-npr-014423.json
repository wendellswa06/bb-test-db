        "Yeah, exactly, because they died doing their jobs but not the purpose for which that job exists.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And do you remember their names?",

        "(Sculptor; Designer, California Vietnam Veterans Memorial): Hi, thank you.",
        "And the Vietnam Veterans Memorial you created on the West Coast is quite different from the one most of us know that Maya Lin constructed here on the Mall in Washington, D.C.",
        "That's correct.",
        "Herman Woods(ph), who is a double amputee and was with the First Air Cav, came back after the dedication of the Maya Lin memorial and was determined to get something going here in California.",
        "And upon his research, he realized that we had lost - not that these are bragging rights - but that we had lost 5,822 men and women, which was the largest amount of any state."

        "And the - more California residents were killed in Vietnam than the other residents is what I'm saying, and we also received a lot of the Medal of Honors and the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart, as well, so...",
        "But how did you decide to - you got one example.",
        "You clearly don't want to do that again.",
        "How do you mean?",
        "The Maya Lin memorial.",
        "Every - people need to be represented, and you have smaller memorials all around, in every state now, Vietnam, all wars, memorials, working on one presently right now for the B-17, people with the Flying Fortresses in Madras, Oregon.",
        "It's a small memorial, but it's to recognize where the training ground was there, where they had lost some people in training, as well.",
        "And what principles guide you as you try to memorialize these men and women?",
        "Well, there are many, but it's mainly listening to the stories - and, I mean, the main focus on a memorial is to heal the wounds of the veterans and the families and the willingness to show the sacrifice by those who served and relate the loneliness and the vulnerability of a soldier in combat and hopefully transport the visitor into another time and space and expand the awareness of hardships incurred by veterans and their families.",
        "And give us an idea of who they were, those of us who did not know them.",
        "Well, memorials are kind of a thing where you try and step into a space and feel.",
        "At the California memorial, we have four kind of anterooms where we have the POW panel, the rest panel, the action panel, and we were the first ones that included women in the memorial because there was between 11,000 to 15,000 women that served in Vietnam.",
        "And so Rose Sendachy(ph) was very terrific in giving us our guidance on putting together that panel.",
        "And then in reference, Time-Life Books and Mr. Duncan(ph), I believe, the photographer and (unintelligible) photographers, we used a lot of photographs out of Time-Life.",
        "I got permission to replicate kind of what the experience was like."

        "And if the memorial is successful that way, I hope that they are, you know, healing and try and bring closure and completion to some.",
        "And it's also where a lot of people basically get together, certainly at our ceremonies, but also individually when they're walking through the memorial.",
