        "Yes, by all means do so.",
        "Yuck.",
        "Anyway, I brought along these chips because, as you so eloquently stated at the outset of the segment, I was compelled to discover the nutritional values of potato chips when my son put me up to studying chips and the scientific nature of potato chips for a children's book.",
        "Your son put you up to it?",
        "Well, he was sick and tired of all these sort of rush-a-shay(ph), arcane subjects I'd been interested in, pocket watches from the 18th century and he said dad why don't you do something on a subject that people really care about.",
        "And when it comes to things my son cares about potato chips are front and center.",
        "Well, what kind of research is involved?",
        "Potato chips you open the bag, insert fingers, there you go.",
        "Well, that's certainly the scientific attitude that my son brings to the subject matter.",
        "But I decided to channel my son's interest through a character of a science teacher named Franklin Sparks.",
        "And Franklin Sparks is actually able to come up with all sorts of scientific aspects of potato chip consumption.",
        "So, for example, he forces fifth grade students in the novel to study dichotomous classification of potato chips and exothermic reaction, which means they need to find out why some potato chips burn and others don't when you put a flame under them.",
        "There were all sorts of research..."

        "I was just going to say, also, I mean, how do you preserve these?",
        "I mean, the normal, you know, bag backing, plastic bag in back, that's not going to work with the potato chip.",

        "Ellen is the fortunate owner of one, and my son Max is the fortunate owner of the other known smiley face chip.",

        "The Extermitater is probably my son's favorite, because it involves combustion and trajectory, which is a, the two principle scientific interests of the 10-year-old American boy.",
        "Basically we went to Home Depot and bought a 5-foot length of plastic plumbing pipe, put a cap at the end of one end, shaved down the end of the other, bought a little camping stove lighter, and then, went to the pharmacy and bought some hairspray.",
        "And we also bought about 50 pounds of potatoes, Idaho potatoes.",
        "And the combination allows you to launch potatoes about 20o yards, with a very satisfying 'thunk' sound.",
