        "...Ducey on the ballot, and it's Doug Ducey's agenda.",
        "Ducey hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters, a guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats, including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry.",
        "It was Diaz who approached Ducey for the job because Diaz thinks over the past four years, the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past.",
        "The governor does not support certain language, doesn't support certain policies that the national Republican mood may call for.",
        "He is not suggesting on border security that we need to stop them, we need to keep them out, we need to build a wall.",
        "Not once has he said that.",
        "Now, I cannot vouch for other Republicans.",
        "I am vouching for Doug Ducey.",
        "But under that logic, if Republicans want to appeal partywide to Latino voters, they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric.",
        "And there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that like Abel Hernandez.",
        "Remember him, the truck driver who says immigration's the deal breaker for Hispanics?",
        "Here's the key, Hernandez says.",
        "His kids are going to feel the same way he does.",
        "They see what's going on.",
        "They see how they treat us.",
        "And I tell my kids, you got to vote.",

        "All right.",
        "In other words, Hernandez says, the Republican Party's fate may already be sealed for generations to come.",
        "And as a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party, Governor Ducey will be appearing onstage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President Trump.",
        "You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "I'm Ira Flatow.",

        "Well, in the book, one of the things we talk about is, you know by the way, I should say the book is pretty much a part memoir, and it's also a part polemic, you know, because it talks about evolution and some of the problems with evolution.",
        "But it's not something that most people would put together, punk rock and science.",
        "And part of it was a challenge to myself to try and unify this worldview that I've been crafting for the last 30 years.",
        "And what I think I've come to the conclusion about it is that science is something that challenges authority in the same way that punk rock - the thing that kind of sweeps through the last 30 years of punk is this sentiment of challenging authority.",
        "And, you know, science can't really progress if we don't challenge the currently held view.",

        "And it was mostly - you know, I've thought that being in a punk band wasn't really a wasn't an honest living, so I stayed in college.",

        "You say that science, like punk rock, overturns or attempts to overturn the established way of thinking.",
        "It's revolutionary.",
        "Well, I would say that the thread of consciousness that runs through the punk music, if you can summarize it in any way, it has that grain which I think is an important part of the subculture.",
        "And science, I think, has it as well, because my best teachers were teachers in natural science that told me to go out and observe.",
        "And they motivated their students by telling them that any of you in this classroom can go out and make a revolutionary discovery.",
        "And that was something that really pushed me forward in wanting me that forced me to learn more.",

        "Yes, very much so.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And I think the reason for that is because both of these worlds, they do suffer from lack of public personalities who can talk about them and offer a different viewpoint.",

        "But what I think needs to happen is that the Ivory Tower needs to come down and talk to the general public.",

        "When people ask me what I bill my self as, I bill myself as a naturalist.",
        "And that's because I think naturalism is a belief system.",
