        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Speaking about science and religion, would it be fair to say that even though many scientists consider themselves non-believers in religion or in God, that they still have a faith of their own in science?",

        "Now, there's a lot of overlap with religion and science in the first two parameters because in religion, you can also have observation, and I guess you can have experimentation - hasn't been my experience.",
        "But I think - I trust people when they say that they've experimented with religion.",
        "But that third one, I think, verification, that's the source of all the tension between science and religion.",

        "OK.",

        "And Cohen told the judge that the payments were, quote, \"\"for the principal purpose of influencing the election.\"\" So let me ask you this - what kind of legal exposure could President Trump be facing at this point, given those admissions?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I think the reality is you could be facing pretty significant exposure, as long as you accept that a sitting president can be indicted.",
        "Of course, the president has continued to argue that he can't.",
        "But, you know, Michael Cohen didn't just admit that he made those payments today.",
        "He said that he did it at the behest of the candidate - that is to say then-candidate, now-President Trump.",
        "So, you know, in a normal world, this would be pretty serious charges - that the then-candidate, now-president was directly involved in conspiring to violate federal campaign finance laws.",
        "You know, I think the normal reaction we would expect under our constitutional system would be that this would really provoke Congress and the House of Representatives to start looking seriously at the president.",
        "I think we know enough to know that that's not likely to happen, certainly not with this Congress.",
        "Are you suggesting that impeachment proceedings could be triggered by something like this?",
        "Well, at the very least, I think this is a matter that Congress in the normal course would be expected to want to investigate - that if you accept in our constitutional system that the primary responsibility for holding the president accountable lies with the House of Representatives.",
        "You know, I wouldn't necessarily prejudge the question of whether a president should be impeached for this conduct.",
        "But certainly, if I were Congress, I'd want to find out.",
        "I'd want to, you know, conduct a further investigation.",
        "And let's keep in mind, I mean, the Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal stories have nothing at all to do with the ambit of special counsel Mueller's investigation, which is about Russian interference in the election, part of why special counsel Mueller presumably referred these cases to federal prosecutors in New York.",
