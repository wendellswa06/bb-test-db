        "Do you think part of the calculation is maybe that the mere threat of a no-fly zone may help persuade, for example, some of the military commanders who are still loyal to Colonel Gadhafi, that hey, maybe, you know, you better rethink your position here.",

        "But you're right that the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have stretched U.S.",

        "forces are stretched pretty thin, and that's certainly a factor worth keeping in mind here.",

        "British Prime Minister David Cameron, who is also a little bit of an unlikely person to support this given the steep cuts to the defense ministry they've had there recently, has also said he's instructing his military planners to come up with a scenario for a no-fly.",
        "So those are probably firm supporters.",
        "On the other side, you have Turkey, a NATO member, which is definitely against this.",
        "Russia and probably China will block this in the Security Council, and France, which has said that it will only consider this with a Security Council resolution.",
        "So I'd say, today, it's looking rather less likely.",
        "Okay.",
