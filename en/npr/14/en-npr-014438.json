        "Joshua Keating, talk to me a little bit about, practically, as a no-fly zone is being enforced, this question of pilots perhaps having to engage other pilots.",
        "We heard from one of the callers who called in and talked about actually shooting - do you have any sense of - can the other pilots eject?",
        "Are they warned?",
        "What are the dangers in terms of the actual engagement?",
        "Well, the dangers are first determining who exactly it is you're dealing with.",
        "As I mentioned before, in Iraq, friendly fire was definitely an issue.",
        "So first, it's verifying, and then, it depends - it really - every no-fly zone has its own rules of engagement which are set in whatever resolution imposes it.",
        "So those are going to be determined by whatever countries are imposing the no-fly zone.",
        "But usually, there is some sort of warning process.",
        "They try to scare the plane off, or there are number of measures that planes can take to sort of eject - force pilots to remove themselves from the no-fly zone, hopefully, before shooting.",
        "Those aren't always effective, but yes, it can be an extremely dangerous process done at very high speeds.",
        "And it's important that a sort of clear line of command to set up early in the operation as well.",
        "Is it clear - we talked a little bit about Libya's surface-to-air missiles that they might be able to use.",
        "What kind of fighter jets do they have that might be able to engage with Western planes?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Well, I mean, there's - it's - a no-fly zone is generally only considered in cases where there's sort of overwhelming air superiority, and that's definitely a case here.",
        "I mean, the - as an earlier caller mentioned it, the Libyan air force is pretty - it's sort of aging, Soviet-era Russian planes.",
        "And so I don't think that from that perspective they pose much of a threat to the U.S.",
        "Air Force, you know, what - another thing to consider is Gadhafi has actually not really planned a full-scale military invasion.",
        "We've seen the Libyan military almost crumble in recent days as he has relied increasingly on foreign mercenaries.",
        "And that may be intentional; he's looking at what happened in Egypt and seeing how the military pushed Mubarak out there.",
        "And so he wants, sort of, paid people from outside that he can depend on.",
        "So this really isn't a military strategy we're seeing from Libya.",
        "So that's probably another thing to consider.",
        "And the big question mark hanging over all of this, of course, whether a no-fly zone might actually succeed in pushing Gadhafi out.",
        "You talked a little bit about how - in the case of Saddam Hussein, he managed to carry on for a decade with a no-fly zone, in effect, over at least part of his country.",
        "He did.",
        "And now, we see Gadhafi mostly working on the ground to recapture these cities and using mercenaries to fortify his position around Tripoli.",
        "So, you know, I think that while this is certainly a tactic that can help, the real balance of power, if it does shift, is going to happen on the ground.",
        "And that's what we saw in Iraq as well.",
        "But in the process I think we're contributing to the instability.",
        "Okay.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, we'll be watching closely to see how this debate plays out both here in Washington and at the United Nations and in NATO capitals in Europe.",
        "We've been talking with Joshua Keating of Foreign Policy magazine.",
        "Thanks so much for coming in and joining us."

        "Yes.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Well, apparently we're getting one, or we've already got one, I should say, in Fred Thompson.",
        "He's filling what is perceived by a lot of the political analysts around here as a vacuum on the Republican side.",
        "You know, Thompson, even before he announced this week, was running second in most of the national polls behind Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor.",
        "And after he announced on Jay Leno's show and then had a Web video to announce, he got 110,000 hits, he got 300,000-plus dollars.",

        "And he's out there saying he's going to be the adult in the race, that he's going to be presidential.",
        "Of course, he looks presidential.",
        "He's been playing that role on \"\"Law & Order.\"\" And now he says that with that kind of name identification and acting background, maybe people will draw some analogies to Ronald Reagan.",
        "Okay.",
        "Well, that may be more than half the battle.",
        "The other half, of course, is where does he stand on the issues - issues like Iraq, abortion, taxes, et cetera?",
        "And, well, where does he stand on the issues?",
        "Well, you know, again, this comes back to the vacuum issue, Madeleine, because, you know, without saying it, he's pointing out that someone like Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, has shifted his stances on abortion or that John McCain has trouble with conservatives on issues like immigration, or Rudy Giuliani for socially liberal positions on gays and abortion.",
        "Where you see Thompson taking a stand tends to be on issues like smaller government and saying that clearly - you know, it's interesting.",
        "In his record he's a guy who voted in the Senate against setting a national blood alcohol standard in this country.",
        "And even on saying that the schools shouldn't allow, you know, drugs or anything nearby as a matter of federal law, he opposes having the federal government play that role.",
        "So when it comes to abortion, his stand has been, well, mostly opposed to abortion, although he then lobbied for a pro-abortion group here in Washington.",
        "On things like affirmative action, he's been yes and no. And on Iraq, he's pretty much taken a tough line.",
        "Well, let's talk a little bit about Iraq and foreign policy.",
        "The debate that we mentioned, the GOP debate, on Wednesday, Thompson was not there.",
        "But moderator Brit Hume laid out a hypothetical question.",
        "Let's, he said, imagine a bolder nuclear-armed Iran flexing its muscles in Iraq, making threats against Israel, and he asked the candidates there, what would you do?",
        "And let's listen to some of their answers.",
        "We should back off.",
