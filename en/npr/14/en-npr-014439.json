        "The tragedy of that, Roland, is that you do have housing discrimination, and there are excellent public schools in many suburban communities.",
        "So you don't even have to send your kid to private school.",
        "So you can do it within a public school setting.",
        "Right.",
        "But let me raise this, and, Rochelle, pick this up, if you will.",
        "Here is the controversy that's whispered, Cosby put it out, up front and in different words, obviously, but the question of whether or not people who are mis-served, underserved by education in this country even care any more to a great degree.",
        "There are whispers that the black community has somehow lost its way when understanding the importance of education, that young people will say to older blacks, `Look, you know, you guys played the game, and still didn't get you ahead.",
        "So why bother with it?'",
        "Well, we're dealing with two issues here and Roland is exactly right.",
        "You're talking about the most segregated metro area in America where we've got a city that's 87 percent black surrounded by suburbs that are, oh, possibly 80 percent white.",
        "Those suburban schools, as George said, are excellent.",
        "But if you are priced out of a market where the school is good, you're forced to deal with the schools that you have.",
        "And, quite frankly, there are people who have given up, and I've spoken with them, who say their kids aren't smart enough to waste money on private schools.",
        "They're not interested in doing that.",
        "It's not every parent, but there are lots of parents like that.",
        "But the bigger issue is you've got an entire community that has given up on a school district.",
        "And we're talking about a public school district that needed to educate hundreds of thousands of kids, and those kids are leaving.",
        "They're not leaving and going to other schools, they're just dropping out.",
        "Well, here in Detroit where you could go and work at the car plant, the auto industry, and make a great middle-class living, you can't do that anymore because that requires a college education.",
        "So these kids are being lost.",
        "(Soundbite of music)",
        "...it really should be, and so you're absolutely right.",
        "We should not be silent as relates to what is taking place in Chicago.",
        "A study released said that 50 percent of young black boys will not graduate from high school.",
        "I have yet to see a rally or a march or any sort of public demonstration that speaks to that issue.",
        "I've yet to see the religious community, I've yet to see all these community activists step up and say, `We're going to address this particular issue.",
        "We have to understand that the failure to educate our children is as important as racial profiling, as civil rights and as economic rights.'",
        "All right.",
        "Let me move us to something where we do see anger, and that's anger from the White House.",
        "George Bush is lashing out against those, including his constituency, if you will, some conservative groups, who are suggesting to him that he should not, underlining should not, enter Attorney General Gonzales' name in terms of the empty seat on the Supreme Court, saying that that vacancy should be filled by someone who is clearly more conservative, who will not waver in certain areas.",
        "Like it or not, like him or not, like the administration or not, Roland Martin, one of the things that was said about George Bush on the plus side is he is a loyal person.",
        "And you see this, if nothing else, right here.",
        "He's a loyal person.",
        "Both of them are from Texas.",
        "Gonzales served on the Texas State Supreme Court, so it's not surprising that Bush would come to his defense.",

        "What we see is...",
        "George Curry, this certainly helps in the sense that he is in the second term of his presidency and he doesn't have to be as--quite as beholding to these groups as he would be had he been in his first.",
        "Well, you're right about that, but my guess is that he'll appoint somebody else and then make Gonzales as a second appointment.",
        "There's no wonder Bush would want to put on the court Moore because he's intrigued by this whole idea of putting the first Latino on a Supreme Court.",
        "But what we see and now hear is a rise of single issue groups that just based on one issue...",

        "Here is someone who clearly is of the Bush cloth, if you will, cut of the same cloth, yet I suspect that there will be Democrats and liberals who will not see him as ultraconservative.",

        "And people on the right are suggesting that this video has too often been seen as left leaning, that it shows an overview of many of the things that happen on the grounds by the Lincoln Memorial, many of the rallies and the like.",
        "And the suggestion was from the \"\"I Have A Dream\"\" speech and others that they were too right leaning--or left leaning, that they needed more balance politically.",

        "Go ahead.",
        "Exactly.",
        "I think that part of the problem is there are two sad things here.",
        "This would be hilarious if it were not so sad, that you've got people who are trying to not only revise history but they're actually doing this because they think, according to news reports, that this will make people feel that Lincoln felt a certain way.",
        "Now that is the saddest of all, that someone who would go to a statue that represents freedom, is symbolic of a type of freedom and to raise issues.",
        "And conservatives, many of them who have never had to march or to demonstrate for anything, now want to make sure they intersperse some images of themselves because they want people to believe that they are as close to Lincoln as other people who view him as a sign of freedom.",
        "That is really sad, but coming from an administration that is expert in revisionism, I'm not surprised by anything.",
        "Well, my thinking if there were no--I mean, I look at the flip side.",
        "If there were no images from other marches, if there were only conservative--so-called conservative marches, there would be a hue and outcry, as well.",
        "And so I don't necessarily think it is an issue of--well, what videos we show.",
        "I do think, you know, what offends me is this whole--as Rochelle said, this whole joke, this sick joke that somehow Lincoln would have supported these various issues.",
        "But this is also where, I think, the left needs to also challenge the right in that these are the same folks who drape themselves in Dr. Martin Luther King and his speeches, and who also walk around talking about how great Lincoln was and being the party of Lincoln, yet they refuse to even hold up to those various ideals today.",
        "And so I think that's where you can challenge them on this notion.",
        "Yeah, but to say, `Oh, this video implies that he would support abortion, homosexuality,' that's ridiculous.",
        "It's also important to challenge the left, too, as you--and I know you agree with me on this one, Roland and Rochelle.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "Because we don't do enough of that.",
        "I mean, whether you agree or not, conservatives motivate their base.",
