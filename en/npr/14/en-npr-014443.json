        "And I have read those pages, but it seems to me that it's a logical way to begin negotiations.",
        "That one side puts out something, the other side comes back and then you find a place somewhere in the middle, perhaps, to find the right compromise.",
        "Back to France and China - or Russia and China - they do a lot of business with Iran.",
        "So they're probably trying to have it both ways, to try to find some solution to this impasse, but not really totally offend or alienate Iran because of the business that they're doing with them, both in terms of oil and in other commodities.",
        "Michael Meyers, before we move on…",
        "And speaking of oil…",
        "Go ahead, Laura.",
        "We can talk all this tough talk we want, but when it comes down to brass tacks, we've got a real oil problem in this country.",
        "We've got, you know, gasoline prices that are out of control.",
        "If we play too hard of a hardball with Iran, we're going to hurt our own interests in terms of oil prices.",
        "Iran controls and produces a lot of the oil that our nation needs.",
        "And so we can play tough but id don't think we want to be too tough.",
        "And that moves to the question I was going to ask, Michael Meyers - very broad, admittedly, Michael - but when Laura brings up that and some of the other issues that would certainly come into play, not publicly but privately, do you think the Bush administration, and perhaps America in general, understands the instability in this region and what it could mean down the line for its effects on America?",
        "Of course.",
        "The answer is it's all about oil.",
        "Iraq is about oil.",
        "Iran is about oil.",
        "Mideast is about oil.",
        "It's all about getting the United States, which is dependent on oil, keeping access to that rich wealth of oil.",
        "So whether you talk to Iran or Switzerland talks to Iran on our behalf, whether or not we have enough troops to make the situation in Iraq sensible and not have enough troops to fight and attack Iran."

        "And he talked to the collective in terms of black leadership today, and he's suggesting that many potential black leaders are falling under the spell of what he called, a quote, gangster mentality and that is preventing them from becoming positive impacts, not only in politics, but within the community.",
        "Here's a quote from Sharpton in talking about the want for young black leaders to step up: No one broke in my house in Brooklyn and dragged me out of the projects to make me a leader.",
        "I wanted to do that.",
        "Clearly we would work with young people - talking about his National Action Network - who want to do the work."

        "But there are many young people who are running organizations, who are working in grassroots efforts -politically and in nonprofit arena - who are not gangsters, who are not part of that arena.",
        "And the gangster folks, they do have influence through music, through videos, through movies, but they aren't my definition of leader.",

        "I think it's good for Al Sharpton to be out there, be vocal.",
        "I don't agree with everything that he takes on, all of his issues, but nobody else in this presidential race on the Democratic or Republican side are going to be saying that he's saying and he needs to say.",

        "Something interesting, too, E.R., that he suggested that the media - as he's speaking to the journalists - should be careful reporting that blacks are moving toward Republican leadership.",
        "Now we know that this is a biased man talking from the Democratic side.",
        "But he said that blacks are moving toward the Republican leadership position as this year's black GOP candidates, quote, may be yesterday's news come November.",
        "Now is this just a fine Democrats speaking or is there some credence in what he says?",
        "Well, it's definitely a partisan statement.",
