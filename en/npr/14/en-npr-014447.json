        "There's already a limited laptop ban in place for certain flights now.",
        "What more is happening?",
        "Well, what Secretary Kelly announced today is that there will be new security measures applied to all commercial airline flights coming into the U.S.",
        "from abroad.",
        "This includes enhanced screening of all electronic devices.",
        "They're particularly worried about laptops and anything really larger than your cell phone or smartphone.",
        "And there will be more thorough passenger vetting.",
        "There will be new measures to head off any threats from insider attacks.",
        "That means people who work at the airport or work for the airlines.",
        "They're going to require the airlines to acquire some more sophisticated screening equipment, better technology and even use better explosive-detecting dogs better to try to determine if there are bombs being smuggled on to flights and if there is a legitimate threat there.",
        "Why does Secretary Kelly say this is necessary?",
        "He thinks that there is renewed interest among terrorist groups in bringing down a jetliner, particularly those that would be coming to the U.S.",
        "And he cites the downing of the Russian Metrojet airplane in 2015 that had been leaving Egypt and killed all 224 people onboard.",
        "He says that that was likely caused by a bomb hidden inside of a laptop, and he thinks this is a very legitimate threat that this administration needs to take seriously."
