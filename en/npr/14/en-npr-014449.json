        "Shook makes a point of calling it soil to remind people that this is a vital natural resource essential for growing food.",
        "And it's been blowing away ever since farmers first plowed up the prairie, gradually or catastrophically, in the case of the dustbowl in the 1930s.",
        "And Shook says the problem is getting worse again, driven by more frequent droughts but also because farmers again have taken land where grass used to grow and plowed it up, exposing vulnerable soil.",
        "The first soil storm that I saw was in 2013.",
        "And that was about the height of all of the grassland conversion that was happening in this area.",
        "And this is where government policy comes in.",
        "The Department of Agriculture rents land from farmers and pays them to grow grass or trees or wild flowers to protect the soil and also provide habitat for wildlife.",
        "It's called the Conservation Reserve Program or CRP.",
        "And 10 years ago, across the country, there was more land in the CRP than in the entire state of New York.",
        "In North Dakota, it was huge.",
        "CRP land covered 5,000 square miles.",
        "Then farming got more profitable, and farmers let those contracts expire.",
        "They plowed and planted more valuable crops like corn and soybeans.",
        "The amount of CRP land in North Dakota fell by more than half.",
        "And according to environmentalist Craig Cox, this means billions of dollars that the government spent protecting that land was basically wasted.",
        "We're not making lasting change.",
        "The benefit is lost really quickly.",
        "Cox is an expert on farming at the Environmental Working Group, which just released a report calling for the government to stop protecting land just for 10 years at a time.",
        "Instead, he says the government should expand programs that paid landowners for long-term easements, protecting land from plowing for the next 30 years or forever.",
        "That's where you really start to make environmental gains.",
        "Buying up rights to plant crops is expensive, though.",
        "So the government would have to spend its money just in the places where it can do the most good, places, for instance, where that money will keep the most soil from blowing away.",

        "The University of Southern California and the National Football League gathered close to 100 seventh and eighth graders for a three week football camp that taught them that much of football is hard work, discipline and study.",
        "So the youngsters studied math, science and English, as well as blocking, tackling and passing.",
        "They calculated Peyton Manning's passing percentage and made paper airplanes that simulated the aerodynamics of a thrown football."

        "I'm actually surprise to find that climate is not a significant an issue as one might think, and I don't know if that's because our demographic is really more practical than anything else and just figures all right, climate's an issue, but energy is really where we're going to solve it.",
        "Well, I guess that is sort of interrelated.",
        "Aren't they?",
        "If you go to green energy, then you might help abate the climate problem.",

        "They also care very much about research itself and I believe Obama has actually promised not only to double the NIH budget, but also to double basic research funding at the Department of Defense and at the National Science Foundation, really just going across the board with it.",
        "And if you can do that, that's a wonderful think because I think that it's difficult to sell science sometimes, and people will say, well my God, you know, my mortgage is coming due, and I my 401(k) is falling apart and why are we funding research on jelly fish?",
        "And of course, it turns out to be very important and maybe that's what can drive the new economy.",

        "I'm teaching Information Resources in Science and Technology, and I really think education is critical to the future for our country as well as the disciplines.",
        "And do you think that should be at the top of the list?",
        "Well, I think no, not necessarily at the top.",
        "I think the top priority for me is that we should balance the money that we're spending between basic and applied science, because I think both of them are important.",
        "We also should emphasize the education of not only our scientists and engineers, but our teachers of science as well.",
        "And finally, for those librarians of the future, I would like to see some money put aside for teaching the librarians because they are important part in that whole process.",
        "Very interesting.",

        "As a teacher, do you see enough science teachers going through your university?",
        "No, these students that I'm teaching actually have are liberal arts students.",
        "So, we spend a great deal of our time talking about the importance of science, how it fits in to their daily lives and how, you know, how they can use it.",
        "And it's wonderful to see that they all catch on, even though there are History and English - it's a graduate program.",
        "They have undergraduate degrees in History and English fields a lot of times, but they're excited about it.",
        "Well, thank you very much for calling.",
        "Thank you.",
