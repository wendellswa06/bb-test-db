        "And I would love to see that done at the national level.",
        "I think stem cell research is fantastic but let's make sure that we can actually afford to grow new hearts and new limbs and treat the diseases."

        "Hi.",
        "Thanks for putting me through.",
        "I guess my comment is really just a follow up on a statement just made which is that the most important thing that a president can do is really reestablishing the link between policy and science.",
        "There's so many great scientists out there, and the science tends to move a lot faster than a policy does.",
        "And as a result, in the last eight years, when you break that link, change is hard to come by.",
        "But I think if we start listening to the scientists, both in the government and the private sector, we can move policy forward a lot quicker.",
        "So linking policy and science again.",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "And did you think you sort of lost trust in science and politics?",
        "Well, I think there's just been a disconnect.",
        "There's been a lot of partisanship interjected into science that occurs at the federal level and as soon as we start breaking down those partisan barriers that the president-elect promises to do, I think we could start seeing a lot of progress in science that's already been completed and research that's already been done.",
        "OK.",
        "Thanks for the call.",
        "I'm very happy you brought that up.",
        "That's actually the question of linking science and policy and also, just having integrity in federal research.",
        "It didn't start with the Bush administration by any stretch, but in the last eight years, we've seen the politicization of federal science and everything from climate change, of course, to the status of polar bears, to infant formula guidelines.",
        "It's just across the board and then when it comes to the federal advisory committees that inform many of our decisions, we've seen independent experts often pushed aside in favor of people from the industries, or who have conflicts of interest, and there's a lot of trust to be built there.",
        "And once that trust is built, then we can inform the policy with good science.",
        "We have a tweet from Sick Days who writes how about a broadband internet for everybody?",
        "Make sure everybody in our nation - everybody has broadband internet coming.",
        "I won't complain, especially if I can pay less than I do now."
