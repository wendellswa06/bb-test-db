        "And so what specific criticisms of Snyder's role are there?",
        "Well, there're two.",
        "One is the one that it happened in the first place.",
        "And then as it turned out, state environmental regulators didn't make sure that the proper protections were in place - that the water was treated properly once they started drawing it from the city of Flint and then denied that there was a problem.",
        "And this went on for months and months and months before anyone at the state level acknowledged that it was real.",
        "In the meantime, local activists, a pediatrician in Flint and some researchers from out-of-state came in and kept saying, look there's a problem, and finally the state had to acknowledge that it was true.",
        "This has become part of the presidential campaign.",
        "Hillary Clinton framed this as a racial issue because Flint is a majority-black city.",
        "What are people saying in Michigan about that element of this?",
        "Well, one of the criticisms of the emergency management law that we were talking about - the one that allows the state to step in and essentially take over a city that is struggling financially.",
        "It famously happened in Detroit and wound up with the bankruptcy - is that the communities that are taken over, the cities and the school districts, are almost always primarily minority communities.",
        "That's certainly something that people talk about when it comes to this.",
        "Has Governor Snyder had a good opportunity to defend himself?",
        "Governor Snyder was very late to defend himself.",
        "And for the longest time, basically, his administration denied that there was a problem at all, sometimes almost fiercely denied that there was a problem.",
        "Now he is starting to acknowledge culpability.",
        "Although in an interview with the National Journal, he kind of dumped it on environmental officials saying that they hadn't gotten the change memo - those are his words - when it comes to how public agencies are supposed to operate.",
        "That's Rick Pluta of Michigan Public Radio.",
        "Thanks very much.",
        "A pleasure, Steve.",
        "If you've heard in the last 24 hours that Donald Trump has hired, quote, \"\"the most dangerous political operative in America,\"\" you can thank Bloomberg Businessweek and journalist Joshua Green.",
        "Last fall Green wrote a profile that bestowed that title on Steve Bannon, and Bannon is Trump's new campaign chief and chairman of Breitbart News.",
        "Bannon took over shortly after the news site's founder, conservative firebrand Andrew Breitbart, died back in 2012.",
        "Now, for more on Steve Bannon and what he might bring to the Trump team, Joshua Green is here in the studio.",
        "Welcome to the program."

        "Good to be with you.",
        "So for everyone who might not be familiar, Breitbart in a nutshell...",
        "Breitbart is what I would describe as a right wing populist ethno-nationalist website that really appeals to this splinter group of conservatives who are known collectively as the alt-right.",
        "They sort of define themselves as anti-Washington, anti-political, anti-corruption activists who just happen to practice a form of media activist journalism, I guess you'd call it.",
        "And there's a strain of - I guess you're saying - nativism that runs through this and ethnocentrism.",
        "Nativism, ethnocentrism, a lot of racial paranoia.",
        "They were out and ran the Shirley Sherrod story, demonizing the former Agriculture Department employee who was depicted in a video tape that turned out to have been sort of dishonestly spliced seeming to make racist comments against white people - turned out that she wasn't.",
        "They're very kind of tied in with the far-right mentality that views this all as some great cultural struggle, and they're very much on the side of Trump.",
        "But essentially Bannon and Breitbart News really predate Trumpism.",
        "They were writing about these sorts of things years before Trump ever came along, and in a sense, he is a vessel for the kind of things that they care about.",
        "So tell us about Steve Bannon.",
        "What did he do before he was chairman of Breitbart?",
        "Well, so Bannon is a strange and colorful character, especially for Washington.",
        "I mean he reminds me sort of a swashbuckling pirate captain who gleefully attacks Republicans and Democrats alike.",
        "He grew up in Virginia.",
        "He's an ex naval officer who wound up going to Harvard Business School in the '80s, became captivated by Ronald Reagan, moved on to become an investment banker at Goldman Sachs and then moved out to Hollywood where he opened his own boutique investing firm and essentially did big media deals.",
        "He actually negotiated a deal where as part of his payment, in lieu of money, he took syndication rights to the TV show \"\"Seinfeld,\"\" which at the time was just starting out but, as you can imagine, wound up being very, very lucrative.",
        "And he moved from there into film making, did films about Sarah Palin.",
        "And this led him into the Tea Party movement and eventually to Andrew Breitbart.",
        "You can hear Mark Kurlansky recite the full version of \"\"Nebraskans Eat the Wieners\"\" on our Web site at npr.org."

        "This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.",
        "I'm Melissa Block.",
        "If you've been wondering why your food dollar has shrunk so dramatically, here are some numbers that help explain it.",
        "The price of large grade A eggs has gone up 35 percent over last year.",
        "Fresh whole milk is up 23 percent.",
        "And flour, up 37 percent.",
        "As prices soar, we wondered how food banks are feeling the effects as they try to provide for the hungry.",
        "We've called Bob Evans in Mesa, Arizona.",
        "He's president of the United Food Bank, which serves five counties, 40 percent of Arizona's population.",
        "Mr. Evans, thanks for being with us.",
        "Thank you for having me.",
        "As food prices rise, are you seeing more and more people showing up at food pantries and soup kitchens around Arizona?",
        "We go on the number of agencies that we served and they're up by at least 10 percent, so, extrapolating down the headcount, I'm just really not sure how much more there is, but it's quite a bit.",
        "And when did you really start noticing those numbers going up?",
        "Within the last 12 to 18 months they started to creep up, and now, it's not a creep anymore, it's a, it's an escalating movement upward.",
        "If it's going back that far, it sounds like it's not tied just with the increase in food prices, it's - also must be tied in with the economy overall and the downturn.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "We're seeing folks in our lines who never would've thought they would be in a line asking for food assistance before.",
        "On the supply side, in terms of the food that you're trying to provide, what's happening, first of all, with donations, the food or the money that people are giving you?"

        "Well, the individual donations seem to be holding pretty good.",
        "That's not a large stream on the food side of where our food comes from, but we're doing pretty good there.",
        "Our two biggest losses of food in incoming food streams are from our USDA commodities and the fresh produce that's so vital to our folks.",
        "And what's happened there?",
        "Well, the USDA commodities were seeing a loss of the entitlement program, and the wonderful bonus product that used to be available to food banks and the school systems has dried up considerably.",
        "In total, our incoming food is down by probably 14 to 15 percent from the same time last year.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "With the increased demand at the same time.",
        "Yes, ma'am.",

        "I imagine fuel prices have to be factoring in here, as well, not just in the cost of food, but in how you get the food out there.",
        "Oh yeah, we're paying diesel fuel prices to run our rigs all over to pick up and distribute food and we're seeing at least a 20 percent increase in the same time last year just in transportation costs alone.",

        "Now to Baltimore and to Deborah Flateman, who is CEO of the Maryland Food Bank, which serves the entire state.",
        "And Ms. Flateman, we just heard Bob Evans talking about a 10 percent increase in demand, how does that fit with what you are seeing in Maryland?",
        "Well, I'll tell you that, anecdotally, what we're hearing from our agencies and our network is that some of them are seeing as much as a 25 percent increase.",
        "And most of the people who were coming to a lot of food shelves these days are people who are holding down, sometimes two and three jobs, but still have to go and look for support to feed their families.",
        "Have you been hearing stories of people who are definitely hit by rising food prices, just the amount of they could afford to buy is cut back so dramatically that they are ending up coming to you?",
        "The rising cost of food is affecting even those in poverty, because those in poverty are eligible for food stamps.",
        "And food - and the formula for distributing food stamps is very basic, doesn't change, it's very static.",
        "And so, whatever dollars they are getting in food stamps now are not going as far.",
        "When did you see those numbers of people showing up really start to rise?",
        "You know, it's really been happening over time.",
        "This isn't an acute thing that we've just seen overnight because of the housing crisis or anything like that.",
        "And as hard as food banks and all of us in our industry work to try to meet the need, we're definitely paddling upstream.",
        "Ms.",
        "Flateman, look forward a bit for us, if you could, I mean, do you see the situation with the food banks that you work with getting better anytime soon?",
        "I would probably say no. The challenge that the Maryland Food Bank faces is that, you know, we're on track to distribute 15 million pounds of food this year.",
        "That is a four-million pound increase over last year.",
        "Obviously, all of these environmental factors that cause for deeper poverty, that cause for working people having to access emergency feeding, that makes the picture all the dimmer.",
        "Well, Deborah Flateman, it's good of you to talk to us.",
        "Thanks so much.",
