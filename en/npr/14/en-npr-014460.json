        "Well, yes, it is more or less the same.",
        "People form preference groups.",
        "They go to different sides of the room to show their support for their candidate and then they're counted up.",
        "So it is very much like Iowa, except that it is clear we are not in Iowa anymore because I was at Caesar's Palace where just an incredibly diverse group of voters came out to support their candidates.",
        "There were people wearing their uniforms.",
        "So there were the chef's coats and housekeepers in their blue housekeeping jackets and cocktail waitresses in their cocktail dresses.",

        "And you can tell it was a pretty raucous scene with people cheering for their candidates.",
        "And the final result at Caesar's Palace was 28 delegates for Hillary Clinton and 12 delegates for Bernie Sanders.",
        "So Tam, just briefly before we turn to Don, you said it's raucous.",

        "One is, as long as it's happening, then we should all be advocating for the health of women.",

        "And then after you check in, there's another one before you get to the gate.",
        "So anybody transiting, for instance, through Ataturk Airport would be behind two security barriers and pretty far away from where this attack took place.",
        "But that's no consolation if you're one of these dozens of families with victims now.",

        "You know, the answer seems to be more intelligence, stop the attacks.",
        "And that, of course, as we've seen, is also extremely hard.",

        "And Turkish authorities already talking about ISIS - but is it too early?",

        "And important to talk about this for a minute, Peter - I mean, people have heard about the Kurds as being allies with the United States in the fight against ISIS.",
        "But you bring up the PKK, which is a Kurdish group that has been considered a terrorist group by the United States and other countries, right?",
        "Yes, absolutely.",

        "We've got to fight, them, too.",
        "So it's a big problem.",
