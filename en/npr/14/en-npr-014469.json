        "The decision - one, the mere decision to carry the child to term, you know, can be seen to be the sort of ideological choice, in a sense.",
        "And two, then the decision to sort of publicize the decision and to - I mean, Palin incorporated special needs children into her speeches.",
        "Santorum cut a video - I think for Iowa - sort of focusing on Bella - a tremendously moving video, but a video that was clearly designed to make a kind of appeal to pro-life voters.",
        "And again, once the politician decides that they're sort of - that they're going to blur the personal and political in this way, you have to expect that people – again, often stupidly and offensively, but are, you know, are going to push back.",
        "And in Palin's case, it was, you know, these conspiracy theories about how Trig Palin wasn't really her child.",
        "And again, I thought - I think that they were ridiculous, but it wouldn't be fair for Palin to just say, well, you know, I have a right to privacy, because she's already sort of recognized that that line blurs.",
        "And the analogy that I drew maybe persuasive, maybe not, is that, if you're a politician in the Jim Crow South, right, where sex and reproduction are less contested, but race is clearly contested.",
        "For a politician to - a white politician to marry a black woman, right, in, say, Alabama 1932, that's inevitably a political as well personal statement, in a sense.",
        "And you have to - if you're a white politician who married a black woman, you would have to be ready for the blowback.",
        "So Santorum and Palin need to be ready for the blowback as well.",
        "Then does that extend to, well, politicians' families?",
        "There is no politician - and you think of President Obama, his daughters, Malia and Sasha - appear from time to time.",

        "Right.",
        "...not part of his narrative in the same way.",
        "Are they fair game?",
        "I think they're only fair game if there were a situation in which, you know, if President Obama starts citing Sasha or Malia to make a point about public education, and his position on public education, right?",
        "And how his position is vindicated by the experiences of his daughters.",
        "Then it would be perfectly reasonably...",

        "Who do not attend - right.",
        "So that would be a pretty - right - a pretty ineffective way of making the point.",
        "But just, you know, in the same way, you know, for a commentator, for instance, the way people did with Chelsea Clinton, right, to make fun of a public figure's child's appearance, I think clearly - I mean, you know, it's going to happen.",
        "But I think it clearly crosses a line, and it would be best if that didn't happen.",
        "But when the politician employs his children's lives, their stories as part of his, sort of, political or ideological narrative, then the, you know, the sort of claim that, oh, but they have to have their privacy as well, gets harder to make."

        "And I think it's a similar thing, where it's easier to say a politician's marital life is none of your business in an era when the definition of marriage isn't contested.",
        "And if the definition is contested, then the fact that Newt Gingrich has had two divorces and three wives – it's reasonable to say, well, that shows that, you know, how can we take him seriously in his argument for traditional marriage if he doesn't seem to take traditional marriage seriously himself?",

        "But it was hard to imagine in 1963, that becoming a cultural war flashpoint because at that point, you know, there was a debate about abortion in the United States in early 1960s.",
