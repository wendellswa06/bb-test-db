        "And right about that same time, the new triple therapy came out and with a shorter treatment option.",

        "Well, grueling is a really good way to put that.",

        "And during treatment, I could not walk to the mailbox.",
        "Yes.",
        "I must emphasize here, we did not look for specific environmental factors.",

        "There are a number of studies which have been carried out, so we know, for example, that adversities during pregnancies increase the risk for a child to be later diagnosed with autism.",
        "We also know that extreme prematurity also increases the risk to develop autism.",
        "So we have some hints, but none of these has such a strong effect which explains the data we found very easily.",
        "So we need, really, to look much more carefully at some of these factors much more specifically.",
        "The assumption must be that there is something out there.",
        "I mean, as most psychiatrists will say, the rate of autism has increased.",
        "I mean, that is a fact, right?",
        "I mean, there are more children diagnosed with autism today than ever before.",
        "Yes.",
        "There's no doubt that there are many, many more children diagnosed with autism than ever before.",
        "There's a lot of discussion how much this is due, basically, to a better detection.",
        "There is also a lot of discussion how much we have broadened our view about the symptoms of autism.",
        "Whether this explains all of the increase, I have doubts.",
        "But it's - again, it's a very, very complicated issue, and a lot of research is going on, also, in this area.",
        "I know that this is a little bit beyond your research here specifically, but there had been some theories that age may have to do with it, the age of a mother.",
        "Yes.",
        "There are two factors here.",
        "One is the age of the mother and the age of the father.",
        "It looks like the older the mother, the higher is the chance that the child receives a diagnosis of autism.",
        "And the same applies, also, to the father.",
        "There's a - fairly large studies - has been conducted here in California, where they show that both of these factors play a role."

        "I suppose autism is also confounding, in quite a similar way.",
        "Yes.",
        "Now, autism is, I think, also very complicated because everything we have to say has to be seen on the backgrounds since there are probably multiple different forms of autism.",
        "And I think we have to really, really be very careful to look at both environmental and genetic factors, look at the interaction - and then really drill down, so to speak, piece after piece after piece, to really then get into the individual subgroups of autism and find out what is causing these groups.",
