        "We have hundreds of tons of biomass produced by our processes, so it seems logical that if the country wants green power - and it's said that it does - that we should try to extract the most value from those little pounds of biomass, and make electricity as well as heat.",

        "Actually, no, 'cause this is all part of the natural carbon cycle.",
        "The carbon is going to be released from that wood, whether it's decaying in the forest, or whether it's burned in controlled slash piles as a forest management technique, or just trees dying and decaying themselves.",

        "And even then, you have to wait for the benefit - basically, the time it takes for the trees to regrow and reabsorb carbon."
