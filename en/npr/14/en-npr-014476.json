        "does it prejudice a jury to see a victim's family wearing buttons or engaging in some other form of silent protest?",
        "The court ducked that question today, seeming to warn the lower courts about the practice without actually barring it.",
        "NPR's Nina Totenberg reports.",
        "In the past, the Supreme Court has ruled that having defendants wear prison clothing when they appear before a jury impermissibly prejudices the defendant's right to a fair trial.",
        "And the court has struck down convictions in cases where there was a mob atmosphere or circus atmosphere in the courtroom.",
        "But the court has never ruled on whether spectators can wear buttons or make other kinds of silent statements.",
        "This term, the court accepted a case for review that could have answered that question, but it was a state case involving intervention by the lower federal courts.",
        "And that for reasons only lawyers can love complicated things a lot.",
        "The case involved a California murder.",
        "The defendant, Matthew Musladin, claimed he was acting in self-defense when he killed his estranged wife's boyfriend.",
        "At trial, the victim's family wore buttons that bore a picture of the dead man taken when he was in the military and wearing a uniform.",
        "The defense claimed that was an appeal for sympathy and was misleading since the victim no longer was in the military and had drugs in his blood when he died.",
        "Musladin was convicted and sentenced to 32 years to life in prison.",
        "A conviction upheld by the state courts.",
        "But a federal appeals court overturned the conviction ruling that the buttons had impermissibly prejudiced the jury.",
        "Today, the U.S.",
        "Supreme Court unanimously reinstated the conviction ruling as it has before that under a federal law enacted in 1996, federal courts may not order a new trial in a case where the state courts have not violated the explicit decisions of the U.S.",
        "Supreme Court.",
        "Writing for the court, Justice Clarence Thomas said that the high court has simply never made any rulings barring spectator conduct of this kind, thus it cannot be said that the California courts unreasonably applied clearly established federal law, and the federal courts had no business intervening in the case.",
        "Three justices, Kennedy, Stevens and Souter wrote concurring opinions strongly suggesting that allowing spectators to wear buttons is so potentially prejudicial that in future, the court could indeed adopt a rule barring the practice.",
        "Justice Kennedy was the most direct saying this case suggests there is a need for a new rule.",
        "Said Justice Souter, one couldn't seriously deny that allowing spectators at a criminal trial to wear visible buttons with the victim's photo can raise a risk of prejudicing a jury.",
        "Well, they fall under copyright protection as works of art, as sculptures because the designs are sewn onto canvas and other materials and they are worn not as costumes, but they're worn over clothing.",
        "So they're not functional, which qualifies them for copyright protection as a sculptural work of art pursuant to the copyright act."

        "And how would this work in practice?",
        "If someone were to take a picture, say, of a Mardi Gras Indian wearing a copyrighted suit, then what?",
        "Well, it depends.",
        "If the photograph depicts the suit as the primary focus of the subject matter, then I would argue that would qualify as a derivative work.",
        "Let's say someone takes a photograph of Chief Howard's suit and they're selling it in commerce.",
        "Well, then he's got recourse in a court of law.",
        "Chief Miller, what would you hope after this year's Mardi Gras parade, what would you hope might be different for you and the tribe?",
        "Well, I just would hope that if we are exploited, then we can be compensated for it because it's a lot goes into the suits - time, hour, blood, sweat, tears, money.",
        "And so, it is only fair that I think that we should be able to be compensated if someone else is going to be paid for it.",
        "So, you're not talking about just your average tourist lining a Mardi Gras parade route.",
        "You're talking about maybe a calendar or a poster book or something like that.",
        "That's exactly what I'm talking about.",
        "We have no problem with people taking pictures for education purpose, for, you know, if you want to take a picture for your private - you know, you have in your home.",
        "There's no problem with that.",
        "It's just - if you want to take it to make money, then that's where we say we should be also compensated.",
