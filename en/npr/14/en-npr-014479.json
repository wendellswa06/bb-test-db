        "From a diplomatic and communications point of view, I think, with the benefit of hindsight, we would say that probably he could have found another way to get started.",
        "But seen within the logic of his argument, he actually didn't stop his quote from the emperor there.",
        "The emperor goes on to talk about the essential nature of rational reflection within reason, that when religious people don't behave rationally, they can end up doing extreme and violent things.",
        "And I think within the context of the pope's argument, the fact that this was a reference to Islam was almost irrelevant.",

        "John Allen, up until now, what has the pope's position on Islam been?",

        "Well, I think this is one of the few areas of clear substantive contrast between Benedict and John Paul.",
        "Benedict does clearly have a tougher line in Islam, especially around the issues of terrorism, religious violence, and also what the Vatican calls reciprocity, meaning the demand that Muslim governments ought to show the same respect for religious freedom as Western governments do.",

        "When - if I may just say, I think that there is a perfectly legitimate critique to be made of choice of the pope's words.",
