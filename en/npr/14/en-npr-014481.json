        "Didn't want you pick up the jobs out of the hall or when you do get them out, you come out on the job site, well, the means didn't want to work underneath you, underneath the crane because it's a black man driving it, a black man driving the winches and all of that old kind of crap, you know.",

        "Clovijean, what about black women?",
        "It was a struggle for us, you know.",
        "We had to stand up.",
        "A lot of women maybe walked away from the job, you know, didn't want to ever come back on the waterfront.",
        "But as a whole, if you stayed and you worked it out, and you learn your job and you apply yourself, you could advance.",
        "Personally, I stayed focused on what I wanted, and I went forward with it.",
        "And opened up the doors for other women to come in behind me.",
        "You know, just stuck to it.",
        "And my father always told me, you go down that waterfront, you can be anybody you want to be.",
