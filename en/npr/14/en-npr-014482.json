        "So, for example, in the case of women who are married to men who become sick, if the man has a psychiatric disease, or if the man has dementia, it's actually more harmful to the wife than if the man was dead.",
        "In other words, a spouse is at greater risk of dying while watching a partner sick with dementia or a psychiatric illness, and then becomes less likely to die once the spouse with one of those conditions dies.",

        "And early in the morning, just as dawn was about to break and the light was conquering the darkness of night, they won the battle.",
        "And to emulate the sound of the battle, you have fireworks going off now.",
        "And light, traditionally, is associated in Hindu philosophy with reality and with immortality.",
        "And so the traditional prayer from a 6th Century text says, lead me from what is not real to what is real.",
        "Lead me from darkness to light.",
        "Lead me from death to immortality.",
        "And so it's this sense of immortality, which is underlying the festival.",
