        "And sometimes they'll board the plane and find out their seats have been separated.",
        "Or because flights are filling up so fast now and you can choose your seat online in advance, if you book kind of later in the game, there may only be middle seats in separate rows.",
        "So, it's very challenging for families because once onboard, they're often left to themselves to sort out and swap with passengers who are willing to give up a seat.",
        "And that's increasingly challenging as flights are packed to the brim.",
        "So there may not be a seat or maybe it's only a middle seat or something, and you're hesitant to give, you know, take a middle seat and give up your aisle or whatever.",

        "So he leaves us essentially with no choice if we want to end this war.",
        "We have to turn to our ability to say, look, by this date the funding for the war won't be available.",
        "We have to give enough time for the troops to be safely redeployed, but the idea that somehow the president can completely ignore the Congress is absurd.",

        "We're just saying, however, you need to start ending the war.",
        "And he's saying, look, I should be able to get the funding and have my policy with no influence at all of the Congress.",
        "But just, you know, to look at this from the other side, is it possible to see this in another way.",
        "Because it is such an important issue, is it appropriate to play this kind of political chicken?",
        "There is no political chicken going on here.",

        "And for us to back down would be cowardice.",
