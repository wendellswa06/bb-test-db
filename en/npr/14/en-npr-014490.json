        "And so when the Pilgrims showed up, they found a devastated area or at least an empty area.",
        "It was an emptied area, if that makes any sense.",
        "`It was a widowed land,' as one historian has called it.",
        "In fact, the first 50 settlements in New England were on deserted Indian villages.",
        "And they were deserted because all the people in them had died.",
        "And, again, if you read the Colonial accounts, they're constantly finding skeletons scattered all over the place, and they landed in a cemetery.",
        "And, of course, the sort of myth before all of this was that the Indians succumbed to the Europeans because of superior European technology, superior European political organization, maybe even superior moral character.",
        "But this whole theory of disease suggests that none of those characteristics were quite as important.",
        "And, in fact, you suggest that technologically many of the Indian cultures were just as advanced, though not in the same areas, as the European cultures.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Take the conquest of the Inca empire, which Pizarro did with just a couple of hundred people--168 I think is the exact number--and usually that's laid to the possession of the horse and steel weaponry.",
        "But, in fact, the Inca rapidly learned how to fight the horses.",
        "And as far as the steel goes, the armor was actually an impediment.",
        "The Spaniards threw it off because the Inca armor, which was made out of this densely woven cotton, was so far superior in those conditions that these things didn't matter.",
        "What really did matter was the appalling political shape that the empire was in from civil war and, also, that Pizarro was an extraordinary leader, and he was extremely adept at playing one faction off against the other.",
        "And this kind of thing, the traditional way that people lose, from better generalship, is what mattered, not the technology so much.",
        "Let's talk a little bit more about the technology and the technological difference.",
        "One point that you make is that European technology was sort of based on compression, compression of metal and that sort of thing, while the Indian technology was--and particularly in South America, was focused on tension and the use of fibers.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And a perfect example of that is these bridges that the Indians had, which were suspension bridges that would go over canyons and so forth.",
        "Suspension bridges at the time didn't exist in Europe, and the Spaniards at first refused to cross these bridges because they couldn't see what was holding them up.",
        "There was nothing underneath them.",
        "And there's all these letters where they'd say, `They have these incredible bridges.",
        "And guess what?",
        "You can actually walk across them.",
        "Again, it's just a matter of a different kind of technology.",
        "The Inca had a very, very sophisticated metallurgy, but for their purposes, metals were most important as a means of display, for their color.",
        "And so they had all these techniques for creating these very thin alloys that could be used to coat stuff.",
        "They were able to work with types of metals that the Europeans didn't understand.",
        "Yet they didn't have steel tools.",
        "And the reason was that metal wasn't valued in that way.",
        "They valued it for its flexibility, for its plasticity rather than its hardness.",
        "Let's talk a little bit about the predecessors to the Incas.",
        "One of the things that we understand because of research of the past couple of decades is that the Incas weren't the first highly developed culture in that area; there were several predecessor cultures.",
        "And that's part of what has been the most interesting work in this new research over the last few years.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "If, you know, in 2,500 or 3,000 BC you were a martian and you had wanted to land in the most sophisticated cultures on Earth, you would have had a very limited number of choices.",
        "And one of them would have been the coast of Peru, where there was a group of cities, 20 or 30 small cities, probably the biggest urban complex on Earth at that point.",
        "And this was very much at the time of Sumeria and Egypt, and this has just been discovered.",
        "The age of the cities was first established in 2001, and last year was the first publication of this survey.",
        "And essentially wherever scientists have looked in the Americas, they've seen more evidence of more people doing more things at a higher level of complexity at a much earlier time than they had believed."
