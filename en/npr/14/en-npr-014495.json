        "And when they told his story in the documentary, I really, really understood why he wrote the kind of words that he did, or why the kind of words that were in his songs appeared, because there was this part of him that was not fulfilled.",

        "We've got tracking radars all over the world that keep track of orbital debris, and it's things that are basically, you know, in rough order magnitude about the size of your fist or bigger.",
        "And there are tens of thousands of things that are tracked.",
        "And whenever one gets kind of close to space station, if we have ample time, we will actually move the space station, we'll actually do a burn - a debris avoidance maneuver, if you will - and it'll open up that distance to something a little bit more comfortable.",
        "Every now and then we'll get something that's either small enough that it only crops up very late, or it crops up in such a way that the accuracy is a little bit unknown.",
        "And in this particular case, it was kind of a combination of both.",
        "There was a lot of uncertainty in it, and it was also very late.",
        "There wasn't time to actually do a born that would've been effective in opening up that distance to something more comfortable.",
        "So for us, we talked about it the night before, actually probably a day and a half before, and we knew there wasn't time to do the burn, and certainly in the 12-or-so hours leading up to what we call the shelter in place, we discussed what we'd have to do."

        "And from our perspective here on board, it was actually fairly straightforward.",
        "We essentially started from the forward part of the station, worked our way back aft to where the Soyuz vehicles are located, and we powered down systems.",
        "We - and the ground did an awful lot of the systems work there.",
        "And we closed all the hatches to isolate as many of the modules as possible from each other, and then we just waited until the closest point of approach with the debris item.",
        "And we were each in our respective Soyuz capsules.",
        "There have been a couple of big solar flares recently that sent lots of potentially dangerous charged particles toward the Earth.",

        "We do have a higher level of radiation up here, but we're still very much under the protection of Mother Earth.",

        "And how are you experimenting with it?",
        "Well, one of the racks, this rack right here, is a combustion rack for investigating various combustion processes, where you're looking at the nitty-gritty details of how flames burn.",
        "The rack right next to it is a glove box where I currently have a flame experiment set up there.",
        "And basically flames have a healthy appetite for oxygen, and they get that oxygen literally by fanning the flame, and gravity helps fan the flame because of gravity-driven convection.",
        "The flame is hot.",
        "The hot air rises.",
        "Cold air rushes in, and that brings fresh oxygen next to the flame.",
