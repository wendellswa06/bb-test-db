        "Increasing the enrollment numbers for African-American males at college campuses is especially daunting, considering that in many metro areas, the high school drop out rate for black boys is 50 percent.",
        "That according to recently published reports in the American School Board Journal.",
        "Rosa Smith authored some of those studies, and continues to explore this issue as president and CEO of the Schott Foundation for Public Education.",
        "She joins us via phone from Cambridge, Massachusetts, where the organization is based.",

        "Dr. Comer heads the Comer School Development Program, which he founded in 1968.",
        "His latest book is titled Leave No Child Behind: Preparing Today's Youth for Tomorrow's World, and he joins us from New Haven, Connecticut.",
        "I thank you both for joining us.",
        "Dr.",
        "Comer, let me start with you.",
        "You've been doing this for a number of years, now.",
        "What is the difference that you have associated with the decline in boys finding education important in their lives?",
        "IED - Improvised Explosive Device, the terminology for, well, those things that have killed so many people in Baghdad.",
        "If you try to burn a flame in weightlessness with no air motion around it, it'll burn for a few seconds and snuff itself out.",
        "So the whole dynamics of what happens with flames is different in a weightless environment, and so the microgravity environment here on space station is a wonderful place to investigate fundamental aspects of combustion.",
        "It's basically another experimental knob we can tweak and help figure out what's going on when something burns.",
        "And you're saying that if you leave the flame to itself, it will snuff itself out.",
        "That's - wow, that's something unexpected.",
        "It is, and I was doing some combustion experiments where were burning little spheres of plastic, they were polymethylmethacrylate.",
        "It's the clear plastic that you see things made out of.",
        "And we were burning spheres of that, and we were going to - we had a fan blowing on it to add convection, and we were going to put the flame out by purging it with nitrogen, which would, should stop the flame.",
        "It turns out it didn't stop the flame because the nitrogen entrained enough air in it that it just kept feeding sufficient to the burning plastic.",
        "And what snuffed the plastic out in a matter of seconds was turning the fan off, and the flame consumed all the oxygen around it, and it just went out on its own.",
        "And I tell kids this is the space equivalent of what we tell our school kids of stop, drop and roll if you happen to catch on fire.",
        "But the space version of that is stop and float."

        "And of course you don't need to drop because there's no place to drop to.",
        "Very, very interesting.",
        "Let's talk about another experiment.",
        "Is it true that you have, like, a little distillery up there in space, you're doing a sort of a malt experiment?",
        "Are you going to brew some beer or something for us?",
        "You know, I heard about that, but that experiment hasn't made it on space station yet, and I don't really know what the details are.",
        "I think it's just bringing some materials up and maybe mashing them and then bringing them back down to Earth.",
        "I don't think there's any plans for distilling.",
        "However, we do have a distillation process here on space station, a distillation apparatus.",
        "And can you guess what we distill with it there?",
        "I'm afraid to ask.",
        "OK, it's part of what we call our regenerative life support system, which I like to refer to as the coffee machine because it consists of three pieces of equipment.",
        "We have a toilet.",
        "We have this big piece of equipment that the toilet is plumbed into, which contains a distillation apparatus, and then we have a galley.",
        "And you go in and use the toilet, and then this big piece of equipment goes chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga, and then you go to the galley, and you get yourself a bag of coffee.",
        "And so I like to refer to this as a coffee machine because it takes yesterday's coffee and turns it into today's coffee.",
        "And the key element, one of the key elements of that, is a fractional distillation process.",
        "And a normal process like that wouldn't work in a weightless environment because all our stills on Earth require gravity to separate the vapor from the liquid, and this uses a rotating body to help add centrifugal force to separate the vapor from the liquid and perform the distillation.",
        "So it's really a neat piece of engineering research."

        "Dan Burbank, what are you hoping to learn through your integrated cardiovascular experiment?",
        "Well, that's an experiment that's got a lot of different aspects to it, and fundamentally, the main goal is to understand how humans adapt to the weightless environment of space and how we can mitigate the negative effects of that."

        "If you're up here in space, and you don't exercise considerably, since you're never counteracting the force of gravity walking around as you would on Earth, up here you would lose a lot of muscle mass, you'd lose a lot of minerals from your bones.",

        "Now, rough order of magnitude, the moon is about 1,000 times further from the Earth from the space station.",
        "Mars is about another 1,000 times further, you know, than the moon is.",

        "Now, the psychological aspect of going to Mars, there's another whole wrinkle to that, and that is the time it takes to transmit a single from Earth to the crew on Mars or vice versa, and you're limited by the speed of light, and it'll be a long, long time.",

        "And it has to do with our trash cans, our waste baskets.",
        "And we have these really nice wastebaskets, and if you open up the lid to put a small piece of something in there, that little small piece of something will just be floating right under that lid.",
        "And then the next person who opens that lid up, all these little small pieces come floating out, and it makes a big mess.",

        "So what we do is we take one our little wet-wipe containers, which is just like the wet-wipes that you use for wiping baby bottoms on Earth, and we use the same ones up here, and they come in a little plastic pouch with a little lid, a little doorway that you can open up.",
        "And when we have one of those things empty, we stick it on the wall, and we use it for a small-items wastebasket.",
        "And you can open that little lid, and you can put little tiny things in there and close the lid, and you don't need to worry about all of these things swimming out.",
        "And I never would've thought that you'd use something like this for a little trash can, and it's an elegant solution to the problem.",
