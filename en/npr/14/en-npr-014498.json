        "Yeah, I guess if I were to think back on the thing that probably surprised me the most, you know, even having been up here twice on shuttle missions, is how difficult it is to keep track of everything that you have.",
        "On a shuttle mission, it's a little bit smaller volume.",
        "You do spend time in the station.",
        "But you don't spend as much time here that you don't get necessarily exquisitely good about keeping track of things.",
        "And up here, you know, the first couple of weeks that we're around, it is so easy for things even that are Velcro-ed and attached and so forth to just fly away, get bumped and jostled.",
        "You know, we joke about, you know, new crews coming onboard space station, shuttle crews included, creating a wake of swimming parts and cameras and notebooks and procedures and so forth behind them when they go by.",
        "It gets to the point up here where everything that you do, you're constantly thinking, planning - or at least in the back of your mind - how to keep track of everything.",
        "And if you're going to take something apart to fix it, for example, keeping track of bolts and washers and nuts and having a little piece of tape staged by and having all your tools organized is something that's kind of part and parcel with your life up here.",
        "One last question: Dan Burbank, you're going to be coming back in a few days.",
        "Is adjusting to life back on Earth going to be difficult?",
        "Are you looking forward to it, or are you going to be nostalgic about missing the space station?",
        "I think everybody that's had a chance to be here, I think you're always going to have just a little piece of your heart that's still here, that you're going to miss these views, miss just the nature of life in space.",
        "I'm really looking forward to seeing my family again.",
        "Family and friends, being able to see them again, will be great.",
        "The thing that'll be really hard, at least by all reports, is getting used to planet Earth's gravity and getting used to fighting it all the time.",
        "We spend a lot of time exercising up here, but I wonder if it'll ever really be enough to make those first couple of weeks as easy as I hope they would be.",
        "Well, Commander Burbank and Flight Engineer Don Petit, I want to thank you both for taking time to be with us today, and good luck to you, and welcome back when you get back to Earth.",
        "Thank you for joining us on SCIENCE FRIDAY from the International Space Station.",
        "Ira, thank you, it was great talking to you today.",
        "The full interview with NASA astronauts Dan Burbank and Don Pettit is available via podcast, or you can download it from our website at sciencefriday.com."

        "Corey lives near Reno, Nevada, and for the past two months the area and its residents have been shaken by a series - well, a swarm, really, of quakes.",

        "So, how did you sleep last night?",
        "Well, between about the 10:57 to 10:58 p.m. earthquake, and the six o'clock this morning when the 60 mile per hour winds began, I got a nice nap.",
        "How big was the quake last night?",
        "I haven't checked.",
        "It was fairly small.",
        "It shook our house, our old two-story house is a little flexible anyway, but it shook the house a little bit.",
        "And then we dozed off, and then we woke up, and the wind was shaking the house to about the same degree.",
        "So, there was a pretty big earthquake on Friday.",
        "Things fell off the shelves, and somewhat smaller one earlier yesterday, but two months of this is going on.",
        "How are people doing there?"

        "Normally you have one earthquake and then a series of decreasing aftershocks, and these have gotten steadily stronger from the 20th of February.",

        "And the change in the nature of work, one, the physical strength is no longer a great advantage for males, and we have a service and information age where in many ways, it favors girls or women.",
        "And the kind of traits that they have, males that would have dropped out of school and still been successful, are now in school.",
        "But the school has not made an adjustment to make it possible for them to be successful.",
        "Rosa Smith, when we look at the numbers, black boys make up about 8.6 percent of the nation's public school students, this in the year 2000/2001, yet they comprise 41 percent of the special education population.",
        "We mentioned earlier, in many urban areas, well over 50 percent of them do not graduate in 13 states; between 30 and 40 percent of the black male students graduated on time.",
        "When we look at these numbers, how did we allow it to get to this point?",
        "Let me put this in the context that, I think, that public education in America is mediocre at best.",
        "We only graduate about 67, 69 percent of all of our children.",
        "I would agree with Dr. Comer that it is about boys in general.",

        "Mr.",

        "We've just finished looking at the results of a school district that had 41% of students proficient, 43% in reading and math, and in five years, they were 93% to 98% efficient, and that was done by creating a culture that focused on the development of the children.",
        "That requires a change in the way we prepare teachers and administrators who think about more than raising test scores, which is the problem with No Child Left Behind.",
        "In my own book, Leave No Child Behind, we talked about creating a culture that allows all of the adults to support the development of the children.",
        "The children themselves promote their own development, and as a result we've gotten dramatic improvement.",
        "One of the things I think is problematic is that too many of the people who work with black male students cannot imagine them to greatness, so it gets in the way that they think about our kids, and they set expectations.",
        "I agree with that, and yet I've seen teachers and administrators just like that involved in a program to change the culture of the schools in which their attitudes, their ideas, their understanding changes.",
        "How realistic is that in terms of the real world and trying to make change, Rosa Smith?",
        "When I know when you were Superintendent in Columbus, Ohio and tried to close a dysfunctional school, you received a lot of flack for that."
