        "And so they asked, could I have a cup of milk?",

        "And so, you know, she ended up giving the child some water and, you know, went through it.",

        "American carriers have lost about 55 billion over the course of the past decade according to the Air Transport Association.",
        "You know, as operational costs like fuel and employee benefits have, you know, outpaced revenues.",
        "And so they've done everything they can to, you know, make up for those losses by cutting service and adding fees.",
        "And for families, that just makes things more complicated and compounds the cost.",

        "We have a 5-year-old, a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old.",
        "And one of the tricks I like to do is when, at the end of the flight, especially if you're landing sometime in the evening, the attendants always tell you that you have to turn off your electronic devices, and that's really hard because if the kids are watching DVDs on the DVD player, you have to turn it off.",
        "And you usually have about 30 or 40 minutes still to go that you have to entertain them.",
        "So I always stop at the dollar store, pick up a couple packs of glow sticks.",
        "And at that point, when we're in our descent, I break them all open, and the kids entertain themselves with that.",
        "And on that last flight, we starting passing the glow sticks back through the cabin, and by the end of - by the time we landed, all the little children on the plane had their glow sticks, and the parents were happy and all the passengers were happy."
