        "I thought it was a case of life imitating counterfactuals in one sense.",
        "I mean, as you said, my imagining was that Osama, as a part of a strategy, threw up his hands and said, I surrender, because you may remember that CIA Director Panetta said, well, if he'd thrown up his hands and surrendered, we would have had to capture him.",
        "What I tried to imagine was, okay, imagine that happens, and if I may quote those great constitutional scholars, Laurel and Hardy, you would have had another fine mess, one that's - whose ending would have been years away.",
        "Well, you say that as he was taken into custody, he seemed to have a smile on his face.",
        "Well, that was taken from the fact that a lot of the pictures we see of Osama have - I wouldn't exactly call it the Gioconda smile, but it is that kind of half smile and my - what I was trying to project in the piece was that he had succeeded in trapping the United States into a situation where nothing good for the United States would have come from this for all kinds of reasons.",

        "And what I was imagining was that his very survival would have made him, again, a powerful figure.",
        "There's a lot of argument that in the recent years he had declined this appurtenance of importance.",
