        "I'm just - I was just saying that it's possible they did go ahead and just kill Osama because some of the things that may have been let out in the process of a trial.",
        "So that he may have been trying to surrender and was not allowed to.",
        "Right.",
        "Because in the process of a trial, there were some things that United States didn't want to be known to the general public, some of the things that were done that were not really lawful and did not want to be known.",
        "So they just went ahead and took care of the whole situation.",
        "It seems unlikely to me that he would have known things that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed does not.",
        "But anyway, Jeff Greenfield, well, might that have been the case?",
        "Well, I mean, I think you - I think one of the inevitable results of whatever happened was that a - this is like the most amazingly fertile ground for the growth of conspiracy theories.",
        "I mean, if one believes that Osama was in league with the Bush administration to pull off 9/11 - and, you know, you have to forgive me, I don't think one is neutral about that opinion, I think you either are on planet Earth or you are not - then that makes sense.",
        "I mean, it's certainly, by the way, the classic part of conspiracy plots - I mean, I'm talking here about in fiction, is you always knock off somebody in the middle of the conspiracy because they know too much.",
        "You know, it's always - if you're ever watching a movie about a conspiracy, the unbilled actor who plays the number four conspirator, he's not going to be in that movie very long because sooner or later the bad guy, or the worst guy, is gonna bump him off because of what he knows...",

        "Then the president would hold a news conference to announce he had been killed.",
        "We would all believe he's dead and he would never be seen or heard from again except by the select interrogators or torturers at the secret prison.",
        "OK.",

        "But that's one of the other interesting things is - about a bin Laden, you put him in a military commission or military tribunal - that takes years.",

        "Good morning.",
        "What is this new proposal?",
        "What exactly will it mean?",
        "So what Secretary Azar of Health and Human Services under the Trump administration - he took to the stage yesterday, and he announced that any drug that costs more than $35 a month would need to have advertising on its television ads.",
        "And the rule is rather specific.",
        "It says the advertising needs to be on a contrasting background.",
        "It needs to be easy to read.",
        "So there are a lot of questions embedded in that.",
        "What price are they going to list in the TV commercials?",
        "Because based on how much people pay in insurance, the prices are different for different people, right?",
        "Right, exactly.",
        "So when you go to the pharmacy counter and I go to the pharmacy counter, our copays may be different depending on our insurance, and we may have a deductible we have to fulfill.",
        "So the question is what price will be up there?",
        "The secretary did note that they want list price up there, which is also...",
        "What is it?",
        "...A good question - what does it mean?",
        "He clarified later and said it would be wholesale acquisition cost, which is an industry term where nobody really pays that often.",
        "Alex Azar made a point of saying that the list price does matter, and he did this big analogy with the auto industry on cars and so forth.",
        "And it does matter because it's the base for a lot of negotiation, and it can be a base for what people who are uninsured pay.",
        "But...",
        "Would it matter to consumers, though?",
        "It can be often confusing for consumers, right?",
        "So if I'm told that my drug is $5,000 a month, just for example, but I'm only going to pay a couple thousand dollars a month or my deductible covers it or my health plan covers it and I'm only paying $50 copay, it could scare you away from getting that drug.",
        "Right.",
        "So even though it's kind of confusing, it's still demanding a level of transparency that I imagine the pharmaceutical industry isn't so keen on."

        "Just the idea of it, forcing these drug companies to be more forthcoming.",
        "So is it - what's the likelihood that it actually is going to go into effect?",
        "So let me back up just a minute and say the pharmaceutical industry's response because I think that helps lead us to the likelihood of it going into effect.",
        "So yesterday morning before the secretary took to the stage and made this big announcement, the pharma industry through their trade group PhRMA made a big announcement as well.",
        "And they said, hey, we're going to do a voluntary measure where we ask our companies to help educate you about your price, and we will help, you know, direct you on our website to information about the benefits and cost of our drugs.",
        "And they're going to put together a web portal that you can go and look at your insurance options and so forth.",
        "OK.",
        "So that was kind of the pharma industry on the offensive.",
        "During the press call for that, somebody asked, hey, is there a possibility for litigation here?",
        "And the industry didn't say no. And I think it's a legitimate question, and several law scholars that I spoke with yesterday did note that this is just asking for litigation.",
        "So even if the rule comes into being, which you've outlined is kind of a longshot because of litigation, what tools does a Trump administration have to enforce it?",
        "So they don't have much at all - not really anything.",
        "In there, they say that they're going to put together a list of companies that don't meet the standards and shame them, and then they're going to expect the other companies to sue each other or consumers to sue the companies - so no real tools.",
        "Feels more political than substantive.",
