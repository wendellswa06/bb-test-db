        "But yeah, they have been used a lot, and they're terrifying because somebody can slip them under a car on what was a fairly busy street without anybody evidently noticing or not too many people evidently noticing, though there was that tip that we're told was called in to the nearby Iraqi army post which we believe helped save us.",
        "According to the Iraqi government, there were 28 sticky bombs used that detonated in Baghdad last month alone.",

        "Yeah.",
        "They actually restrained our two drivers from approaching further to the vehicle, and then helped protect us in the aftermath.",
        "We were very worried after the initial explosion that there could be some kind of follow up attack.",
        "And in fact, at one point, Ali asked me to duck down behind him in order to hide the fact that there was a foreigner standing out on the street.",
        "I kind of got up after a few seconds.",

        "And kill the translator.",

        "And of course, there's more than a few incidents where one bomb goes off and they wait for first responders to rush in, and then another bomb goes off, and that's been a typical tactic.",
        "Ivan, we want to talk about things in general, but one point in recounting the story earlier this week on NPR, you said that somebody was arrested, a suspect.",

        "Ali, why don't I take that?",
        "No. One of the miracles of this is that we did not have - I don't believe hearing loss unless I've totally lost my hearing already.",
        "And we were not pelted with shrapnel.",
        "Every car bomb I've been near and I think Ali would say the same, tends to spew at the very least, broken glass and pieces of the car itself.",
        "The car itself becomes a shrapnel bomb.",
        "And we think maybe that we were protected by the fact that the car's structure was reinforced, that its glass, is reinforced glass - that didn't - while the windows were broken, they were broken out.",
        "They didn't shatter and spray glass or pieces of the car all over us, and we were standing only 15-20 feet away and there were other Iraqis with us as well.",
        "As for the street, it was broad daylight, around one o'clock in the afternoon and there was traffic moving back and forth.",
        "There were other pedestrians passing by.",
        "Not incredibly crowded but busy enough that I think we felt fairly comfortable there, especially due to the close proximity of the Iraqi army checkpoint, which was just about 20 yards up the road from where we parked the cars.",
        "Joe, you may be unaware.",

        "Ali, why don't you take that one?",
        "Well, I think it's everything basically, because first of all, you turn up with armored car which mainly for ordinary Iraqis, you know, who never saw armored cars before 2003.",
        "It means that there is someone valuable inside that car.",
        "Either like, you know, officials, security, journalist, someone, at least well worth a ransom, or you know, will make some publicity out of, you know, like killing him, hitting him and that's one thing.",
        "The second thing is like maybe, Western-looking, you know, like the blonde hair, you know, might also attract attention and the third one is like actually introducing yourself, you know, to the restaurant guys, like the restaurant owner.",
        "The first we did, is like introduced ourselves as journalists, as we always do in reporting.",
        "So, that on its own, you know, will make you a target because journalists, like in general in Iraq, have been targeted over the last six years in Iraq."
