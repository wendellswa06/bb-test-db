        "And secondly, if there is some improvement, do you feel like - you were commenting a second ago that you are moving towards normalcy where there won't be bomb attacks, or do you feel you're not quite over the hump yet?",

        "It's comparatively speaking, you know, two years ago, it's improving from what it was two years ago.",
        "But, like there is a famous Iraqi saying that everyone is like recalling these days, which is like they have shown us, they've shown us death filled with fever.",
        "So it's like - it's now down from like 55 dead bodies dumped in the streets everyday and endless number of bombings and ambushes and attacks, to like five bombs in Baghdad and you know, other, you know, violent actions.",
        "So, it's not normal.",
        "It is improving, yes.",
        "But the thing is it's confusing.",

        "Its like they don't really know whether things have been like completely resolved, like have been like completely, like whether the government and the security forces have actually managed to get rid of the - of what actually made all this mess and what actually caused all that violence.",
        "Because, some of the elements that actually, you know, participated in that violent action in the past have now changed their titles and now they are like somehow protecting - pretending to be protecting people.",
        "And in fact, they do protect people genuinely.",
        "So Iraqis are wondering whether these guys will continue to do so or will be back to their, you know, insurgency, work or like to kill people and behead people again as they did in the past.",
        "Ivan, let me ask you also about the people who are there to report on these events.",
        "We've seen sharp reductions in the number of agencies, television networks that maintain bureaus in Baghdad, as this conflict has gone on over the years.",
        "And well, puts an enormous strain on budgets of just about every news-gathering organization."
