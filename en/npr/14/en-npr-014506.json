        "Now most cancers are caused by something that goes wrong in the genes, so they started planning and waiting.",
        "Because at that time it would have cost somewhere in the neighborhood of a hundred million dollars to do that genome sequence.",
        "But as the years went by, the technology (unintelligible) cheaper, and the cancer researchers backed by a philanthropists got their wish.",
        "They were able to sequence the genome, well, actually two genomes, really of a woman who died of leukemia.",
        "They sequenced the DNA from both her tumor and her skin, so that they could compare the healthy and the cancerous genes, and see genetically what went wrong in the cancer cells.",
        "I spoke with John Prendergast, senior adviser of the International Crisis Group and an expert on the region.",
        "He says the Courts filled a void when America pulled out of Somalia after the now infamous Black Hawk Down incident in 1993.",
        "An in the context over the intervening decade, the Islamic Courts began to assert themselves basically organically, not very much funded from the Middle East, but really a local Somali entity that was a response to the anarchy that the warlords were basically creating.",
        "So within the early part of this decade, as the U.S.",
        "looked around in the aftermath of 9/11 and saw the growth of these courts, the harboring of some al-Qaida suspects and other negative trends in Somalia, we decided to reengage once again, and reengage wrongly once again, on the side of some of the most venal elements in Somali society, which were these very same warlords that had destroyed the country.",
        "So we started providing assistance to them to counter the Islamic Court phenomenon and what has resulted has been a radicalization of the courts, of the Islamic Courts, strengthening of the courts against these people, growing popular support for them as they finally defeated the U.S.-backed warlords in June, consolidate control over the capital city of Mogadishu and have expanded their territory.",
        "Bringing it up to the present then, Ethiopia, which of course is the U.S.",
        "ally in the war on terror and is very concerned about the growth of Islamic fundamentalism, has now deployed forces into Somalia against the Islamic Courts, and they're basically standing on a precipice between on the one hand, the Ethiopian Army, and on the other hand, the Islamic Court militias.",
        "So it remains to be seen who is going to strike a match and hurl it on to this gasoline pool, but it's poised on the brink of an explosion, and the coming weeks will determine where we're going.",
        "We'll talk about the Ethiopian troops and their involvement in just a moment.",
        "But I'm curious in terms of this Supreme Islamic Court Council, so many people will hear the words Islamic Court and assume that this is like the courts that we have here in the states, and it is not.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The Islamic Court, it's more of kind of a rudimentary authority that, again, organically has sprung up in a number of parts of Somalia, where a local area fed up with the anarchy and the predatory behavior of some of these warlords basically asserts Islamic law.",
        "They set up this court, which then hears cases to arbitrate on various issues that are disputes that arise, but more importantly establishes a militia that then imposes order on a particular area."

        "They also deliver social services.",
        "So there's a lot of stuff that comes out, positive things that come out of these courts.",
        "The problem, of course, is that some of the courts are highly radicalized and have provided sanctuary for al-Qaida suspects, for people that have actually committed or at least suspected to have committed specific terrorist acts against U.S.",

        "He is mobilizing sentiment against foreign intervention in Somalia, which is a very hot button issue everywhere in the world, nationalism; but certainly, Somalis are very xenophobic and nationalistic and very sensitive to this idea that that U.S.",
        "can support warlords and that the Ethiopians can send troops.",
        "So the courts are growing in their influence and support.",
        "And the repercussions are broader that just Somalia and the very surrounding region because the suspects that have been harbored have a demonstrable track record involvement in terrorism.",
        "So it's not an issue to be taken lightly.",
        "It's a national security interest issue for the United States, which makes it just extraordinary that the U.S.",
        "is so passive in response to what's happening there diplomatically.",
        "We haven't really engaged.",
        "We haven't sent people over there to really work the diplomatic efforts to try to prevent a full-scale war from erupting.",
        "That was going to be my next question, that you have a young, fledging government trying to find a foothold in all of this on the Somali side.",
        "You have the history, as we've talked about, monies being poured in by previous administrations.",
        "When you look at the Bush administration and the United States government in general, even prior to this, what do you think has to be done from this side to help bring stability to that area if, in fact, you believe that this would help in the, quote, war against terror?",
        "We're missing a partner in our efforts on counterterrorism, and the Somalis much more importantly are missing a government that can adjudicate disputes, that can provide security and that can provide social services.",
        "It just doesn't exist.",
        "It hasn't existed since the early 1990's.",
        "It's the only country in the world that doesn't have a government.",
        "So it is time for the U.S.",
        "to really roll up its selves diplomatically, which cost nothing to us, and get involved in the processes that could lead to a negotiated - that government of national unity, a negotiation that have to occur between the Islamic Courts and the Ethiopian-backed entity or authority that exists in one of the small towns outside of Mogadishu now, which is claiming to be a central government but has no authority anywhere.",
        "So, what did they find out now, that's what we are going to talk about with Dr. Timothy Ley, he is an M.D. and a professor in the department of medicine in the Oncology Division at Washington University in St. Louis.",
        "Thanks for being with us today."

        "This could be really a bloody situation if people aren't careful?",
        "Exactly.",
        "And you know the blood, to be frank, is not really the issue and the problem, because if we look at what precipitated, what prompted President Bush, Sr. to send tens of thousands of American troops to Somalia, it was the famine that resulted from the war in the early 1990s.",
        "The same thing would happen again now if the Ethiopians went toe-to-toe, full-scale war with the Islamic Court militias; we would see probably a few thousand battlefield deaths, but we would see hundreds of thousands of people who would put immediately at risk of starvation and of the diseases related to malnutrition that would then create the huge mortality rates that we've seen in Ethiopia, we've seen in Sudan, and we saw in Somalia when a third of a million people died in '91 and '92 before we sent our own troops.",
        "We know that the Bush administration has sent a steady stream of intelligence officers into Somalia to monitor the situation with al-Qaida.",
        "So it's hard for them to suggest they wouldn't know what was going on in this region fully.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It was profound miscalculation.",
        "I mean, in 2003, the Bush administration began to provide, through the Central Intelligence Agency and through those intelligence officers that made their monthly visits to Mogadishu, they began to provide cash to these warlords to counter the Islamic Courts.",
        "All this did was enflame Somali sentiments against the United States and in support of the Islamic Courts, because they saw the U.S.",
        "was intervening on behalf of the vultures that were just tearing that country to pieces.",
        "They just picked the wrong horse, basically.",
        "The intention was right.",
        "You know, the U.S.",
        "wanted to be able to keep our eyes on the suspects of al-Qaida that are in Mogadishu now.",
        "They wanted to be able to counter the influence of some extremists but they used absolutely the wrong actors.",
        "Again, rather than getting involved in building government in Somalia, we picked a few strongmen that we factored and forced our will.",
        "The worst thing you could possibly do is ignore what people want locally and then tell people locally, can you do us a favor?",
        "And that just wasn't happening.",
        "So now we're compounding the error.",
        "Now that all of our warlords have been pounded out of the country, we've now sort of disengaged and, you know, we do our diplomacy from New York through an international contact group where we sit around in lunchrooms in the United Nations and talk about what might happen in Somalia."

        "Yeah, the peace talks now, remarkably, everyone else is crapped out.",

        "But if the United States and the Brits work with some of the African nations to get in there and do the right thing we could do that in the next week.",
        "I mean, it doesn't take a lot to ramp up one or two people who have some experience there and work it.",
        "But the potential for fairly significant gross terrorist threat in Somalia is real.",
        "As the territory, which the Islamic Courts control expands, there are greater potential for additional investment by terrorist networks to find sanctuary there and begin to plan attacks.",
        "So I'm quite worried that the longer we sit back and allow this to fester that this will create the haven that we've always worried about occurring around the Indian Ocean coast, and I just think that will have a profoundly negative repercussions for the region and up into the Persian Gulf for years to come.",
