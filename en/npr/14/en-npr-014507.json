        "The problem is that we don't know what causes the disease for the vast majority of our patients.",
        "We don't know the genetic underpinnings yet.",
        "And we've been trying and many investigators around the world for years and years to understand the mutations that cause this disease, and with the advent of the modern genomics, we've thrown the book at patients with this disease.",
        "Tried every new modern platform imaginable that looks at all of the genes expression, and whether they're present or absent.",
        "Everything's been tried and we sequenced lots and lots of candidate genes that we thought we understood, and we thought that might be involved with leukemia development.",
        "But none of these approaches after years and years of preparation and work with patients , who had participated with us, none of these approaches were really telling us what the genetic disease is comprised of.",
        "What are the real mutations that are causing the disease?",
        "And a couple of years ago, when this new technology became available for a very, very high (unintelligible) rapid sequencing at low cost, called Next-Generation Sequencing.",
        "We decided really the only chance we had to find these mutations was to just bite the bullet, and sequence the whole genome.",
        "And we had prepared for this for years and years, by getting skin samples and tumor samples from patients with leukemia, who we saw here at (unintelligible) Cancer Center, and we banked them all the way.",
        "Now we looked at hundreds of them to pick one patient who would be perfect for the first analysis, who would have just two copies of all of her genes, and with a very common kind of a disease that we faced very often, and in whom we know almost nothing about the mutations that caused the disease.",
        "So she was picked as our first patient.",
        "And you found the difference between the cancer genes - the genome in the cancerous tumor and in her normal skin cells.",
        "We did.",
        "We knew that we had to sequence her normal cells and her tumor, because there's an enormous amount of generic variation that exists between individuals.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "For the first few genomes that have been done, we know that there are millions of differences between each of us, and those are called SNPs or single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the genome.",
        "They're normal variations in the genome that probably, you know, help to make us the different people that we are, but we don't know how they contribute to diseases yet, and we don't know how they contribute to diseases like this one.",
        "So we knew we would find millions of differences between her genome and other genomes that have been sequenced, but how would you ever know which ones are responsible?",
        "So we had to sequence her normal genome, and we had to sequence her tumor, independently, and then compare the two to find the differences.",
        "What we found really - it astonished us that we only found 10 differences between her tumor genome and her skin.",
        "And eight of these were completely new.",
        "They are mutations that had been acquired in the tumor.",
        "They were not present in her skin.",

        "Now in retrospect, they all make a lot of sense to us, because they're involved with things that's easy to imagine how they might be participating in the genesis of this cancer.",
        "We don't know exactly what they do or how they fit together yet, but just to find them for the first time and to know all of the mutations that might be contributing to one person's cancer, is really a milestone for us...",

        "That's right.",
        "These are mutations that are acquired in the tumor.",
        "Our current understanding of cancer suggests that a cancer starts maybe with one mild perturbation, an acquired mutation that gives a cell a little bit of an advantage.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And that advantage persists over time until another random event occurs that gives the cell a little bit more of an advantage, and over time these mutations accumulate in the cells that have more and more of an advantage, and these cells basically just start to take over.",
        "Now, our guess about this patient's tumor is that these 10 mutations basically were in almost all of her tumor cells.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Nine of them in every single one, and one, probably the last mutation that she acquired, was present in most of her cells, but not all.",
        "So, our guess would be that each one of these mutations contributed a little something to the tumor.",
        "Right.",
        "And that as they accumulated over the period of time that her tumor was growing, they all were important, and they all added a little bit of something that was relevant for her disease."

        "In the copy numbers of genes, there are lots of chromosomes that seem to accumulate or are lost in certain kinds of cancers, so I think our greatest fear was that there would be thousand, or perhaps tens of thousands of mutations.",
