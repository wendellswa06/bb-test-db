        "But, for this particular incident, let me tell you that I haven't actually told my family yet, because I know that my family, which is my mother and sister, you know, they won't know, because they are now living in Syria, and they don't get the chance to actually listen to NPR.",
        "So, I actually try to sit on it until I go on vacation, or I see them, you know, in the next couple of weeks, and then I will tell them about it, because they will never believe you that you're OK.",

        "It's one of the decisions why I - one of the reasons why I decided - I asked to stop coming to Baghdad regularly after 2004.",
        "I just - it was so dangerous, and I recognized how difficult it was for my family to put up with the worry and the fear.",
        "I just decided that it was not fair.",

        "And then to call back home and speak with your family and realize that they're just totally shattered having heard how close you came to death.",
        "That was a very difficult position for me to be in.",
        "That is nothing, though, compared to the Iraqis who have to live with this day in and day out or the soldiers.",
        "Imagine you've survived one of these terrible roadside bombs, and then you have to continue doing this for another 11 months, Neal.",
        "That is very hard to imagine.",
        "I get to leave here in a couple of days and go to a much safer place.",
        "Here's an email we have here from Dan in Oakland California.",
        "What I wonder about is how rattled you get by this kind of thing.",
        "Does it ever get to the point where part of your brain or heart says enough is enough, get me out of here?",

        "Well, that's a very tough moment for me actually, because now, it's becoming more and more difficult to justify to them my staying here and the job that I'm doing, because over the past years they've all been saying this is too much risk for you to take.",
        "You have to consider other options, especially like, I'm a medical doctor so I have other options actually in hand.",
        "So, it's hard to justify it anymore.",
