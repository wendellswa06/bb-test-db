        "Thank you for having me.",
        "The Bush administration is pushing Iraqis to meet this deadline and even if that means approving a constitution, as one US official put it, quote, \"\"without the bells and whistles.\"\" What does that mean?",
        "It means, in practice, that some of the hardest issues will simply be shelved instead of being resolved directly.",
        "That means, for example, that the question of just how independent the Kurdish region will be might be fudged in the constitution; we might not get an explicit answer to it.",
        "The status of the city of Kirkuk, they might just leave it for the future.",
        "And probably when it comes to Islam and family law and the rights of women, we'll see some language that just declares that they all fit together wonderfully without actually resolving those tensions between them.",
        "Well, then is that a recipe for disaster in the future?",
        "Not necessarily.",
        "Sometimes the only way to get a constitution signed is if the different people who are sitting at the table are prepared to compromise and defer certain decisions.",
        "We had that in the drafting if the US Constitution when the most contentious issue, and I think the most morally troubling one--that of slavery--couldn't be resolved by the people there.",
        "The Northerners felt one way and the Southerners another, and they essentially agreed to disagree and to defer the question.",
        "And although eventually that did lead to the Civil War, it also bought 70 years for the new republic.",
        "But with the Iraqi Constitution, the Kurds are suggesting that they may not ratify it if their issues aren't resolved now.",
        "That's the Kurds' ultimate bargaining chip, and it's the reason that they're going to get more or less what they want in this constitutional draft.",
        "Their threat is, `Well, we can leave the table.",
        "We can walk away from the constitutional process.",
        "We'll decline to ratify the constitution,' and then they don't say it but they imply it, they're going to declare independence completely.",
        "So they have the forces to do that should they wish, and so issuing that threat at this stage helps them get what they want in the final draft.",
        "It's simply the fact that although most Arab Iraqis, Shia and Sunni, object to the Kurds' demands for autonomy, they really have no choice but to accede to them because the Kurds have their own light infantry that's pretty big--50 or 60,000 troops--they've been good friends with the US recently and so there's nobody to take away their autonomy from them.",
        "So the rest of the country is faced with either a guaranteed secession or the possibility of some perhaps secession at some future date.",
        "And between those two, it's an easy call, so I think that's why we'll see a compromise on those issues.",
        "But again, some of the issues are really so controversial--like the city of Kirkuk with its immense oil field beneath it--that I think that will just be deferred to a later time.",
        "And what about the rights of the Sunni minority?",
        "The Sunni minority is unlikely to get expressed guarantees of rights.",
        "Probably its rights will come from more general guarantees of the equality of all citizens before the law, and perhaps there may be some provision similar to the one in the transitional law ensuring that the resources of the state shall be fairly distributed.",
        "That's a very vague way of putting things."
