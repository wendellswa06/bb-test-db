        "Yes.",

        "Thank you.",
        "The greatest worry for the Sunnis, ironically, is not denominational discrimination.",
        "Their greatest worry is being cut out of the oil revenues, because the oil is concentrated in the Kurdish north and in the Shia south.",
        "And the Sunnis, who have dominated the country in the past, are to some extent oilless, so that's actually--the distribution of resources is actually a much more important issue to the Sunnis over the long term than just the direct question of discrimination.",
        "And how much of a hand is the US playing here?",
        "It's a very tricky question because during the transitional process, the US tried to allow the Iraqis who were involved to do the drafting and the work and I think that mostly happened.",
        "The problem was that the US had largely chosen those Iraqis.",
        "This time around, the Iraqis are not handpicked by the US; they were chosen by a national electoral process.",
        "And as a consequence, they're not responsible to the US.",
        "Ultimately, they're responsible to their own constituents.",
        "The US is putting a lot of the diplomatic pressure on and we've got, don't forget, 150,000 troops in the country risking their lives and that's also the reason we're pressing for things to happen, but it gives us a lot of leverage.",
        "The trick, though, ultimately is the Shia and the Sunni and the Kurds could say no to us because our ultimate threat--the US' ultimate threat--is just to leave.",
        "And right now the US is not prepared to leave because of the instability that would follow that.",
        "Could say no to us in terms of...",
        "Well, they could simply say, `We refuse to ratify this constitution now.",
        "There was a wonderful quote reported, I believe, in The New York Times today from one the Kurds in the constitutional committee who said, \"\"We don't want to resolve this in a hurry.",
        "It's the Americans who want to resolve it quickly because they have this exit strategy that they're trying to pursue.\"\" I thought that was extremely telling coming from somebody who's a part of this process and who is nominally working alongside the Americans.",
        "And I think it, frankly, bodes ill for us if we are in a rush to get this done for some exit strategy sort of reason.",
        "It seems to me that getting the constitution done right is more important than getting the constitution done quickly.",
        "Some external pressure is probably valuable in order to get Iraqis to focus and do a deal, but overdoing that pressure could really be potentially disastrous.",
        "New York University law Professor Noah Feldman, thank you.",
        "Thank you for having me."

        "Well, there's general dissatisfaction with the security situation.",
        "But specifically in Basra, there have been a lot of killings and kidnappings of professionals, like doctors and academics.",
        "And there have been attacks on women.",
        "Last year more than 100 women were murdered, apparently because they were wearing Western clothing or behaving in ways that were offensive to religious extremists.",
        "Residents blame the police for not doing enough, but - and also for being party to much of the violence.",
        "In a recent interview, the local army division commander said the police force in Basra is basically just a bunch of militias.",
        "And he said they'd been kidnapping soldiers, his own soldiers, more than 50 of them, for ransom.",
        "So, I mean, you can imagine how bad the situation is between the police and the army.",
        "Can you tell what's behind all of this violence?",
        "Well, it's basically a fight for power.",
        "But in Basra the interesting thing it's not sectarian.",
        "Basra's overwhelmingly Shiite with very few Sunnis.",
        "But what you've got is a fight for power and money, and here it's between competing Shiite groups.",
        "These political parties - there are almost two dozen of them - and their militias are fighting for Basra's oil wealth and the profits from this key port city.",
        "And the residents are saying, hey, there is economic potential here but we're not seeing any of it.",
        "Just as in the rest of the country, ordinary Iraqis aren't seeing any signs the government is investing in infrastructure or services."
