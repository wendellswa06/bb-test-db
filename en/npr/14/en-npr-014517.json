        "Hmm.",
        "You mentioned the word hubris, which is, of course, a Greek word, which I, you always see it translated as overweening pride.",
        "I had never seen the Latin translation which is superbia, which, of course, sounds like a little town right outside of Philadelphia somewhere, but, in fact, is Latin for hubris.",
        "I never understood that.",
        "Yeah, when you think about, too, superb.",
        "You know, I'm thinking about some derivations.",
        "When you say something is superb, of course, it's the ultimate...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...in compliment.",
        "But at the same time, as you say that superbia also is about the regions, and to borrow your suburban metaphor, the regions that ring around an appropriate sense of pride, but that are always beckoning with vicious intent, and certainly vicious consequence.",
        "We want to get listeners involved in this conversation about pride.",

        "Yes.",
        "I'm speaking, of course, as an atheist, a secularist, but it's always seemed to me that one reason why religions tend to be down on pride is because religion operates somewhat as a protection racket, in that they say you're, you know, you're really nothing.",
        "Oh, but with the help of God, you can be someone.",
        "Mmm.",
        "And I think they basically have to pull people down in order to build them, in order to claim they have a solution to that later on."

        "Hmm.",
        "Well, I think that that certainly may be the case and certainly has been the case for some religious cultures and religious peoples.",
        "On the other hand, I think another virtuous function of this religiously informed conception of pride is that it keeps people from investing, over-investing zealously and exaggerating the importance of institutions, say, like politics or culture, even the church, which accrue to themselves enormous forms of power that are rarely interrupted, except when people see that, no, the seat of your power, the source of your authority is not in you, but it's in God.",
        "Black people, for instance, who were put down systematically and lacerated, lashed even, with vicious forms of self-degrading reflection, said, no, you can't make us believe we're nothing.",
        "We believe we are something, because God's love and spirit in us makes us feel good, makes us feel capable, and therefore gives us a source outside of your authority to draw upon.",
        "So, I absolutely agree with your, with the caller's first analysis, but that doesn't exhaust the potential or possibility of response from within religious circles as to what pride functions as.",
        "I'd like to say that I do think there's a strong difference between pride in things for which one hasn't worked at all, like your race or your ancestry, and pride for things that you've achieved, of course, with some humility, because you stand on the shoulders of the people underneath you, and you don't have control over what talents you're given initially.",
        "Sure.",
        "Well, no question.",
        "But even, it's a bit more slippery than that, right?",
        "Because things for which you don't work, like race, well, race's meaning is never settled upon entry into existence, upon birth.",
        "The meaning of race depends upon the interaction between human beings and cultures and societies as to the meaning of that.",
        "So, in this case, especially in an American society where race has been a marker of degradation or seen, especially blackness, as a floating signifier for that which is not excellence, racial pride is a very hard, fought-for virtue.",
        "And sometimes, of course, to be sure it can become a vice, but a virtue that is the manifestation of a determination to identify with the things that are healthy and uplifting.",
        "So, I don't think that it's a given.",
        "The myth of the given there has to be dismissed, and I think that it is something that the people have to work very hard for in order to achieve.",
        "Yeah, but, you know, things like the Irish, and then later the Italians and Jews and Poles, for that matter, becoming white in the common language...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...that's a matter of just buying into the top of society without, you know, black people are never going to become white, so we better just drop the category if we could."

        "In particular, ethnic enclaves and cultures, and coming to America where the crucible of race pulverizes the ethnic particularity of Italian identity, or Polish identity, and so on.",
        "And it becomes white.",
        "It becomes all together white, because the politics of race in America are about black and white, so to speak.",
        "But yeah, on the other hand, though, blackness does signify, in serious fashion, and is not up to me as an individual black person whether we should have the category or not.",
        "I'd be perfectly willing to surrender the negative connotations of race all together.",
        "But, you know, I keep trying to leave it, but they keep dragging me back in, as they say.",
        "The reality is, is that race signifies, almost in an objective fashion, beyond the intent of the individual user of race.",
        "So, even if you want to disclaim the notion that race will have any impact on you, say as a person of color, there could still be objective conditions."

        "The issue of race keeps asserting itself with lethal intensity in America, and it's not up to the personal discretion of the individual person.",
        "It's a collective reality, and it's a group reality in a society where race continues to make a huge difference.",
        "So, I'd love to have the luxury of, you know, sloughing it off, but the reality is race has objective and very empirically-based consequences that I can't just dismiss with the wave of my hand.",

        "The black people who were left down there, 134,000 of whom were without cars, still had enough pride to muster the might to get to the, you know, to the Convention Center, or to the Super Dome.",
