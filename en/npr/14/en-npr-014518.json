        "But it also circumscribes, with boundaries, what we can say and not say, what we can mean and not mean.",
        "However, I think that the language is kind of elastic when it comes to conceptions of pride.",
        "Because if, as the caller has just talked about within, you know, Spanish and being Puerto Rican.",
        "There are many definitions, shades, and nuances of meaning that the language allows to, in one sense, allows to occur.",
        "So, if for instance, when you think about, we can use the same word, we don't even a different word...",

        "On the other hand, Curtis Mayfield would sing, I'm so proud, I'm so proud of you and the pride we have.",

        "So, it's even trickier within English when you have pride stretched out horizontally, but it means so many different things at the same time.",
        "And it can shift up even within the same paragraph to mean something positive and something negative.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "So, the point is that, yeah, that kind of pride can be destructive, and the lack of a sense of balance and approach to that relationship can be destructive.",
