        "No more than nervous than we are, Susan.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Oh, good.",
        "Well, I'm calling in a bit of a disagreement with an earlier caller, who had said that religion utilizes pride in order to keep people down.",
        "And although I think that's a pretty easy conclusion to draw when you're not in a religion, or dropped out when you were in high school, I think that's pretty, you know, that's kind of an obvious conclusion to draw.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But, I really think that the demonization, I guess you could say, of pride in religion, comes from early Catholic roots with aestheticism and mysticism, and, you know.",
        "In Plato, seeing this realm as basically false compared to the realm of the forms.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "You know, and I really think that that's where the lack of pride comes from.",
        "Seeing as, this realm isn't even real.",
        "So, it's really the realms of the form that we need to exist in, and really, pride has no place in that realm, because, you would have pride in earthly things which aren't even real."

        "Hmm.",
        "And I really think that that's where Catholic roots, where Catholics get the putting down of pride.",
        "Well, yeah, that's a very interesting argument.",
        "I try to trace, in the first chapter of my book, the kind of religious and philosophical roots of pride.",
        "You know the Augustian, that's a mystic, Gregory, of course, earlier bishop, Evagrius of Pontus, and so on and so forth...",
        "Exactly.",
        "...to think about the roots of pride.",
        "So, in that sense, I think that there is an ongoing argument about the relative place of pride, and the recognition of God as the superior power, and that human beings who fail to recognize that superior power are attempting, like Satan himself, to displace God, and therefore fall from heaven; the angelic heights of enlightened engagement with God, to a despotically willful place where they have rejected and repudiated the conception of God.",
        "So, in that sense, a religious conception certainly can be used to acknowledge the sinful place of pride.",
        "But it also can be used, I think, if I take the first call, the caller with whom your disagreeing, right.",
        "Right.",
        "I think that it can be used religiously to justify and sanctify a status quo, or to sanctify and justify a religious sensibility or body of belief that wants to police the mindsets and the perspectives of those who fall within its religious order.",
        "One thinks now of Evangelical pieties that are afoot in contemporary Christianity.",
        "Outside of even, say, Catholicism, where the rain of a certain kind of religious authority suggests that pride operates to the degree that people refuse to acknowledge the superiority of their religious viewpoint.",
        "Think about Pat Robertson on the 700 Club, and the enormously difficult and problematic deployment of the notion of pride there.",
        "Anything that challenges, I think, a middle of the road evangelical piety that is mainstream, and quite frankly, Republican right-wing, ends up being sinful, but everything that falls within that circle ends up being good.",
        "I think that could be a function of the protection racket that the first person talked about."

        "Michael Eric Dyson, you point out at one point, the different arguments that the two sides, parts of the two sides use, in rallying the troops around their arguments about abortion, for example.",
        "Oh, absolutely right.",
        "You know, because some people say, well, you claim to have enough insight to know when life begins or ends, so how can you make a judgment about when life ends or begins and do you think you're God.",
        "On the other hand, the opponents of such a viewpoint would say, no, it's not that we think we know when life begins or ends, it's the fact that you tried to exhaustively define what life is and you cut it off after, you know, when a child is born, you have no more investment in that child's life and as a result of that you begin to valorize the conception of life that is prenatal, so to speak.",
        "So, the warring sides in the abortion argument, or in the Civil Rights argument, about the proper use of force or love or justice in a public space all have to do, ultimately, with the roots of pride and how one understands the function of a certain sense of arrogance, or hubris, as we've been calling it, as it functions in politics.",
        "And I think that's part of the, both the enriched argument that we often have, and also part of the complexity of that argument that we often miss, in blunt force objects like you're proud, you're not proud, you're good, you're not good, you're bad, you're not bad.",
        "And I think that's where the problem comes in.",
        "Okay.",

        "As we've been discussing pride and the other deadly sins, as if sin is a term that has a lot of meaning in the world today.",
        "Yeah, right, exactly.",
        "That's true.",
        "I mean, you think about Karl Menninger's book, Whatever Became of Sin, and that was written, you know, I don't know, 30, 40 years ago.",
        "So, it is true that the notion of sin, as falling short of the mark, sin, as failing to live up to one's obligation, or more specifically and concretely sin as the manifestation of a will that is against God, has resonance in many of these religious communities, but it certainly takes on different meanings in different contexts.",
        "I mean, after all, don't the Muslim brothers and sisters who are now protesting the cartoon drawing in Denmark think that it is an absolute sin for anybody to make a representation of Muhammad, or of a deity, of their deity.",
        "And, you know, for the same people it is a sin not have the ability, that is the people who draw the commercials or the cartoons or the people who defend them religiously, it is an equally egregious sin not to have the freedom to express oneself and what's on one's mind.",
        "So, yeah, sin is a slippery slope and it certainly is a shape shifting term that depends upon the context to fill in the blanks about what it looks like.",
        "We're talking today with Michael Eric Dyson about his new book Pride, part of the seven deadly sin series from the Oxford University Press.",

        "Dyson, this is in no relation to God and such, but I'm from New Orleans, I'm a new transplant to Charlotte from New Orleans after the hurricane.",
        "And I was just curious to know why you sort of linked pride to people staying in New Orleans as a source for them staying there.",
        "And I ask that because being so familiar with New Orleans there's so many poor people that the hurricane having hit at the end of the month, they were simply unable to leave due to financial reasons.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Many, I don't think we need to categorize everybody, but yes.",
        "Right, right.",
        "Yeah, well, I argue in my book, Come Hell or High Water Hurricane Katrina and the Color of Disaster, that 134,000 people in New Orleans indeed were not able to leave at least because they didn't have cars.",
        "Now, all of them who didn't have cars, of course, I'm not arguing that everybody who didn't leave didn't have a car, because some people who had cars perhaps chose not to leave.",
        "I am arguing, however, as you have just now pointed out, that there are very empirically verifiable financial reasons and economic reasons why people were there.",
        "They weren't stubborn, they weren't stupid, they were stuck.",
        "But some chose to stay.",

        "Those poor houses?",
        "Well, I'll tell you what, 54 percent of people in the 9th Ward owned their own homes.",
        "Now, you might think they're crappy and shoddy, but they owned them.",
        "It was theirs.",
        "So, that's what I meant by pride.",
        "Like I'm proud of the fact that this is mine.",
        "This is my piece of territory, and if it gets washed away, you know, it's mine.",
        "And they were right, right?",
        "Many of those people turned out to be right because now that their property has been washed away FEMA is not helping them out, the federal government is not helping them out, the local government failed them.",
        "And so they were right to be concerned about what would happen and their investment.",
        "That's what I meant by pride.",
