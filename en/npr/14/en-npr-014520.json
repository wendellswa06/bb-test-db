        "But to get back to my original comment, if we look at, you know, it's just a comment, if we look at literature and we see the examples of pride, say in Oedipus Rex, where he's literally blinded and then he hands it down to his daughter, and that's the reason she's, you know, killed by pride.",
        "But if we bring that to a more modern day kind of concrete example, you look at sports players who seem to almost rip apart their team and destroy that family bond through their own, you know, selfish pride, and their own sense of self worth that is not in any way humble.",

        "And to wreck the pride of the team as a team.",
        "So the same function of pride or at least I say the same word functions in different ways.",

        "I think America has a great dose of this as well, as I write in the fifth chapter of my book about the difference between being patriotic, which is loving one's country in an edifying and in a very vividly ingratiating way, and then nationalism, which is my country right or wrong, which is the belief that my country is the only means by which the norms of justice and democracy can be measured.",
