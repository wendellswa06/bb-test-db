        "Well, because Congress made a change last year in the tax bill.",
        "It zeroed out the penalty for - the tax penalty for people who didn't have insurance.",
        "And what the 18 Republican attorneys general argued in their brief is that without that tax penalty - that was what the Supreme Court said that the law could hang on back in 2012 - without it, the whole rest of the law has to go away.",
        "The Trump administration said maybe not that much.",
        "They argued that just the preexisting condition protection should go away.",
        "But the judge agreed with the original claim in the lawsuit that said the whole law has to go down.",
        "So will this case definitely get to the Supreme Court?",
        "I think most people think it will probably get to the Supreme Court.",
        "There is some thought that the 5th Circuit, which is where this case is - it's a pretty conservative circuit.",
        "But even they might not - not only not agree with this judge's take on it but might not agree that the plaintiffs in the case even have standing to sue.",
        "So it could get rejected, basically, on a technicality.",
        "But there is probably a good chance that it will eventually get to the Supreme Court.",
        "So here's where I'm asking you to speculate, but what would happen if this ruling is eventually upheld - if the court, for whatever reason, decides that this judge is right, and this case, which was brought by all these Republican attorneys general, does have merit?",
        "What happens?",
        "Well, it's not even really speculation.",

        "It was a number of new benefits and huge payment changes for Medicare.",
        "It renewed the Indian Health Service.",
        "It allowed for generic biologic drugs.",
        "All of those things would go away if the entire law was struck down.",
        "And a lot of analysts say it would really plunge the nation's health care system into chaos.",
        "The federal government wouldn't know - wouldn't be able to basically pay for Medicare because all of the Medicare payments have now been structured because of the Affordable Care Act.",
        "So if it went away, it would be really an enormous disruption.",
        "So we have about a half a minute left.",
        "Do you have any sense of what the timing of all this might be?",
        "I can imagine that this is very nerve-wracking for people who are getting their health insurance because of this or - you just don't follow this stuff every day.",
        "It is.",
        "Well, we've been waiting two months - more than two months just for this decision, so it's not clear how long it will take.",
        "But one thing that this does is it throws the Affordable Care Act into uncertainty again.",
        "Every time it seems that it stopped and this is what we're going to have, something else changes.",
        "So, as long as this takes, we're going to have this uncertainty with the law.",
