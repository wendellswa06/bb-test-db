        "Election Day was the last time Romney addressed a crowd like this.",
        "That night, he was shocked and exhausted, his speech thrown together at the last minute.",
        "Today's address felt almost like the actual concession speech.",
        "Of course I left the race disappointed that I didn't win.",
        "But I also left honored and humbled to have represented the values we believe in and to speak for so many good and decent people.",
        "He looked back, telling stories of ordinary and famous people he met on the campaign trail and he sounded humble.",
        "As someone who just lost the last election, I'm probably not in the best position to chart the course for the next one.",
        "Still, Romney dismissed people who are writing obituaries for the Republican Party.",
        "He said, I utterly reject pessimism.",
        "And he said his party should find hope in state houses around the country, where Republicans now hold 30 governor's offices.",
        "They're winning elections, but more importantly, they're solving problems.",
        "At the end of this 15-minute speech, Romney nodded to some of the themes from his campaign - freedom, debt, gridlock.",
        "Not long ago, he believed he would be tackling those challenges from the White House.",
        "Now, Romney says he won't run for office again, but today he promised not to withdraw from public life.",
        "I'm sorry I won't be your president, but I will be your co-worker and I'll work shoulder to shoulder alongside you.",
        "The audience jumped to its feet with a roaring cheer.",
        "Romney wrapped up with thanks as his campaign song pumped back over the speakers one last time.",
        "He stood on the stage waving before he finally turned around and walked away.",
        "Ari Shapiro, NPR News.",
        "To the end, Maurice Sendak retained a wicked sense of humor, which he demonstrated this past January when comedian Stephen Colbert paid him a visit."

        "This is a situation where Immigration benefited from their own delay.",
        "They could have taken Ricky before an immigration judge much sooner.",
        "And this case would have been resolved way before he served five years in prison.",
        "In the decision that the judge made to allow Ricky to stay, the judge cited the length of time that Ricky had been in the United States.",
        "At the time, Ricky had already been in the United States over 20 years.",
        "The judge mentioned that Ricky had no close relatives or any ties to the United Kingdom, that he owned property in the United States and that he had strong family ties, his mother, his son, now he's married.",
        "And she also cited to many of Ricky's accomplishments while he's been here in the United States in that he gave talks to churches, he spoke to youth groups regarding the dangers of violating the law.",
        "And all those things are the factors that the judge considered in determining that the positive equities in Ricky's life far outweighed the mistake he made and the conviction that he was given because of that crime."
