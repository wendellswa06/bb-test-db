        "Jeff, thanks very much.",
        "And let me ask you about - the one we've not focused on at all yet is Iran.",
        "And more evidence over the weekend, if more were needed, that Iran appears to be - its nuclear ambitions include nuclear weapons and that's the direction it seems to be going no matter what the international community says or does.",
        "Well, we don't know how true this so-called evidence is.",
        "As you know, there are a lot of parties that are interested in the United States and Iran not reaching an agreement.",
        "So we have to be absolutely certain that this is not a repetition of the Iraq case when there was also a lot of parties that wanted us to go to war with the Iraq and kept insisting that there is evidence that the Iraqis already have nuclear weapons.",
        "I think the picture with Iran is more mixed.",
        "I think there are reasons to be suspicious, but we don't have enough reasons to be conclusively convinced that they're actually actively seeking nuclear weapons.",
        "The last comprehensive U.S.",
        "intelligence assessment concluded that currently, they are not.",
        "Secretary Gates recently said that he didn't think that would have any effective nuclear arsenal before 2014.",
        "One, be patient and not to try to force the issue immediately, because if we do it's a prescription for failure.",
        "Secondly, to the extent possible we should be negotiating not just about the nuclear problem, which is a very serious and complex problem, but we should always be negotiating about regional security in which we'd have a common stake and maybe even about financial economic arrangements.",
        "If we do that, there's a greater chance of quid pro quos emerging from the different negotiating tables.",
        "And I think that's in our interest.",
        "Yet, there was the president himself who said, though, he wanted to see substantial progress with Iran by the end of his first year in office or else he would start moving towards more comprehensive sanctions.",
        "He wasn't that precise.",
        "He says at the end of the first year, he will reassess how much progress there is and then make a decision.",
        "And I think he'd be very unwise if he concluded that there is not enough progress, therefore we should abort and move towards sanctions.",
        "Let me give another example.",
        "Right now, we have negotiations with the Russians regarding a new START agreement that involves reductions in nuclear weapons.",
        "We didn't reach an agreement.",
        "And the agreement expired a few days ago.",
        "Should we now plunge into a immediate threats against Russia and adoption of sanctions?",
        "I don't think anybody would urge that.",
        "Okay.",
        "Well, let's use that as a measuring stick for how we should negotiate with Iran.",
        "We're talking on the Opinion Page this week with Zbigniew Brzezinski who was, of course, national security advisor to President Carter.",

        "Hi.",
        "Yes.",
        "I think, in my opinion, I'm a citizen of the United States now.",
        "And I can say as a citizen that I would really rather our troops not be in Iraq and not be in Afghanistan.",
        "I believe Afghanistan and Iraq are completely irrelevant in some way.",
        "If our stated goal is to pursue al- Qaida, then it's very puzzling to me why we would stay in Afghanistan since al- Qaida is not a fixed entity and doesn't need any particular place to get along.",
        "So my question is, well, if we were to suddenly triumph over Afghanistan, suppress the Taliban entirely, what's next since al-Qaida is supposedly in Pakistan?",
        "Do we attack Pakistan next?",
        "Do we take over Waziristan?",
        "It seems absolutely pointless to me.",
        "This is a cover.",
        "The pursuit of al-Qaida is a cover for broad strategic aims whether they have to do with oil or sphere of influence or some such, a - the great gain, if you will.",
        "This one is really special, it's really amazing for me because it's in my motherland, in my old country.",
        "And especially I become the torchbearer.",
        "Collin, let's Zbigniew Brzezinski respond.",
        "And Dr. Brzezinski, as you know, the president has sent a stern warning to Pakistan that if they do not deal with the elements in their country, that are crossing the border to fight in Afghanistan, the United States will and more drone attacks and perhaps and even the soldiers going across the border.",
        "Well, he didn't really say that in his speech.",
        "He said that he hopes and expects that Pakistan will make a serious effort to deal with the Taliban, in particular with that Taliban which shelters al-Qaida.",
        "He doesn't exclude some accommodations also locally with the Taliban.",
        "But I think the key issue is that we didn't go in there because of some great gain.",
        "We went in there because the Taliban regime in Afghanistan provide a safe haven for al- Qaida, which meant that al-Qaida had a command structure, training camps, other facilities in a large country and could act from it with a relative impunity.",
        "That is why there was a danger.",
        "And this is why the United States went in.",
        "I think that President Obama now has indicated that he wishes to focus specifically on al-Qaida, making it impossible for - to operate from there.",
        "But that he's not planning to engage in some long-term indefinite effort to remake Afghan society, to rebuild it into a modern democracy.",
        "Nonetheless, at the same time, he knows that if we just pull out abruptly from Afghanistan, not only will al-Qaida have a prominent position there potentially, but it would strengthen the al-Qaida forces and the Taliban in Pakistan, a country which now has nuclear weapons, and that would potentially greatly maximize the risks.",
        "This is the reason why we're engaged.",
        "It's nothing that one wishes for.",
        "It's nothing the one did voluntarily.",
        "But we're really caught by the circumstances created by 9/11, and the very strong unilateral reaction that President Bush undertook and then neglected, because shortly thereafter he sort of got diverted to Iraq.",
        "We just have a few seconds with you left, but does not al-Qaida have those same kinds of facilities and structures now in those tribal areas in Pakistan?",
        "Well, that's precisely why the danger involves not only Afghanistan but also Pakistan.",
        "And this is why we have to work at an outcome that both secures Pakistan but also makes Afghanistan unlikely to offer a safe haven to al-Qaida.",
        "Otherwise, we could be facing a much greater danger than the one that arose in 2001.",
        "Zbigniew Brzezinski, thanks very much for your time today.",
        "Well, it's very good to talk to you.",
        "Thank you for having me."
