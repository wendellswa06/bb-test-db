        "And David, also a former prosecutor, she worked in the District Attorney's office in Manhattan under a legend there, Robert Morgenthau and that comes up in terms of a case called Graham versus Florida and Sullivan versus Florida, which raised the question of whether it's cruel and unusual to sentence juveniles to life imprison without the possibility for parole, for crimes in which there was nobody dead, did not involve murder or a crime leading to murder.",
        "You know, Neal, I think her prosecutorial background will affect her in a number of cases, search and seizer-type cases.",
        "When she was on the Court Of Appeals she was much more skeptical than some of the traditional liberals about keeping out evidence.",

        "What is the constitutional issue here?",
        "The constitutional issue really gets flagged a couple of years back, Neal.",
        "As you'll remember, the Supreme Court, in a pretty contentious decision with Anthony Kennedy voting with the liberals, determined that it was unconstitutional under the 8th amendment, cruel and unusual, to execute folks who were juveniles when they committed their crime.",
        "And the analysis got a lot of people all fired up.",

        "Their brains are not formed.",
        "And so they can't be held accountable to the extent that you can give them the sort of ultimate punishment that you can give an adult.",
        "But there was a sort of gloss over the Kennedy opinion that had a lot to do with international norms, what other people do, what other countries do; the fact that the United States really was an outlier in its willingness to execute juveniles.",
        "So, this case really builds upon that president and says look, if it's unconstitutional to execute someone for crimes committed when they were juvenile, how can it possibly be constitutional to put them in jail and throw away the key without any possibility that they can ever get out.",
        "Everybody's eyes are, of course, going to be on Anthony Kennedy again, because I think, as David pointed out correctly, probably Sotomayor will tilt leftward on this.",
        "And then the question is, the same Anthony Kennedy who said I just can't bring myself to execute someone for crimes they committed when they were 16, is he willing to give them life without parole.",
        "So, that's the constitutional question.",
        "But again, we're hearing a lot of muttering about the fact the United States is one of really only a handful of countries - and as David points out, Florida really only one of sort of a small minority of states that had most of the juveniles in prison with life without parole.",
        "And some people would see incrementalism here, and that the next step is to say wait a minute, even if it does involve a murder, you can't sentence a juvenile to life without parole.",
        "Well, that's the problem from the prosecution point of view, and that's what they're going to argue.",
        "The court, I should say, has never basically used the Eighth Amendment, cruel and unusual, to limit prison terms.",
        "I mean, all the big decisions have been limiting the death penalty, and so that's the threshold that we've got to sort of cross here.",
