        "Right.",
        "It's a simple question with a lot of history behind it that until the 20th century, most of the parts of the Bill of Rights were said to only limit the national government, and that's the question here.",
        "Does the Second Amendment, like the old Bill of Rights, only limit the national government, or does it also apply to states and municipalities?",
        "And as I understand it, in the 19th century, the court issued a number of decisions which said no, it does not apply to the states.",
        "That's right.",
        "Well, remember the First Amendment begins with the word: Congress shall make no laws respecting… And so the thought was, for most of American history, the Bill of Rights, the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, Fourth, only applied to the national government.",
        "The Second Amendment got lost along the wayside because there weren't any Second Amendment cases, and so now the court's got to try to decide: Are we going to bring the Second Amendment into line with all the other parts of the Bill of Rights and applies to all government at all levels?",
        "And Dahlia Lithwick, this in terms of the gun people, this is incrementalism on their behalf.",

        "This is the next step.",
        "This was the obvious next step, and it was a question that was expressly reserved in the Miller decision by the Supreme Court.",
        "The court just did not want to go there.",
        "Now they have to go there.",
        "Stay with us if you will, and Jeremy, thank you very much for the call, appreciate it.",

        "He's for the Los Angeles Times, along with us also Dahlia Lithwick of Slate.com, and David, I wanted to ask you about something you write.",
        "We just were talking earlier, just before the break, about the gun case in this term, the case about gun bans in Chicago, and there is an issue here that is quite interesting not just simply extending this decision from the District of Columbia, a federal enclave, to the states, but something called the privileges clause, and tell us about that.",
        "Yes, there's one aspect of this case that actually has liberal constitutional scholars and conservatives on the same side in this issue.",
        "After the Civil War, Congress passed and added the 14th Amendment.",
        "It said: No state shall abridge the privileges or immunities of a citizen of the United States.",
        "And that was their way of extending all the fundamental rights, like the Bill of Rights, say those are a matter of you as a U.S.",
        "citizen, your privileges, your immunities.",
        "The Supreme Court, a few years later, basically wrote that provision out of the Constitution and said it really didn't mean anything.",
        "It only meant national rights.",
        "And it's been dead - it's been essentially a dead letter ever since then.",
        "And a lot of liberal scholars have thought that's - there's a whole series of privileges of U.S.",
        "citizenship that you could be made part of the Constitution, and they've argued for reviving the privileges or immunities clause, and a lot of conservatives in the gun-rights case say the Second Amendment right to bear was one of those privileges of U.S.",
        "citizenship.",
        "So in this case, the court is actually going to consider whether the right to bear arms is one of the privileges of U.S.",
        "citizenship.",
        "And what might be some of the other implications of that, Dahlia Lithwick?",
        "Well, the implications are vast.",
        "I mean, we really - one of the things that's so tricky about this case, and David sort of highlights nicely, one of the really most curious things about this when it came down is the Heller decision in D.C., is that sort of liberal academics got on board with conservatives and gun-rights people, and they all kind of came together and said look, if we're for a robust reading of the Bill of Rights, let's read the Second Amendment robustly.",
        "And really, I think the tipping point in this case came when a lot of progressive scholars started to say - they were calling it the embarrassing Second Amendment, the notion that this is a right only conferred upon militias.",
        "Diana Abeyta lives on a quiet suburban cul-de-sac in the San Francisco Bay Area.",

        "So when they started saying no, this is an individual right, this is a robust, individual right, the whole world kind of fell on its ear, and the court sort of followed that lead of the academics and said okay, it's a robust, individual right.",
        "But that didn't solve this problem of what is a reasonable regulation, and that's the can of worms that pops open now.",
        "Okay.",
        "We know that it's subject to reasonable regulation.",
        "The question is, and this was not a question that was answered in any meaningful way in the Heller decision that came out of the District of Columbia, what is a reasonable regulation?",
        "There was a very funny, throw-away line where Justice Scalia said: Clearly, you wouldn't want people bringing guns into the courthouse.",
        "So we know that he sort of wants to be safe at his job, but it really does raise these questions that are very, very hard to answer about where you're going to do that very, very complicated line-drawing about what are reasonable regulations of a right that, even if it's an individual right, obviously isn't absolute.",
        "David?",
        "Well, before we leave privileges, it is a very hard question to answer because you don't know if the court opens up that door.",
        "But there was a case about 10 or 12 years ago.",
        "It's the only time I remember the court cited it.",

        "But secondly, isn't there an issue with the Second Amendment applying then to all of the states with the 10th Amendment and reserved powers?",
        "The 10th Amendment says: Anything that we don't specifically award to the federal government in this Constitution and its amendment goes to the states.",
        "I'm paraphrasing here, and the Constitution is an awkward thing to paraphrase, but Dahlia Lithwick, have I got that roughly right?",
        "I think that's right.",
        "Yeah because there are those powers then reserved to the state, and I just kind of wondered if the federal government then rules on the Second Amendment to apply broadly to the states, it just - it seems like that ruling, in and of itself, will take away a lot of those state powers to regulate their own gun laws.",
        "That's interesting.",

        "Leave us alone.",

        "And this is a case called U.S.",
        "versus Stevens, distributor of films, which involve pit bull fighting and animals being crushed, its critics say tortured, to death on film and whether they could be sold for profit.",

        "Yeah, this is one of those cases, Neal, that gets a lot of press just because of the utter grossness of the underlying facts.",
        "And as you point out, the utter grossness is that there's apparently some fetish phenomenon of watching women in very high-heeled shoes do something called crush videos, where they crush little, tiny, baby animals with their feet.",
        "I never knew this existed until this case came up, but apparently in an attempt to sort of do away with the crush-video phenomenon in 1999, Congress passed a statute that was going to make the interstate commercial trafficking in depictions of such animal cruelty illegal.",
        "Now, the question is whether this is way, way, way too sweeping under the First Amendment.",
        "The statute itself has an exception for items for films that have, quote, serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical or artistic value; but really the question is: Can Congress go ahead and do away with a whole class of speech the same way we've said there's no First Amendment protection for, say, child pornography?",
        "Is this tantamount to child pornography in that it has no redeeming value whatsoever?",

        "There is a very strong body of law that says if it's, you know, something involves expression or speech, the government simply can't regulate it and ban it because they don't like the content.",

        "The idea was - there's this underground market in dog-fighting videos that they wanted to do away with, and I must say, I don't have a good instinct.",
        "The argument is tomorrow.",
        "I'll be interested to see how the justices approach this, whether they think this goes too far, no free speech protection, or on the other hand, hey, this is a video, and the government can't make a video a crime.",
