        "Go ahead, please.",
        "I just had a comment about the corporate-personhood case.",
        "I think they're - at least I hope that the Supreme Court denies constitutional rights to corporations as opposed to expands those rights.",
        "Corporations' rights.",
        "They are treated, at least in tax law, and this is one their geniuses, Dahlia Lithwick, as individuals.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, this was the - this is the core fight, as David said, that was going on here.",
        "And one of the very, very interesting things that we saw happening in the last couple of years of the Roberts court is a very fundamental split between two of the four conservatives, and two of the four conservatives on the court.",
        "And by that I mean Justice Scalia and - Justice Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas are unequivocal, unequivocal on this question that they think that this part of McCain-Feingold is completely unconstitutional and that corporations have the right to speak like anyone else and that this is, in fact, core constitutional speech.",
        "It goes to the most important First Amendment right, which is to talk about politics and elections.",
        "On the other hand, Chief Justice John Roberts and Sam Alito have had this wait-and-see approach.",
        "And we - it's not only in this case that we've seen this play out.",
        "Several times over the last couple of years, we've, in fact, heard Antonin Scalia accuse his colleague, accuse John Roberts of what's he's called, quote, \"\"faux judicial restraint,\"\" of taking it slow, taking it easy, not being willing to do the dirty work of overturning precedents.",
        "This case, if Citizens United go to the way it looks like it's going to go, it would require overturning two precedents.",
        "So there's this really interesting tension - I think it's almost the most interesting, unreported story about the Supreme Court right now - between these two branches of conservatives on the court.",
        "And so really, this question of how robust is this constitutional right to personhood in corporations, and I should just add that Alito and Roberts have very much waited on this issue.",
        "They've said we want to wait until this question is squarely before us.",
        "They've had an opportunity to address it.",
        "They haven't taken it.",
        "But I think this dynamic of Alito and Roberts sort of trying to determine how far they want to go is probably the most interesting piece over at the Roberts court right now.",
        "And here's an email on this point from Dave.",
        "How do they give corporations rights under the Constitution?",
        "They are creatures of statutes, so they can be limited by statute.",
        "No?",
        "David?",
        "Pretty good argument.",
        "It's the one the solicitor general uses in this case.",
        "There is an easy way out in this case, or a simple middle course, which is to say this was a nonprofit, ideological corporation.",
        "This is not, you know, what used to be General Motors, a company that made a lot of money and could pour money into - I think that's one of the things that really irks the conservatives in this case, is that you have a lot of groups that, like - the previous case was Wisconsin Right to Life.",
        "It was a small group that only existed - it was not a classic profit-making corporation.",
        "It was an incorporated, ideological group.",
        "Same thing with this group, Citizens United, that put out this movie.",
        "And so I think one possibility is to say we're going to exempt these nonprofit ideological corporations and reserve the question about what if it really is the pharmaceutical industry or the insurance industry…"

        "You start with a tiny corporation that really has no profit.",
        "And they hand down some decision that says corporations have a free speech right, then it's everybody.",
        "Then, you're talking about the big-money corporations.",
        "So, I think there's a possibility they'll stick with some narrow, middle-ground rule.",

        "We're talking about the upcoming Supreme Court session with David Savage and Dahlia Lithwick.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And there's another interesting case we've not mentioned yet: Salazar v.",
        "Bono.",
        "This is the cross in the desert case.",
        "It involves the separation of church and state.",
        "A cross was erected on federal land.",
        "And Dahlia, the way I understand it, there was an end-run.",
        "That land was donated to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, I think, so that they could get around the fact that you're not supposed to use federal, public land for religious ceremonies.",
        "That's right.",
        "One part of this case that's very interesting is that once this case sort of blew up and it became clear there was going to be a big mess around it, the government tried to give one acre of land back to the Veterans of Foreign Wars and say, okay, you take the acre that the cross is on, and we've now sidestepped the constitutional question.",
        "And that is certainly one of the issues in this case.",
        "You know, the court's jurisprudence on these public crosses is just a mess.",
        "It's such an unmitigated disaster, Neal.",
        "And it's very, very hard to determine what the current jurisprudence is about these public, religious symbols that may or may not be purely religious, they have a historic meaning.",
        "Ruth?",
        "This cross has been there in the Mojave Desert since 1974.",
        "It was erected by a private group, the Veterans of Foreign Wars.",
        "It's a small cross compared to some of the crosses we've fought about before, but the jurisprudence is all over the place.",
        "And this case comes to the court in addition to this question of can the court just sort of slice and dice the land and give it away?",
        "This very, very complicated question about standing, and that is to say who is the offended viewer of the cross, and how offended does he have to be, and how do we measure that offense?",
        "It's a very, very complicated question.",
        "In this particular case, the guy who objects to the cross is himself a Roman Catholic.",
        "His principal objection is that the government wouldn't let the Buddhists put up a monument to their religion.",
        "So it really becomes very, very weird and squirrelly.",
        "And this question of not just, you know, is this government establishment of religion, but who gets to come into the courthouse and complain about it?",
        "And this would affect, presumably, Merry Christmas lights on city hall and (unintelligible) outside the courthouse, David?"

        "They said Texas could have a plaque with the Ten Commandments sitting near the capital, amongst some other monuments, but Kentucky could not put the Ten Commandments in each of its courthouses.",

        "It seems like it's a real mess, and they may end up with some narrow ruling or something, as Dahlia suggested, they may focus just on the standing question.",
        "Well, I'm sure we will have both of you back at various times over the next several months as the Supreme Court winnows its way through these and other cases, about the 74 others - we've only talked about a few - and issues its decisions over the course of time.",
