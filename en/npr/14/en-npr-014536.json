        "Devin Leonard is a staff writer with Bloomberg Businessweek.",
        "He's profiled the revival of the agency's enforcement division.",
        "The SEC - under the Bush administration and more specifically, under chairman Chris Cox - had a reputation as being toothless, especially when it came to enforcement.",
        "And there are numbers that support that.",
        "The penalties under Chris Cox in 2008, when the markets were raging and all, you know, all sorts of things were happening - a lot of bad things were happening - the total number of penalties that the enforcement division collected were about quarter of a billion dollars.",
        "Flash forward to 2011; they collected a billion dollars in penalties.",
        "The enforcement division has been largely reinvigorated and among other things, the director - new director, who's been there for three years; he was a former federal prosecutor - Robert Khuzami has created specialized units dealing with insider trading, dealing with hedge funds, dealing with municipal bonds, and dealing with structured products - you know, real estate CDOs and securitized real estate debt, that caused a lot of the problems in the financial crisis.",
        "So it sounds like they're in a better position to - kind of go after the figures they're looking for on Wall Street.",
        "And you talk about the different folks in the department who, you know, share some credit in this.",
        "But in particular, you zero in on an investigator named Sanjay Wadhwa.",
        "Tell us about his background, and what he's doing differently.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And like what you just said about Pepsi, Pepsi kept the key touchpoints but they said, let's shake it up and throw it out again and make it exciting for the next generation here.",
        "And I think the speech was another one of those moments that really marked the president's transition from campaigning to governing.",
        "It was the speech of somebody who, as David said, really soberly has thought through the role of America in the world.",
        "And it was a speech that Bill Kristol, the ultimate conservative hawk on Iraq and Afghanistan and everyplace else, loved.",
        "And it was the speech of man who has confronted the realism that you can only confront by sitting in the Oval Office and weighing the tough decisions.",
        "And that was clearly his most agonizing and agonized decision of the year.",
        "Here's one measure of change over a year: About a year ago, when candidate Barack Obama was hoping to reach across the aisle and improve bipartisanship in Washington, he used to talk about his conservative friend Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, the Republican senator who was last heard leading Republicans in prayer that some Democrats shouldn't show up for the cloture vote.",
        "What happened, what happened to the hopes for some kind of more bipartisan tone in this city?",
        "Yeah, I've got a scapegoat for this, which is David Obey and Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner - that is, the congressional leadership.",
        "I happen to think that Obama actually tried to reach out to the Republicans, but the first thing that happened was, we have a stimulus bill that went through the House Appropriations Committee, which was phenomenally partisan, where information was not shared, which was old politics at its worst.",
        "And that pretty much soiled the waters ever since.",
        "And now we're stuck again - probably with an even more partisan atmosphere than under George W.",
        "Bush.",
        "And one of the things that is so striking to me about this year - and you might say that lamentations about the lack of bipartisanship are something that we end every year with ..."

        "Well, we did have Afghanistan, which is sort of bipartisan.",
        "I do think when he gets his substantive policy grounds correct, you can actually create bipartisanship.",
        "I probably am the squishiest conservative on the face of the earth, but even I couldn't stomach the stimulus bill or the health-care bill.",
        "So, the policy just wasn't there for any kind of centrist alternative.",

        "I'm afraid my baby boom generation has failed in parenting, he writes, failed by giving too many pats on the back when a swift kick in the butt was really needed."
