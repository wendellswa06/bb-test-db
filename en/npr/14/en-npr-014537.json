        "I mean, what are the things that he was doing differently, that have made a difference?",
        "Well, I think one of the things that the SEC used to do is, they used to wait for tips to come in; or in some cases, there's something called FINRA - it used to be the NASD, the National Association of Securities Dealers - that would alert the SEC when there were - lots of trading before an event, or an earnings release in stocks.",
