        "The whole white part of it opens up hugely.",
        "And then if you got the low-calorie version, it's just a little, tiny smile.",
        "And it's supposed to engage - the logo itself is similar enough to the old Pepsi logo.",
        "I don't think it's going to confuse anybody, but I think a lot of people looked at that endeavor and the amount of money that kind of got you there, and were surprised by it.",
        "I happen to like the can itself.",
        "I think the can is simple and blue and really stands out on the shelf in a retail way, in a way that the old package - that was covered in little doohickies and swishes and lines and all sorts of stuff like that - really didn't.",
        "And Coke did a similar thing, too.",
        "They've taken it back to simplicity as well.",
        "The Coke can is very, very - simply red and almost devoid of extra marketing, you know, doodads.",
        "And I applaud that.",
        "I think it makes for a more compelling package on the shelf.",
        "You used an interesting word, and that is engagement, that the way these brands are conceived, they're supposed to engage us consumers.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Yeah, you're supposed to - the reason that anybody does this at all, I mean, the reason that you take a package that has sold well for, you know, 100 years and change it is because you have to create some news around the brand.",
        "There's a lot of ways to create news around the brand.",
        "I mean, you can run an ad campaign.",
        "You can have a celebrity use it or not use it.",
        "You can do all sorts of things like that.",
        "But one of the ways to make something new without changing anything on the inside of the package is to change the package.",
        "Change the package.",
        "Though, as you also point out in a piece you wrote, in perilous economic times, there are risks associated with this.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, the whole reason is, if you're seeing something changing yourself, some sort of external influence that is changing your customers' behavior - all of a sudden, their paychecks are different, or there's some other reason that they're not doing what they used to do - you either have - you have to change something about what you're doing in order to either get them back, get them interested again, something.",
        "And there are relatively - especially on a product like Pepsi, or anything where there's a lot of risk about changing the product itself, like New Coke."

        "I mean, you can see it in the advertising with all the, you know, the bright colors and the adjectives and how they express themselves.",

        "But - this problem is, is almost everybody, they've moved to putting a juicy tomato on the front of the bottle, and that seems perfectly logical.",

        "And so removing that, even though it's a tiny little thing and you probably couldn't quantify it, and it might not show up on any data sheets or any research, it's a little thing that is a connective tissue that you're probably not - you're not benefiting the product by just removing it for no reason.",
