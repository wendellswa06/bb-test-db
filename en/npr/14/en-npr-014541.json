        "First of all, go back a little bit in history, because this particular methodology has a clear precedent.",
        "It was the very same, almost the exact same, method that was attempted by Ramzi Yousef, the leader of the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, who after he fled after that incident had this plot to blow up about a dozen U.S.",
        "airliners over the Pacific in the Far East.",

        "What kinds of things do you have to think about?",
        "The security countermeasures, and we know from going back to the Yousef experience and the interrogations of him after the earlier plot, he was highly conscience of this, thinking about what sorts of materials could be sneaked past security, and of course back in those days, the aviation security checkpoints were much less rigorous than what we have today.",
        "That's the first thing you have to consider.",
        "And then you have to consider on-flight security measures, sky marshals, and that sort of thing.",
        "Wouldn't you have to teach the people who were going to carry this out how to do it, that is, how to get these bomb components safely on board and then put them together on board and then put them together in such a way that they'd actually go off?",
        "On the sheer mechanics of putting an explosive together, and I'm not an engineer or a technical expert, but my understanding of the sorts of materials that could be used, they are not that hard to put together to combine in a way that would cause at least a small explosion or a large fire.",
        "And we should remember that any kind of thing going bang at 30,000 feet in a thin-skinned aircraft can be much more destructive, to the point of being catastrophic, than it would be on the ground, where it might make a relatively small amount of damage.",
        "How about communication, maintaining discipline, and information, that kind of thing?",

        "They generally are highly conscious of operational security, well aware of the well-publicized communications-intercept capabilities of the authorities in the United States, Britain, and elsewhere, keeping most of their communications, or to the largest extent possible, face to face.",
        "And another technique that they have used in the past, particularly overseas, is with the use of pre-paid chips or cards that don't associate a particular cell-phone number with any one address or any one individual.",
        "So they use all these techniques to try to minimize their vulnerability.",
        "How about fake IDs?",
        "Wouldn't it be risky for potential bombers to use their real names when boarding planes, because you wouldn't know if you might be on a watch list, so you'd have to get fake IDs for 20 people.",
        "We've had unfortunate incidents where, say, a supply of blank passports had been stolen from the embassy of a particular country somewhere, and they enter the black market.",
        "But there again, fake identification is not absolutely essential.",
        "As we saw to our horror in the investigation of 9-11, we had some of those perpetrators operating under their real name.",
        "I would not see that as an insuperable barrier to even a modestly organized organization, but it's certainly one of the major things that they would have to plan for and prepare for.",
        "But you know, isn't there a kind of difference in scale if you're talking about someone who organizes to buy subway tickets and someone who organizes to buy transatlantic airplane tickets and maybe for multiple trips?",
        "There's talk about test runs, that sort of thing.",
        "People who are going to maybe acquire fake IDs, bomb components - I mean it just seems much more grand, if you will.",
        "Remember after 9-11 how many times you head, oh, there must have been a state security service behind this.",
        "Well, there wasn't.",
        "Yes, you need a little more money, of course, to buy airplane tickets and to buy train or transit or bus tickets.",
        "But as far as coordinating schedules and things like that, not only are we all quite experienced with using cell phones, but you or I could get online and research the airline schedules and probably, in pretty short order, come up with our own list of simultaneous flights that would make tempting terrorist targets for an operation like this.",
        "The spirit has to do what is invoked, and that's quite different from either Protestant or Catholic Christianity.",
        "It means that the spirits, like the holy spirit, are far more active in people's lives than they would be in the normal European interpretation.",
        "Later caches found in other Annapolis buildings show the spiritual practices mixing with Christianity.",
        "There's one intriguing piece.",
        "It's a tiny little charm the size of a ladybug, a hand holding a ring.",
        "Leone calls it a fist charm and says it's evidence that the early slaves were practicing the Muslim religion here too.",
        "And therefore in 18th and 19th century Annapolis there are other religions beyond Christianity.",
        "So, despite how slave masters may have tried, they could not break the culture of the Africans that were brought here.",
        "Maybe they hid it but they kept putting these things in these caches, they kept speaking to their spirits.",
        "You can tell that.",
        "We could not only tell that, through archaeology we can actually use artifacts to understand the wholeness and the complexity of people's lives.",
        "So our contribution to Annapolis is an understanding that this is an African city with African traditions alive as well as the European city."
