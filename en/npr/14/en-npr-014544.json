        "Now, before we get to some of the iPad competitors, what are some of the new features that Apple might rule out with this new iPad 2?",
        "The pretty obvious new features are it's going to be thinner, it's going to be lighter.",
        "It's going to have a camera, probably a front-facing camera so that people can do video chat.",
        "But beyond that, it's - I don't think Apple has to do a whole lot to keep their lead and keep people interested.",

        "Well, the biggest competitor to Apple on the tablet front is Google.",

        "Are they all touch screen tablets?",
        "Can you expand the image in the way that you can in an iPad.",

        "The reason that it is as successful as it is or has been embraced as broadly as it has been, because of all the applications, you can basically use your iPad to do all kinds of things if you are able to, you know, load it up with all kinds of apps.",
        "Can you do that with these other tablets?",
        "Not to the point that you can with the iPad.",
        "I mean, when they're advertising the iPad or even the iPhone to a certain extent, they're just showing off the apps.",
        "They're not even showing off the phone's features anymore at this point.",
        "They're just kind of showing off all the fun stuff you can do with apps.",
        "And they've got - a last quote was around 60,000 apps just made for the iPad, for the larger screen of the tablet.",
        "And right now Google has finally unveiled their Android 3.0 operating system, which is made for tablets and are saying that they're ready to start making applications just for that tablet operating system now, too.",

        "I mean, they've taken smartphones, which is kind of a necessary thing that people need, they've taken laptop computers and traditional desktop computers and then they've forced them aside a little bit to make a new market of a tablet computer that can kind of straddle both of those.",

        "Once again, political forecasts got it all wrong.",

        "Now, the man often lampooned in the foreign media will return to power with a very comfortable majority.",
        "But analysts were unprepared for the huge success of Berlusconi's ally, the Northern League.",
        "Born 20 years ago with its roots in country folklore, the League doubled its votes, making big inroads in left-leaning working class bastions of industrialized cities like Milan, Turin and Genoa.",
