        "My pleasure.",
        "Why is this legislation significant.",
        "Well, I think this proposed bill is the latest and one of the strongest indications of the political will emerging in Europe generally and in particular in the U.K.",
        "to keep pushing further with the effort to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and address climate change.",
        "And it is intended quite deliberately as a message to the United States and to other industrialized nations that it is necessary to reduce emissions much further than has been agreed to thus far.",
        "And why the Brits first?",
        "Well, I mean this is not something out of the blue.",
        "In Britain there has been, for some time now, broad public and political support for strong action to address climate change.",
        "Prime Minister Tony Blair really has been at the forefront internationally in pushing for stronger action, and his government has been promoting strong policies within the U.K.",
        "for some time now.",
        "I mean, among the industrialize nations, really, the U.K.",
        "is already well ahead of Most of the others, they have managed to reduce the emissions about 70 percent - seven percent, I'm sorry - in the past 10 years at a time that their economy was growing 24 percent.",
        "Give us some details about what the legislation would do.",
        "well, I mean the U.K.",
        "government under Prime Minister Blair has articulated this type of goal before as a matter of policy, and what they're now proposing to do is to put this into law, make it the law of the land, and that provides a legal foundation for then legislating the actions that would be necessary to reduce emissions by that 60 percent by 2050.",
        "It also would mandate reductions of 26 to 32 percent by 2020.",
        "So it - as you said, it's the first - it would be the first long-term legal framework actually mandating those reductions."

        "And what kinds of actions would we see coming from a bill like this if it were passed?",
        "Well, it would require quite a range of actions, frankly.",
        "Now as a part of the European Union, a lot of the policies that would deliver on that kind of commitment actually would come out of Brussels because there are a lot of climate-change policies set at the E.U.",

        "emissions trading scheme, which was launched in 2005, which limits carbon dioxide emission from about 10,000 power plants and factories across Europe.",
        "So that will be a big part of any U.K.",
        "strategy to achieve its goals, but the U.K.",
        "already has in place taxes, renewable energy targets, efficiency standards, a range of other policies that are delivering reductions now, and we'll have to explore basically any and all means to push that further.",
        "One of the things they are looking at is establishing their own emissions tradition system within the U.K.",
        "that goes further, reaches further into the U.K.",
        "economy than the E.U.",
        "system would.",
        "So the E.U., would it be behind the U.K.",
        "then?",
        "Well, the announcement out of London actually came right on the heels of another announcement from the European heads of state last week.",
        "They declared a unilateral commitment.",
        "In other words, the European Union is saying that it is prepared to reduce its emissions 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, even if there is no further international agreement.",
        "Under the Kyoto Protocol, their commitment is to go eight percent below 1990 by 2012, so they're now saying we're prepared to go 20 percent below on our own by 2020.",
        "They're also saying they're prepared to go further, maybe 30 percent below, if the other industrialized countries would sign on to that.",
        "I don't think we're going to see the other industrialized countries agree to a reduction of that level.",
        "But again this is a very strong indicator of the kind of the kind of political will that seems to appear at this moment in Europe.",
        "So the U.K.",
        "goal goes out further, to 2050.",
        "So I wouldn't necessarily say that - in the time span, certainly the U.K.",
        "bill goes further, but it's on the same order of reduction that is being proposed across the E.U.",
        "in the 2020 timeframe.",
        "Yeah."
