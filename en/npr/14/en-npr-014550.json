        "Do they show any inclination to jump on this bandwagon?",
        "Well, you know, this is a negotiation, and it was agreed at the state of this negotiation, back in '92, that the developed countries should take the lead.",

        "So you're not going to see the developing countries standing up and waving their hands and saying yes, we're ready to take on commitments.",
        "That said, there have been very interesting indications from China, in particular, over the last couple of years, which suggest that A, it recognizes that climate change is a real concern for China in terms of the potential impacts; B, that it recognizes that addressing climate changes creates economic opportunities for China; and C, that it's open to discussing future arrangements that would be to the advantage of China."

        "Basically, to take on a commitment under Kyoto, you agree to a limit on your emissions across your economy, and that's a type of commitment that is working for Europe and I think potentially works for the United States, but it's not going to work for the developing countries, at least for the foreseeable future.",
        "So you need to have a more flexible type of treaty that allows different countries to take on different types of commitments that fit their specific circumstances.",
        "And you know, what's interesting that's developing in this country is now you have businesses who see the handwriting on the wall, asking the government to help out to set some standards because they know that they want to compete, they're going to have to start, you know, worrying about carbon taxes themselves."

        "But even before the election there was strong growing momentum here in Washington to begin looking at mandatory climate efforts, and a lot of that is, you're right, driven by a recognition among business - especially forward-thinking business - that this is an issue that has to be dealt with, and they'd rather deal with it in a way that works for them than have constraints imposed on them.",

        "I mean, as China has pushed aggressively to expand its use of renewable energy, it's been careful to make sure that a large portion of that technology is indigenous.",
        "They're quite deliberately growing in indigenous industry on renewable, and at some point they'll be exporting that.",
