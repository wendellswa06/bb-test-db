        "But when school's out, he heads back into the field, both to keep his skills sharp and to help meet the demand for techs in the region.",
        "This is his third appointment of the day, and it's not even noon yet.",
        "He says every technician's work schedule is packed.",

        "But he says being an HVAC technician is worth it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I'll keep working every summer till I'm old and gray I'm already heading there, but (laughter) yeah, I enjoy it too much.",

        "Even Hasbro's CEO conceded that those cartoons were lame, but lame was good enough 25 years ago.",
        "Well, Brian Plunkett writes: I realize the Transformers cartoons in the '80s probably were not Golden Globe Award winners, but they did the job they were supposed to do - namely, entertain 6 to 12-year-old kids without being so graphic as to alarm their parents, and maybe sell a little a product in the process.",
        "As one of those kids who watched the cartoon daily, I say it was a job well done, and definitely not lame.",
