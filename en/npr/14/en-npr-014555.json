        "Then the steel mills shut down, and for a time, Pittsburgh was a poster child for the rust belt.",

        "It seems that every system, from the education to the health care, everything except security perhaps, seems to have broken down in Zimbabwe.",

        "Unfortunately, their march was met with, again, the security forces coming out, and intimidation and harassment has been the response.",
        "So what is needed is actually getting at the root cause of this crisis, not just dealing with the cholera, but dealing with the issues around the economic collapse and the political collapse in Zimbabwe.",
        "Well, on the political front, people are trying to get the president, Robert Mugabe, out of office.",

        "That's some tough talk.",
        "Is it realistic?",
        "Well, you know, Farai, when we had Charles Taylor in the case of Liberia unwilling to step down, many thought it was unrealistic to continue to push for his ouster.",
        "And clearly, that day did come, and I think it needs to be held out as a realistic option in the case of Zimbabwe that, you know, no one is above the law, that there is an international legal system that protects, particularly innocent civilians in time of war and crisis.",

        "Given that a major question here, as you describe it, is, how rare is life as we know it, and is there life out there in a similar planet, what would it take to detect what kind of life might conceivably exist or have existed on a planet out there?",
        "Well, the main thing that we need to do is study the chemistry of the atmosphere of a distant planet, and that's difficult to do.",
        "But we're starting to be able to have the technology to do that in certain situations where we can actually directly image the planet.",
        "And this isn't a situation where we're going to be likely to be able to do that, but as we find more and more exoplanets, we'll have more examples of other atmospheres.",
        "And what we really look for in other atmospheres is a sign that the atmosphere is out of equilibrium in some way where you would need to have life changing the chemistry of the atmosphere to get that mix of elements.",
        "We're starting to be able to do that, but at the moment, we haven't seen anything that really stands out as that's something can only happen with life.",

        "I think that's the sort of thing where, you know, it would take technology far beyond what we have, and it would take extremely long times.",
