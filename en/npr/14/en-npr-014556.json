We can make this work.",

        "And they sent her home with a note saying she couldn't attend school until she came up with one.",

        "Who did you turn to?",
        "Well, it was interesting because, you know, I often - especially later in high school - didn't have as much in common with my high school friends and found that I had a great deal more in common with other women that I had met that had teenagers or, you know, the parents of my younger brothers' and sisters' friends.",

        "I was trying to figure out how to get dinner on the table.",

        "You talked about this family lawyer who was obviously very helpful for legal matters, but...",
        "He was very helpful.",
        "And my aunts and uncles, I think, despite the fact they didn't live in town, a lot of people checked in on me.",

        "You know, when you're 19, you think you know how to handle - you think you know everything there is to know in the world.",
