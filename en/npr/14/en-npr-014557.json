        "And my - he also, another thing I remember is that because we live on the country, and they used to hunt a lot.",

        "What is lost here?",
        "And is there something that's gained?",
        "Well, I'm a little overwhelmed by the story that she just shared because there's so many critical stages of development that get lost or has to be hopped over very quickly when everybody has to really become more independent and more self-sufficient at very young ages.",
        "And you're right, the teen years are so critical for establishing their own independence and sense of identity and defining who they're going to be out in the world.",
        "And for this sister, it was defined for her, before she could even make a decision, her role became mother of these other three children.",

        "There's still a lot of innocence and naivete when they're teenagers, even though they don't like to think so.",

        "Again like Kathy, you had to jump into - she had to jump right into a mothering role and of a 15-year-old, a 12-year-old and a five-year-old.",
        "Taking on motherhood is difficult enough and a big change in one's life, but to take on three children half-grown is even much more of a challenge.",
        "So I think for her there was a lot lost.",
        "But I also hear a gain because they're very close.",
        "She has a lot of motherly feelings towards these younger children, and they needed that, and I'm sure she did the very best that she could.",
        "So I think there are some gains, but there was I think a big price to pay, as well.",
        "We have an email from Noreen, who writes: My mom was a single parent and had to work very long hours to make ends meet.",
        "I had to take on a parent role for my younger sister.",
        "I was constantly on her back to finish her homework and clean up.",
        "Basically I was trying to help my mom with the parenting, and now as we've grown up, it turns out my sister does not look at me as a friend, but rather she always complains that she has two moms."

        "I kind of bring together my personal experience of being the oldest of a blended sibling set, two biological brothers and a step-brother and step-sister that are 10 and 11 years younger than I am.",
        "And our parents worked out of town a couple of days a week.",
        "So there were always at least two days a week that I was in charge as a 15- and 16- and 17-year-old.",
        "And then I worked in family court and with juvenile offenders, and in that realm, I also saw a lot of instances where an older sibling ended up being the caretaker for the younger siblings because the parents were incarcerated or, you know, had drug and alcohol issues.",
        "And I like what your guest has brought up about the concept of there are gains but also a price to pay.",
        "And I have seen this time and time again where the young ones and - we don't even know how do they know to do this?",
        "And it becomes instinctual, almost, this I'm in charge.",
        "I have to take care of my younger siblings.",
        "And they just do it.",
        "But it's a remarkable story.",
        "She's a social...",
        "Sociologist.",
        "One thing that I have seen as a through-line in, again, my personal experience and also some of my professional experiences, are challenges that come with adult relationships once that older sibling who kind of inherits responsibility early enters adulthood and also the idea that it's very hard to ask for help because you've inherited independence and a tremendous amount of responsibility so early in age, you take all of this on, and once you get into adulthood, it's very hard to ask for help, and you end up taking - continuing to take on things in adulthood without knowing how to enlist the help of others.",
        "Ha.",
        "And I think a lot of that ties back to that, you know, that early inheritance of responsibility.",
        "That's interesting because I would have thought, on one hand, you would have been forced to ask for help to take on so much.",
        "But I guess you just felt you got - you had it.",
        "You became independent and - hmm.",
