        "And also, again, they've lost that opportunity to develop into a functioning adult.",
        "You're just kind of thrown into it.",

        "I called the operator, and I'm from New York City.",

        "He could not find work and just took to drinking and became an alcoholic.",
        "So family court had actually separated my mom and dad, and he was living somewhere else, and we were just living with our mom.",
        "We were on welfare, very poor.",
        "And this happened, by the way, on Thanksgiving, and at that time, there was nothing called food stamps.",

        "Well, I'm not a legal expert, so I am going to stay away from that issue.",
        "However, it changes things so much because it's - you have a parent, but the parent is not functioning, so he's sort of there but he's sort of not.",
