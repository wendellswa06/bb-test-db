        "Oh, yeah, I would definitely agree.",
        "It's a very interesting book.",
        "I think the fact that it was kind of like a comic book, it gave a nice novelty to it.",
        "And, I mean, it's just - you could read it and it never got dull at any point really.",
        "Never got dull.",
        "Oh, that's good.",
        "I think that's going in quotes on the back page of the next edition.",

        "Well, they do say it's, you know, there's a certain - I won't say.",
        "It's a rye voice.",
        "It can be pretty cutting at times.",
        "It's definitely in the vernacular.",
        "It's - it is not an academic book, although it could possibly have been if written differently without pictures.",
        "So I'm really grateful for my artist, Josh Neufeld, who had an enormous amount to do with making sure that there was flow and cohesion.",
        "We also asked those who had to choose these books to defend themselves, and this was the statement from Lisa Kiely, assistant dean of undergraduate studies at the University of Maryland: Everyone loves to hate the media, but Brooke Gladstone says everything you hate about the media was there from the beginning.",
        "With the rise in citizen journalists, particularly in the Arab Spring, the Tea Party and the Occupy movement, we wanted a book that gave students a good history of journalism, even going back 2,000 years.",
        "What a great time to do so with the presidential election, where many of our students will vote for the first time.",
        "Another reason for selecting the book is the opportunity to discuss a graphic text and debate the validity of this medium.",
        "How does one read a graphic text?",
        "Do our students all know how to read images?",
        "Many of our first year's writing classes are discussing this issue.",
        "And Christopher Fulgaris, is that being discussed in your classes?",
        "Yeah.",
        "We are about to begin discussing it in our honors colloquium and it's going to be a big talking point for most of the class.",
        "So you will want some zinger quotes from the author, no doubt."

        "Yeah.",
        "Well, the pictures were coming up - the thing about - the difference between a comic book and an illustrated book is in an illustrated book, the pictures support the text, but in a comic book the pictures replace the text.",
        "And as a result, I had to come up with every single image, and there's about a thousand of them.",
        "And I would write a panel in words and then I would cut it in half, and then I would figure out what could I indicate with the image, and then I would cut it in half again.",
        "So everything went through - every panel went through three written revisions before they even went through the three stages of drafting, penciling and inking.",
        "That's pretty intensive.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Are you writing all this down?",

        "So as you get on to discuss this, do you think the fact that this was written in that illustrated fashion, as sort of a comic book, a graphic novel, as it were, or a graphic fiction, or nonfiction, the - do you think that worked?",
        "I think it does work.",
        "I think the discussion is going to be maybe a little bit easier because you can kind of look at the pictures and see kind of almost what the words are trying to say.",
        "You can paint a little better image and it helps - I would say it helps the discussion overall.",
        "And if you had to pick a book for a freshman read, Christopher, what would you suggest?"
