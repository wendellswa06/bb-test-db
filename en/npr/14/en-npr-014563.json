        "Republican Senator John Thune of South Dakota held out the possibility that after today's meeting, he could come around to support the measure - perhaps.",
        "A lot of what my view on this is going to be shaped by what happens in the Senate from here on; what amendments get accepted - if we can get my amendment on the list; and if there are amendments that get adopted that improve or strengthen the bill.",
        "But I think the president was very persuasive.",
        "I mean, I think, I don't know, if he changed new minds, but I think he was very - did a very good job of making his case.",
        "Thune's amendment would require the president to certify that provisions calling for the hiring of more border patrol guards, building more fences along the border, and putting an employer verification system in place are all carried out first before the undocumented aliens would get legal status.",
        "But one stalwart opponent of the immigration measure, Alabama Republican Jeff Sessions, said he was unmoved by the president's lobbying."
