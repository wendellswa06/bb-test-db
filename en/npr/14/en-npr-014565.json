        "But critics of Prop 66, including Santa Clara University law professor Ellen Kreitzberg, say speeding up appeals with lawyers who may not have handled death penalty appeals increases the chance of executing an innocent person.",
        "The danger with 66 is it does limit and narrow the ability to present newly discovered evidence, which is how most of these innocence claims are presented in court.",
        "I've asked to be executed by stopping my appeals, but my attorneys and them refused to do so.",

        "Dying is easy.",
        "Since 1978 when California reinstated capital punishment, almost 900 death sentences have been handed down, but only 13 inmates have been executed - the last one, more than a decade ago.",
        "That's when a federal judge stopped executions until California revised its lethal injection procedure.",
        "That still hasn't happened.",
        "The decades of delays frustrate crime victims' families, including Kate Riggins.",
        "Every day, she lives with what happened to her son John and his girlfriend 36 years ago.",
        "They were kidnapped.",
        "And they were taken and left in a ditch to die with their throats slit.",
        "Today, Kate Riggins and her husband, Richard, are now both in their 80s.",
        "They want California's broken death penalty system fixed.",
        "Richard Riggins doesn't expect to witness the execution of his son's killer, but he'd like to die thinking it will eventually be carried out.",
        "I don't really think even the death penalty is adequate retribution.",
        "I mean, your loved ones are gone forever.",
        "Polls show both Propositions 62 and 66 falling short of passing.",
        "So it's possible that California's dysfunctional death penalty will be neither fixed nor abolished."
