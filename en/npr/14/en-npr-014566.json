        "The way he spoke, like, not only was he coming at me as a coach, but, like, as a fellow Korean and as an elder.",
        "Cho says as Coach Chun persisted, he shifted from English to Korean.",
        "When an elder tells you to do something, it's very difficult to reject him and tell him no. So, that was hard on me to have to tell him no twice, and then him come at me a final time.",

        "And, you know, my hands were shaking, because I was terrified.",
        "So, I screwed up.",
        "A bending machine bends a skate blade strategically so that it grips the ice just right at the 30 mile-an-hour speeds and steep turns in short track.",
        "Cho hit the bending lever hard.",
        "Olivier Jean was forced out of the final relay when his skate didn't track the way it should.",
