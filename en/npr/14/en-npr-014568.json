        "If you look at some of the characteristics I think that would define a successful process for impeachment and you compare that to what we saw with Director Mueller, he had more resources.",
        "He had more access to things like documents, emails.",
        "He had more access to the technical capabilities of the FBI, and he had more time.",
        "Remember; that was 2 1/2 years he spent coming to conclusions that didn't lead us too far down the path.",
        "The Democrats come at this from a partisan approach.",
        "He was nonpartisan with less time, fewer people, less technical capability.",

        "Yes, but we're talking about two different issues where one is an issue where we're going after people for lying during the investigative process.",
        "The other is an issue that was lost mostly during the hearings last week that we should focus on that you just discussed, which is how we think about Russia.",
        "If we spend a little less time on an impeachment process that won't succeed and maybe more time talking about how we help states defend themselves and how we talk to the American people about how they look at Facebook messages next year during the campaign, I think we'd be better off.",

        "Those black sites, rendition sites, were deemed illegal, were vilified, and it seemed to many Americans that there was sort of a collective passing of the buck when it came to these kinds of decisions.",

        "I don't think we had any good decisions.",
        "I think it's OK for Americans to judge us harshly, but it's not OK for them to judge without stepping back in time and trying to understand why we made those decisions.",
        "It's hard for people to acknowledge - all these people I spoke with, or most of them, were my friends.",

        "And we should say, we're talking about sleep deprivation, waterboarding and what has been referred to as enhanced interrogation but is torture.",
        "It was a dark period in the history of the CIA, and some could argue that it opened the door for the tactic to be used again as President Trump has suggested.",
        "But by morning, he was under fire for distorting his own record in Congress, to score hits against the president.",
        "Former Republican congressman Vin Weber, of Minnesota, has known Ryan since his early days in Washington.",
