        "They have been arming in a clandestine way but, you know, well-known, the Syrian opposition now for sometime.",

        "We have also seen YouTubes just in the last 24 hours of rebels taking out a tank with wire-guided anti-tank missile system.",
        "There's no flags on these weapon systems when they arrive.",
        "You don't know, you know, where they came from and who gave them.",

        "But there have been Libyans fighting alongside the rebels, and they have been using Libyan arms.",
        "So that article gives more meat to this story, but it is a story that has been known.",
        "Now, you talked about Russia likely taking Syria - is very likely taking Syria's side in any resolution before the Security Council.",
        "Russia is also been talking to the United States about a conference on Syria that would involve the Syrian rebels - nobody knows at this point who would represent the Syrian rebels - the Syrian government, which seems to have the upper hand at the moment.",
        "And today, the Russians saying, well, if this is going to happen, it can't happen without Iran sitting at the meeting, either.",
        "Indeed, and there was a meeting in Geneva between U.S.",
        "officials and Russian officials that ended inconclusively.",
        "You saw the top negotiator, Lakhdar Brahimi, say not going to happen in July.",
        "And it is not altogether clear when Geneva will happen or if Geneva will happen.",
        "It seems the dispute is still over who will represent the opposition and whether Iran will be at the table.",
        "It seems unlikely you can get a resolution to this conflict without one of the major players being at the table.",
        "But the Saudis do not countenance the Iranians being at that conference, so there's still more work to do at a moment when it is the last place where one could imagine that you can slow down the violence in Syria.",
        "And so it was very bad news out of Geneva that they can't even make a date for this conference because there's still so much to be determined on the agenda.",
        "And interesting, the Saudi foreign minister spoke about the role of Hezbollah, which is providing infantry troops to the Syrian forces to help them.",
        "He's talked about the role of Iran and Iran's revolutionary guards, did not mention the other major arms supplier by name: Russia."
