        "And when he's talking about we must sanction these arms flows, that's really what we are talking about here.",
        "Interesting to note that Hezbollah also worked with the Lebanese army in the past few days.",
        "There has been violence here in Beirut, in the southern city of Sidon, clashes between the Lebanese army and gunmen led by a Sunni radical imam here.",
        "Forty people were killed including 18 soldiers in the Lebanese army.",
        "And Hezbollah stepped in here to help the army put down that revolt.",
        "And there are reports - rumors still - that the cleric went across the border and went to Syria to fight with the rebels there.",
        "This man named Ahmad al-Assir, a firebrand who's come to prominence just in the last couple of years since the start of the Syrian civil war, but somebody who is regarded as being somewhat outside the mainstream in terms of Sunni thought in Lebanon, in particular, and yet, as this fighting erupts, it seems like a lot of Sunnis are saying, well, we may not like him fighting the Lebanese army necessarily, but he speaks for us.",
        "Well, that is what is so troubling about everything that's happening in this region, Neal, is all those lines have moved.",
        "This war has now crossed borders.",

        "Now, it's the Levant that is involved here.",
        "And so you find Sunnis across the region who are stepping up their language, sounding much more radical in the way that you heard the Saudi foreign minister today talking about genocide, talking about we cannot be silent.",
        "And so these are very troubling signs and, as I said before, you know, Geneva was not a great way out, but it was a way out.",
        "And the fact that both the Americans and the Russians cannot find a way to make a date for that conference only is bad news for everybody in the region.",
        "And as the United States coming under increasing pressure, A, to start the flow of light arms that they started to talk about and, B, to say, wait a minute, maybe anti-tank, anti-aircraft arms ought to be included as well?",
        "I think that pressure is coming.",
        "The American policy and the Americans are very open about this is not to help the rebels win.",
        "It is to force the Syrian government, the president, Bashar al-Assad, into a position where he will agree to go to Geneva.",

        "Yesterday, Syria's foreign minister, Walid Muallem, said that President Assad will not give up power as part of any transitional government - very tough statement out of Damascus.",
        "What's interesting about that is the Geneva framework that was agreed to by both the United States and Russia actually talks about this transitional government, part opposition, part Syrian government, both sides have a veto on who sits on that government and it will have full powers.",
        "So Muallem can say that that he won't give up any power.",
        "But that is not what the U.S.",
        "and Russia agreed to.",
        "And in fact, a State Department spokesman came out after his statements and said, very nice try Mr. Muallem, but this is what we and the Russians agreed to for the Geneva Conference that has not been scheduled.",
        "Yet, the events on the ground seem to run so far in advance of diplomacy.",
        "Things keep changing.",
        "As you suggest, this fight in Sidon with the Sunni militia fighting against the Lebanese army, very troubling there in Lebanon."
