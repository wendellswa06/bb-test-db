        "There was also, you had a wonderful quote about the long-term plan that the idea, once these lawsuits went through and the Supreme Court decision on Citizens United and other court decisions came down that said money is speech, you can't restrict the flow of, you know, in many circumstances of this money, that the goal was in fact to release all of the - get rid of all of the restrictions.",
        "Right, which had been part of the plan.",
        "You know, if you deregulate the outside money, then you have the candidates and the parties playing with hard money that's restricted, and they're at a disadvantage.",
        "So you take out their limits, too, and then everything is even.",
        "The problem with that is a constitutional one that when the Supreme Court first passed judgment on the campaign finance law, they said that the government had a constitutional right to restrict money going to candidates and party committees because of corruption and fear of an appearance of corruption.",
        "So unless they're going to knock out the corruption rationale, they're going to have a hard time taking off those limits, I think.",
        "In the meantime, as we look ahead, the effect this time around may not have been much, but are people looking, saying maybe it was not the money but the way the money was spent, perhaps television advertising isn't all it's cracked up to be?",
        "Yeah, I think that is really kind of a coming issue in big-time American politics, that it used to be if you wanted, you know, bang for the buck, TV was the place to put your money.",
        "And as the TV audience fragments, as younger voters, you know, go away from TV and are watching on their laptops and stuff, I think that, you know, the broadcast and cablecast ads are going to look less appealing.",
        "Peter, is it also possible that the viewer is so saturated with negative ads, one after - especially if you live in a swing state, battleground state, it's nonstop negative after negative.",
        "I mean, how effective can these be, can this be when it's just relentless?",
        "Yeah, I think that's a great question and one that the political consulting industry has to deal with.",
        "And they have - they may have a lot to deal with here because TV ads are where they make as much of their money.",
        "If you stop doing, you know, stop making TV advertising the top priority of the campaign, then the whole economics of the campaign industry might start to change.",
        "Shouldn't campaigns be making - putting more of their money into campaign buttons?",

        "Yes, I think that is really an up-and-coming thing, yeah, yeah.",
        "Peter thanks, I appreciate that, thanks.",
        "So next time I - we can expect that there will be just as much, maybe more, money than the last time but directed somewhat differently?",

        "Sure.",
        "But there's going to be, you know, an interest in raising outside money because you don't have contribution limits, a lot of time you don't have to say who gave you the money, which is a great advantage to the donors.",
        "And there might well be an interest in giving to the groups that are most creative in new technology, new ways of doing ground operations.",
        "In the meantime, some of those groups that came together at the last minute to dump money into congressional races will have to disclose their donors I think in December.",
        "We will look forward to your reports on who those people were and the effect of their contributions because one of the reasons they gave in so late is they didn't have to disclose who they were before November 6, on election.",

        "This year's election brought more money than ever into the race.",
        "It also brought a number of changes in the way we vote, especially in California.",
        "A bipartisan commission there reconfigured congressional districts, and the primaries sent the top two candidates to the general election regardless of party.",

        "Well, it did produce quite a little bit of an earthquake in our political landscape, and in fact in California's congressional delegation, the only Democrats who lost lost to other Democrats.",
        "In fact you could look at California's congressional delegation that will take their offices next January, and it is complete - it's a sea change from the delegation that's going out.",
        "Yes it is, at least 11 new faces.",
        "And some of those are, well, veterans who chose to retire rather than fight on in newly drawn districts, and others, as we say, people who had to run against member of their own party.",
        "That's right.",
        "And so the system, though, was designed, at least in theory, to produce more moderate candidates.",
        "If you had to run against - in a heavily Democratic district, say for example, as opposed to be outflanked to the left and that person might win in a party primary, those two top Democrats would end up running against each other, and you'd have to compete for independents and Republican votes in the general election.",
        "That's right.",
        "Reformers were hoping that they would ultimately get a more moderate state House and a more moderate congressional delegation.",

        "But Ken, is it more moderate?",
        "Well, it's hard to say.",
        "First of all, one of the big factors and the big change in California was not only did you have this new system where all the candidates were on the same June primary ballot, but there was major redistricting.",
        "So a lot of these Republicans who did retire, the Jerry Lewises - they love him in Paris, they love him - Jerry Lewis and David Dreier and all those longtime Republican incumbents were forced to retire because the lines were just so drawn."
