        "But because of the top-two primary, that did mean that two Democrats were running against each other, and the guy who I see as the more moderate Democrat ended up winning, I suspect that he managed to get some independent Republican votes that helped him get there.",
        "Jeff, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Ken?",
        "Absolutely, take care.",
        "But one thing I wanted to mention also that what it also does it that people like candidates of the Peace and Freedom Party, the Libertarian Party, all the third-party candidates who always appear on the ballot in November now no longer will.",
        "So I mean, this really basically it's down to two.",
        "So all those third-party candidates, those alternative voices, the Green Party for example, all those alternative voices you would have seen on the ballot in November you no longer will see, unless of course they finish in the top two.",
        "Which in the primary, which Jean Merl, that puts a premium on the primary.",
        "Did turnout increase in the primary as people realized it was going to be more important than ever?",
        "No, the turnout in the primary in California was actually pretty low.",
        "And a lot of people still didn't quite realize, still didn't get the importance of the primary.",
        "They weren't aware of changes.",
        "And so we had a more conservative and smaller turnout in the primary.",
        "That's not the case in the general.",
        "And I think a lot of people are hoping that that will no longer be the case in future primaries as the electorate begins to realize the power they have in the primary.",
        "Let's go next to Nancy(ph), Nancy with us from Auburn, California.",
        "Hi there.",
        "We had an instance here for the State Assembly, two Republicans going against each other.",
        "Well, I'm a lifelong Democrat, and I realize that here in Placer County, I'm only one of about 38 percent of the registered voters here.",
        "There is mostly, you know, 60-something percent Republican versus 38-percent Democrat, but - and it's always been that way.",
        "I don't know why I live here.",
        "But it's just that I have no representation in the State Assembly.",
        "I mean, I realize that in the state Senate I'm not going to - you know, my Democrat is never going to be beat out the Republican, but at least I would have a voice in saying so or at least, you know, having something.",
        "I don't like this at all.",

        "Yes, and the Democrat will never get in there, never will get up there because the Democrat is not going to come through and get into the top two.",
        "You know, like I say, there's only 38 percent.",
        "I mean, I realize we may be the only red county in California or at least the reddest county, but it's just, you know, we will probably never have a chance.",
        "And then the other point that Mr. Rudin made was about the honing ground for if we're ever going to have a viable third-party candidate come out or a viable third party period, they'd kind of get honed down in those lower races, and they're never going to come out of it, ever.",
        "Nancy, thanks very much for the phone call.",
        "And have you had a chance, Jean Merl, to crunch the numbers to see if turnout declined in those places where there were two members of one party running against each other, and members of the opposite party felt that they were disenfranchised?",
        "I have not, but my guess is probably not because we had a pretty good turnout in some of those districts, particularly the Berman-Sherman district.",
        "And I don't think the fact that two members of the same party were running against each other affected turnout.",
        "Let's see if we can go to - this is Steve, Steve with us from Mountain View, California.",
        "Yeah, thanks for taking my call.",
        "I'm Steve Chapman, president of Californians for Electoral Reform.",
        "Couple of points I want to make.",
        "One is that the independent redistricting actually had a bigger effect because that allowed the Democrats to get their super majority in both the assembly and the state Senate.",
        "So that ironically is going to eliminate gridlock by allowing one party to dominate.",
        "(technical difficulties) the top two primaries produced some very anomalous results, for example, in the 31st Congressional District down in Southern California, it's a majority Latino district, but there were so many Latino Democrats running in the primary that they split the vote.",
        "And the two Republicans - only two Republicans (technical difficulties) primaries, they ended up getting the most votes.",
        "So now, you have this majority Latino district being represented by a Caucasian Republican.",
        "Do you think, Jean Merl, whether that's an anomaly, or are people going to have to just take some time to figure out how this new system works?",
        "I think people are going to have to take some time to figure out how the new system works, and what the parties are trying to do is figure out how they can telegraph to their voters who their preferred candidates are, which may undercut the whole point but...",

        "If you have a Latino district and you want Latino representation, having 15 Hispanic candidates running against two Anglo candidates, I mean, that's what happened in Memphis.",
        "You have a white Democrat, Steve Cohen, representing Congress because all the black - all the African-American political machines backed different candidates.",
        "So ultimately, if you want Latino representation in a Hispanic district, you have to rally around Latino candidates.",
        "And, Steve, are you still there?",
        "Yes, I am.",
        "That's why our organization advocates for proportional representation.",
        "So you're not necessarily in favor of this reform?",

        "Obviously, people vote for governor statewide, but those ballot spots are selected, Jean Merl, on results in other races.",

        "There were Democrats that were just kicked off the ballot in a number of districts and because they didn't make the top two.",
        "I think the redistricting is less of an issue, but the top two is really a problem because your - as previous callers and guest have mentioned, those third-party candidates are important if - not necessarily for their candidates but the ideas that they bring into the race.",
        "You know, they may not catch fire within the first year or maybe this first election or second election they're in, but they're important part of the process.",
        "And you force them out by using two top and I think...",
        "Again, Penny, you force them out of the general election, but if everybody focuses on the primary, this is the place where great ideas are debated, the primary becomes that venue.",
        "But with the emphasis on two top, they even get washed out to a certain degree even in the primary.",
        "I mean, the focus was so on the - in our counties, in my county and surrounding counties - on the Republican candidates that there was very little attention paid, even our local papers, about local debates and local meetings about different ideas and different candidates.",
        "I also want to mention that it may not have affected turnout this year, because you're talking about a presidential election, but I think you already have a problem with turnout in off-year elections.",
        "I think the next off-year election is really going to be a bellwether as far as how this top two is going to affect that because if you get these districts that have two Democrats or two Republicans, and I really think in an off-year it's really going to show its effects by less involvement.",
        "Jean Merl, that's a fair question.",
        "Does anybody look forward to that?",
        "Well, yes.",
        "But I think, again, you know, it puts a lot of - a lot is riding on the primary, and people need to get out and vote in the primary.",
        "And I think what the reformers who pushed this change would say is that the reality is that in a strongly Democratic district, the Democrat's going to win anyway.",
        "And that if you can get in there in the primary, you can affect who those choices will be between, and you may get - if you're a Republican, your goal is to get a Democrat who's a little more to your liking than, say, someone who would be more down the party line and perhaps less moderate.",
        "Penny, thanks very much for the phone call.",
        "Thank you.",
