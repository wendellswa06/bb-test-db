        "And I think a lot of this came out of various churches and different groups, and they actually started these centers that were close to where they lived or directly out of a outreach ministry from that church.",

        "I don't think that there was an all-out - we just want to put our pregnancy centers in suburbia.",

        "You talked a little earlier about the numbers and how you believe the numbers show that abortion is a big issue for African-Americans, but how big an issue is it really in those communities when you talk about other kinds of problems, if you want to call it that, that communities might face?",
        "Where does it rank, I guess, in those communities as something to be grappled with?",
        "When I go into cities, various cities and talk to pastors and urban leaders, and I provide the information to them about how many babies have, black babies have been aborted, when I talk about some of the history of Planned Parenthood, these pastors are outraged.",

        "But one thing I will tell you, these people are in the United States, they're roughly between the ages of 16 and 21, a few of them are based in Texas, Waco, Texas.",
        "And, you know, we know that these are young people who pretty much thought it was a joke, you know.",
        "Who, from what I understand, it all started from some sort of internet beef that they had with people who were on our forum, and decided that they wanted to make this big production out of it.",
        "So, you know, it started off as some sort of joke, and now it's turned into, you know, interruptions in our business and an FBI probe.",
        "Do you think - your own personal opinion - that these are pranksters who are using the racial images as kind of a sidebar, or racists who are using technology?",
        "Well, you know, it's interesting, because at first I thought it was a prank.",
        "They're definitely beyond pranksters.",
        "You know, they definitely have access and knowledge about attacking and hacking.",
        "So I mean, they're beyond pranksters.",
        "These guys do this for - this is what they do on a regular basis, and we're the target now.",
        "We became the target as a result of this kind of beef that was going on with some of our members.",
        "But we do know that this is a racist attack, because the images we saw, the Nazi swastikas, the images of the slaves with the nooses and mutilated bodies, in addition to the information that the FBI and we have uncovered gives us access to conversations that they've had online, which they've been using the N word, where they've talked about how their neighborhoods have been overrun by, you know, niggers and spicks and things of that nature.",
        "So, you know, people automatically saying, oh, we're trying to play the race card, but this was actually a racial issue, because these people are attacking us and attacking us on the basis of who this site serves, which are predominantly - I mean, hip-hop serves all cultures so it's a misnomer that people think that it's a black website.",
        "But certainly African-Americans, Jewish people, Latinos, whites, everybody comes to this site.",
        "And I guess it's considered - they perceive it to be a African-American thing, or, you know, they're attacking us on that basis as well."

        "We didn't have a lot of people who were around as kids and so we went to summer camps and we relied a lot of times on the free or reduced summer camps.",

        "I think that the situation probably varies from city to city.",
        "But there are many opportunities for free and reduced summer camp activities through organizations like the YMCAs, YWCAs, Boys and Girls Clubs, etc. Boys and Girls Club, I'm sorry.",
        "So how do parents go about finding out about programs that aren't going to break the bank?",
        "I think parents can make inquires at the school where their child attends.",
        "That would be my first suggestion.",
        "Usually, school systems are well aware of the fact that children of course are out during the summer and they are interested in children being involved in productive and safe activities during the summer.",
        "So they often will have information for parents, particularly about municipal services that offer camps and fun and educational experiences during the summer.",
        "I think also the television and radio are opportunities for parents to find out about activates just keeping their eyes open and watching what's being advertised.",
        "Sometimes, other media forms also provide information.",
        "Billboards on buses and in areas, you know, that the public often attends.",
        "Posters, for example, that may be obvious in city hall and other kinds of public places.",
        "And I would say newspapers are another source of information about summer events available for children.",
