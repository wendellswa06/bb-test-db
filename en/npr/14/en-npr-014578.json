        "Let me turn to the issue, Carol, of two different scenarios.",
        "One is you're working during the summer as a parent.",
        "The other one is that you're home.",
        "So let's start with some of the stay-at-home parents.",
        "It might be easier to say, OK, my schedule's flexible, but they might also drive you crazy.",
        "So what kind of plans can you make to keep everybody happy?",
        "Well I think stay-at-home parents may have an opportunity or an advantage if you will in that their time is more available to their children.",
        "But I think the important thing to remember about summer is we know that children lose a lot of the academic gains that they make during the school year during the summer if they are not engaged in activates that keep their minds active.",
        "So it's not just a question of driving parents crazy.",
        "Stay-at-home parent also need to be looking for productive activities for their children during the summer.",
        "OK, if you're working, say that you have found a situation for your kid that you feel is helping but then someone calls and says, I'm sorry your child is sick we can't keep sick children here.",
        "What kind of backup plans do you need?",
        "Well, I think the backup plans one needs during the summer are the same as backup plans one needs during the year.",
        "Somebody is going to have to stay home with a sick child, particularly if the child is, you know, spreading the disease or illness that he or she has.",
        "And so there are babysitters.",
        "There are often over the summer there are families, other family members, teenagers and or young adults, teenagers particularly who would normally be in school but are available during the summer.",
        "but what about teens, because, you know, teens are at this age where you can leave them by themselves but you may not always like what they are doing.",
        "How do you deal with that?",
        "Well, teens need productive activities scheduled for them during the summer just like younger children.",
        "I think that they of course will want more autonomy and should participate in the planning of events.",
        "But I strongly recommend that parents sit down with their teens and make plans for how they will spend their time during the summer.",
        "What about jobs?",
        "Is there, you know, it's a tight economy.",
        "What if a teen was counting on getting a job and they are finding it harder than they thought?",
        "How do you deal with that disappointment and maybe steer them in other directions?",
        "Well, I think teens can be encouraged to look at volunteer activities, even if they don't pay a salary, because those require the same kinds of commitments.",
        "They require responsibility and accountability.",
        "And they are opportunities for teens to learn skills, acquire skills and or pursue areas of interest that they may well have.",
        "So they can be really a suitable substitute if you will, for employment.",

        "In 1999, Debra Gwartney's 14-year-old daughter saw a man taking photos outside her window.",
        "When the police arrived, they found evidence that someone had climbed on a bucket to peer through that window, and had done so many times.",
        "The unsettling discovery was just the first in a long series of disturbing details that Gwartney and her daughters would learn about a peeping Tom.",
        "While the act is reviled, it's sometimes dismissed as relatively harmless, a victimless crime, some say.",
        "But there are victims.",
        "And these days, they can find themselves exposed on the Internet, and their computer webcam can be hacked to serve as a digital window into their bedroom.",

        "And I was driving home, and I saw this young man walking down my street.",
        "It was late.",
        "And something about him, I noticed the shape of his head, and just the way he was walking.",
        "And by the time I got in my apartment about 15 minutes later, I saw a shadow by my window on the sidewalk, and I said: That looks like him.",
        "And why is he so close?",
        "And then I went to look out the window, and there he was, staring back at me.",
        "And so I ran into my hallway, called - because I was so scared and terrified, and then called the police.",
        "They came, but by the time the first set of cops came, he was gone.",
        "And for some reason, I guess they dispatched a second set of officers, and while they were talking to me, I could see him slinking down the block again.",
        "And so I screamed there he is.",
        "There he is.",
        "And they took - you know, chased (unintelligible) but unfortunately, he was small and wiry, and they had on all their gear, and he got away.",
        "But I remember from the experience just feeling so frustrated and angry, you know, and just completely violated, even though we'd caught him - I mean, you know, nothing major had happened, but just the fact that he did this to me, you know.",
        "And all these years later, it still haunts me.",

        "I've interviewed, I don't know how many women, and all of them - when I ask them - I said, well, how did you feel after your abortion.",
        "They would say to me, I felt relieved, I felt like it was the answer to my problem, all of my problems were solved.",
        "And then they would lower their head and, you know, they - the silence would come over the room and I would ask them, well, how did you feel after that?",
        "And almost all of them - including my experience - I felt like somebody stole something from me that I could never ever recapture.",

        "We do have a disproportionate number of abortions, meaning that we are a smaller percentage of the population, and we are responsible for them, but I think that's caused by a number of factors.",
        "First of all, we have such denial in our community and having honest conversations about sex.",
        "If we can't talk about sex, we cannot teach our young people how to protect themselves, when it is okay to say yes - but we also don't acknowledge that for a lot of young women, they aren't even the ones making the decision about when to engage in sexual activity.",
        "It really depends also on the older men who have access to them.",
        "We are not necessarily getting the best leadership we could get from the churches.",

        "This overlay of now we're coming to the black community to save black babies, simply is not persuasive or convincing for me.",
        "Because if they cared so much about black children, those same voters who vote against abortion also vote against Head Start, they vote against school-breakfast programs, they vote against family planning services.",
        "I mean, if you were consistent, you would care about the child once the child was here.",
        "So what do you think is behind this apparent push by anti-abortion advocates to focus more attention on black women?",
        "Part of it is to give themselves some cover to pretend that they care about the birth of black babies.",
        "But all you have to do is look at the headlines.",
        "They blame the black community and our children for the crime rate, the failure of the educational system, environmental degradation.",

        "I mean, ever since enslaved Africans arrived in this country, women have fought to control our fertility.",
        "Whether it was as part of the resistance against slavery; we had the midwives who came with us from Africa, teach us how to use the herbs and the pessaries, and things necessary that both prevented contraception and caused an abortion, once the pregnancy was ensued."
