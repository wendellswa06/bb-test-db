        "And we certainly know that there's lots of pornography available on the Internet, and so on.",

        "And what about the victims?",
        "Well, you've heard from a couple of victims, and I think one thing - one point that's important to make is that everybody who experiences sexual abuse responds in a slightly different way.",
