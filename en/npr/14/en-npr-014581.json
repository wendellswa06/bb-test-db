        "I understand the difficulty of going and testifying in court, and this is a deeply personal decision that every person has to make who's involved in these situations.",
        "Unfortunately, a great number of people who go through the legal system attempting to bring about justice find the experience to be extremely challenging at best, and many say that they would never go through it again.",

        "And it's the same mentality.",
