        "But yesterday - I'm sorry - two days ago, FEMA said no. The agency denied the governor's request to keep paying a hundred percent and said that now Puerto Rico will have to start pitching in.",
        "So listen to what Mike Byrne, the top FEMA official in Puerto Rico, said on a call yesterday.",
        "It's not that we're walking away.",
        "It's just that the early part, where emergency needs were required and we were able to provide a hundred percent cost share after that.",
        "We've done that.",
        "And we believe that we're at the end of that period.",
        "And we've just let the governor know about that.",
        "So he said, you know, we're not walking away.",
        "FEMA is still going to pay 90 percent of the cost of the recovery work here and that Puerto Rico will now pay 10 percent.",
        "FEMA estimates that that could come out to about $100 million that Puerto Rico will have to shell out between now and whenever the disaster is declared over.",
        "All right, so what does Puerto Rico's government have to say about all of this?",
        "Are they unhappy?",
        "They are not happy with the decision.",
        "Officials on the island issued a statement yesterday.",
        "The director of the office of recovery sent me a statement saying that the Puerto Rican government will appeal FEMA's decision.",
        "Wow.",
        "And he said something that officials here often allude to when they're talking about how the federal government treats Puerto Rico.",
        "He said that he would continue to fight for the, quote, \"\"equal treatment to which all of the island's U.S.",
        "citizens are entitled.\"\" Now, he didn't elaborate exactly on what he meant by that, but it could refer to the fact that after Hurricane Katrina, for example, FEMA paid a hundred percent of the emergency recovery costs in Louisiana until that disaster was over."

        "So will Puerto Rico be able to pay anything here?",

        "And Puerto Rico has earmarked some of that money for possible use to cover its share of these emergency expenses that FEMA is going to stop paying.",
        "And that's actually another reason that Mike Byrne, the head of FEMA here in Puerto Rico, told me that the agency had made the decision to stop covering the full cost - because the agency knows that that money is on the way and that Puerto Rico will be able to use some of that to cover these costs.",

        "She was, onstage and off, a huge and fierce advocate for civil rights.",
        "And of course, some of her songs, like \"\"Respect\"\" and \"\"Think,\"\" became anthems for empowerment for women's rights, for broader rights.",
        "And she empowered herself, too, by creating this singular soul sound that you hear on so much of her classic material.",
