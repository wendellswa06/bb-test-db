        "Joining us to talk about the complex relationship is NPR senior Washington editor Ron Elving.",
        "Ron, welcome back.",
        "Good to be with you, Alex.",
        "So the president is looking for common ground with Democrats because he doesn't have any with Republicans on this issue.",
        "This is topic number one for him.",
        "What's going on now?",
        "What's he's saying in his speech?",
        "Well, not so much common ground with the Democrats on other issues, but this is one where he is hoping to make some common cause.",
        "First of all, protect the border, protect the border, protect the border - that's why he's down at Yuma, one of the hot spots.",
        "And that's really the key to getting some Republicans on board for this.",
        "Number two he still wants a temporary worker program that starts to get into the controversial area, but that's what business people are looking for.",
        "And then, third, he wants to hold employers accountable for the workers they hire.",
        "This is always a tough rub for all those who try to deal with the immigration question - how do you really go at the employers, the people who hire them provide the jobs that are the lure to bring people across the border.",
        "And then, they want to resolve - this is how the White House put it this morning - they want to resolve the status of the millions of illegal immigrants already here.",
        "While resolving their status is, of course, a huge generalization.",
        "Do you send them back to the country of origin before they can apply for any kind of a permanent work visa?",
        "Do you simply put them in jail for a period of time and then send them back permanently to their home country?",
        "There are many putative suggestions, punitive suggestions.",
        "And then, there are also people who say, look, let's just recognize reality: these people are here, they have families, many of their children are citizens.",
        "We have to adopt and adapt them to our society.",
        "So the last point in the White House plan is let's find ways to assimilate these new comers into our society.",
        "And are there clearer things in these new White House proposals to differentiate it from the policy proposals the last time around?",
        "Not so much on policy, although, I do think they're going to lean more heavily in terms of border enforcement right from the beginning, and they're going to try to give some cover to those Republicans who particularly in the House.",
        "We're not with him, last time around, and essentially scuttled negotiations between the House and Senate so that there could not be a bill of any kind in the last Congress."

        "They are now in charge of the House and Senate.",
        "Maybe this is actually making a little easier for the president - at least from this one issue.",
        "I think it gives him his one window of opportunity but at the same time, it doesn't make it as much easier as you might think.",
        "Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker is saying, you've got to give me 70 Republican votes to do business in the House.",
        "I don't want to pass this with just Democratic votes alone.",
        "And over to the Senate, Teddy Kennedy is saying something pretty similar, and he's kind of calling the shots on the immigration issue for the Democrats.",
        "So there's a certain amount of talk about bipartisanship but the Democrats are asking the president to put the Republican votes on the table upfront.",
        "Okay, another issue that's coming back for Congress.",
        "The Senate is in Washington this week.",
        "And taking up the issue of federal funding for stem cell research.",
        "And this is an issue that the president has talked about before.",
        "He's blocked funding.",
        "Will this round be different?",
        "It could be but it looks like they still don't have the votes to override his veto and the veto was the last word, the last time around.",
        "The House has passed federal funding bill.",
        "The Senate is looking to try to follow through this week and they have the votes, of course, to pass their bill, but they're a little shorter of the two-thirds margin they're going to need.",
        "So this is going to be another one of those issues in the weeks ahead in which there's a showdown, where the president vetoes a bill and then the Democrats maybe have the votes in the Senate but surely will not have the votes in the House to provide two-thirds to give full access to human embryos for research purposes.",
