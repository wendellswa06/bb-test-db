        "A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation long-suppressed finds utterance.",
        "The soul of that nation was the new Indian state, a secular state with a Hindu majority.",
        "And carved out of both its eastern and western flanks through partition, was Pakistan, with an explicit Muslim identity.",
        "Pakistan's founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, addressed the new nation on its first day of independence, August 15, 1947.",
        "(Soundbite of vintage recording)",
        "Muslims of India have shown to the world that they are a united nation and their cause is just and righteous, which cannot be denied.",
        "Jinnah said the goal should be peace within and peace without.",
        "But the history of the last 61 years has proved otherwise, to say the very least.",
        "We're going to talk about the divisions between India and Pakistan that start with that division on the map.",
        "And for that, we're joined by two prominent scholars of South Asian history, Sugata Bose and Ayesha Jalal of Harvard and Tufts Universities respectively.",
        "Welcome to you both.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Good to be here.",
        "And let's talk about the period leading up to partition in 1947.",
        "There had been a lot of conflict and spasms of violence over this question of whether India should be united or split.",
        "What were the arguments on both sides, Professor Bose?",
        "Well, first of all, I should say that there was a long history of Hindu-Muslim political unity as well in the course of the independence movement.",
        "Hindus and Muslims fought together shoulder-to-shoulder for India's independence.",
        "But of course, at the end of the day, the political leaders could not agree on how power was to be shared once the British quit India.",
        "And so partition took place ostensibly on religious lines, but of course, there were many Muslims who stayed behind in what was India."

        "He simply went and took an aerial view and decided that this is where the line was going to be drawn.",

        "When it comes to diet advice, there are a lot of conflicting ideas out there.",

        "We'll take your questions and talk about this study with NPR food and health correspondent Allison Aubrey.",
        "Allison, this is yet another study that looks at the role of fat and carbs and how our diet choices can influence our health.",
        "Tell us about the study.",
        "Well, researchers looked at the dietary habits of tens of thousands of people in 18 countries, including many lower-income countries - so places like Bangladesh and India - and some middle-income countries, too - Turkey and Poland.",
        "What they found is that people who get most of their calories from carbohydrates had about a 25 percent higher risk of premature death compared to people who ate fewer calories.",

        "They had a lower risk of death.",
        "Now, when you put these two things together, I think the strong suggestion here is that it's these refined carbohydrates and sugars - all the packaged crackers and chips - these seem to be driving the risk, at least that's the conclusion of some of the scientists who looked at this.",
        "And what was the reaction?",
        "Well, you know, I think some nutrition experts look at this.",
        "And they say, hey, look, this is more evidence that the war on fat that we had - these messages to eat less fat - really shifted dietary habits so that people started consuming more carbs.",
        "People didn't really get the message to eat, you know, whole grains and fruits and vegetables.",
        "What they seemed to get the message on was to eat more refined carbohydrates.",

        "This is a huge problem because everybody knows that when you go on to develop diabetes, your risks of everything go up.",

        "There was this very, very important study done about 10 years ago called the Diabetes Prevention Program study.",
        "And it found that when people change their diets in really moderate ways - they eliminate sugary drinks, sugary cereals, cut the refined carbs, started exercising just a little.",
        "If they made enough of a move to cut their body weight by 5 percent, then their risk of developing diabetes was cut 60 percent.",
