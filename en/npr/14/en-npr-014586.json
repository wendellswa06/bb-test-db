        "So the undergraduate science students I think don't get it so much, and that's what really - that's what propelled me to think about this and to write about it.",

        "That's twice the weight of a normal adult human brain, and it's about the brain, I mean.",
        "So - and of course I try and give these lectures that are full of information and so forth, because that's what you want to do as a diligent teacher, you know.",
        "and I came to realize at some point, standing up there in front of the students, that I must have been giving them the idea, by the end of the semester, that we pretty much knew everything there was to know about the brain and that the whole idea of neuroscience or any science was just a collection of facts that we put in these big encyclopedic-looking books.",
        "And neither of things are anywhere close to the truth, of course.",
        "And so I began to think, well, maybe we should teach them about the stuff we don't know, the ignorance.",

        "He had the question man, right?",

        "How soon?",
        "With the partition into two countries, India and Pakistan, there were huge migrations of many millions of people that followed toward the areas where they would join their religious majority and also what follows were unspeakable acts of violence on a massive scale between Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslims.",
        "What is the best tally of how many people were killed in that period?",
        "Well, I mean, we know now that over 18 million moved both ways, and the tally of the fatalities is still not really well-established.",
        "It sort of goes from anywhere from half a million to a million, and it could really be more because recent researchers suggest that there are people who are simply missing, amongst whom women are a prominent category.",
        "One accusation that has been made through history, since 1947, is whether the British were to blame for a very hasty partition and also for inadequate - completely inadequate preparation for what would follow.",
        "Well, yes, absolutely.",
        "I mean, I think the evidence is overwhelming to suggest that the administrative operation was extremely badly planned.",
        "The reality on the ground was ignored.",
        "The British simply didn't want to get their hands dirtied in this business of keeping Indians from going at each other's throats, with the result that the British military did not actually try to prevent people from massacring each other or abducting each other or taking possession of property.",
        "So this could have been avoided.",
        "There's no question about it.",
        "But I don't think that that was a priority at the time.",
        "The British were primarily concerned about getting out and getting out quickly.",
        "When you think about the present-day tensions between India and Pakistan, India, a Hindu-majority nation, Pakistan, an Islamic republic, how much of current conflicts can be traced back to 1947 to the divisions that were set up then, and how much of it has been supplanted by what's transpired since, Professor Bose?",
        "I think the decisions of expediency taken in 1947 cast a very long shadow on the subcontinent.",
        "And we are still paying the price for the kind of partition that took place, including the partition of Punjab and Bengal.",
        "Professor Jalal, Professor Bose just said they're still paying the price.",
        "Of course, the difference now is that both India and Pakistan are nuclear countries, nuclear-armed countries.",
        "That's correct.",
        "I mean, partition may have been a question of conflict management, but it was certainly not conflict resolution.",
        "What was required was a power-sharing arrangement, which was not possible in '47.",
        "But the creation of a false international border meant that the two countries have not only fought wars but internationalized their grievances."
