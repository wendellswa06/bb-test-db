        "The Shiite coalition has got a very big division among them.",
        "And the plan was, somebody wants to unite them, and the only way they can unite them is to create such an incident.",

        "Given that this attack on the Shiite shrine took place in mostly Sunni city, where Iraqi insurgents who are associated with Sunnis have been very active, don't you think it's possible that a Sunni group might be responsible or that al-Qaeda in Iraq, which has been supported by some Sunnis, might be responsible?",
        "I don't believe that is being done by the insurgents.",
        "Is this a moment of greater tension, do you think, then at previous tense moments in the last three years?",
        "This time is the most dangerous moment and the most devastating that Iraq is passing, maybe in its history.",

        "I don't know how many Klansmen and neo-Nazis read The American Prospect, but that's not a flattering portrait that Bannon paints of them.",
        "He talks about ethno-nationalists as losers and a fringe element - a viewpoint that lots of people would agree with, but that's sort of surprising coming from Bannon, who so successfully harnessed ethno-nationalism, first at Breitbart and then later when he was running the Trump campaign.",
        "But he says he's happy to have Democrats talk about racism.",
        "He feels like identity politics is a loser for Democrats.",
        "and that, by the way, is a point that some on the left, like Columbia historian Mark Lilla, have also made.",
        "So the whole reason, I understand, that this interview even happened was because Bannon thought he'd found a friendly publication - a friendly editor who would help propagate his ideas on China, right?"
