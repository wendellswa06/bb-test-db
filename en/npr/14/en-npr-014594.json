        "He came to Los Angeles and, essentially, blew the whistle and told me and my film team, over seven month's time, the extent of what is this 40-year operation that cheated every single clean athlete on planet Earth, robbed thousands and thousands and thousands of Olympic medals under the hands of the Russian ministry to which Grigory was in charge of this program.",
        "So let me hear from everybody on this.",

        "And what they did in the Sochi Games was literally break into these untamperable collection bottles and swap out the dirty steroid urine of Russian national team athletes and substitute it with clean urine of that same athlete.",
        "So this isn't a - what we want to call a Lance Armstrong of it, meaning, hey, everybody's doing it; and if you can get away with it, then, you know, then is it really cheating because you're doing essentially what your other opponents might be doing?",
        "This is pure outright criminal fraud.",

        "And the interesting thing to me about this is that, for one, we've been here before.",
        "We made half a step in the last summer games because the Russian track and field athletes were banned.",
        "And the question then was, well, do we not think that the other Russian athletes in other sports were not also part of this state-run program?",
        "And, clearly, now we're arguing that they all are, and they're going to have to prove their innocence on their own.",
        "AJ, what do you think?",

        "Sometimes it's enforced unduly.",

        "They would be taken out of the game and suspended the first half of the next game.",

        "He was fined, which was bringing that punishment down.",
        "And so now you have these Steelers coming in and speaking out against that.",
