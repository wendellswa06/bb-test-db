        "When you talk to musicians from New Orleans, who are now scattered around, is this the kind of thing they're telling you, that they just feel lost and afraid, a stranger and afraid in a world they never made?",
        "I think the reactions of musicians are like the reactions of all kinds of different people; they vary quite a bit.",
        "Some people started out with a big burst of energy, and they were out on the road when this happened, and so they stayed on the road and did OK.",
        "And then they realized that even if their house wasn't destroyed, that home would never be quite the same because of the--what had happened to the city.",
        "Some people--their careers have gotten real launchpads out of this.",
        "Allen Toussaint has been featured all over the place, as he has so richly deserved to be.",
        "Somebody like Irma Thomas, though she's living halfway between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, has kind of reinvigorated her career.",
        "So I think people's reactions are as diverse as any set of reactions, and almost all musicians, though, want to get back somehow and use music to rebuild the city as well as their lives.",
        "Irma Thomas is on here with an old song, a Bessie Smith song, about the great flood of 1927.",
        "And you could just transpose it 80-some years, and it sounds like, you know, exactly what people are going through now.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's interesting that Bessie Smith wrote that song in '27.",
        "Apparently she was up in Ohio, and the flooding was throughout the Central Valley of the United States.",
        "And she leaps boundaries here.",
        "She jumps out of being the soul queen and does a little bit of old-time classic blues.",
        "(Soundbite of song)",
        "(Singing) When it rains five days and the skies turn dark at night, when it rains five days and the skies turn dark at night, there was trouble taking place in the lowlands that night.",
        "Nick, do you hear these songs in a different way now?",
        "Are they always going to be, for you, in the context of Katrina and the flooding in New Orleans, do you think?",
        "Well, I think some old songs from New Orleans that I had kind of dismissed over the years that maybe were a little schmaltzy or overplayed in the tourism, you know, settings, the hotel bars and things like that--but these songs take on new life, and these are new performances of old styles and songs that are already creatively new in other ways as well.",
        "There's a version of \"\"When the Saints Go Marching In\"\" here, which I think sort of encapsulates what you're talking about.",
        "This is Eddie Bo."
