        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "If moving forward, we see that the NFL is stricter with players who have had some character concerns, then maybe some of that tension is relieved a little bit because having high standards for character may be also something that will affect the likelihood that somebody's even able to be on the field.",
        "He's basically suggesting that the league could take away the competitive advantage of having a player who has been charged with something but performs well in the field by giving teams certainty that these players are going to be just suspended - not allowed to play in the NFL.",
        "And so teams would not have the incentive to bring them in.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "It's about collective actions and collective standards.",
        "So the league cares about the reputation of football.",
        "If individual teams try to set those standards, they might be penalizing themselves by losing out on performance.",
