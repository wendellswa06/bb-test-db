        "This is one week on the NFL schedule where the Miami Dolphins will not lose.",
        "That's only because they're not playing.",
        "The Dolphins have lost their first four games - not just lost but lost badly by staggering margins.",
        "Not exactly a fun time to be a Dolphins fan, but commentator Mike Pesca says this is actually part of a strategy.",
        "The Miami Dolphins are what football experts call terrible.",
        "In fact, they are historically awful.",
        "The team is winless.",
        "They've been outscored 81-0 in the second halves of games.",
        "They have scored 26 points this entire season but given up 40 points per game, meaning the average Dolphins score this year has been a loss by a tally of 41-6.",
        "The dolphins are no strangers to the tank.",
        "A player named Tank Carradine was signed then released two times by the Dolphins this year.",
        "Also for the first three years of their existence, the Dolphins had a live mascot swimming in a tank in their stadium.",
        "But those aren't the tanks that we're talking about.",
        "In the Dolphins' case, tanking means trying to lose in order to get a better draft spot, which are awarded by inverse order of finish.",
        "And the Fins were finished before the season started.",
        "Tanking is a viable strategy throughout sports.",
        "The Houston Astros won a World Series thanks to tanking.",
        "The Philadelphia 76ers are regarded by Las Vegas as the fourth most likely team to win a championship largely thanks to tanking.",
        "Baseball, this season, offered more tanking than the 3rd Armored Division in the Battle of the Bulge.",
        "A record-setting four teams lost more than 100 games, which doesn't just happen.",
        "Tanking is intentional, which is why it is seen as a shameful act to be publicly disavowed despite plenty of evidence that it's sound strategy.",
        "But in football, tanking is different.",
        "The physicality of the sport renders it dangerous.",
        "There is no whimsy in a play poorly defended.",
        "There is peril.",
        "When an outfielder misses the cutoff man, it's an error.",
        "If a lineman misses a blocking assignment, it's a health risk.",
        "Football, when played by compensated professionals, is just this side of the knife's edge between rough and wanton.",
        "Plenty of former fans have turned away because of the inherent risks and inevitable maimings.",
        "It's not as if the individual players on a tanking team aren't trying.",
        "It's just that management strategy is to field a team with little regard to player quality.",

        "He says the federal government will likely ask a nonprofit to take the program over.",
        "About a dozen other states have similar programs.",
        "But Rippenkroeger says that shift will be an undertaking.",
        "Well, everything, pretty much.",
        "He is someone who is involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in a fundamental way.",
        "Let's start with who Dani Dayan is.",
        "He was the former head of one of the main settler councils, the Yesha Council, which is a kind of umbrella organization for settlements in the occupied West Bank.",
        "Now, you know, for some countries this might not be an issue, but Brazil has made a point of its policies on the Israeli-Palestinian issue.",
        "You know, under the former president, they recognized a Palestinian state.",
        "This president, Dilma Rousseff, withdrew her ambassador temporarily from Israel during the most recent Gaza conflict in protest over civilian deaths.",
        "So you know, formally, what the government here is saying is that Israel's prime minister announced the appointment on Twitter.",
        "He didn't follow diplomatic protocol.",
        "But what we know is that it's about much more than that.",
        "It is about who Dani Dayan is.",
        "It's a substantive disagreement with the Israeli government.",
        "But Emily Harris of NPR News, who's in Jerusalem, I want to bring you into the conversation because surely Israel's government was aware of Brazil's objections.",
        "Why did they choose this particular ambassador?",
        "Yes, they're very certainly aware of Brazil's policies, and senior Israeli officials though, say that Prime Minister Netanyahu selected Dani Dayan as the best man for the job.",
        "They actually cite his Latin American roots.",
        "He was born not in Brazil but in Argentina and immigrated to Israel as a teen.",
        "Dayan is not a professional diplomat, but Israeli officials say that Netanyahu knows him personally, likes him and respects him.",
        "They also say his job would be to represent Israeli government policy, not Brazilian government policy.",
        "Certainly, supporting settlements is something that's important to the right-wing coalition government that Netanyahu has put together."

        "What makes it hard for either side to back down here?",
        "Well, for Israel, a couple of things.",
        "One, Dayan is making a case that they should not back down.",
        "The backdrop for Israel is a concern that whether other countries might at some point act on often long-held policies against Israeli settlements.",
        "Most countries, even though they may not put it as forefront as Brazil, don't recognize Israel's claim to the West Bank and they say that building homes for Jewish Israelis there, settlements, undermines a negotiated solution between the two sides.",
        "Often that policy doesn't go beyond diplomatic discussions.",
        "But already, for example, this fall, Israel saw Europe move to label at the consumer level certain products to make it clear to consumers whether they are Israeli products made in Israel as it's recognized by most international countries or whether it's made in Israeli settlements in the West Bank.",
        "Now, the EU says this was to give consumers full information.",
        "Dani Dayan, in this case, has drawn a parallel.",
        "He's saying if Brazil refuses his appointment, it's like labeling people, not just products, from Israeli settlements in the West Bank.",
        "Well, from the Brazilian point of view, Lourdes Garcia-Navarro, why would Brazilians not simply just go on with diplomacy?",
        "This is symbolic, after all.",
        "Yeah, I mean, first of all, you know, Israel is a big provider of military technology to Brazil and this has caused a big breach in the two sides of the government.",
        "On the one hand, you have the diplomatic side.",
        "On the other side, Brazil's military has been quoted in the local press as being quite upset that this diplomatic standoff could affect the military relationship.",
        "But we spoke yesterday with the man who is Dilma Rousseff's defense minister, his name is Celso Amorim, and he's come out pretty strongly saying Brazil should not allow itself to be pressured by Israel.",
        "He says Israel is trying to legitimize the settlements, and he said, quote, \"\"Dayan is the leader of a policy condemned by the United Nations, and as such, it would go against Brazil's interest and world peace to allow him to become ambassador here.\"\" And for the moment, it doesn't look like the Brazilians are going to be standing down on this issue.",
        "OK.",
        "That's NPR's Lourdes Garcia-Navarro in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and NPR's Emily Harris in Jerusalem.",
        "Thanks to you both.",
