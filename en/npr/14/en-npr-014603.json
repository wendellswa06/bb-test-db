        "Kevin Fobbs met Carson in ROTC in 1969.",

        "Sellouts and Uncle Toms and so on because of the fact that we were even putting the uniform, quote, \"\"of the man\"\" on.",

        "He says the discipline of ROTC coupled with Carson's Seventh-day Adventist faith helped solidify Carson's conservative views.",
        "And then you have those few of us who decided that there had to be another way, and that other way actually was ROTC.",
        "Some aspects of Carson's inspirational biography have been called into question lately.",
        "Carson said in his 1990s autobiography, \"\"Gifted Hands, he met a Vietnam-era Army general while still in high school.",
        "He said the general offered him a full scholarship to West Point.",
        "This fall, a report surfaced contradicting that account, prompting his campaign to clarify that Carson was actually told he could get an appointment based on his grades.",
        "Other questions followed.",
        "Carson claimed he was a violent teenager who, at one time, almost struck his mother and, in another incident, tried to stab a friend with a knife.",
        "No one NPR spoke to for this story mentioned Carson's alleged temper during his childhood, including Timothy McDaniel.",
        "They met in junior high school and remain close to this day.",
        "Before he announced his run for politics, he was considered one of America's heroes and darlings by all the people.",
        "Since then, Carson has become much more divisive.",
        "McDaniel noticed this last year while organizing the 45th anniversary reunion of their Southwestern High School class.",
        "In 2013, Carson compared Obamacare to slavery, and that didn't sit well with their former classmates.",
        "Some wanted to tell him we all grew up poor, and now that he's no longer poor, they want to remind him that we all came from the same place.",
        "Carson ended up not going to the reunion, and even though McDaniel says 99 percent of the class are Obama supporters, they're all still happy about Carson's success in life."

        "And so it was part of I guess the umbrella would be Project Gunrunner, and it was supposed to stem the number of firearms that were leaving the United States and going into Mexico, into the hands of drug cartel members, largely because it is much easier to obtain guns in the United States than it is in Mexico, which has some fairly stringent at least legal, you know, ways to get guns, it's fairly stringent gun-control laws.",
        "So what they would do, is instead of actually arresting a person who bought a gun, as a straw purchaser - bought a gun for somebody else, which is illegal in the United States - that's the way it works, and then they hand them over, and then they walk them into Mexico."
