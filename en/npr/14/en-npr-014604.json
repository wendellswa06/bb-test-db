        "They did, and ostensibly this was the purpose of Operation Fast and Furious and its predecessor Operation Wide Receiver.",

        "And Ted Robbins, clearly that's not the intent.",
        "What went wrong here?",
        "Well, what went wrong is it was as, I think, as almost everybody admits right now, it was a flawed plan.",

        "Why did they use so many guns, Ted Robbins?",
        "Well, I mean, they - most of the guns that are taken into Mexico are not - were not part of this.",

        "Michel might have a better - I think it was something like 1,600.",
        "Is that right, Michel?",
        "Yeah, it was roughly 1,800, mostly AK-47 variants, but also 50-calliber rifles, which are, you know, a bullet the size of a small beer bottle.",
        "Yeah, so the standard, you know, sort of the standard training was to follow the straw purchasers to where they handed off to the cartel members and then arrest everybody and seize the guns, and they just lost track in this operation.",

        "He has said that he did not know.",
        "Mexico has pounded on the table, saying that they are shocked and disappointed with the United States, but it did appear that at least some people, including that former attorney general, had been briefed on the ATF's idea.",

        "It turned out the two drug lords that he was supposed to be working as a snitch on were informants for the FBI.",
        "And in all this, the DEA was also involved running pole cameras, they call them, on these same two suspects.",
        "So really we had I do not know how many suspects that were working for either the ATF, the FBI, the DEA and in some cases all three being involved in this fiasco.",

        "Fast and Furious came to light only because - well, let me back up.",
        "There were a number of guns that were traced, and ATF agents were voicing opposition.",
        "But really all of this came to light because of the death of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry just over this side of the border, which was arguably - he was arguably shot by a couple of the guns allowed to walk.",
        "And that really brought this to light, and I think an agent named - an ATF agent named John Dodson and another were upset at this operation, and they had reached out to superiors in ATF, and finally they went to Congress, and they went especially to Senator Grassley of Iowa and then Representative Darrell Issa.",
        "And they started complaining about this tactic, and that's really how it came to light."
