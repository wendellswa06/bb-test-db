        "Now going back to Wide Receiver, because I've always had questions about this, see, when they started the prosecutions of people in that case, they brought in a special prosecutor from Washington, D.C., to handle the prosecutions here in Tucson.",
        "In other words, prosecutors here didn't handle it, she did from D.C.",
        "So what happened there?",
        "Defense attorneys tell me she had to have known because she'd talked to all the agents, she knew all the parts of the program, and in Wide Receiver, they clearly new, the courts documents stated, that these suspects had been going into Mexico with guns and coming back into the U.S.",

        "Well, they're not - as long as they're not sold as fully automatic, they're not illegal, and then they can be easily - I don't know how easily - but they can be converted.",
        "And it's also not - it's not illegal to buy these guns.",
        "It's illegal to buy them in somebody else's name.",
        "In terms of tracing, you know, there were gun dealers who were worried about this, who took part in it and worked along with the ATF.",
        "There are reputable gun dealers who will not sell if they have any suspicions that this is going on in the Tucson area and Phoenix area, and in Texas, as well.",
        "But some of these people were actually, you know - some of the dealers were working with the ATF.",
        "So I don't think you can put it on the dealers for selling the guns.",
        "This - AK-47 is what's called a select-fire weapon, Wren.",
        "There are switches, as manufactured, switches for single shot when you pull the trigger or a burst of three or - then fully automatic.",
        "They are - as sold in this country, only supposed to be the single-shot version, but there are kits available that you can adapt it, as Ted Robbins said, to - back to the full select-fire options.",
        "Indeed, and, well, thank you for taking my questions.",
        "I just wanted to make a point that with - undoubtedly, hundreds and hundreds of these weapons still out there, we can only conclude after 300 Mexican citizens have been killed with them, that the rate of killings will continue at one every two or three days.",
        "That's the arithmetic rate of killings under this program, and it's got to be continuing.",
        "All right, Wren, thanks very much for the phone call."

        "As such, it begs the question of whether or not any executive branch can effective manage the ATF or other branches.",
        "Ted Robbins, is the ATF out of control?",
        "You know, that's a loaded statement to say they're out of control, but I think it's - it calls into question federal bureaucracy, that once you get a ball rolling, it's a lot harder to stop.",
        "So, I mean, clearly, there was a lack - and I think even they would admit, the ATF, that is - there was a lack of internal responsiveness to critics, and there was a lack of sort of, you know, what bureaucrats call outcome-based decisions.",
