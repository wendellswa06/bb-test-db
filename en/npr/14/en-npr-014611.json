        "And we're thinking that's the same way that Pluto got its large moon, Charon, that some large body left over from the early formation of the solar system smashed into Pluto and splashed some material off and we got Charon.",
        "And because these other satellites are in the same plane or the same tabletop, orbit plane as Charon, we think that maybe they formed at the same time.",
        "That it was just additional material that also formed independent moons at the same time the big moon was formed.",
        "Might there be other undiscovered moons around Pluto?",
        "Well, it's possible that these guys, P1 and P2, are just the tip of the iceberg because one can always probe faster, deeper, and farther.",
        "And the fact that there's these two small guys I think suggests that there could be more."
