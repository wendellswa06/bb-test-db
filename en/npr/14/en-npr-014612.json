        "And that first thing that tipped you off was the sound in the otherwise quiet Icelandic night of detonating Land Rovers.",
        "The second thing is Pluto doesn't care what we call it.",
        "Pluto's an interesting place no matter what we call it.",
        "It's a body that has an atmosphere.",
        "It has these moons.",
        "We believe it has polar caps.",
        "We believe it has seasons.",
        "In fact all of the science questions that we're addressing with our spacecraft mission that we're calling New Horizons, all of the science that we're doing on Pluto and the scientific questions that we're asking are the same kinds of scientific questions that we ask about missions that go to Mars, for example.",
        "So they're planet questions and its planet science regardless of what you call Pluto.",
        "Speaking of planet science, are you fearful that the budget cuts at NASA, which are happening to the science, the space science programs because of the money that is being funneled towards going, returning to the moon and mars and the space station, are you fearful for those other science projects?",
        "Well it's a, it's always a question of balance.",
        "And in my view, the robotic program of NASA has been an outstanding success in terms of the science and the excitement per dollar that comes back.",
        "Now that's not to say that we don't need visions in other areas, but I think that one has to make sure that the overall program remains in balance.",
        "And I think what's currently proposed, my personal opinion, is that its tweaking the whole system out of balance.",
        "Because then the jewel, you know, right now the jewels of the system are the planetary probes and the Hubbell's and things like that.",
        "That's right.",
        "And its all about the vision and exploration.",
        "And its, you have to imagine that the robotic and the human space flight program go hand in hand, that the robotic program lead the way and the human program can eventually follow.",
        "And so, we've got to have this be a partnership and a thing that moves forward together, and not be in a situation where we're trying to do one at the expense of the other.",
        "This should all move together in a very smooth, uniform way.",
        "Let's see if we can get a phone call or two in here.",

        "Oh yeah, and thanks for taking my call.",
        "Yes.",
        "Hi Kenneth.",
        "What can I do for you?",
        "I wanted to talk to you about naming these two moons of Pluto.",
        "Okay.",
        "I've sent in a few emails to that IAU, but I haven't had any success in getting a return from them.",
        "Well keep sending or...I'm sure they've been received.",
        "The prerogative of the name goes to the discoverers.",
        "And while, the way it works is that the discoverers get to choose what names they would like to propose and the IAU is the body that makes the decision.",
        "So, you know, so they, it's a process, and I'm sure that getting suggestions into the system are welcome.",
        "But it's the discoverers who will make the formal suggestion to the, or the formal proposals to the IAU, and the IAU will be making its decision.",
        "And it can choose what the discoverer's proposed or it can choose whatever they deem is appropriate.",
        "Kenneth, can you share with us what names you proposed?",
        "Yes, the two names I was proposing were Tarterus(ph) and Arabus(ph).",
        "And those two are the sections of the underworld in Greek mythology.",
        "And since Pluto is already named after Hades(ph) and all that, and Charon(ph), the boatman on the river Styx, I thought that would be, well, for them.",
        "Because it's just the two, there.",
        "A natural fit."

        "Um, can the moons have moons?",
        "I mean, I know they probably don't, but what governs that?",
        "How many generations can it go?",
        "If our solar, could our solar go around a hugely big sun?",
        "I know it goes around the sun in the Milky Way, but how many, you know, there's the center of the Milky Way, then there's our sun, then its our, then it's the moon, could that moon have moons?",
        "Right.",
        "Well it's very interesting, the, maybe the most well known analogy are multiple star systems, where you can have a primary star and then a secondary star, which, where the second one is actually double.",
        "And so you can get these multiple systems.",
        "It's probably difficult in the case of Pluto and Charon because, what you need is to have the system be stable against gravitational tugs or perturbations(ph) from other things.",
        "And the fact that Charon is so large it probably disturbs, it probably would disturb anything in orbit around P1 and P2.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.",
        "And in fact, even Charon, in fact I think, even is responsible for placing P1 and P2 where they are because P1, for example, is in an orbit that goes around exactly one time for every six times that Charon goes around.",
        "P2 is in an orbit that goes around one time for exactly every four ties that Charon goes around.",
        "Charon's closer in, so it goes faster.",
        "And these are these little ratios are called resonances.",
        "So, it may even be that Charon is driving that the, was even driving the formation or at least maybe nudging these orbits so that when they finally got to these perfect resonance locations that they stayed still and stopped in enabled (unintelligible) sense.",

        "Well I, I--that is beautiful.",
        "And the fact that there is these resonances, that is just, just, just amazing.",
        "On what basis would it be?",
        "How many generations, like five generations, or could you have twenty generations?",
        "I mean, how do you do the, it's the mass of each of these objects?",
        "Yeah, it's amazing.",
        "Thank you.",

        "And it, it is indeed a complicated problem, but I think in the case of P1 and P2 they're probably there as solo bodies in this system.",
        "We're talking about Pluto this hour on TALK OF THE NATION Science Friday, from NPR News, with Richard Binzel.",
        "It reminds of that old three-body problem in math and physics.",
