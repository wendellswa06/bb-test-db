        "Hi Professor.",
        "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Pluto itself and whether it has an atmosphere or not.",
        "Well Pluto, we think, has an atmosphere of nitrogen and maybe methane, and, you know, it's interesting, Pluto was just closest to the sun in 1989 it reached its closest point called perihelion.",
        "And now it's, in another century, Pluto will be at its farthest point.",
        "And we think when Pluto warms up that the ices on its surface go into the gas phase and we get this thin atmosphere.",
        "So we have in fact detected an atmosphere on Pluto, we know it s there.",
        "And a big question we have that we're hoping to find out when New Horizons gets there in 2015 is whether the atmosphere is still present or whether or whether it is frozen entirely out onto the surface.",
        "We can always hope there is still intelligent life on this planet by the time it gets there, 90 years from now.",
        "Will New Horizons be taking measurements of the solar system as it goes, or does it shut down and wait until it gets to Pluto?",
        "Well in just about a year, in fact, just under a year from now, we will be arriving at Jupiter, and we're going to use Jupiter as a gravitational boost or a gravitational assist to get us out to Pluto in a little bit faster fashion.",
        "And we're going to take science data on Jupiter during our fly-by, and then after Jupiter we're going to go into more or less a quiet phase for the spacecraft.",
        "We'll have routine checkouts of the spacecraft, make sure it's happy and healthy, but we'll go into a quiet phase so that we've got everything functioning with the, you know, at full capacity, full capability when we get to our main target; which is of course, the Pluto system.",
        "And what, in the last minute and a half left, what is the thing you want to know most about Pluto, that has to be answered?",
        "Yep.",
        "I think we want to know what it's made of and how its there.",
        "It's an entirely different region of the solar system and the ices and all the material that Pluto is made up of, Pluto is the basic building blocks of what formed all of the planets including the earth.",
        "And even the very stuff of life.",
        "It's all preserved out thee in the outer solar system, and we just want to go out and see what it is firsthand.",
        "Well I want to thank you for taking time to be with us, and good luck to you.",
        "We'll be following that mission, I hope, on Science Friday for the next nine years.",
        "All right.",
        "Call us anytime."
