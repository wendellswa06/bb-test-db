        "It's interesting that you got into drumming by watching the \"\"Lucy Show\"\" because there's a tune that starts out like something from an old kids' show from the '50s or even music from a vaudeville routine, the song \"\"Bubbles.\"\" I understand that's inspired by a Carl Sandburg poem, actually.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Mr. Sandburg was born in Galesburg, Illinois, and I grew up in a town just adjacent to that town, Knoxville, Illinois.",
        "We studied his poetry as children, and my great-great-aunt was married to Carl Sandburg's first cousin, Charlie Krans.",
        "So we sort of had this sort of almost relation to him in a certain way.",
        "And I always really loved the poetry.",

        "But sometimes, they just speak to you.",
        "And I thought: Oh, this'll work perfectly for a tune.",
        "So that's why I chose that particular poem and that particular way of writing the tune, to have that sort of enthusiasm and joy and also just a kind of reckless abandon for life in that tune.",

        "I think it's a great message.",
        "And you never - and sometimes at gigs, we blow bubbles.",
        "And I think it gives people another chance to sort of feel part of it.",
        "That's what I really feel, like, that I want to do in performances is really involve the people.",
        "I always say that the more that you can get people to laugh, the more chances you have to really touch them to cry.",
        "And on recent tours, we've had people sob during a couple of our ballads and stuff - it was pretty touching - and at the same time having them really walk away laughing and having a great time.",
        "So I always think - sort of think about, like when great sitcoms have poignant moments.",
        "You know, you really feel for the characters because you've laughed with them so much.",
        "So I feel like I want to present not only a wider range of music in an evening but a wide range of emotions.",

        "How big do you think it could get?",
        "The sport right now is not very big, but the potential is huge.",
        "And one of the reasons there's such a big potential is that the typical esports viewer and esports player are young males.",
        "Those are people that don't watch television.",
        "They've never watched television.",
        "We talk about cord-cutters in the business.",

        "So you have companies like Turner Sports, the Big Agency, WME-IMG - they see that advertisers want to reach this group, so they're all trying to get into that group to sort of prove that advertisers should go with them in order to build up the business.",

        "And sort of where is it going?",
        "Where are they investing the money in?",

        "You have certain NBA team owners that have invested in actual teams.",
        "I mentioned Turner Sports and WME-IMG.",
        "They actually created a league called ELEAGUE with different teams, and they have a regular season and a playoff tournament.",

        "They're very heavily involved in sort of not only developing the games but also developing the business in total.",
        "Well, you're talking about scholarships, and that's interesting.",
        "We've seen now at least one major university and many more smaller colleges offering esports scholarships, which is this new development where schools are now getting in on this.",
        "And they're recruiting top gamers and - or esports athletes, as they're known.",
        "What's in it for a university?",
