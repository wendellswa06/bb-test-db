        "They hope that if everyone is counted, Salina's population will officially top 50,000, which many consider to be a magic number.",
        "Salina area Chamber of Commerce president Dennis Lauver says it's all about economic development.",
        "Employers typically take a look at certain benchmarks to the size of a community that they would consider locating a new restaurant or a new retail business or a new factory.",
        "A population of 50,000 is also the sweet spot for some types of federal funding.",
        "Andy Martin, who heads the United Way in Salina, says smaller communities have to compete against each other for a share of federal funding for projects like streets, waterlines, and parks.",
        "But once a city's population reaches 50,000, some funding becomes automatic.",
        "It would just be a given that we would receive 250 to 300 thousand dollars a year in money that's allocated to the states for helping low and moderate income neighborhoods.",
        "So Martin teamed up with local government and business leaders more than a year ago to try to make sure that this time everyone in Salina would be counted.",
        "They enlisted more than 500 volunteers to blanket the community with signs and messages about the census.",
        "Volunteer Ted Zerger(ph) spent three weekends hanging reminders on hundreds of doors in the city's poorest neighborhood.",
        "He says one woman he encountered there succinctly summed up the importance of the census.",
        "And she said, well, the goods and services go where the people are, and if they don't know we're here, you know, we've got to let them know we're here."

        "Greer sent in his census form, but only answered the first of ten questions.",
        "What he may not realize is that he's likely to find a census enumerator on his doorstep soon asking him the other nine questions.",
        "Salina city manager Jason Gage says Salina's drive to promote the census is not meant to overstate the city's population but to get an accurate count.",
