        "There can't be because he is acting within his legal authority.",
        "Even if you take the most unflattering view of his asking James Comey to go easy on his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, or his firing James Comey, the former FBI director - even if you believe that those were motivated by the Russia investigation, the lawyers say the president was within his legal authority, and therefore, it's not obstruction.",
