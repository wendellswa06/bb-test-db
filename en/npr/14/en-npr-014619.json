        "And one of his very first acts as president was, with considerable fanfare, to formally withdraw the U.S.",
        "from this trade agreement.",
        "So the talk about re-entering would be a big reversal if - and this is a very big if - the president really meant it, but I don't think he does.",
        "Right.",
        "So he has a tendency, I think we can say, of knowing how to speak to his audience, right?",

        "But before the day was out, Trump himself was pouring cold water on this.",
        "He tweeted that he would only join TPP if the deal were substantially better than the deal that was offered to President Obama.",
        "Do we even know what better is?",
        "I mean, has he articulated what changes would need to happen?",
        "No, I don't think he's gotten that specific.",
        "And meanwhile, the other 11 countries that were parties to this deal - they say, yeah.",
        "We would welcome the U.S.",
        "to come back into the agreement, but we're not waiting on the U.S.",
        "They have struck their own trade agreement, minus the United States.",
        "And significantly, Rachel, they have dropped some of the intellectual property provisions that the United States had been pushing for.",

        "And he has also lost the ability to shape what the TPP looks like.",
        "When Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005, one victim was political scientist Daniel Aldrich.",
        "He had just moved to New Orleans.",
