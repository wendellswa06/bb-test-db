        "And their growth was really amazing.",
        "I mean, it was the - as one economist put it to me, it was the most rapid expansion of a banking system in the history of the world.",
        "They went from having a few billion dollars of assets on their books in 2003 to, in 2008 when they collapsed, having a $140 billion in assets on their books.",

        "Maybe the first way to answer that is to ask, why do they even want to do it in the first place?",

        "It's an odd thing.",
        "I mean, the fishing villages around the world are poor.",

        "And this created, essentially, a boom in Iceland, created overnight billionaires in Iceland, and - real well.",
