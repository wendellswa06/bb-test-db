        "Very good question, a very pregnant question, because slaves - attention was paid to their fitness for work, not to their health.",
        "Very important distinction.",
        "And when you're watching interaction between a physician and a slave it may look very much like the interaction between a physician and a person who's not enslaved.",
        "But the truth is a physician cares for a person who is free, who is white, who has money, they're trying to bolster your health.",
        "With slaves, they wanted to increase their ability to do work, the ability to extract work from them, the ability for them to bear children - that would be profitable for the master - and so very different rules governed it.",

        "Because prison is an essentially coercive environment, you know.",

        "It's a discussion that just has not really been had.",
        "And I wondered about the impact of the syphilis study on their lives and also on the life of the community.",

        "In this particular part of the country they still engage in that quite a bit.",
        "And as an occupational therapist I thought, well, what a fine way to bring a group of women together and to have them engage in this projected medium to begin a dialogue, but also to end up with something really tangible, like a quilt, that could be hung and shown and stimulate public conversations about the study.",
