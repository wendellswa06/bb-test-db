        "When they get around and do their quilting, do they tell stories about what was happening in those days?",
        "Yes.",
        "You know, I explained to them what the purpose of the project was all about, and so I actively elicited the stories.",
        "One of the things that we learned is that there's still a lot of silence about the syphilis study.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I mean big, big secrets, you know, in the community.",
        "And I thought and believed that the quilting made it easier for people to tell and to talk about something that was pretty painful.",
        "Harriet, if you want to jump in anytime, just feel free to say something.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Do they talk about Nurse Rivers who was - I understand she was an African-American and she knew what was happening to the men, but she didn't try to stop it.",
        "Right.",
        "Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory disease -they will be very high on the list, and they will require a long-term commitment to supplying those needs.",
        "Yes, it comes up quite a bit, and there's always a mixed kind of response, a mixed review.",
        "Some of the women were angry and felt that she had betrayed the men in the race, and others had a very compassionate understanding of the complexities of the dynamics of what was happening in that particular time period and knew of her commitment to the community as a public health nurse, and actually, like I said, felt very compassionate towards her and did not believe that she should be held totally responsible.",
        "I'm glad that we're talking about Eunice Rivers, because I think black complicity is a very important part of what I've discussed in my book in part of this history.",
        "And she has been made, in my opinion, to bear a disproportionate part of the burden of the study.",
        "If we look at the Tuskegee syphilis study, which actually was a Public Health Service study with Tuskegee only marginally involved, the architects of the study were PHS physicians, very powerful men, government physicians: Taliaferro Clark, O.C.",
        "Wenger, Raymond Vonderlehr, and Surgeon General Thomas Parran.",
        "These men put together the study and propagated it.",
        "Eunice Rivers was a public health nurse in rural Alabama, a black nurse, arguably at the very bottom of the medical totem pole."

        "Yes.",
        "You know, the (unintelligible) her agency is very, very limited.",
        "And although personally I wish she had asked more questions about the study, I think it's unrealistic to expect her to have had much agency in terms of ending its course.",
        "Professor Shakir, are the quilts visible or, you know, open to the public to see anyplace?",
        "Not at this particular time.",
        "However, I am available to give talks and to bring the quilts around.",
        "Probably at some point in time in the near future they will be on display for people to see.",

        "Harriet, do you still think there's unethical things going on?",
        "There are unethical things still transpiring, but I hasten to add that they pale in comparison to what happened in the past.",
        "The horrible abuses of the past almost never happen anymore.",
        "We no longer see black people herded into segregated hospitals, where they are experimented on to devise new procedures or just to train physicians.",
        "That doesn't happen anymore.",
        "But there are problems, there are abuses, and a lot of them are racially disproportionate.",
        "In large part they fall under what I call the erosion of consent.",
        "Since 1990, there have been a variety of laws passed, part of the Code of Federal Regulations, that have been watering down the concept of informed consent, which has been sacrosanct in medical research here, and black people are suffering disproportionately from that."

        "I think, for example, of the artificial blood studies that have been conducted in Detroit until fairly recently, where as you were brought into an emergency department in Detroit - and six other centers across the country - unconscious and you need blood, you may be given blood or you might get artificial blood, which in this case is old, expired human blood.",

        "We're going to see more of these.",
        "So you're saying it's unethical to withdraw the artificial blood from these people.",

        "My question is two-fold.",
        "Firstly, I'm originally from Maryland, and there is certainly a pervasive belief in Baltimore city, especially amongst the older people, that back in the day that you were not to go seek treatment at Johns Hopkins.",
        "Because apparently people would go get treatment and come back worse off than where they were, or they would just not be seen ever again.",
        "And I was wondering if Ms. Washington had ever found any evidence of that.",
        "And secondly, I've known several black men in my family, family friends, who just seem to die, be it from cancer, a variety of other types of illnesses.",
        "But they die, like, in their early fifties.",
        "And I know someone - and my father passed away at 53, and I knew several other black men in that age range to die around that age.",

        "Thank you.",
        "Hi.",
        "Yes, I have heard very often people voice the fears about John Hopkins University.",
        "What I have found is that not pertaining to John Hopkins in particular but at hospitals in general there - again there is a grain of truth to people's fears.",
        "Because the truth is, earlier in our nation's history, black people were treated in separate clinics and separate wings of the hospital, and they were expected to undergo research as payment for having been treated in the charity wards.",
        "But yet, if you were black, you couldn't go into a regular paying ward.",
        "And so it's true that sometimes people would go into the hospital and have procedures such as amputations done simply as part of medical training, not because there was medically indicated.",
        "And that was a horrific thing.",
        "It doesn't happen now.",
        "But the memory, of course, of these things persists.",
        "And also our fears of burking(ph), which is being killed for anatomical dissection.",
        "And I did find one documented case of that.",
        "It took - but only - it happened to a white woman, not a black person, a white woman who lived in a black area.",
        "It doesn't mean it didn't happen to other people.",
        "But thankfully it's among the abuses that I think we can place firmly in the past.",
        "In terms of the death of black men, I think that was actually a quite question on your part because I think we're going to be talking more about that later on."

        "You live longer on the average if you're white.",

        "Well life expectancy is basically a way of summarizing mortality.",
        "So one way to think of it is sort of as the average life span that would be expected for an individual living under sort of the current mortality conditions.",
        "So, for example, life expectancy in the United States is currently about 78 years, meaning that on average an individual born today can expect to live to about 78.",
        "Now that's the average for the United States as a whole.",
        "The average life expectancy for whites is about 78.1 currently but for blacks is about 72.7.",
        "So there's about a five and a half year gap at present between blacks and whites."
