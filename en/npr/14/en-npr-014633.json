        "So that's what we mean by the gap.",
        "I got you.",
        "And how has the gap changed over the years and how has it shrunk?",
        "Well as you pointed out, for most - actually, since we've been recording mortality statistics, life expectancy has been higher for whites than for blacks.",
        "But for most of the 20th century the size of that gap has been declining.",
        "However, we did see during the 1980s a rapid increase in the gap.",
        "And subsequently over the past decade or so we've actually seen a rather rapid decline in the gap.",
        "We're talking about life expectancy this hour with black versus white on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News, talking with Sam Harper.",
        "So why does the gap persist, Dr. Harper?",
        "Well one of the things we looked at was trying to look at different causes of death and how they might contribute to this gap.",
        "So in terms of the existing gap that we see, we found that among men about 30 percent of that gap is due to black/white differences in cardiovascular disease.",
        "And similarly among women we see cardiovascular disease accounts for about 40 percent of the existing gap.",
        "So clearly that's a major component to the gap.",
        "Is this because of medical care being different?"

        "That's certainly an element of why we might observe this contribution to the gap.",
        "Clearly we know that for some risk factors for cardiovascular disease - in particular, things like hypertension and diabetes - we know that blacks seem to have higher levels of these risk factors than whites do.",
        "So clearly those things are potentially targets that could be addressed through the medical care system.",
        "Well, we'll hear from him in a moment.",
        "Well I think we don't have much evidence at this point that that makes much of a contribution to this difference in life span.",
        "And it seems very unlikely that it makes any really contribution to this decline in the gap that we saw over this recent decade.",
        "So you really don't understand what the decline in the gap?",
        "Well, we do n terms of understanding sort of the major causes of death that contributed to the decline.",
        "Really, we found that actually it was really down to only a few causes.",
        "About 70 percent of the decline among men was due to only three causes of death.",
        "So that was improvements in homicide, HIV/AIDS, and unintentional injuries.",
        "And those same factors also improved the gap among women, although among women we also did see improvements in heart disease mortality make an important contribution to reducing the gap over this period.",
        "So that's at least some sign of progress.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "Harriet Washington, do you think it's worth investigating the genetic differences?",
        "No, because of something called Occam's razor, the scientific principle saying that it's not necessary to invoke genetics.",
        "We know of the many very dramatic causes.",
        "And frankly if you look at the causes of death of black people, we're talking about genetics contributing to .5 percent; that's less than one death in 200.",
        "So that we know that many of the things Dr. Harper's investigated - heart disease, HIV disease, diabetes, infant mortality - we know these to be gross contributors.",
        "So it's not necessary, I think, to invoke any sort of genetic approach when we know exactly what diseases are carrying us off in greater numbers."
