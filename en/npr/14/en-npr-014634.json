        "Well, the people who are on the ground have experience in these kinds of disasters, and I guess the most recent one to compare it to would be Haiti.",
        "And the situation in Japan, as compared to what was happening in Haiti, of course the death rate is much lower, possibly due to both the event and then some of the advance warning that went along with it, the nature of Japanese society, the fact that, yes, it is a country that is a developed country.",
        "But most importantly, the Japanese are very well-prepared as a society for dealing with disasters.",
        "Disaster preparedness is very much a part of what happens in Japan.",
        "And if there was one thing you could get there urgently, what would it be?",
        "I think right now the one thing we would want to get there urgently are the basics.",
        "And we can provide some of those, and some of them will have to be provided immediately by what is available in Japan.",
        "What I can see over the next week or two is that they're going to be running out of the medications we just discussed.",
        "These will be things like oxygen, chronic care medications, even things like the materials that are needed to treat chronic kidney disease, like dialysis equipment.",
        "These are the kinds of things we'd want to get in real soon.",

        "We heard of a big radiation spike earlier today, workers withdrawn from the plant.",
        "That's right.",
        "Well, there have been a few developments.",
        "There was an attempt to use helicopters over the reactors to try to pour water to cool things down.",
        "But apparently those helicopters had to withdraw because of concerns about high radiation levels.",
        "Apparently there's some sort of new plan to bring, you know, trucks or ground equipment in to pump water.",
        "Also, the U.S.",
        "embassy in Tokyo is recommending that American citizens within 50 miles of the plant evacuate the area or take shelter indoors if safe evacuation isn't practical.",
        "And they said that's consistent with guidelines that would be in place if that kind of event was happening in the United States.",
        "We've heard various other nations advising their nationals to, well, either evacuate the area or even consider leaving Tokyo.",
        "That's right.",
        "That's right.",
        "And consider what the Japanese government has recommended.",
        "I mean, they have evacuated their citizens within 12 miles of the plant and then recommended sheltering in place within 18 miles.",
        "So it's a different a different kind of situation.",
        "Now, around the plant itself, according to Gregory Jaczko, the head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in testimony to Congress today, he said: We believe there are high levels of radiation around the plant, levels high enough to cause radiation disease.",
        "Well, levels at the plant are the real concern.",
        "Last night, after white smoke or steam was seen on Japanese television billowing from reactor number three, a government spokesperson came out and talked to the media.",
        "And he said that there had been fluctuating radiation levels but that there had been a spike that required them to at least temporarily remove workers from the scene.",
        "So the radiation levels and workers' ability to get close to reactor buildings is a concern.",
        "And actually, the Japanese government increased the legal limit that workers can be exposed to.",
        "They basically doubled that limit."

        "So in other words, if in the past you were only permitted to be exposed to X percent, X millirads, then they've doubled that.",

        "Your information about -there was a fire at reactor number four, and then later there was another fire, and it wasn't clear.",
        "Was that the first fire that hadn't been extinguished, or was it a new fire?",
        "The exact nature and cause of the fire?",
        "Some of this stuff is murky, and part of that is because the people who really know may be working the situation.",
        "Also, it may be that people just don't have the information to provide.",
        "And again, we may not know the answer to this question, but if the radiation levels are high enough to cause real fears of exposure to the workers, it's going to be very difficult for them to try to contain this situation.",
        "Well, I mean, people are obviously working as hard as they can.",
        "At a press briefing today at the International Atomic Energy Agency, officials were asked repeatedly, you know: Is this out of control?",
        "And those officials were not willing to say that.",
        "They said people were working the situation hard.",
        "The head of the agency said he was planning to go to Japan and that the situation was very serious.",
        "Yesterday we were talking about perhaps partial meltdowns at a couple of these reactors.",
        "Any more information on that?",
        "No.",
        "I mean, workers are still trying - the overall need is to get water into these reactors, reactors one, two and three.",
        "And then there are also concerns about the storage pools, pools of water that are used to store spent fuel or fuel rods at a couple of the other reactors.",
        "So I mean, all efforts are going to try to keep all of those things cool."

        "Is - given the physics of this, will these things eventually cool down on their own, or will they get hotter and hotter?",

        "And part of pumping the water is getting electricity to the site.",

        "I mean, you know, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said that he was going there, but I'm wondering what kind of international assistance could be offered.",
        "Because it's hard for people who are not on the scene to look at this, and they want to help, and it's not clear what help can be given.",
        "We had heard that the United States might be asked to bring in, well, generators to provide the electricity needed to power those pumps, to pour the water on the fuel.",
