        "And what do they use to search?",
        "We do use listening devices - Delsars, as they're called.",

        "But with the professionalism, obviously, of the organization and the great training these guys have, that has no impact on our ability to do our job.",

        "I'm sure they compare this to other situations they've been in before.",
        "What kind of comparisons are you hearing?",
        "A lot of the comparisons initially were - it was kind of a combination of what they were seeing between Katrina and also some of the devastation seen in Haiti when we were there.",
        "But each one of these deployments have their own unique challenges and things, and you never know what you're going to see until you get there.",
        "How much longer is it useful for these operations to continue?",
        "That's really unknown at this point.",
        "They just continue to give us these operations to conduct, and we'll do that as long as the Japanese government needs us to do so."
