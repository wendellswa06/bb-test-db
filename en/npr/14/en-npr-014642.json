        "And I gave her a little time.",
        "And then I asked her what Beijing does not understand about the people in her hometown.",
        "They do not understand that Hongkongers do not want to obey them because we have tried the taste of freedom, and we will never obey them or be controlled by them.",

        "You know, five years ago, residents occupied the city's financial district for months to protest a rule that gave Beijing more power in selecting Hong Kong's leader.",
        "And that was called the Umbrella Movement, and it was about maintaining transparent elections.",
        "And many of the leaders of that movement have been imprisoned in Hong Kong as a result.",
        "This latest extradition bill could give Beijing even more power, allowing it to take those democracy leaders or anyone else it doesn't like to China for punishment there.",
        "It's a terrifying bill for people in Hong Kong.",
        "And that's why you're seeing so much popular resistance to it and, as we've seen today, very violent resistance.",
