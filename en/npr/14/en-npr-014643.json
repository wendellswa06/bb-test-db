        "What are those differences?",
        "Well, part of the difference is - and I think here's the place where perhaps the Jewish and the Pentecostal connect more so than we might like to think - is the idea about disciplinary bodily practices.",
        "And I think for Pentecostals, the act of fasting, prayer, shouting, dancing, especially for African-Americans, ties back to traditional slave religion.",
        "And these are the kinds of things that are more appealing, let's say, than a quite liturgical experience being held in some other type of churches.",
        "And another thing about Pentecostalism, too, I think, is that it gives you a place in which to deal with the super naturalist and say there's real evil in the world; there are evil things that happen.",
        "And especially for African-Americans with a legacy of slavery and all, we don't - you know, we may not talk about these things very much.",
        "And it's a manner in which you can acknowledge evil, but you can also acknowledge that God can triumph over evil as well.",
        "What role did Pentecostalism play in the development of black communities, particularly in the South?",
        "Well, what's very interesting is that Pentecostalism, I'd like to say, is the glue that holds the pre-migration period and the migration period together.",
        "And by that, I mean, you have small rural Pentecostal churches that get started.",
        "After this, there's a (unintelligible) revival, some that are existent before 1906.",
        "And then what you have during a great migration period is the connection between churches like Church of God in Christ that are based out of Memphis, that have big centers in places like Detroit, and Chicago, Philadelphia and New York and others.",
        "And as you have this movement back and forth; these churches continue to meet in Southern places.",
        "The Church of God in Christ has met in convocation in Memphis for probably over 100 years.",

        "Is that correct?",
        "Yes, I affiliate with the conservative Jewish movement, and majority is not people of color, right.",
        "Do you ever feel isolated within your synagogue?",
        "I do not, actually.",
        "And I have moved around a lot in the 20-plus years that I have been Jewish, and so I've belonged to a lot of different synagogues, and I have never felt as if I were on the outside within that community.",
        "It doesn't mean that people don't, you know, inquire, you know, when you're born Jewish, how did you become Jewish, and they all want to hear that story.",
        "However, otherwise, it's - you know, it's business as usual: You're there to pray, you're there to celebrate a holiday, and I don't feel that there's any difference there."

        "What about the issue of conversion?",
        "When you talk about being a part of the conservative Jewish tradition, there are many different branches and groups, but there's reform, conservative, orthodox, and my limited understanding, admittedly, is that some people make a distinction between people who are converts and some people don't, in terms of things like lineage, where Judaism is often viewed to be something that passes from mother to child.",
        "How do you perceive people's relationship to you as a convert, aside from race?",
        "Well, in general, I think - well, one thing, I guess, even though I do also know people of color who were born Jewish, you know, whether - because parent was or - what have you.",
        "However, it still is a big presumption that I converted.",
        "So, I could say that I wear my conversion on my sleeve.",
        "You know, there are other people, Caucasians, who convert who probably don't get noticed as much.",
        "So, I would say, again, the biggest difference there is that I'm usually asked more often than not about the process, you know, why did you convert?",
        "How did you convert?",
        "This is your first couple of questions - were to me.",
        "I do hear those questions a lot.",

        "Outside of that curiosity, as they - as some people would, even if this was a Caucasian person who had converted, if they knew that, they may also ask the same questions of that person.",
        "But in terms of being treated differently within the conservative Jewish movement, because I am a convert, I again do not find that to be the case.",

        "Right.",

        "How was it that England triumphed against Colombia?",
        "What's the difference?",
        "And in terms of the law enforcement response now, how do they respond?",
        "Well, right now, around the world, if we take everybody, it's over 500 million people.",

        "D.",
        "Jakes, Creflo Dollar, all those kinds of people, plus people like Charles Blake in Los Angeles and others, the African-American Pentecostal Churches are much larger than the traditional churches that you've probably previously talked about, AME or some Baptist churches.",
        "Some yes, they're growing at an exponential rate.",
        "And I think, for - especially for African-Americans, they find themselves more comfortable in these kind of church environments than they do in what we would call the traditional black church environment."
