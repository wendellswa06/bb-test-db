        "When she started, actually, her mom passed away in 1995.",
        "That's when she started.",
        "She did the first grito in 1996 and I told her, I want you to yell as if your mom just passed away 'cause she died with a heart attack.",
        "And that's what the grito is.",
        "It's a cry, a Mexican cry, a Mexican yell.",
        "I said, use that power, use that energy and she did.",
        "And I started crying because it - the way she yelled, it was like I felt it all over again.",
        "So the grito is a cry of pain, but it also brings out, as you heard, Audie, a kind of joy and I think that represents as well as anything the kinds of stories that we found along the U.S./Mexico border.",
        "And we'll be hearing more of those stories on NPR News.",

        "But, you know, despite how dry it is and how hot it's been, a lot of the region has, as you said, been spared so far.",
        "Now here in California, that's not really the case.",
        "The fire season is off to an earlier start because the winter rains that usually tide this area over until July or August, they barely materialized.",
        "So a lot of the federal resources have been mobilized here so far.",
        "Kirk, I'm wondering, has there been any effect - because so many federal agencies were tagged by the sequestration - has that had an effect on the U.S.",
        "Forest Service?",
        "You know, it might.",
        "It's worth mentioning that as a result of the sequestration, there'll be about 500 fewer firefighters on hand this summer.",
        "It brings it down from about 10,500 that the U.S.",
        "Forest Service usually has to around 10,000.",
        "You know, that may not seem like a lot, but it actually can make a difference if you consider the largest wildfire we've had so far in the west, that being north of L.A.",
        "here, the powerhouse fire.",
        "At its height last week, you know, there were 2,000 firefighters on it.",

        "So, a loss of control is one earmark that delineates someone with a bad habit versus someone who has an addictive process they're involved with.",
        "Give me a more concrete example of when you think someone has crossed that line.",
        "Well, it's very difficult when you talk about addictions, in terms of a diagnosis, if you're limited to diagnosing a problem in terms of frequency or amount, although many people have tried to do that.",
        "So for instance, when looking at eating disorders or food addiction, most people try to define the difference between someone with a weight disorder and an eating disorder, for instance, in terms of what they weigh.",
        "And the truth of the matter is that there's a subjective perspective with all of this.",
        "And I would prefer to define an addiction in terms of someone continuing to engage in a behavior despite consequences and also despite the fact that they may want to stop but feel that they've crossed the line where they're not in control.",
        "What does this do to your brain?",
        "If you are someone who, for example, has been spending years eating high-sugar, high-fat foods, does it change how your brain works?",
        "Well, one of the ways in which we delineate, you know, compulsions and addictions from folks that, you know, occasionally overindulge is that the brain chemistry - we don't know whether this predates the onset of the addiction or comes after - sort of chicken or the egg - but we do know from recent research - mostly PET scans, tomography, et cetera - then, when you look at the brain chemistry and you map the brain of addicts, there are similarities between, for instance, cocaine addicts and food addicts.",
        "Specifically, the amount of the dopamine receptors in the brain are less amongst those with cocaine addiction, or in the throes of cocaine addiction, or those in the throes of compulsive overeating.",
        "And when you measure brain activity, when someone is ingesting cocaine or ingesting, for instance, sugar, refined carbohydrates, types of substances that radically change blood sugar levels, these are mood or mind altering.",
        "And the evidence of that is you can see highlighted areas of the brain where available dopamine and serotonin levels skyrocket.",
        "And in addition to that, insulin levels also are elevated, which results in a rapid rise in blood sugar and then a rapid drop, which some people know as functional hypoglycemia."

        "But I also understand that there is some controversy about questions of race and ethnicity and how those may be counted.",
        "What can we expect?",
        "Well, there are two potential changes that may be coming in 2020.",
        "One is a new category for people of Middle Eastern or North African descent.",
        "And this has been a longtime request from community advocates who have wanted this separate category in order to get numbers to help push for more government resources.",
        "The other possible change is how the government counts of the Latino population.",
        "And the Census Bureau right now is waiting for some decisions from the White House, which sets the standards for how the government collects race and ethnicity information.",
        "It's unclear when those decisions will come out.",
        "But the final wording of the questions for 2020 - that's due to Congress by the end of March."
