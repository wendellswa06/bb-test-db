        "And I understand that things are - could be tough there in Jacksonville, Jay, but across the country, we've seen a drop in violence, certainly any kind of social violence, and it's been precipitous in many places.",
        "Well, I think you have to look at it in a more - not just in terms of violence where there is maybe a gun involved, but things like robberies and people - a lot of crimes go unreported, where people have their cars broken into, things that people can do to get immediate fixes.",
        "And I would be surprised to see that - as people are losing their jobs and aren't making income, they aren't simply going to sit down on the side of the road and be hungry.",
        "You know, we have to - there's going to be another impact where they're going to do something to make income, whether that's legal or illegal.",

        "Certainly, there is a loss of faith in institutions of the United States, a cynicism about government, and I think a lot of that is driven by income inequality, people feeling as though they are not part of the larger society, that they're being left behind.",
