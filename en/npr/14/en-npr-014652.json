        "And the economist Alan Blinder has estimated that, in the future, as offshoring becomes less about manufacturing and more about the service sector, you are going to see other countries taking off-shoring jobs for highly skilled labor.",

        "Now what happened to the 20th century was that as the technological demand on the typical worker rose, and rose and rose, requiring more and more skills, the production of skilled workers by our K-12 education system increased.",
