        "All of them say they do, but I can tell you from my own experience that that is also varied.",
        "Eric?",
        "Well, I mean she's right.",

        "A young man named Marcelo Armstrong figured out that he could make money running tours through the favelas, which, of course, right - are in the hills overlooking the Copacabana and the beaches?",
        "And he claims he's open to community center, and he's doing good work there.",
        "The question is how much and how much gets back?",
        "And, you know, it doesn't have to be in the form of charity.",
        "It could be some sort of artist cooperative where you sell - they sell paintings to the tourists.",
        "My understanding is that, at first, in Rio de Janeiro there was a lot of begging that went on when these wealthy tourists suddenly entered the favelas.",
        "By that, over the years, that has stopped and now there's more selling going on.",
        "And it also, you know, begs the question of whether these tour operators deserve to earn a profit, as well.",
        "I mean, they are mostly for-profit businesses.",
        "There are few NGOs that are running tourists, but most of these are for-profit companies.",

        "That's not to say that there weren't difficulties there and there isn't really terrible living conditions by any standard, but almost everyone told me that it was, you know, really better, in some sense, than they expected.",
        "Now, maybe this has a lot to do with their expectations of what life is like in a slum that we think of it as sort of misery incarnate.",

        "Times article that's how I started off, by saying success spawns uproar and great success spawns great uproar.",
        "So, certainly, that is the case.",

        "The name is \"\"Traffic Signal,\"\" and the director, Madhur Bhandarkar, shows very similar situations.",
        "It's about the poverty.",
        "It's about the slums.",
        "It's about the organized crime that takes place and the manipulation of people who come into the slums, both slum dwellers and tourists.",
        "And it went on to win a best director award in India, but perhaps because it was an independent film and didn't do so well at the box office, there was hardly any uproar about it.",
        "So I think that is a very accurate comment.",
        "So, if we just stay to the arthouse, we can stay pure."
