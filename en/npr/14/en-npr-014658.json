        "And I think that Obama must've chuckled when he read that.",
        "David, by linking his speech to Teddy Roosevelt, the president could say that redressing economic inequalities, or the privileges of the rich, aren't some kind of alien class warfare.",
        "It's in the American tradition – in fact, of both parties it's in the American tradition.",
        "You think he's right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, sort of.",
        "There is early Roosevelt and there is late Roosevelt.",
        "Early Roosevelt believed in making competition fair and the square deal.",
        "Late Roosevelt, progressive Roosevelt put a lot of faith in experts and centralizing power.",
        "I like the early one.",
        "I think E.J.",
        "has a little more taste for the later.",
        "I thought there was a lot to like in the speech.",
        "I guess I have two criticisms of it.",
        "First, I think this election is going to be about national decline.",
        "It's not going to be, as this president tried to make it, an election about inequality.",
        "And so, he can focus on greedy bankers and CEOs, and a lot of us will nod our heads.",
        "Nonetheless, the core issue is economic growth and job creation.",
        "And I think he's sidestepping the core issue.",
        "The second is just a matter of substance.",
        "The only policy I can see in there was the idea of raising taxes on the rich to pay for more infrastructure spending and more basic research, which I'm for.",
        "But is he really going to run for president on that?",
        "It's an extremely modest agenda, given the broad problems he described.",
        "E.J.",
        "I agree with David that this election is about national decline.",
        "And disagree with them on everything else.",
        "Because I think of this speech was actually about more than higher taxes on the rich, it was very much about how do you expand opportunity for the middle-class; why we need regulation to make capitalism work in a fair way.",
        "And I think it was forward-looking.",
        "I think what Obama was saying is we need to take these steps, so that we don't go into decline so that we get our act back together again.",
        "By the way, E.J., are you confident that this is the tone now for the campaign?",
        "Or might President Obama, you know, reconfigure it, re-triangulate it at some point between now and in November?",
        "Well, if you look at the history of the administration, you always wonder are they going to re-triangulate it?",
        "I talked to somebody in the White House who made a good point.",
        "He said, look, defending the progressive tradition in America is not a problem because unlike a rather rigid conservatism, progressivism, liberalism is rather pragmatic and is willing to adjust to circumstances."

        "The former speaker of the House has emerged as the latest challenger to Mitt Romney.",
        "And he's reminded us that he is still capable of tossing red meat to his critics.",
        "For example, opining here on poor elementary school students and proposing a kind of work-study program for 10-year-olds.",
        "What if you paid them part-time in the afternoon to sit at the clerical office and greet people when they came in?",
        "What if you paid them to work as the assistant librarian?",
        "What - and I'd pay them as early as is reasonable and practical.",

        "What Newt's problem?",
        "Character.",
        "You know, he is the real Teddy Roosevelt candidate, or is in his best moments - wanting to use government to enhance growth and competition.",
        "His problem is he can't believe the same thing for five seconds in a row.",
        "Every moment in his life has no bearing on the next moment, and any word he says has no bearing on the moment after that.",
        "As I was listening to that clip, I was reminded when he was speaker, he would have a press person on his staff in front of him nodding his head when Newt was being good, and shaking his head when Newt was straying off on some...",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "...strange idea.",
        "And so, you need that.",
        "And it's very interesting - Peggy Noonan made a very good point in her column in the Wall Street Journal today that the people around Mitt Romney generally want him to be president.",
        "The people who worked Newt Gingrich generally are desperately afraid that he might become president, because he is inconsistent and erratic.",
        "You had a great line about the 1950s and '60s that I want you to...",
        "That's where we're facing a candidacy on the Republican side between Mitt Romney, who looks like he walked straight out of the 1950s with his gee willickers vocabulary, and Newt Gingrich who walked straight out of the 1960s wanting to turn everything into a revolution."

        "And I think there is a sense that this man can be very creative, but a lot of people just can't see him as president.",
        "But isn't it - David Brooks, isn't there a real gap here between the reasoned opinions of establishment Republicans, conservative and otherwise, and what turns on grassroots Republican activists?",
        "They seem to be very pro-Newt at this moment.",
        "Right, 'cause he can take it to the opposition as hard as possible.",
        "And it's very interesting to watch the people who were served with him in Congress on the Republican side, wondering if they should come out and endorse Romney or criticize Newt.",
        "And they have a suspicion it would make any difference, and that could be right.",
        "So, they're really hanging back but they're scared.",
        "The more the establishment in Washington attacks him, the stronger he might get, and that's the box they're in.",

        "You have to pay people more to transport it, since they're facing jail time.",
