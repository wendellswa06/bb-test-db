        "Another important experiment was the measurement of nitrogen isotopes by Viking.",
        "And by looking at the difference in the ratio of isotopes it was concluded that Mars lost 99.99 percent of its atmosphere.",
        "So, as Viking entered the atmosphere of Mars it made critical measurements.",
        "As it landed, it made measurements, meteorological measurements, measurements of the surface, and did some very sophisticated biology experiments.",
        "What kind of life did it look for and how did it look for it?",
        "I mean, actual microbes, I remember, they were talking about on the surface.",
        "Yes.",
        "It looked for life in the form of microbial life by looking at respiration products, by looking at how a microscopic form of life would ingest atmospheric gas and exhale gases.",
        "And the measurements from Viking on the biology experiments did not suggest evidence of microbial life or any life on the surface of Mars.",
        "What Viking did discover, a very important discovery, is that the surface of Mars is very highly reactive chemically.",
        "In fact Mars has a unique surface, and the surface of Mars is more chemically reactive than any surface we know about.",
        "And it's believed that the high chemical reactivity of the surface is due to the deposition of chemically active gases from the atmosphere onto the surface, gases like hydrogen peroxide and ozone.",
        "So Viking discovered the surface of Mars to be a very strange place."

        "And did it not actually just sprinkle some ingredients on the surface to see if there were microbes, there would be the output the microbes would make?",
        "Yes.",
        "Instead of sprinkling things on the surface, Viking had a shovel on an arm and brought samples of Mars' surface into a chamber.",
        "And in the chamber, the respiration and the metabolic properties of the surface sand material were measured and we added nutrients and measured the gases that were produced.",
        "And of course every time there's something going on with Mars, from satellite pictures that show a face on Mars to this, even the first Viking mission, there was always some - there is always some sort of controversy.",
        "And there was actually controversy, if I remember, about that experiment of sprinkling the nutrients on the sample.",
        "There was one person - I can't remember who it was - and it still is floating around, you know, in cyberspace, the idea that there was some life that was shown but we just didn't measure it correctly.",

        "Well...",
        "And I'm sure you're familiar with that one.",
        "Yes, the labeled-release experiment, the principal investigator was Gil Levin, and Gil to this day thinks that his experiment gave evidence of microbial life on the surface of mars.",

        "Well, I think the key aspect of Viking was a very strong, dedicated team of scientists and engineers and project managers that lived, 24 hours a day, the Viking mission.",
        "They developed technologies, Ira, that are still being used today.",
        "Every landing we've had on Mars since Viking 30 years ago - Mars Pathfinder, even the Mars-exploration rovers Spirit and Opportunity - were based on Viking technology.",
        "A supersonic parachute that opened in the Mars atmosphere, the aeroshell design, is all based on Viking, and the thermal protection system.",
        "And we had never landed - soft-landed an object on the surface of Mars, and there was no textbook.",
        "And as a result, Viking was highly tested both in laboratory facilities and in the Earth's atmosphere.",
        "So we knew so little about the atmosphere of Mars, we knew so little about this technology, that we couldn't take anything for granted, and we are going back.",
        "Scientists and engineers at Jet Propulsion Laboratory had said very recently they are still going back to the database that Viking developed 30 years ago.",
        "Let me point out that the Viking Project was developed and managed at the National Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia.",
        "The landers, which were the responsibility of Langley, were developed by a company called Martin Marietta.",

        "The Viking landers took over 7,000 images of the surface of Mars.",
