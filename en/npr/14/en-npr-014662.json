        "Yeah.",
        "Well, let me just reintroduce everybody.",
        "That was Mary Frances Berry, professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania.",
        "We've got Joe Davidson, an editor at The Washington Post; and Nat Irvin, columnist for The Winston-Salem Journal.",
        "In case you're just joining us, this is NPR's NEWS & NOTES, and I'm Farai Chideya.",
        "Let's move along to yet another topic back here at home: anti-immigrant radio.",
        "So there's a popular local radio station in New Jersey that launched a campaign that asks its audience to turn in illegal immigrants to federal authorities.",
        "The name of the promotion is \"\"La Cuca Gotcha,\"\" a reference to catching cockroaches, according to the commentators, Craig Carton and Ray Rossi of WKXW 101.5 FM.",
        "Now they say that they want to make New Jersey a safe state, \"\"illegally reporting and deporting illegal immigrants who live within the Garden State,\"\" that's a direct quote.",
        "But people are incensed by the name and by the action.",
        "What is your thought, Mary, on this?",
        "They ought to - people ought to be incensed.",
        "These guys apparently have a very bad record.",
        "They've been disrespectful and, according to some accounts, racists on many occasions on the radio station, but they stay on because they have big ratings, which is disturbing.",
        "But in any case, the cockroach reference is of course offensive - calling people cockroaches.",
        "And secondly, how do you know somebody is an undocumented worker or illegal alien just looking at them and saying, gee, I think they're a foreigner and maybe they should be illegal and I should report them.",
        "So it encourages profiling.",
        "It encourages attacks on people for no reason at all.",
        "And if they didn't have a bad press record already, and if they weren't talking about cockroaches, and if they were just telling people, any illegal activity you see, report it to the police, I mean there's nothing offensive about that.",
        "But this is obviously a racist campaign.",
        "And I understand why people are upset about illegal immigrants in some places, but I think this goes a little far.",
        "Nat, there's a situation where a lot of times in the past we've associated undocumented immigrants with certain states - Texas, California, mainly the West.",
        "Now, in New Jersey, I mean, there has been a lot of concentration of both legal and undocumented Mexicans.",
        "Is this something, you know, despite the essential friction over the name of this, is this something that we're going to be seeing more of as an issue in every part of the country?",
        "Well, of course we will.",
        "I mean when you look at the future, what we're going to have is a country within roughly one and one half generations roughly 25 percent of the entire United States population will be Latino.",
        "When you look at the issues of immigration now, it affects one out of every 10 families.",
        "So this is long-term.",
        "And these Jersey guys, you know, they may find it all funny and humorous to refer to people as being cockroaches but, you know, in time, I would hope that they would start to look in and perhaps maybe do a little reflection.",
        "You don't call children cockroaches.",
        "You don't just hide behind these labels of illegals and undocumented as if it is somehow the way that you would actually see human beings.",
        "I think this tendency that we have sometimes when we have fractious debates to become so careless with our use of language, I think it's destructive.",
        "And I just wish that sometimes people would take a look and imagine, you know, when we look in - when we think about the problems that we have with race already in this country in our history, go back and look and see how it happened and you will see that what we were doing, we were using names to stigmatize people who were going to be here for the future.",
        "These guys ought to be ashamed of the fact, and these other college Republicans who had that other game of catch the illegals ought to be ashamed too."

        "Well, I do think that sometimes we give these kinds of comments too much publicity.",
        "I mean, after all, these folks are on the radio station so they already have access to the media.",
        "They are the media.",
        "And so many times, I don't feel the need to go into discussions like this, frankly.",
        "Having said that, and since we are in the middle of talking about it, I mean, I think that my advice would be that next time we don't talk about it.",
        "Oh, Farai, if you've got a minute.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think a way to deal with it on a show like this, I would think in the media, is to give some context.",
        "I mean, the historical context is every time groups of immigrants come to the United States in our history, when the Irish came and other people came, they've been called names - blacks are the perpetual immigrants; that's a whole different story - and eventually they get political power in certain communities and then it is reduced.",
        "Latinos, as Nat said, are going to be a huge part of the population in this country no matter what anybody thinks about that happening...",
        "Absolutely.",
        "They're going to have more seats in Congress.",
        "They're going to have more political power...",
        "Absolutely.",
        "They're going to be everywhere.",
        "They are going to be like other immigrants who come and who have stayed.",
        "So calling them cockroaches and engaging in all of this nefarious dialogue about it isn't going to stop them from coming and it isn't going to stop lots of them from becoming citizens and gaining political power.",

        "You know, it also should be noted...",
        "Let me bring up one more thing just very quickly.",
        "There's this new bipartisan legislation that was introduced yesterday in the House that would grant temporary legal status to undocumented workers.",
        "Now Joe, is that a sign that this is a much more complicated issue, because it isn't just the Democratic issue or Republican issue, or a left or right issue?",
        "There are different factions that are both pro-immigration and anti-immigration.",
        "Well, I think that's true.",
        "And certainly on the issue of immigration you'll see in the Republican Party that George Bush has always had what some would consider a more progressive approach to immigration than others even in his own state and certainly others in the Southwest.",
        "And just one quick note about New Jersey.",
        "It's not - New Jersey has a lot of Hispanic people, not just Mexicans, but there are a lot of Puerto Ricans who are natural born Americans there.",
        "There are a lot of Cuban-Americans in New Jersey too, who are also natural born Americans or who came from Cuba decades ago and are now citizens.",
        "And so the kinds of things that we're looking at in New Jersey with these two guys has some serious implication, particularly when they discussed renting buses and going around and collecting people...",
        "Absolutely.",
        "...they think are illegal immigrants.",
        "But...",
        "Let me...",
        "...the immigration issue is very multi-layered within - even within the main two political parties.",
        "Nat, final and very brief word.",
        "I was just going to say that I believe the numbers are that every 31 seconds, this country - there is either an illegal person or illegal immigrant or legal immigrant is added to the United States.",
        "So you just do the math and you'll see, longterm, this is not - this is a very complex issue.",
        "But mathematically, it's going to be with us for as long - for the next 50 years."
