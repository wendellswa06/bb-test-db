        "How did you navigate that?",

        "Now, the Trump administration says, as I said earlier, that this is to put same-sex couples on the same footing as couples that comprise two different genders.",
        "How do you respond to that?",
        "Well, I say it's one of two things.",
        "One, it's either they're inept in really understanding the logistics of what happens to gay couples and the challenges they have, or two, it is straight discrimination, which is what I think it is from this administration.",
        "And the reason that it's different is - after Obergefell, that was, essentially, a landmark ruling of the Supreme Court that recognized marriage in all 50 states so that same-sex couples, who now legally could be married in the U.S., throughout our diplomatic corps no longer had special privileges.",
        "Tim Wise is a former New Orleans resident and author of \"\"White Like Me: Reflections On Race from a Privileged Son.",
