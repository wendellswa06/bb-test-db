        "So in this administration, that person is chief of staff John Kelly.",
        "In fact, in any administration, that's the chief of staff's job.",
        "By many accounts, Kelly is the guy holding the Trump White House together, though.",
        "Before this, he was a decorated four-star Marine Corps general, four decades in uniform, a man who prizes discipline and order - which are not necessarily words generally used when talking about this particular White House.",
        "And there have been reports for months that President Trump has bristled against the structure and processes John Kelly has tried to put in place there.",
        "OK.",
        "Our colleague NPR's John Burnett joins us in the studio now.",
        "He spent time with Kelly in his White House office yesterday afternoon for, John, a pretty rare on-the-record interview with this official.",
        "And you talked to him about - one thing you talked about was why he took this job.",
        "Obama appeared on an elaborate stage set, which had been ridiculed by the Republicans for looking like a mock Grecian temple.",
        "Obama reintroduced himself to voters by reminding them of his 2004 convention speech - the one that launched his national career.",
        "Four years ago I stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well off or well known but shared a belief that in America their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.",
        "He didn't wait long to launched a sustained, blistering attack on his opponents.",
        "The speech hammered the theme that the Obama campaign believes will win this race, that the country is ready for a change and John McCain is more of the same.",
        "Next week in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF BOOING)",
        "And we are here - we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE)",
        "On November 4th, on November 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough."

        "After the obligatory acknowledgment of McCain's heroic wartime service, Obama proceeded to attack him as out of touch, a creature of the past.",
        "It's not that John McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americas, Obama said, it's that he doesn't know.",
        "Obama stressed his own middle-class roots and values.",
        "He reached for a connection with the struggling families he'd met on the campaign trail by praising his white grandmother who had raised him.",

        "Let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am president.",
        "To those who say he is a tax-and-spend liberal...",
        "I will - listen now - I will cut taxes, cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families, because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class."

        "If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander-in-chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.",
        "And Obama took aim at McCain's greatest strength - saying McCain had poor judgment on Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
        "And he offered this rebuke.",
        "So I've got news for you, John McCain.",
        "We all put our country first.",
        "Putting country first is the theme of the Republican convention in St. Paul next week, and Obama's challenge to McCain on that ground was a display of the kind of toughness Democrats have been begging him to show.",
        "Obama made history last night.",
        "He is the first black presidential nominee of a major American party.",

        "They could have heard words of anger and discord.",
        "They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustrations of so many dreams deferred.",
        "But what the people heard instead, people of every creed and color from every walk of life, is that in America our destiny is inextricably linked, that together our dreams can be won.",
        "We cannot walk alone, the preacher cried, and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.",
        "We cannot turn back.",
        "Obama struck a populist tone on economics and on hot-button social issues he spoke directly to those culturally conservative white working class voters by appealing for common ground on immigration, abortion, gun control and gay marriage.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"\"ONLY IN AMERICA\"\")",
        "Even the music the campaign choose to play at the end, as the confetti rained down and the fireworks exploded, seemed aimed at those voters too - the country-western hit \"\"Only in America."

        "I asked her how the exiled community is taking this change.",
        "I think there's a kind of a wariness, but I think there's generally acceptance.",
        "There's been very few demonstrations against this, and those that have taken place have had very few numbers.",

        "And a lot of families had tremendous divisions during this.",
        "I mean, my parents and I didn't speak for six months during that time.",
        "And I think that was a big lesson in avoiding gigantic political issues so as to keep a certain amount of family unity, especially during holidays.",

        "as adults, as young adults, in recent years - in the last 10, 20 years, people who are still very tied to the island, people who work so that they can invest in their families and the island, and they do make periodic returns.",

        "I've talked to different people, and, you know, it's interesting to me because a lot of those folks grew up with, you know, the strongman, and I get this idea that they still think it needs something, that there's a sense of control - that Cuba still needs some sort of sense control.",
        "I find that so curious."
