        "Randy Smith Jr. has been working for more than a decade to build a personal device for deaf people that would allow them to enjoy movies, something that didn't require special screenings and wasn't bulky, something that would simply put captions on the screens.",
        "And now, that device is here.",
        "They're glasses that project the captions on a screen in the form of a hologram floating about 10 feet in front of the person using them, sort of like 3-D glasses for captioning.",
        "Sony and Regal Cinemas have partnered up to create the first batch, and they'll be distributed to about 6,000 theaters across the country this month.",
        "For Randy Smith Jr., the project was also personal.",
        "His son, Ryan, is deaf and a self-proclaimed cinephile.",
        "Ryan was the first tester of the devices throughout the years.",
        "RANDY SMITH JR.: It has been our goal for, you know, I'd say, 15 years, to develop a technology that would allow accessibility to the deaf and the blind for every show time, for every feature.",
        "So it took us a long time, but as technologies would be developed, we'd meet with them, and they would send me prototypes.",
        "And I'd come home, and I'd basically say, you know, Ryan, tonight, we're going to go see a film and test the new technology.",
        "And he would give me feedback as to what he liked or didn't like, and we'd send that back to the technology manufacturer, and they'd tweak it.",
        "So now that you're perfecting the technology and getting it out there, what is this going to mean for your family and the deaf community?",
        "JR.: You know, it's hard for me to put into words.",
