        "Hi, Robert.",
        "And let's start with an Israeli - I guess he's a peace activist, named Gershon Baskin, and the phone call that he received a few days after Hamas had taken Gilad Shalit captive back in 2005.",
        "Sure, Robert.",
        "It's just three days after Gilad Shalit had been abducted.",
        "And the phone rings in Gershon Baskin's office and it's this member of Hamas at the university in Gaza, an economist that he had met at a conference six months before in Cairo.",

        "What they don't do is they don't take into consideration alternative amendment.",
        "They don't take into consideration a Republican amendment or an amendment that may have changed a few words around that frankly may be a little more advantageous for whatever community, and put that into a report card as well.",
        "So it's a very, very biased, very, very narrow-minded report card, with all due respect.",

        "But given that you see a majority Black city with a Black mayor, Quami Kilpatrick, in the national, maybe international spotlight, what does this say about Detroit and about a black mayor who was involved in a very controversial race just last year, in addition to which there are complaints that some people have been displaced, as we see all the money flow into Detroit and the attention to this super event, the Super Bowl.",
        "Robert Traynham?",
        "There's no question about it, that would allegedly happen in terms of some homeless folks being displaced is very, very unfortunate news.",

        "They tend to take all of their bad apples or their bad scars, if you will, and try to put a big Band-Aid on them so that no one will see them.",
        "And so, let's just hope and pray that when the Super Bowl actually leaves Detroit on Monday, is that the homeless folks and all the other folks that were displaced and disenfranchised because of the Super Bowl, will actually see some economic benefit from the tens of thousands of people that actually traveled to Detroit and spent their hard-earned dollars on beer and wine and hotels and so forth."

        "I don't know if either of you saw the most recent episode of his show on Comedy Central, but it includes in the, you know, just the week before Coretta Scott King's death, an imaginary cartoon of Dr. King lecturing Black America and going off on a rant and finally, in frustration, leaving.",
