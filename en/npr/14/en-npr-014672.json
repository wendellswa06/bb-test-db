        "He was tasked with overhauling the troubled VA health network.",
        "He had bipartisan support, and as we just heard, it seemed like President Trump really liked him.",
        "And then his last six weeks got rocky.",
        "What actually led to his departure?",
        "There were two things.",
        "An ethics investigation by the inspector general at VA came out saying that Shulkin had taken an official trip to Europe last year but that he improperly brought his wife along, spent several days on tourism.",
        "He had to end - he ended up paying back several thousand dollars of improperly spent VA funds.",
        "So that was not very popular among rank-and-file veterans.",
        "Congress ended up supporting him on - after that ethics investigation.",
        "But what was even more interesting were emails exchanged between other political appointees within the Trump administration who were actively planning to use this investigation to push out Shulkin and his top deputies because they didn't think he was moving fast enough to increase the use of private care at the VA.",
        "OK, so there are a couple backstories here.",
        "What do you know about his replacement nominee, Dr. Ronny Jackson?",
        "He's got a great reputation as a physician.",

        "Other than that, no one really knows his qualifications to run such a huge organization.",
        "VA has more than 300,000 staff.",
        "And a lot of actual veterans really liked Dr. Shulkin, right?",
        "How are veterans' organizations reacting to all this?",
        "The big organizations had been pulling for Shulkin.",

        "Jackson is.",
        "But other than that, they're sort of saying, we're going to wait and see; we want to get to know him.",
        "Do you think that Dr. Jackson is going to have an easy time getting confirmed?",
        "Well, there's already some noise, particularly among Democrats as they heard the news last night - they think Shulkin was pushed out by an agenda that wants to privatize the VA.",
        "And for all its warts, vets like the care they get at the VA once they get in the door.",
        "And the VA does pretty well with its outcomes, even compared to the private sector.",
        "So we may see in this confirmation hearing an effort to extract some pledges from Jackson that he'll resist the agenda - the same agenda that may have just gotten his predecessor fired.",
        "That is really interesting.",

        "How are these two simultaneous disasters - the fire and the diplomatic crisis - affecting his popularity?",
        "Well, surprisingly, both fit the Kremlin narrative quite well, that Putin is the only leader for Russia.",
        "From the Kremlin's point of view, these mass expulsions of diplomats just prove that the rest of the world is ganging up on Russia, and this horrible fire shows people that Putin is a good czar who just has a lot of bad ministers, advisers and governors around him.",
        "He visited the site on Tuesday.",
        "He was trying to put himself on the side of the people, and there, he said criminal negligence was to blame.",
        "Just yesterday, one of his top advisers said rabble-rousers from the opposition are trying to exploit this tragedy for their own political purposes.",
        "Of course, the real problem here isn't that Russians don't know how to put out fires.",
        "Of course, they do."

        "Yesterday, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement and said, Britain has shown that it can't predict - protect the lives of Russian citizens on British soil and that Britain actually needs to prove that it didn't poison this double agent - former double agent, Sergei Skripal.",
        "The attitudes towards the U.S.",
