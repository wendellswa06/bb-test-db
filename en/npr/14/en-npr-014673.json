        "It's not clear at the moment who is winning this battle, says Karim Sadjadpour, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
        "Because the State Department hasn't been able to show that these talks have borne any fruit, more hard-line elements within the Bush administration, like the vice president, can say, well, why are we even talking with Iran?",

        "They flair out their ears, shake their head back and forth, a lot of strong exhalation of air - (makes blowing sound) - you know, and sometimes like high-pitched trumpeting, which makes most of the farmers laugh a lot because they know exactly what the elephant's feeling.",
        "The Trust, based in South Africa, has been promoting the use of red-hot peppers as a low-tech way to drive hungry elephants away from farm fields.",
        "Osborn says it works in part because while we humans have mere noses on our faces, elephants have giant trunks that are incredibly sensitive to capsaicin, the chemical that makes peppers hot.",
        "Their whole trunk is coated with a mucus membrane, and elephants have 100 or 200 times better sense of smell than humans.",
        "So when they breathe in even very, very small amounts of atomized capsaicin that you get when you burn a chili, for example, their whole trunk is stimulated.",
        "Osborn started stimulating elephant trunks in the late 1990s after hearing stories about farmers using peppers in the old days.",
        "Since then he's taught hundreds of farmers to plant hot chili pepper buffer zones around their fields and to create what he calls dung bombs out of ground-up peppers and dry elephant poop.",
        "When these bombs are burned, they send out spicy smoke that helps drive big groups of elephants away for hours at a time.",

        "Pilot pepper programs are now up and running in Cambodia and Thailand, too.",
        "And if the thought of putting all those elephants through all that pain seems a bit cruel to you, Osborn advises you to think a bit about the alternatives.",
        "For poor framers, they consist of waiting in farm fields in the middle of the night with a lot of pots and pans on which they are forced to bang when they see elephants approaching.",
        "Some of these farmers end up getting stomped to death, says Osborn.",
        "Most of the rest accomplish nothing in the end.",
        "And these animals would charge them and chase them around the fields and scare the farmers quite a bit.",
        "And usually what they do is abandon all of their fields to the animals, and the animals would end up just consuming virtually everything.",
        "Farmers who lose everything to animals like these will look the other way when poachers come around.",
        "In that sense the plan B faced by many of the elephants might just be a bullet through the forehead.",
