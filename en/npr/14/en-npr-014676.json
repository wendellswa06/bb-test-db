        "We had known that there was a lot of vegetation coming out from underneath the Tear Drop Glacier up in Sverdrup Pass on north - in central Ellesmere Island.",
        "And we were up there for a various number of different projects.",
        "And we thought that we would take a closer look at the margin of the glacier to see this vegetation.",
        "And what amazed us was that we did see large populations of bryophytes coming out from underneath the glacier that looked like they had a greenish tinge.",
        "And we thought, well, that was pretty weird that they still retained some greenish color.",
        "So we thought that we would gather up some of that material and bring it back down south to check out the age of it.",
        "And that we did, and we looked at it a little more closely by, you know, teasing it apart underneath a microscope in the lab and noticed that it looked like yes, indeed, some of the tips looked green, some of the - or some of the material looked like they were developing or had developed branches.",
        "So we decided to go back another year, back in 2009, to do a more systematic study of collecting a large number of samples.",
        "And so that's what we did.",
        "Well, was this surprising to you?",
        "This is surprising to us to be able to regenerate material that has been covered by a glacier for 400 years, for sure.",
        "But I think it also is something that really distinguishes bryophytes from other land plants, in the sense that they have a very unique biology, in the sense that most of the cells of, you know, bryophytes are what we call totipotent.",
        "And that means that all of the cells of a particular plant can actually be reprogrammed to initiate the development of a whole new individual.",
        "And it's not that every single species can do that, but there are a large number that can."

        "That's amazing, a little-known thing that you've educated us to, and I'm very happy that you did that.",
        "But I'm also fascinated by the fact that this glacier is like retreating three to four meters a year and uncovering all this stuff as it retreats.",

        "How did they survive in the dark for, you know, all these years?",
        "Well, I mean, if you think about what extreme environment that these bryophytes have to go through on an annual basis of, you know, six months of darkness or whatever, they're programmed to be able to do that.",
        "So did they - were they still growing in the ice?",
        "No, they...",
        "They stopped growing?",
        "They would stop growing in the ice.",
        "It would only be - and it's not like you're going to uncover a whole population of, you know, say a nice tuft of moss, and that whole tuft is going to turn green and grow.",
        "That's not, you know, what we did.",
        "It would be that there would be a number of cells in that tuft that actually have been preserved well enough to be able to, you know, regenerate."

        "It's largely an optimistic view: Small, local terrorist groups are less likely to assemble a nuclear weapon or carry out large, complex plots like the 9/11 attacks.",
