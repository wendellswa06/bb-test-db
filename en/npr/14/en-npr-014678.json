        "This incident may not seem much.",
        "But there have been other challenges by the Lal mosque against Pakistan's central government in the last few weeks.",

        "Ghazi says this was meant as an attempt to enforce the law, which bans prostitution.",

        "For all its reputation as a hotbed of fundamentalism, Pakistan actually has large numbers of moderate, pluralist Muslims.",
        "They're now watching the Lal mosque's confrontation with the Musharraf government with concern, but also with skepticism.",
        "At today's demonstrations, many said they suspect the Lal mosque controversy has been orchestrated by Pakistan's intelligence services to distract public attention away from the row over the chief justice.",

        "When the fighting ended nearly three years later, between half a million and two million people were dead, most from starvation and disease.",
        "Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie says Biafra has special meaning for each of the three main characters in Half of a Yellow Sun, Richard, Olanna and Ugwu.",
        "For Richard it means finally having a sense of belonging, because he's an Englishman who in many ways has been looking for a home and finally finds that in Biafra, and he finds love as well, because he falls in love with this woman who is Biafran, and then he falls in love with the idea and the cause behind Biafra."

        "And I wanted to tell the story from the point of view of a boy who really isn't an insider, and I wanted him to grow.",
        "And so when he comes to master's house, he's very young and very raw, but also very bright and very discerning.",

        "Writing it really was difficult.",
        "When I was writing the war parts, it was quite difficult, and I went to difficult places emotionally.",
        "I would often stop to cry, but I was also very set on portraying war as I think war really is.",
        "What do you mean by that?",
        "I didn't want to gloss over things.",
        "So when I was writing the scenes of the massacres, I didn't want to use vague language, for example.",

        "I mean there were moments in reading this book where I would have to just stop reading for a moment because during your scenes in this war, there are some very disturbing images.",

        "I mean you couldn't - I felt I couldn't write about Biafra truthfully without writing about, for example, the woman who fled the north with her child's head."
