        "Well, we of course have been doing a lot of work for years now on screening quickly, and you know, the concern has always been not necessarily that we don't have the ability to detect the chemical, but that the chemical is so common that it would result in our detecting almost everything and have a lot of false positives.",
        "I think what was particularly challenging here was the design was not simply putting chemicals that are liquid, but that it was to put them in in way that really disguised them as ordinary, common items you might bring on an airplane, so that it would really take a very patient, careful examination of the item to see that it had been altered.",
        "And that, of course, you know, raises the bar and makes it much more challenging than if you run across a bottle with wires sticking out of it and a detonator strapped to it.",
        "So you know, this is part of our constant, continual upgrading of our processes.",
        "It's a whole system of systems that we've got in place, and we want to make sure that, you know, we've fully incorporated the lessons of this plot as we more forward.",
        "There have been a lot of arrests over the past few months, in the U.S.",

        "Some look at this and say that it reflects better intelligence.",
        "Others say that what it actually reflects is that there are more plots in the making.",
        "Where do you come down on that?",
        "Well, I would certainly say it reflects better intelligence.",
        "I'd have to say that at least in the connection of the dots, we've done a lot better now than we've ever done before, and certainly much better than 9/11.",
        "I also have to point out that some of these plots are what we call homegrown plots, where people are radicalizing themselves over the Internet or in small groups, and the larger question is, you know, what do we do about the increased radicalization of some people into an ideology of terror and hatred?",
        "And that is a much more fundamental study, which we are undertaking with a great deal of energy and a great deal of urgency.",
        "Well I guess that goes to the question as to how you actually vanquish this threat, because unless you can actually weaken their ability to plan and to plot and to pay for these events, it seems like you're engaged in almost like a game of whack-a-mole, just trying to knock them down when they come up with these plots.",
        "And now here is Flora with the video Pick of the Week.",
        "Hey, Flora.",
        "I think you're exactly right.",
        "I mean, clearly on the short term and through the long term, we're going to continue to have to improve our intelligence and have these measures, but you know, that psychology of what makes a person convert from an ordinary individual to a suicide bomber is, I think, at the core of a long-term strategy to winning here, which is worth a great deal of study and discussion, because clearly at the end of the day, we've got to eliminate that pool of people who are susceptible to becoming killers.",
