        "Now whether that material could actually be, you know, regenerated, you know, that would - you'd have to try it and see and go and see what's happening around the margins of those glaciers.",
        "What does this tell you?",
        "What have you learned besides that these things can live for 400 years under the ice in the dark?",
        "Well, I think it really pushes back when we think about repopulating deglaciated landscapes, where is the genetic material coming from as far as, you know, the Arctic flora and probably in the Alpine areas, as well, you know, that we're not only dealing with populations that are above and beyond the margins of these glaciers, but we are also dealing with genetic material that goes back much further.",
        "And I think if you're thinking about, you know, trying to have a - any kind of plant material that say would be sent to extraterrestrial areas, like if you wanted to try something on the moon or on Mars or something like that, definitely bryophytes would have a great potential because they are programmed to be able to dry out, desiccate totally.",
        "They are programmed in the Arctic species anyway to be able to be frozen for long periods of time.",
        "I think the biology of bryophytes really needs to be emphasized in research, and hopefully this will give them - put them into the limelight a little bit.",
        "Yeah, you sound like you're the defender.",

        "Yeah, it's really interesting.",
        "Do they produce anything for humans?",
        "I mean if you took them along on the Mars trip, could you eat them?",

        "So they have, you know, special biochemistry that has been explored extensively."

        "What would really you like to find?",
        "What would, you know, besides...?",
        "I think what would be really fascinating is that if you could go under a melting glacier that was 100,000, 150,000 years, maybe 200,000 years old, and you actually found macrofossils, what would be called macrofossils underneath the glacier and be able to rejuvenate them.",
        "That would be pretty amazing.",
        "Yeah, about the mosses that you found.",
        "Are all mosses like this, or is this a particularly hardy species of moss that you've discovered in the ice there?",
        "The mosses that we've been able to rejuvenate are hardy.",
        "There are definitely species that occur up there that I don't think would do the same thing or, you know, we haven't been able to rejuvenate them.",
        "So it - these species are definitely adapted to Arctic environments, and that I think gives them a jump start, you know, from coming out from underneath the glacier.",
        "Is it possible to go out in your backyard and find these same mosses?"

        "What's the best way, if people listening now are saying I want to grow some moss, I want to raise some moss, you've raised my consciousness?",
        "OK, well, you could just go out into your garden and find some moss and bring it in.",
        "What you could do to do an experiment is actually put them into a coffee grinder and grind them up and put them into a little dish with a little bit of soil and see what you can grow.",
        "The other really neat experiment probably for kids would be just go out and take some soil and water it, cover a Petri dish with a glass and see what comes out of that soil, and you'll be amazed.",
