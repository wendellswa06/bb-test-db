        "He was only 3 years old.",
        "And to think about somebody that young being taken by this terrorist is just, you know, really chilling.",
        "One thing I want to mention is, thinking about whether to watch the video that terrorist posted - you know, part of me was thinking, should I go ahead and watch it to get a better understanding of what these victims had endured?",
        "And then when I was piecing together these profiles, it was just way too much for me.",
        "I didn't want to see them getting killed.",
        "So you started working on this on the same day as the attacks, March 15.",
        "Yeah.",

        "I'm keen on knowing the names, remembering the stories and celebrating the lives of the victims.\"\" And I was so struck by that because it's something we all, I think, think about whenever there is some atrocity committed - is that we should be talking more about the victims than the perpetrator.",
        "You actually went and did something about it.",
        "Why?",
        "You know, I'm a scholar on issues pertaining to Muslim-Americans, the war on terror.",
        "I came to understand that, you know, part of Islamophobia - I think a critical dimension of Islamophobia is this tendency or phenomenon to view Muslim victims or Muslim victimhood at large in, you know, kind of monolithic terms.",

        "And I think that the presumption by mainstream media outlets who tend to fixate on the terrorists is that they don't care.",
        "And they specifically don't care when the victims are Muslims.",

        "And the central arc of the book is essentially her life and how her desire to know - her curiosity is sort of used against her during this war.",

        "She becomes a weapon in this civil war, and she's kind of transformed by hate.",

        "It reminds me - you know, Joseph Conrad said he wanted to write the \"\"Heart Of Darkness\"\" as nonfiction, but he thought no one would ever believe the horrors taking place in the Belgian Congo, so he decided to write it as fiction.",
        "Do you think that's why you wrote your book this way because as you say, rightly, there are horrors of war being enacted in other parts of the world?",
        "There's not much in here that's fully unanchored from something that happened in the real world.",
        "And I - it was interesting for me because I spent the last 10 years writing nonfiction.",
        "I've spent last years - 10 years writing journalism.",
