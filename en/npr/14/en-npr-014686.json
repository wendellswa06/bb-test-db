        "She reveals in the interview that this was, you know, one of her deepest passions.",

        "And the interview request was put in six months prior to November 8th.",
        "So this was, you know, a long time, you know, coming, you know, waiting for the interview, and I'm happy that I did get speak to her, though.",
        "And that foundation deals with the issue of education and dropout prevention, sometimes using music to try to encourage kids to stay engaged.",
        "Definitely.",
        "Their first initiative and program was Loop Dreams, which Kanye and his mom, Dr. West, were going - that was to be the first initiative.",

        "So it was sort of, like, I was speaking to my mom in a sense because they just had a similar loving spirit.",

        "So when you look at all of the obstacles that there are in raising kids, you can sort of see why it's really, really important to try to keep their minds straightened out, but at the same time being sensible enough so they can be creative and come into their own.",
        "What kind of an impression did you get of how she brought that spirit to raising her son, who is, of course, at this point not only incredibly creative, but incredibly wealthy at being creative?",

        "Estimates range from five to 20 percent; no one knows for sure.",
        "A living will is a legal instruction so if you become terminally ill or unconscious and can't speak for yourself, it spells out what treatment you'd want or not want.",
        "But Sabatino says it's just too hard to figure out those things in advance.",
        "We've spent about 30 years trying to standardize the way patients express themselves about end-of-life care.",

        "It's called a Healthcare Power of Attorney or Healthcare Proxy.",
        "The Proxy Directive or Healthcare Power of Attorney appoints someone who is legally authorized to be your spokesperson; to look at the facts, your medical condition, taking into account your wishes and values, and to make the decision at the time a decision really needs to be made and you can't."

        "It gets easier when you have it actually in writing what the patient wants, because let's just say you might have somebody identified as the healthcare proxy in a family situation and there might be, let's just say, two or three children, one of whom is the healthcare proxy, the other two have different opinions about what it actually is that mom wanted.",
