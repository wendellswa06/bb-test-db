        "Now, that offseason work, by definition, did not include coaching because at that time, there were not coaches who were WNBA players.",
        "So she came up against a very simple issue, which is that $50,000 was the max that could be paid to all the players for offseason work, and 40,000 of that had already been promised to her Mystics teammate Elena Delle Donne.",

        "And so we were back and forth in communication with them, keeping them updated on which magazines were interested, you know, with - and on our final decision is to go with Sister 2 Sister.",
        "So they were definitely aware of it, and they gave us their blessing."
