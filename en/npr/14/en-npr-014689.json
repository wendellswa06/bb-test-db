        "She actually blogs with her students, and she's been teaching for more than 20 years, but she's really embraced the Internet and made it a core part of her curriculum.",
        "And where she comes down on this is that she has no patience for educators who don't incorporate technology into their classrooms.",
        "Because, as she points out, although a lot of parents sort of think of the Internet sort of like TV - as entertainment - it's really becoming the primary source of information these days."

        "How does a mathematician wind up on the atom bomb project?",
        "First, of all, the very idea of an atom bomb came from theoretical mathematical calculations.",
        "They then knew this thing would work before anyone would - had been able to build it or even try to build it.",
        "John von Neumann, a very famous mathematician, one of the guys who began the computer industry in the United States, or the ideas of computers, and it was von Neumann that actually recruited Ulam as one of several mathematicians to go to Los Alamos to work on the Manhattan Project.",
        "And as I understand it, at one point he corrected Edward Teller?",
        "This was in the - 1943, 1944.",
        "Teller was already starting working on the idea of an H-bomb.",
        "He'd got a design that he'd worked out.",
        "Ulam looks at it and says, no, that's actually not going to work, and then came up with an improved way of building the thing.",
        "Teller agreed and then thought about it.",
        "And in fact Teller then came up with an even better design.",
        "So the final design of the H-bomb is actually known in the business as the Teller-Ulam or the Ulam-Teller H-bomb.",
        "What other things did Stanislaw Ulam work on that made him proud about his life and career?",
        "First of all, in his early career, when he was growing up in Poland, he worked in number theory, ergodic theory, algebraic topology, discrete mathematics, did a lot of varying clever mathematics.",
        "But it was really only after he came to the States and started thinking about issues to do with the real world that his genius really came to the fore.",
        "He was one of these people, almost like Einstein, that could think of things in different ways.",
        "One of the things he did when he was working on the atom bomb was that they were faced with solving mathematical problems with the very crude computers that were just being built."

        "It's a very clever, powerful method that's now used all over the world.",

        "One of them is the one that Ulam came up with in a conversation in 1958 with John von Neumann.",
        "And they observed that the rate of change of technology was heating up.",
        "Things were changing faster and faster.",
        "Eventually the rate of change of technology would reach a stage that it was too fast for human beings to keep up with it.",
