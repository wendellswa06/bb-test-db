        "Well, I - believe it or not, I found it inside the company archives in a notebook kept by John Pemberton, who was the sort of root doctor/scientist who invented Coca-Cola in 1886.",
        "It didn't say Coca-Cola on it.",
        "It had - it just had a big X, but it clearly is a Coke formula, and it - you know, if you make it, you'll drink Coca-Cola except it'll have a little bit of cocaine in it.",
        "Wait.",
        "You didn't - but didn't they deny that this was the real formula?",
        "Oh, yeah, of course, they denied it.",
        "But how - you know, you can't prove anything unless you look at what they've got in their vault.",
        "So, but it taste like Coke, you're saying.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "It's a - it's the Coke formula.",
        "I mean, maybe Pemberton futzed around with it a little bit but, you know, it's got the little 7X formula with essential oils that are orange, lemon, nutmeg, cinnamon, coriander, neroli and vanilla, and it's got some lime juice in it.",
        "They make it citric acid back in those days.",
        "Now they make it with phosphoric acid.",
        "You know, but basically it's the same formula.",
        "And nowadays they take out the cocaine, as I said, from the fluid extract of coca leaf before they serve it to you.",
        "Now, this story seemed to just seize the public's imagination, or the media's imagination, at any rate.",
        "But, you know, Coca-Cola's been around for a long time, since 1886.",
        "Is this the first time that an employee tried to leak the formula to a competitor?",
        "Well, number one, let me make it clear.",
        "They're not trying to leak the original Coca-Cola formula.",
        "This employee had no access to that.",
        "What they were leaking was apparently a formula for a new drink that Coca-Cola's about to come out with.",
        "And, yes, it is the first time that any Coca-Cola employee has tried to give any kind of formula to Pepsi, to my knowledge, and it's very shocking and very unusual.",
        "I don't think this would have happened 10 years ago.",
        "The company - in 2000, they fired about 5,000 people, and it was a terrible shock to their corporate culture, and they really haven't been the same since.",
        "This is a company with tremendous pride in loyalty and longevity where, you know, people stay there their whole lives, and now it's just a place to work apparently, and so this sort of thing might happen.",
        "Let me also point out, it was only one person.",
        "It's one secretary essentially, from what I gather, who was in the marketing department, who had access to this material.",
        "And I don't know how she got hold of Ibrahim Dimson or Edmund Duhaney, her colleagues, but they did not work for Coke.",
        "This Joya Williams is the secretary.",
        "Right.",
        "Why would Pepsi have cooperated on this?"

        "Well, if you think about it, I'm quite sure Coca-Cola would have done the same thing if the situation were reversed.",
        "Number one, they'd be idiots not to turn somebody in immediately.",
        "If they were actually going to entertain a bribe like that and it, you know, hit the news, a company like Coke or Pepsi would look so awful having done something like that it wouldn't be worth it to them.",
        "What if this was a sting operation in the first place?",
        "In other words, what if it wasn't really a Coca-Cola representative approaching Pepsi?",
        "What if it was the FBI?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Which is precisely what happened to the people who were approaching Pepsi.",
        "So it does not surprise me that they turned them in.",
        "The other thing you have to realize is that although Coke and Pepsi are bitter rivals in many ways, they also both recognize that they need one another, you know, sort of like everybody thinks about Coke and Pepsi.",
        "They don't think about these other drinks.",
        "Right.",
        "So, you know.",
        "All right, let me ask you about another highly guarded secret that you wrote about - an article about, and that's the recipe for Colonel Sanders Kentucky Fried Chicken.",
        "Now this wasn't a case of corporate espionage, but it does show how seriously these companies take their secrets and protecting them.",
        "Tell us about the story of Kentucky Fried Chicken.",

        "Well, the story that I read was - and I thought that you were the author of it - the story that I read was about a woman who had worked for Colonel Sanders who then - and I think perhaps bought his house, and then found this formula in the attic that she thought was the Colonel Sander's recipe, and went to Kentucky Fried Chicken to say we're going to auction this off, and they tried to take her to court.",
        "But, once again, it was a case of they were really concerned that this - was it a case of their being really concerned that this recipe was going to get out, or they had to protect, you know, they had to protect their corporate identity.",
        "It's interesting.",
        "I'm very surprised that they took her to court or threatened in any way, because that would simply call more attention to the thing.",
        "For instance, when I published this Coca-Cola formula in the book, you know, it would have amazed me if the company had sued me or something like that, because then it would be like saying, well, he really does have something valuable here.",
        "Right.",
        "So, (unintelligible)...",
        "Well, in the end they decided not to take her to court for just that reason.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Well, that makes sense to me."

        "Right.",

        "Twenty-one years ago?",
        "Right.",
        "...the whole country sort of had a nervous breakdown.",
        "It was amazing to me that people cared that much, but the company got 40,000 letters with people saying that it was like changing the Constitution or burning the flag on their front lawn, and how dare they change the Coca-Cola formula.",
        "So, that's what this company has come to mean to people, and I think that's why you're getting this reaction.",

        "The Coke and Pepsi case caught the public's eye largely because they are two globally famous companies and rivals that actually cooperated to expose a crime, but corporate espionage happens much more frequently on a smaller scale.",

        "There are actually lawsuits and people are trained in those large electronic stores, for example, to see people who might be surreptitiously going along and recording notes as they go by.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Again, that's another case of espionage, because you're talking about - it's more a case of death by a thousand cuts.",
