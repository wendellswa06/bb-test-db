        "And the whole Coke and Pepsi story that we've been talking about up until this point really isn't corporate espionage.",
        "This was just a case of -not even a disgruntled employee, but an employee who thought that she could make a buck, I guess.",
        "Right.",
        "This is more something I would expect - a plot out of Get Smart, as opposed to a plot out of James Bond, frankly.",
        "And it doesn't rise to the level of what you would call corporate espionage?",
        "Well, I mean, by definition, it is corporate espionage.",

        "And I should say that a lot of corporate espionage is committed by amateurs, but at the same time, you have to realize that you have professional organizations doing it as well."
