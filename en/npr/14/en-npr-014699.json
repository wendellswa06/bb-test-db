        "Another thing is we have trouble with numbers.",
        "So something like a 1 or 2 percent fee in a mutual fund - you might think that sounds really small, but we have trouble grasping that, look, over 20-30-40 years that little fee can eat up just a huge amount of our money, and those are some of the key mistakes that people make.",
        "So the aim of this series, it sounds like, is to give people really very practical hands-on advice.",
        "Right, and one way we're going to do this - and this is kind of cool.",

        "Oh, I like that.",
        "...It's a pretty good one - by signing up for your 401(k), for example.",

        "He called the Fed, quote, his \"\"biggest enemy,\"\" and said nominating Jerome Powell to lead it may have been a mistake."
