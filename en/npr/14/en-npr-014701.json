        "It will be a challenging election.",
        "But it's one that I feel very good about.",
        "Republicans just don't want anyone so deep in the heart of Texas who will stand up against the Wall Street banks and the pharmaceutical companies and the corporate tax-dodgers, as I have done for years, and they will do anything to get rid of me, even if it means colluding with some Democrat to do it.",
        "And the allegation is that Democrat is the person you may face in the primary from San Antonio.",

        "But yes, in sworn court testimony, it's come out that he, in fact, helped the Republicans design the district.",

        "I've been working on the ground in San Antonio since June.",
        "We'll be back there again tomorrow, and I feel very good.",
        "You know, the Republicans obviously don't want my neighbors to vote on my service because they know they can't prevail there.",
        "That's why they've tried to connect me with as many people I've not served as possible.",
        "So how - how does puzzling fit into your life?",
        "Yes.",
        "But I think my continual attention to San Antonio, combined with the support I already enjoy in Lockhart and San Marcos and Austin will be sufficient to give me a chance to continue battling Republicans here in Washington.",
        "We should mention there is a different version of the story of how that district got drawn from your potential challenger, but we'll let that go for a minute.",

        "Yes, in 2004, it was Tom DeLay instead of Rick Perry, and he thought he only had to divide my district in three pieces and connect it to the Rio Grande River with no straight road.",
        "This time, it's a couple-of-hundred-miles-plus shorter in the length of the district, but it's a district that's really unfair to San Antonio.",
        "It divides up neighborhoods, minimizes the voice, particularly the east side and south side of San Antonio, connecting them to the airport in Austin instead of the nearby airport in San Antonio.",
        "So I think it's really a map, with its crooked lines, that is about as unfair to San Antonio as it is to all the communities heading up to Austin.",
        "Ken?",
        "Congressman, you mentioned the mid-decade redistricting of 2003-2004.",
        "Basically, that's what brought down Tom DeLay, because of the kind of things he tried to do to make sure he can pull that off.",
        "And I also want to mention that you and I met in 1984 when you were running against Phil Gramm in the primary.",
        "Yes, I was the Democratic nominee in '84, and so I've really been battling with kind of the same folks all along, and it's amazing how much the issues then, like protecting Social Security and Medicare, trying to get the economy moving and controlling our deficit in a way that would involved shared sacrifice instead of putting all the burden on working people, those same issues that were at the core of that battle, remain at the core of my current attempt to be re-elected.",
        "One of the big issues in Texas redistricting, of course, is that because of population gains, Texas gains four seats, and most of those population gains are from Hispanic residents.",
        "And yet by the map I've seen, it looks like that the Latino district, Latino gain may only gain one of the four seats.",
        "Well, that's - your analysis is certainly correct.",
        "You would think, unlike a state like Illinois or Ohio or New York that are losing members, in Texas it would be extremely easy.",
        "I represent an area that has some of the greatest population growth, and we're getting four new seats.",
        "But instead, this is really a plan to try to assure that Hispanics and African-Americans do not get the seats to which they are entitled and to claim that the only - and I think it's a false claim - that the only seat that they call an opportunity district for Hispanics is one designed specifically with help from my challengers to try to run me out of office.",
        "I don't think it will work in San Antonio.",
        "I enjoy the support of a big Latino for Lloyd group, and I think we'll overcome it.",
        "But I mainly hope that the courts will act in a hearing next week in San Antonio and another hearing in Washington to begin taking the steps to declare this outrageous plan - which it does deny opportunities to Hispanics and African-Americans - to declare it in violation of the Voting Rights Act and help us get a more fair and just plan.",
        "Is your argument undermined somewhat, when Republicans make the same complaints about the maps Democrats drew in places like Illinois and Maryland?",
        "Well, I think the situations are different, but I think that the courts will have to look and apply one standard across the country, and if they apply the standard that has existed previously with the Voting Rights Act, as well as recognize the changes we made in that act on intentional discrimination, I think they'll invalidate the Texas plan."
