        "Redistricting has been a fascinating thing to watch here in Arizona with our independent commission and the fighting that's come from all sides and, you know, the different opinions that come from people whether they want to see more Democrats elected, more Republicans elected or more minority-represented districts.",
        "On the map this time, I'd hope that we've seen at least three minority-represented districts in Arizona, and we ended up with two.",
        "The right wing in our state wanted to see three border districts instead of two, and they got that.",
        "But as someone from Tucson, it's nice that we'll have three congressmen representing us are women, representing us in the next election.",
        "And it's nice to see you're a supporter of Congresswoman Giffords that her district will be much more favorable for her than it was in the past.",
        "Ken?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Assuming Gabby Giffords runs again, I think, by all indications, she probably will, although, of course, there was some talk about her running for the Senate, and that's not going to happen.",
        "But it seems like if - you're exactly right, independent commission in Arizona and it seems to be the Republicans who are complaining the most.",
        "I think Ben Quayle, son of Dan Quayle, his district has also been changed.",
        "He may be thrown in with another Republican incumbent.",
        "Tyler, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And, Ken, as you look at this map, I've seen some analysis that suggests that after the big Republican wave in 2010, not just in Congress and the Senate but, yes, in those state legislatures and state senates and state houses where all these things are so important about redrawing these maps in generally a very partisan way.",
        "They're not expected to actually pick up a whole bunch more seats when you weigh everything out but could be solidifying a lot of those swing states, swing seats.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "I mean, first of all, Republicans picked up a net of 63 seats in 2010.",
        "There's not many more seats they can come up with, but a lot of these seats are precarious.",
        "A lot of them were anti-Obama.",
        "A lot of these lines have to be redrawn by Republicans to make sure they have a chance for re-election in 2012, because whenever there is a big-wave election, two years later it's the freshmen who are most vulnerable.",
        "And also a lot of these maps are going to end up with the stamp of a federal court on them.",
        "How long does that process take?",
        "Aren't people filing for election now?",
        "Well, that's exactly right.",
        "Like Ohio, for example, there may be a ballot initiative to force the Republicans to either change their map or redesign it completely.",
        "And now, the primary apparently has gone from May to June to give voters more time to - and for the mapmakers more time to establish the new districts."
