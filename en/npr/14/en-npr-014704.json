        "Not only could they clearly detect plumes containing thousands of different types of bacteria, they could tell all sorts of things from the clouds, like whether they came from a man or a woman.",

        "We could actually tell people apart.",
        "Meadow says this raises all kinds of possibilities, like someday maybe being able to identify a murder suspect by reading the microbial cloud he or she left behind at the scene of a crime.",
        "You know, there's a lot of reasons why we might want to know if some nefarious character's been in the certain room in the last few hours, and maybe there's a way to use microbes for that.",
