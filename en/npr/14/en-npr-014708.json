        "Of the three nuclear tests that North Korea has conducted, the latest one is by far the most powerful.",
        "The weapon could be in the range of the bomb that devastated Hiroshima during World War II.",
        "It's much harder to verify North Korea's claim that it tested a miniature nuclear weapon.",

        "It doesn't do the North Koreans much good if they have to put it in a truck.",

        "And James Acton, at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, says that's apparently, the news with this third North Korean test.",
        "KCNA, the Korean news agency, has come out and said it was a smaller and light design, I believe were the exact words that they used.",
        "It may be possible to glean more information about that claim if gases from the underground test have escaped into the atmosphere.",

        "So although I do think it may well have been a miniaturized device, we actually may never know.",
        "The United States undertook hundreds of nuclear tests before developing reliable small warheads.",
        "But Acton says the North Korean program has been designed from the start to produce a compact weapon.",
        "That means it could have made some real strides, even though this is just the third test.",
        "There's also the possibility that the North Koreans have received outside assistance.",
        "That could make their task of producing a miniaturized warhead easier."
