        "And even if it has produced a compact warhead, North Korea doesn't yet have the ability to strike the United States with it on an intercontinental ballistic missile.",
        "They have demonstrated an ability to launch missiles into space, but so far, North Korea hasn't shown that it can build a warhead that is rugged enough to re-enter the earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds and blistering temperatures.",
        "Not only do you have to have a weapon that's light enough to fit in the nose cone and small enough to fit in a nose cone, you also have to have a re-entry vehicle and design combination that is durable enough to survive the rigors of re-entry.",
        "That said, North Korea may have the ability to threaten its neighbors with a warhead on a shorter-range missile, which moves much more slowly and can carry a bigger warhead.",
        "Corey Hinderstein is at a nonprofit called the Nuclear Threat Initiative.",
        "Some of the missiles that they have, the shorter range missiles, they might only be looking at a payload of about three feet, in which case we'd have to believe that that's doable.",
        "And North Korea could build a handful of weapons.",

        "The real interesting question is whether this used highly enriched uranium.",
        "It's harder to build a compact nuclear warhead with uranium, compared with plutonium, but it is possible.",
        "And it's possible to enrich uranium in secret.",
        "No reactor is required.",
        "At least publicly, they have declared that they are not producing any highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons, that all of their interest in uranium enrichment has been in support of their nuclear energy program.",
        "Hinderstein says if the sniffer aircraft detect a uranium bomb, that would be a very significant finding about the North Korean program.",
        "It doesn't necessarily change their capability, but it may change the number of weapons they could have at their disposal in the near future."
