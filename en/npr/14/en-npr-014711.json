        "But maybe - and this is what he's trying to determine now - maybe they've got a disruption in their hormonal system, the system that responds to stress and physical and emotional pain, that could make them more prone to misbehave as kids, and more prone to sense physical pain as adults.",
        "But McFarland says if you're in pain now, that certainly doesn't mean you were a bad kid.",
        "Of people who have chronic pain in adulthood, these factors in childhood probably affect a very small percentage - perhaps only about one in 20.",
