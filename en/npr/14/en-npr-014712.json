        "And it was the perception on their part, I think, you could make the argument that Ronald Reagan might have done something different than Jimmy Carter that - that eventually won their release.",
        "Because there was probably a likelihood had Reagan been confronted with the situation that Carter was, he wouldve probably used force.",

        "I'm depressed too because I see - I pick up the paper, I say, my God, this is what the - the promise of the Enlightenment was that educated, well-fed, well-taken care of individuals with suits and ties can adjudicate things in a way that cavemen couldnt.",

        "It's completely different.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You got a good point because a lot of people in the United States suggest that technology has changed the course of events, that maybe even that brain chemistry has evolved in 2,500 years so that we're not - we dont think, we dont react to stimuli - I've had people tell me that - as the Greeks 2,500 years ago."

        "The idea that the Confederates had lost the big battle, they'd failed in the Northern invasion, the Emancipation Proclamation, the Gettysburg Address, nobody after Cold Harbor remembered that.",

        "HANSON Yes.",
        "Yes, at three places (unintelligible) and if I could summarize his ideas, whatever good that I can do by objecting to Sicily, the Sicilian Expedition of 415, and he did object to it, is overshadowed by the fact that I can do a lot of damage once my country makes a decision to go to war by helping its defeat.",
