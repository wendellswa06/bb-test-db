        "Well, the original GI Bill had the power to transform the lives of the veterans and the rest of the country along with them.",
        "And the current GI Bill is, although modeled on the original, is just - has so much more range of benefits.",
        "You can't really make it through college.",
        "In most areas, the strain on veterans that tried to do so is often great because they have to hold down a job, take out loans.",
        "And many veterans - and this is kind of scandalous, really - who served duty at war in Afghanistan and Iraq, who happened to be Reserves or National Guardsmen, only get about 27 percent of the benefits, and sometimes not even that.",
        "Why is that?",
        "Well, there was a one instance - and this has happened several times, was in the news recently.",
        "A group of Guardsmen served 22 months in Iraq right alongside the regular Army troops, but they returned one day early of the necessary amount of time they need to serve - full service in order to get their benefits.",
        "So that, basically, for that one day, they got very little in return of the benefits they thought they had in the bank.",
        "And it was very clear, since their orders were cut ahead of time, that there's - they - at war, it was engineered, so they would not receive the benefits that they otherwise would have coming.",
        "That's their belief, anyway, but the military may disagree with that.",
        "In any case, after the Second World War on the GI Bill, not only was your education, the fee of your college, private or public, was paid, you got a stipend and a living allowance.",
        "Do those things still count?",
        "Well, you do get tuition assistance now, but the average cost of a public university across America - it's not enough.",
        "Some of the lower-cost ones - you can make it through, but there's no such stipend or book allowances or living expenses.",
        "You get a maximum amount per month, and this is often just not enough.",
        "Furthermore, there's the fact that a lot of veterans have to support their families, have hold down jobs rather going to school, and consequently just becomes too hard for them to take advantage of these benefits.",
        "There was a study that the Defense Department did awhile back that showed, since 1985, only about eight percent of eligible veterans took advantage of those education benefits.",
        "You're talking about some differences.",
        "Obviously, there are other differences, too, during the Second World War, whether they were volunteers or whether they were drafted, men and women were in service for the duration, not for a specific period of time, as they are now in the all-volunteer Army.",
        "Well, that's correct.",
        "There were other differences, too.",
        "The original GI Bill reached an enormous segment of American society simply by virtue of the fact that one in eight Americans served in the military during World War II, one in eight Americans alive at the time.",
        "And if you can imagine the impact of spreading out to entire generation free college educations and subsidized home loans and cradle-to-grave medical care and so forth, it was epochal on its effect on America to open up the colleges to a much broader segment of the population.",
        "It made a nation of renters into nation of homeowners.",
        "It's profound in its effects."
