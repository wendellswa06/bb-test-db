        "This was - the GI Bill of 1944 was the most important legislation that the country had, in addition to the Marshall Plan.",

        "And I hope I will supplement what I've already put in, and I hope that others will join me, and we will start to do what should be done.",
        "We cannot give the living stipend, the tuition because that will be taxable to the GI, so that's just is silly.",
        "But I'm hopeful the Congress will change that and enable the GI to at least go untaxed.",
        "And I'm hopeful that we can give larger amounts because the way things are, the GI has only enough to pay for the tuition, and that means he probably has to go to school near his home.",

        "Today, we haven't shown that gratitude.",
        "We've got to.",
        "Obviously, the fund, as it's presently structured, would be, what, about 100 people per year.",
        "And if more people join you and if you devote more of your considerable resources to this, that could go up.",
        "But we're still going to be talking about hundreds maybe little thousands per year, when many tens of thousands of people would be eligible normally.",
        "That's right.",

        "And it's really sad because if you'll look at what fully funding education cost for our veterans has done for the country in the past - doctors, lawyers, engineers, inventors - you know, the people who built much of what is keeping us afloat today was paid forth and obtained through those education benefits.",

        "Well, this is one of my problems with the GI Bill was - and I just kind of want to point this out - coming into the GI Bill program, I didn't have - I had never taken SATs or anything, so I didn't go directly to a four-year college.",

        "My father who served for over 20 years had the same thing happened to him, and I think that this is really common, and I don't know how it can be addressed or tackled because a lot of people are getting locked out of benefits that they were promised.",
        "Edward Humes, as I understand it, to qualify for the GI Bill, the - $100 of each monthly paycheck has to be deducted in the first year of enlistment, is that right?",
        "That's correct.",
        "And that is - was a new, relatively new requirement that was added to the original GI Bill.",
        "That didn't exist in the past for World War II or Korean veterans.",
        "But to continue the program, there were pressures in Congress to both cut the benefits and to transfer some of the costs to the members of the military themselves.",
