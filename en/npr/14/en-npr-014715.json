        "No - well, my case, I think, is very common.",

        "Yes, sir, two months.",
        "And how much did you receive for school from the GI Bill before you were deployed to Iraq and after you were deployed?",
        "Before I deployed to Iraq, whenever I was in school, I'd receive $230 a month and that was if I was taking fulltime, 12 hours.",

        "That is correct.",

        "Correct.",
        "I recently spoke with the VA about if I will still receive those benefits after I get out, and they said, no, that the GI Bill, especially for the Reserves, is an incentive to stay in the Reserves.",

        "I'm sorry, sir.",
        "Where are you going to school?",

        "And you're doing that I suspect, what, 20 hours a week or so?",
        "Twenty, twenty-five, yes, sir.",
        "I've been able to set up my schedule, my class schedule so that I can work about three days of the week during the day and then leave the nights for studying, so…",
        "And again, this money is an inducement for being in the Reserves and staying in the Reserves.",
        "Is it what you expected?",
        "I can't really say that I really had any expectations.",
        "I joined the Marine Corps definitely not for the money.",
        "Anyone who joins the military for money, I don't think they have the right idea of what they're getting into.",
        "So I can't say that it let down my expectations, but when I joined.",
        "But now, it kind of does, especially whenever you only get 36 months of usage for the GI Bill.",
        "And so if I take summer classes, when I can only take six hours, I only get - I get about half the amount of money, and then also I'm using two of my months of eligibility for the GI Bill instead of - so if you can equate that, it's basically less money in the long run.",
        "So you've got to juggle your studying schedule as well as your finances.",

        "To make it more flexible.",
        "Correct.",
        "More flexible and instead of - and do it like credit hour basis instead of a monthly basis or something like that or just a flat rate of how much money you're available to receive, you know, in the certain amount of timeframe instead of, you know, penalizing someone for only taking six hours instead of 12 like your caller earlier is saying about the community college.",
        "Sure.",
        "And you're going ahead, and how much school do you have left?",
        "This is my final semester of undergraduate studies and I'm going to go to law school and also get my MBA at UMKC as well, so I have about another four years.",
        "And your eligibility will be up under anybody's bill by then?",

        "And, again, Edward Humes, the rules are different for National Guard and Reserves.",
        "Yes.",
        "And I believe there are some proposals now that look at that and perhaps altering it in Congress, because while Benjamin served overseas, his duty, undoubtedly, was every bit as hazardous and vital as the regular troops that he was serving alongside, and yet his benefits are just a fraction of what they receive.",
        "And I'm sure a lot of people might think that that's not quite fair.",

        "But in the time of war, they're really doing the same service.",

        "Again, if you served in the military, whether you are pressed into service as regular troops or as a guard - guard's unit or a reservist, you've got full benefits.",
        "There is no sort of class distinctions as we're seeing now with our returning veterans.",
        "...more taverns than churches.",

        "Interestingly, Sonny Montgomery, the author of the Montgomery GI Bill, was responsible for a lot of legislation involving the military; chairman of the House Armed Services Committee for a very long time.",
        "But among the things he also did was reforms that made it impossible for the United States to go to war without the Army Reserves and - without the Reserves and the National Guard.",
        "It's interesting.",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "He was really single-handedly responsible in a lot of ways for keeping some form of the GI Bill alive.",
        "It really reached it's nadir during the Vietnam conflict, where the benefits were really quite miserly.",
        "And, really, he managed to resurrect portions of legislation to improve it somewhat.",
