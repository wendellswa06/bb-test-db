        "President Calderon has found himself on the political defensive.",
        "With more than 6,000 people killed last year in drug-related violence and no end to the war in sight, the president has been in the odd position of having to publicly justify why he's battling organized crime.",
        "President Calderon says the surge of violence is a sign that his forces are seriously disrupting the workings of the cartels.",
        "Last year alone, Mexico seized thousands of tons of marijuana, 200,000 kilos of cocaine, hundreds of weapons.",
        "Several key leaders from several cartels were arrested.",

        "In July, the Mexican marines even snagged a submarine puttering off the Pacific Coast carrying more than five tons of coke.",
        "What Calderon's administration has been unable to do is bring an end to the drug violence across Mexico.",
        "Jason Beaubien, NPR News, Zihuatanejo.",
        "Tomorrow, NPR's John Burnett reports on why young men become foot soldiers for Mexico's drug cartels.",
        "And for more on this series, go to npr.org.",
        "BPs internal investigation was not met with enthusiasm on Capitol Hill or on the Gulf Coast.",
        "As NPRs Debbie Elliott reports, some say it smacks more of finger-pointing than internal scrutiny.",
        "The first line in BPs press release this morning read, quote, no single factor caused the Macondo well tragedy.",
        "Orange Beach, Alabama Mayor Tony Kennon doesnt agree.",
        "They can say there was no single failure, but there was a single failure.",
        "The single failure was a lack of leadership and management on BPs part."

        "Massachusetts Democrat Edward Markey is on a House committee looking into the cause of the spill.",

        "Halliburton said it was confident its cement work met BPs specifications.",
        "Its not surprising to see the companies trying to parse out blame like that, says Tampa attorney Steve Yerrid, special counsel on the oil spill to Florida Governor Charlie Crist.",
        "Now the real format of what their defense is going to be is emerging.",
        "That is, it wasnt us, which is an untenable defense.",
        "Okay, well, maybe it was us, but only partially.",
        "Look at the other wrongdoers.",
        "Yerrid says the document today makes clear that BP does not intend to be solely liable for the damages that result from the explosion and oil spill, but will be looking to others to share that burden.",
        "Courts will determine some of that, but so will the government.",
        "Today, the top federal official overseeing the spill, retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen, said BPs internal investigation is hardly the last word.",
        "We know very little about his outlook on housing given his lack of experience in that area.",
        "President GEORGE W.",
        "BUSH: Our past efforts to secure Baghdad failed for two principal reasons: There were not enough Iraqi and American troops to secure neighborhoods that had been cleared of terrorists and insurgents, and there were too many restrictions on the troops we did have."

        "I mean, what we were advocating is a change of mission and definitely start to secure the population in Baghdad, which is an appropriate place to start, and that's what is going to take place.",
        "When we analyzed that, we believed we needed about five additional brigades to what's already in Baghdad and what the Iraqis can produce to do that.",
        "And the president has acceded to that, and you know, we though we needed two regiments to go to Al Anbar.",
        "The military guys are saying one, and certainly, we'll defer to their judgment.",
        "But by and large, from the force level perspective, I think it's on the money, and it's a force that can be decisive based on what it's being asked to do, and that is secure the population in Baghdad, but begin with the Shiite-Sunni neighborhoods where the population is about 1.8 million.",
        "A lot of people - and I think you included - have said more troops are not going to be meaningful unless they have a clear and specific mission.",

        "Well, you look at Baghdad, and like any military objective, I mean, you break it down into its parts, and you don't have to take on the whole city at once.",
        "And one of the things that we suggested is that the logical place to start is the Shia/Sunni neighborhoods, because you can demonstrate an even-handedness in securing that population.",
        "And believe me, the military tactical feature of this plan is the troops stay in the neighborhoods 24/7 and not go back to their bases, which is a major departure from anything that we have done in the past, except for the operation in Tal Afar.",
        "So if you start with the Shia/Sunni neighborhoods and protect both Shiites and Sunnis, I mean, it occurs to us that you have an opportunity there with Maliki for the first time to have some leverage over the Shia militias - both al-Sadr and al-Hakim, and also the Shiite vigilantes - in seeking to get them back behind their barricades and accept that political accommodation because we are finally protecting them.",
        "They waited two-and-a-half years in the harsh reality that one, the Iraqis couldn't protect them and the American military strategy chose not to protect them, and that's a fact.",
        "And I think there's something to work with there.",
        "And if they don't accommodate that desire after the evidence that we're protecting hundreds of thousands of their people, then we may, in fact, have to deal with them in Sadr City.",
        "But I think the first step would be not to contest them in Sadr City, but to secure the Shias and the Sunnis in a mixed neighborhood.",
        "That's the logical place to start.",
        "Well, let me play a tape for you.",
        "This was recorded earlier today at a news conference from the White House, where the new Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was specifically asked if this meant that the United States was going to either prepare to arrest or kill that Iraqi Shiite militia leader Moqtada al-Sadr.",
        "I think one of the most important commitments that the prime minister has made is that in this offensive, the military will have the authority to go after all lawbreakers.",
        "There are no exceptions.",
        "I'm not going to hang specific targets on specific people.",
        "That's Robert Gates, and referring to Moqtada al-Sadr, he later said that the troops would be going into Sadr City.",
        "Is not the kind of guerrilla house-to-house fighting that people were afraid of at the beginning of this war, is that not going to increase American casualties?",
        "Well, I believe what they're starting with is - what I've been told is the neighborhoods that I suggested, the Shia/Sunni neighborhoods.",
        "Certainly, if they have to deal with Sadr City, a highly dense population of 2 million, the challenge you have there - I mean, it's military feasible to do that, certainly.",
        "But is it desirable?",
        "In my view, it's a second-phase operation, and only if you have to.",
        "Because what'll happen is, quite frankly, that will unite the Shiite militias who are not united now.",
        "That will unite the Jaish al-Mahdi, and it also will unite the Badr corps and the vigilante groups, and the sum of that is about 70,000.",
        "And I agree - Shiite death squads are going to be killed in those Shia-Sunni neighborhoods if they're not brought to heel.",
        "They're going to be captured if we can capture them, and they're going to be driven out of there for sure.",
        "And we're speaking with retired General Jack Keane, who you just heard, with Larry Diamond, and with Michael O'Hanlon.",

        "I think that there is some prospect that we can get stabilization on the streets in parts of Baghdad for a time with this.",
        "But I think this is only going to work if the political aspects that the president spoke to are really activated.",
        "And I don't see where our leverage is to bring about the painful political compromises that need to be made on the constitution, on the sharing of oil revenue, on the reduction of the scope of de-Baathification and so on if we're putting all of this forward at the beginning, before Iraqis have actually performed.",
        "The mistake that's been made over and over again, Neal, is that the Iraqis say they're going to do things, we say fine, and then we make our commitments.",
        "And then the Iraqis don't deliver, and then we have no leverage.",
        "So if Prime Minister Maliki is not able to bring about the kind of political reconciliation that everyone knows needs to happen and that the Iraq study group focused on in great detail, this plan has no chance of working.",
