        "And I don't think we're going to be able to get traction on the Sunni basis of the violence on the resistance in al-Anbar Province, and it's radiating out into Baghdad.",
        "And I don't think we're going to be able to turn the corner on one of the most vital goals for the United States and Iraq, which is to really eliminate al-Qaida presence in western Iraq in the Sunni areas, unless the Sunnis feel that they're getting a political stake in the future as well.",

        "It has to do with the incompetency in the part of the administration.",
        "And I guess the question I would have is: How many of these 20,000 troops are actually going to be on the street?",
        "I would assume that a portion of them are going to be support people, whether they're…",
        "Well let's get a response on that from General Keane.",
        "Well, the overwhelming majority of them, you know, will be on the streets.",

        "But these are combat troops that are going in there.",
        "And they take some support troops with them.",
        "I mean, they have some - they have some engineers and they have communications and the rest of - the logistics troops that would support them are already in the theater.",
        "So whatever they bring with them are what we call in the military enablers to help combat troops do their job.",
        "But the overwhelming majority of all of these forces are, in fact, combat troops.",

        "There was still North Vietnamese divisions in South Vietnam, and American people lost their support for that war despite the fact the insurgency had been defeated by '71.",
        "And the house of cards came down in '75, as we all know.",
        "But listen, when you talk about the hearts and minds - I mean, it's an overused term - but the fact of the matter is this basic operation that's taking place in Baghdad's principal purpose is to secure that population.",
        "It's a proven kind if insurgency practice, the end result of which is to bring in economic packages and reconstruction packages so the people will be connected to the local officials, and indirectly to a central government.",
        "I mean, it's a tragedy looking back on it now that we did not do this many years ago.",
        "And the issue is, is it so hopeless that we can't pull this thing out?",
        "My analysis and the analysis of some others is is that it's not.",
        "It's hard, but it's not hopeless.",
        "And we certainly should put our shoulder behind it, given what the enormous consequences of a defeat in Iraq is, which is considerably worse than defeat in Vietnam.",

        "Only partially.",
        "There's a natural analogy in al-Anbar Province, because there is a classic, sort of in a way, nationalist or radical insurgency there.",
        "But in the country overall and in Baghdad, increasingly the source of the violence is sectarian and ethnic rivalry and violence by one group against another.",
        "And that was not really a factor in Vietnam.",
        "You've got two different types of violence in Iraq, and only one has a parallel to Vietnam.",
        "It's very hard to separate warring parties in a civil war as an external actor.",
        "And if we don't get a commitment by their political leaders to reduce the political drivers of that sectarian warfare, we just are not going to have nearly enough troops or nearly enough time to prevail in that.",

        "Just because you have a dire scenario that would result if we lost doesn't prevent you from losing - simply saying that your resolve not to lose doesn't guarantee victory.",
        "And while I do think that General Keane and others have put together a very good proposal, I'm more in Larry Diamond's camp of being skeptical that it can work at this late date.",
        "So I think it's incumbent on all of us - difficult for President Bush to articulate at this moment - but incumbent on all of us to start thinking about plan Bs.",
        "Because while I do, on the margins, support the speech last night and the proposal put forth, I don't really expect that it will work.",
        "And so I think we need a plan b, which to my mind should be something like the Bosnia model for Iraq, which is three largely autonomous regions with a weak central government sharing the oil, but otherwise largely staying out of business of most of the governance and helping people relocate from one region to another to places where they will feel safer.",
        "I'm not sure it's - right now - the moment to do this, and clearly President Bush and Prime Minister al-Maliki don't think so.",
        "But 100,000 people per month are being displaced in Iraq.",
        "Bosnia is happening.",
        "Ethnic cleansing is happening, and pretty soon, we're going to have no choice but to try and manage that process rather than pretend that our plan can stop it.",
        "So I hope very much I'm proven wrong, and I think this plan of President Bush's is worth a crack.",
        "But I think the chances of success are less than 50/50, and we'll need a backup plan, which I hope is a much better plan than complete withdrawal and concession of defeat.",
        "And I expect that we'll need a backup plan within a year.",
        "And within a year, though the president is running out of time, literally, in his administration.",

        "Dr.",
        "O'HANLON: My guess is that the Congress is going to ask very tough questions and make a lot of comments, and, of course, you'll hear from Senator Durbin in a few moments and he'll probably say some similar things to what he said last night.",
        "But I don't believe that Congress is going to cut off funding, even for the possible surge.",
        "Even for the jobs program that I think is also an important and welcome piece of this package.",
        "My guess is that Congress is going to try to create a little bit of the tone that Larry Diamond and I are today, which is we will reluctantly support this even though we don't really expect it to work, and save the real showdown on policy for somewhere between 9 and 18 months from now.",
