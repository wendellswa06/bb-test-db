        "They have felt that the operation in Iraq was disproportionately military right from the outset.",
        "Now admittedly, I think we know now this military strategy was wrong, and certainly, you know, military bears burden for that.",
        "But also, the relative ineffectualness of the other elements of our government has clearly played a part here, and we're certainly want them to step up the plate here.",
        "And I was expecting to get a little bit more specificity as to what that really is, you know, to gain confidence that there - we have a chance to bring the whole quaff together, so to speak.",
        "In terms of the risk of the operation, this strategy that we've been using to transition Iraqi security forces and running up and down the streets, conducting presence patrols, I think is really a flawed.",
        "And we get into those neighborhoods and protect the people in those neighborhoods where we develop the intelligence networks - over time, actually, we'll be a heck of a lot safer than running up and down the roads, becoming targets.",
        "Will the casualties go up?",
        "Sure, the casualties are going to go up, because if the enemy chooses to contest what we're doing, it will.",
        "But the evidence so far, based on what I've seen, the enemy is thinking about doing two things: conducting heavier level of violence where we're not, and then avoiding us and just waiting us out.",
        "And that's why the - a short surge, so to speak - I cannot stand that term - but if an increased presence there for a short period of time is not the answer.",
        "This is an 18-month to two-year, in my mind, operation for Baghdad, but even more significantly for al-Anbar, which is where we would've preferred to start, except the enemy chose Baghdad.",
        "And that's the basis in terms of the length of it.",
        "The risk of it, yes, I think there will be some additional casualties.",
        "But I think they will drop down, rather dramatically from what we have been used to in the past.",
        "Hello.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I just had a comment.",
        "You know, I don't think any of these actions will be successful in Iraq because we are not there for the interest of the Iraqis.",
        "Our interests really are our own.",
        "We don't want a democratic Iraq, because if we did, we would have an Islamic republic of Iraq.",
        "I think that's quite clear.",
        "And your guests, Mr. Diamond, Mr. O'Hanlon and General Keane have all been great supporters of this war.",
        "From the get go, they've supported this administration.",
        "And I don't know why they would have any credibility in what they're saying today.",
        "And I would ask them to justify what they're saying today, based on their previous support for the administration, which seems to have gotten everything wrong all along the way.",
        "Can I just say, Neal, I did not support the war.",
        "I criticized it from the beginning.",
        "I said it was a mistake.",
        "I went to Iraq to serve in the Coalition Provisional Authority because we are already there, and I thought the mission was, and in fact remains now, firming out what to do next given that the war is happened.",
        "But I've been a very outspoken critic of the administration.",
        "I just don't think we should drown in our criticism and have that blind us from a sober and practical assessment of what to do next.",
        "And Michael O'Hanlon, I think criticism is a fair word to use about much of your approach since the invasion began.",
        "Prof.",
        "O'HANLON: Yeah.",
        "But frankly, with all due respect to the caller, I think it's more important to get back to the future policy here, because, you know, there's a lot of this kind of recrimination about who did what and said what.",
        "I have been critical, but I don't think that excuses me from having made a couple of mistakes along the way.",
        "But the more important question that I'm focused on now is raised by what General Keane just said.",
        "He thinks it may take 18 to 24 months to see some progress.",
        "I mentioned nine to 18 months.",
        "I think we need to begin to develop a way of evaluating if the president's plan works, because my guess that it will be approved, or at least not opposed by the Congress to the extent it would be needed to prevent it from happening, so I think it will happen.",
        "And then, the question becomes at what point do we conclude that it has either begun to show some promise or failed.",
        "I would submit, that while there may be certain matrix that take 18 to 24 months to improve, we can't wait that long to see a reduction in violence for the Iraqi civilian population.",
        "And if we haven't seen some progress within the course of 2007, I will be pretty close to concluding in my own mind that the strategy is failing.",
        "Now, I say that in a very preliminary way.",
        "I think that's a very important question that I even fully thought through in my own mind."

        "But we're going to need to figure out metrics as a nation to know if this plan is working.",
        "And I'm very glad that General Keane has put his timeline on the table.",
        "Again, mine is a bit shorter, but I think this is a very important open question.",
        "And at his news conference early today, Secretary Gates' timeline was even shorter.",
        "He said he expected to start getting information back within a couple of months, in terms of how much the Iraqi government is willing to come through on its commitments as part of this plan.",
        "Is months, not years, a realistic goal for this, General Keane?",
        "Well, I agree that we should see some progress, certainly, once we get on the streets and bring the level of violence down.",
        "Sometime in the summer, I was really talking about the completion of the operation would take about 18 to 24 months.",
        "And you know, I agree with Michael.",
        "If we don't see some progress here by the summer or the fall, then something's wrong, and we would certainly have to reevaluate it.",
        "But all the indication that I've had in the analysis we've done, we should shortly be able to see some of that.",
        "And I think the secretary's concern, you know, is a legitimate one.",
        "And we have to be honest here.",
        "I'm not sure, you know, what this Maliki government is either.",
        "And I'm not certain anybody in our government knows for sure, whether they truly want, you know, a multi sectarian government that the Sunnis represented and not, or they want to have a much more unilateral approach, with overwhelming Shia majority, carrying out the Shia objectives.",
        "I think that's a open question.",
        "And I believe with the president.",

        "No.",
        "I think that's right, and that's been part of the problem up until now.",

        "Now, in response to tremendous pressure from Congress and the American people, he's concentrating his efforts on securing a single city and to a lesser extent of rural province in this region.",
        "This hardly seems to me to be a winning strategy in what the president has characterized as a global war.",
        "Well, I'd say two things.",
        "One, whatever Iraq was before, it is now the center of the struggle, certainly, the people who are responsible for 9/11 and the people who have been responsible for acts of terrorism around the world, since then, are hoping very much that the United States will be humiliated and defeated and driven out.",
        "There's no doubt that that would straighten them in variety of ways.",

        "It's obviously the largest population center.",
        "It's the place, as the president pointed out last night, where most of the violence in the country is taking place.",

        "The president perhaps has one last option left.",
        "This is it.",
        "He's been described as, you know, one of those poker players going all in on this plan.",

        "First of all, I don't think that that really is why we're there.",
        "If we were only concerned about controlling oil, we would have proceeded much differently than we have up until now.",
        "I do think, though, that the caller raises an important point, and a number of people have touched on it - that Iraq is part of a larger region.",
        "And one of the interesting things about the president's remarks last night, although these points were buried to some extent in the speech, is that he does suggest a diplomatic approach, which is quite different from the one that was recommended in the Iraq Study Group, at least in one critical respect."
