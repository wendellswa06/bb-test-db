        "He says we're going to try to engage governments that we believe have an interest in avoiding the collapse and fragmentation of Iraq, presumably including countries like Jordan and Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, and we're going to try to get them to do more than they have thus far to help prevent that from happening.",
        "But at the same time, we're going to be tougher in our approach to those states which we think have been trying, in fact, to encourage that outcome, namely Iran and Syria.",
        "So he's sort of taking half of the all-outs diplomatic, friendly approach suggested in the Iraq Study Group and saying we're going to reach out to friends, but we're going to give a warning to enemies.",
        "Let's see if we can get another caller on the line, and this is Pauline(ph) - Pauline with us on the line from Palo Alto in California.",
        "Yes, hi.",

        "My son is a Marine, and he's slated for a third deployment, possibly next week.",
        "And no one is really talking about is this plausible with the amount of troops that we have and what's happening to our young men and women, and what the ramifications down the road are going to be.",
        "And I am so upset.",
        "And this is what needs to be talked about.",
        "Everybody's talking about the logistics, and that's very reasonable and good, but the fact of the matter is that unless we have a draft, we cannot - this is not going to work with the troops that we have and sending them in like their dish rags or kindling wood, three, four - you know, two, three and four times and then extending their stay.",
        "And my son, I know, with a lot of the other Marines, are just - I mean, they are so traumatized by this, and it is not going to work.",
        "It will not work no matter - and the best-laid plans are going to fail, and it's also, these young men and women are going to come back with a terrible sense of betrayal, which they already feel, you know, from the military, for this country, for - you know, from the president.",
        "And these are - like my son, he went in to serve his country, and they've really soured.",
        "And it's just - it's immoral, unethical and it will not work, and we can't do this.",
        "These are our youths.",
        "They're human beings, and this is my son, and that's what I have to say.",
        "The Secretary of Defense did announce plans to increase the size of the Army permanently by 92,000 - Army and Marines - but that's going to take several years, Aaron Friedberg, and the kind of relief that Pauline is looking for is not going to be the result of that.",
        "That's absolutely true.",
        "And one of the tragedies of this -one of the many tragedies, I think - is that the decision to increase the size of our forces, which perhaps could've been taken shortly after September 11th, has not happened until now.",
        "If we had increased the size of our forces four years ago, we wouldn't be in the position we are now, of trying very hard to scrape together relatively small numbers of troops to send them into this very dangerous situation.",
        "As far as whether it's going to work, I think - I certainly believe that there's a chance that it can.",
        "I think the costs of failing are so large - and of course not only for people in region but in the long run, for the American people, I think - that I do believe that it's a risk that we have to take."
