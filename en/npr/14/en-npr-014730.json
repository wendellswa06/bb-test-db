        "We don't know how much power the new coalition government is going to have.",
        "Its members, though, are talking as if power has genuinely shifted to them because they have such a huge mandate from the public.",
        "They concede that Musharraf does still hold on paper significant powers, such as the right to dissolve parliament itself.",
        "But there would be an uproar here if he tried to exercise that right now.",
        "Also the military, remember, has drawn back from politics in Pakistan now that Musharraf has left as army chief.",
        "So Musharraf can no longer be certain that the military would back him in a confrontation with the government.",
        "So the government's strength is still unknown.",
        "It's going to depend in part on the coalition itself and how united it proves to be.",
        "Its two main parties do have a history of conflict.",
        "And Sharif, in particular, is intent on confrontation with Musharraf, whereas others, especially people in the Pakistan People's Party, appear to be against that.",
        "And in the middle of all this strife, what are the implications for this so-called war on terror?",
        "Broadly speaking, both the main parties who form the coalition government favor a change in emphasis in the approach to handling Islamist militants in the tribal areas of Pakistan, including the Taliban.",
        "They don't rule out military measures altogether, but they believe there should be a greater emphasis on negotiation and on building civil society and integrating the tribal areas into the rest of Pakistan.",
        "Now, how much say this new government will actually have in this area remains to be seen.",
        "Although the army is withdrawn from politics, at least from the front line of politics, there are certain issues, like the war on terror, Afghanistan and, of course, Pakistan's nuclear policy, the military is likely to continue to seek to control.",

        "Although Dolores Huerta has been a prominent figure in the civil rights struggles going back decades, now there is a documentary that seeks to tell her story anew and to cement her place in this country's civil rights and labor history.",
        "In it, we hear from famous feminists voices such as Hillary Clinton and Angela Davis, but we also get a glimpse of just what has made Dolores Huerta a legend among activists.",

        "And the film premiered this weekend at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.",
        "And that's where we caught up with Dolores Huerta.",
        "I started by asking her about what message she had for those who took part in the Park City women's march.",
        "Well, my message was that we have to get back down to basics.",
        "We have to start organizing at the neighborhood level to get people educated to vote.",
        "There's just so many facets, I think, of the ignorance in our society that have to be corrected if we're really going to have a democratic society and a society that is just and that respects all of the members of this society regardless of who they are, what color they may be, what sexual orientation that they have or what gender, you know, they happen to be.",
        "I mentioned earlier that the documentary is written and directed and produced by Peter Bratt, but it's executive produced by the music icon Carlos Santana.",
        "And in the sort of background notes for the film, Peter Bratt describes getting a phone call from Carlos Santana saying we have to make a film about Dolores.",
        "The suggestion was that the filmmakers felt that your role in the building of the farm workers' movement had not been given adequate attention.",
        "The role of women in general on the struggle for farm workers' rights had not been given its due.",
        "Do you feel that way?",

        "And so, you know, that's, I think, the case of many aspects of the civil rights movement where men were really given most of the attention of the work that was being done, even though we had very many women that were at the forefront of the struggle and at the forefront of the movement.",
        "So it's not just the history of the farm workers' movement.",
        "It's the history of our United States of America and general history of many, many organizations.",
        "And so a women's place in history has never been given the attention that it needs to be given, and, again, that's why we have a lot of the misogyny in our society today.",
