        "This spring, companies are just starting to return to work, drilling new wells in the deep waters of the Gulf.",
        "They're doing so under a new regulator and with a lot of new rules governing them.",
        "Now oil companies must prove they can contain an out-of-control well before they start drilling.",
        "NPR's Jeff Brady is among the few reporters who go an up close look at the equipment that's been built for just such an emergency.",
        "Sitting in a gravel lot north of downtown Houston is a shiny new piece of equipment called a capping stack.",
        "Well, it's a big hunk of iron, as you can see.",
        "That's Marty Massey, CEO of the Marine Well Containment Company.",
        "It's about 30-foot tall.",
        "It weighs 100 tons.",
        "The yellow and blue capping stack needs that kind of bulk to withstand the extraordinary pressures in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico.",
        "In an emergency it would be placed over a well to cap it off and then it could divert oil to ships up on the surface.",
        "It's similar to what was used to eventually bring BP's Macondo well under control.",
        "This particular capping stack is part of a temporary system oil companies have put in place.",
        "A permanent one will be finished next year.",
        "The expanded system will be able to handle 100,000 barrels of fluid a day and it can operate in 10,000 feet of water."

        "And the story of how it got started began when Franklin Roosevelt and his Interior Secretary Harold Ickes went to check up on workers at a Civilian Conservation Corps camp who were building a road in the Shenandoah National Park in Virginia.",
        "Roosevelt and a whole entourage - Harold Ickes is with him, Harry Byrd of Virginia, the senator - they all go to inspect the CCC camp in August of 1933.",

        "And that's sort of, if you pinpoint a moment, that's kind of a moment where this idea begins to be possible reality.",

        "If we wanted to make more highway improvements, then the highway users paid for those by increasing fuel taxes.",
