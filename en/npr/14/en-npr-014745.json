        "I think so.",

        "So, I don't think - I think that mercy rule shouldn't have had any effect in there.",

        "But at the same time, the Dallas girls weren't complaining.",
        "They went out there and they kept going.",
        "They did the best that they did.",

        "They haven't won a game in four-plus years.",
        "Should they even be in a league where they are so outclassed athletically?",
        "Well, I don't think you want to deprive the girls of chance to play it all.",
        "So, maybe if you're going to move them into a lower league where, they would have a chance to win, obviously through the same competitive rules.",
        "But it seems like with regards to the reactions, I read where the Dallas Academy athletic director said that he was proud of the girls for never having quit.",
        "It seem like they were - like Erika said, they were - they weren't - they weren't happy with the results, but they weren't disappointed in the girls, everyone kept on trying.",
        "But I did see, they're also, they're also not going to compete with Covenant anymore.",
        "So, I guess that takes some of the sting out.",
        "So, I don't know what the answer is necessarily.",
        "They certainly appeared on, they appeared on one of the morning shows, I think it was ABC.",
        "And they were happy about the effort that they put out and they felt good about themselves, in spite of what their parents and their school may have felt about how the whole thing went down.",
