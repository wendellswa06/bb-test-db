        "I just don't think that he needed to be fired.",
        "If anything, maybe a suspension, some kind of disciplinary action, but, as far as being fired, it was uncalled for.",
        "Well, the argument was that, and I didn't see the game, I've seen clips of it that they ran the score up in the second half.",
        "He said that he took his starters out, but whoever he put in, in the second half of the game, they were still firing up three-balls and still stealing and just running circles around these girls from Dallas Academy.",
        "He still cares about his girls that he wants them to perform as best as they could.",
        "And you know, I'm sure he probably didn't it at that moment, didn't think, you know, these Dallas girls are probably going to feel bad at the end of the game.",
        "You know, it's just for him, it's more like you know, these girls have worked hard, so why not, you know, especially if you took the starters out, let the other girls go in and play their game.",

        "I mean, it's definitely a tough call.",
        "And the coach even said afterwards, you know, obviously, this is not - obviously a result like this shows no compassion, but that's not the case.",
        "You know, we feel, we feel bad about this.",
        "So, it was a bit of a roll reversal, but in terms, in general, I think, I don't know, I think sometimes if the score gets out of hand.",
        "I know, when I was playing, when I was on the high school football team, if the score got - if we were 30-nothing, 36-nothing, then we pretty much called off the dogs.",
        "So, I don't know, if they - I mean, obviously it's a different sport and different circumstances.",
        "So, I don't know, maybe there should be some benchmark but I'd have to agree with Erica.",
        "I don't really see why the coach should have been fired in this situation.",
        "Well, this next and last item isn't about mercy, but you could say, it's about taste and what some see as the lack of taste by an Arkansas High School girls dance team that performed during a basketball game.",
        "A Jonesboro high school team was disbanded.",
        "The coach was removed after the team performed a provocative dance at a basketball game.",

        "Provocative, sluttish, some pretty harsh descriptions, but I suppose there are anybody that's every seen a game, professional or high school where they have these women performing and girls performing, have seen this kind of thing before.",
        "Do you think this went too far?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "At the high school went way too far.",
        "I mean, I watched all six minutes of the video.",
        "And three minutes until you see the chairs come out.",
        "And you know, the lap dancing, you know, starts - that's just too much.",
        "You know what?",
        "They were wearing, I mean, would it have made a difference if they were wearing more clothing, I don't know.",
        "But I mean, the lap dancing just went way too far.",
        "Well, I didn't see them do that.",
        "I saw the video.",
        "They were around the guys.",
        "They never really sat on their - on their laps.",
        "They didn't, that's true.Yes.",
        "That would have been completely, clearly over the line.",
        "My question for you, Chad: You would think somebody approves these dance routines before they are presented to the public, wouldn't you?"

        "Very serious.",

        "It's extraordinary, but what I have observed is really a deep mistrust across the board, particularly between the opposition and the government.",
        "And that mistrust, you know, went beyond what we knew.",
        "We knew Egypt was divided.",
        "It was really clear based on the elections, the first found, the presidency.",

        "The president the second round was very close.",
        "But what we have seen is deepening sense of mistrust, particularly after the constitutional declaration.",
        "And it was kind of interesting because it didn't have to be, it didn't seem to be going in that direction.",
        "In fact if anything, Morsi in the initial few weeks and months seemed to actually gain more support.",
        "And he got approval for a number of things that he did, including getting rid of the head of the military, his initiative in the Sinai, which was very popular, and then his remarkable, you know, mediation of the Gaza War that won him praise from left to right within Egypt and outside.",
        "So it's just the next step that really instead of using that as a way to build a big consensus and legitimacy, moved to consolidate power, and that scared a lot of people.",
        "And you can't miss it.",
        "It's there particularly when you go to Cairo because in fact the bulk of the opposition is in Cairo.",
        "We know that, for example, when the constitutional vote was counted, you know, over 60 percent of roughly 30 percent of the people voting supported it.",
        "But in Cairo particularly, people opposed it, and that, obviously, Cairo is the heart of Egypt.",
        "And what does it also say when the reaction, the response, is so similar to the responses of the previous regime, to declare curfews, states of emergency, to call out the troops, the tanks and then the police?",
        "Well, of course, you know, Egyptians are nothing if not humorous, and you can see all the jokes being cracked already across the board in Egypt and on the Internet and people who are juxtaposing a statement that - you know, a video of a statement that Morsi made before he became president, saying I will not impose martial law, and then obviously speech imposing martial law.",
        "So clearly people are - you know, those who opposed him are opposing him more, and some of those who supported him, clearly because they didn't want his opponent to win, are now having not second thoughts about rejecting his opponent but are now a part of the mainstream opposition.",
        "But let's not rush to judgment on the following point.",
        "We don't know if the - let's assume that there were elections held tomorrow.",
