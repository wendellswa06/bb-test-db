        "The 70-year-old sheriff's career has been subsidized by his remarkable success at seizing drug money off of Interstate 95, which runs through the county, north-south.",
        "Over the past decade and a half, his highway interdiction team has grabbed more than $20 million from drug money couriers.",
        "I have to say Camden County is probably been one of the most successful agencies on the Eastern Seaboard in seizing money belonging to the drug dealers.",
        "With this endowment, he's built a law enforcement empire in this quiet pastoral county, tucked between the Florida border and the Atlantic Ocean.",
        "First, there was the new sheriff's substation.",
        "We spent about $3 million on going in and redoing the whole establishment there, and putting in a 911 center, state of the art, best equipment money can buy.",
        "Then Smith bought vehicles for other county departments and for neighboring law enforcement agencies.",
        "He purchased boats that some wisecrack are his Camden County Navy.",
        "And he created an estimated $600,000 in scholarships.",
        "And we've had quite a few individuals from our department to go and get their associate's degree, their bachelor's degree and master's degrees.",
        "And the purchases got more exotic.",
        "There was the $90,000 Dodge Viper for the sheriff's DARE anti-drug program.",
        "Lieutenant William Terrell opens a trailer parked in the lot behind the substation to reveal the gleaming low-slung sports car.",
        "The year we took this out to Las Vegas for the national DARE convention, it was the number one DARE car in the country",
        "The sheriff spent so much seized drug money that the regional newspaper in Jacksonville, The Florida Times-Union, began to write stories about it - about the quarter million dollars he gave to his alma mater, The Citadel, for a scholarship.",
        "And the $12,000 he gave to the spinal cord center in Atlanta, where his paralytic son had been treated.",
        "But the expenditure that really raised eyebrows the highest was the $50 a week he paid to county jail trustees, the sheriff says, to do public works and to teach them a work ethic.",
        "His chief critic says he used them to build a weekend home called \"\"The Ponderosa."

        "Go for it.",
        "I went to see one of Morsi's advisors where I was there in the presidential palace, and I can tell you, it was kind of striking because as we approached the compound on the road leading to the presidential office, there was a gate, and it was closed, and there was a young man not in uniform standing there.",
        "And he basically said you can't go in here, you have to go all the way around.",
        "So - and then he said: And if you're going to see President Morsi - shouted so everybody could hear him - tell him the people don't want you.",
        "And of course this young man can't speak - he can't know what the people really want.",
        "He's reflective of a mood in the area.",
        "And of course it would not have happened in Mubarak's era because no one would have taken that risk to shout out loud, certainly somebody who's guarding the gate that's leading to the presidential palace.",
        "But when I spoke with the advisor of the president, and I think he was very thoughtful, he was reflective, he was engaging, he listened, and pointed out that, you know, they are trying to deal with the constitutional issue.",
        "They understand some mistakes may have been made.",
        "He pointed out that there was almost two-thirds support for it.",
        "And I said yes, but you don't have Cairo.",
        "He said Cairo is not all of Egypt.",
        "But maybe not, but, you know, to run Egypt, you can't run Egypt without Cairo.",
        "And so it is clear that, you know, the numbers aren't enough here, you know, to run the country, to get the legitimacy, to get the support of the institutions that run the country.",
        "And so there is a genuine crisis that they have to deal with.",
        "Let's bring another voice into the conversation, another of those we turn to to discuss these issues, Rami Khouri, director of the Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy and International Affairs at the American University of Beirut, columnist for the Daily Star newspaper, with us by phone from his home in Beirut.",
        "And Rami, always good to have you on the program, as well.",
        "Thank you, glad to be with you.",
        "And Shibley Telhami just mentioned a critical word: legitimacy.",
        "Is the legitimacy of the government being questioned?",
        "Is it in doubt?",
        "I think it's the credibility and the efficacy of Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood grab for power that is being questioned mostly.",
        "The legitimacy of the presidency I don't think is in doubt, and legitimacy of Morsi is not in doubt because he is, in fact, the first legitimately elected president in modern Egypt.",
        "And he was hailed by the people in Tahrir Square when he went and took his oath of office, symbolically, for them, not just showing that he was legitimately elected but showing that he served the people, that his legitimacy came from the people, from the street.",
        "So I don't think his legitimacy is shot, but it is certainly dented.",
        "And I think the real problem, and you see this all over the region, you see this with Maliki, the prime minister of Iraq who was also legitimately elected, but these people, they have legitimacy because they're popularly elected in a relatively democratic way, but they haven't earned the credibility, the efficacy and the trust and the confidence that they need to govern efficiently."

        "So there's a real crisis, and Morsi had damaged the standing of the presidency, but that will be regained.",
        "It's not shot completely but has been damaged a little bit, it's been dented.",
        "But these institutions in Egypt are very solid.",
        "You know, the judiciary, the presidency, the army, these are powerful, old.",
        "In some ways, you know, they're modern, but they're also ancient in the way that Egypt is an ancient country.",
        "So there's great reliance on these institutions of statehood and nationhood.",
        "So I think it's a balance between legitimacy and credibility, really.",
        "And that other sort of barometer of democracy that we always think about, and Shibley was describing it to some degree in the case of that young man outside the presidential palace, what about freedom of speech?",
        "Well, the interesting thing about Egypt, it reminds me of my days as a student in college in the United States in the 1960s when there was all this anti-war protest.",
        "And, you know, there was probably about, you know, two, three percent of Americans who were out on the streets protesting the war in Vietnam and Cambodia.",
        "But they ultimately ended the war.",
        "They forced the government, Nixon, to pull out of those wars.",
        "So you can't measure popular sentiment by the number of people on the street.",
        "Certainly the people in the street are motivated, they're really angry, they feel betrayed, they feel that they are being subjected to a new form of autocracy and central government control and even thuggery to some extent.",
        "Where is the center of gravity of Egyptian politics, and where is the silent majority?",
        "My guess is that if Morsi were to - if there were an election now, the Muslim Brotherhood would still be the biggest party, like the plurality that was gained by the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamists, the party in Tunisia who got around, say, 40 percent of the vote.",
        "Probably that would be the same, but there's still a core support that the Muslim Brotherhood has that the people on the street demonstrating are really angry, and they will bring down the number of votes that the Muslim Brotherhood gets, but they're still probably the single biggest group.",
        "The real point here is that we have genuine political conversations now in Egypt in the public political sphere.",
        "That's the real historic story.",
        "Whether Morsi stays or goes, if he goes he's going to go through some kind of political process, and that political process is not clear whether it'll be through elections or through - against street confrontations that lead to a political compromise.",
        "There still has to be an election for parliament, which will clarify where the balance of power is.",
        "So there's a lot of things that still have to happen before this transition period settles down, and I think we're looking at another year or two, at least, until we can really see where the center of gravity is.",
        "And the opposition is trying to coordinate and to act more responsibly.",
        "I think the opposition has been pretty amateurish, as Morsi has been.",
        "But you really have an opposition.",
        "They're trying to coordinate more efficiently.",
        "The people in the street are one element, but they're not the single most important element.",
        "And these people in the street are not in every city in Egypt.",
        "So again, we don't want to exaggerate them, but we don't want to underplay them, either."

        "No, as we've seen over the course of the last years, Egypt very quickly went from exhilarating moment of national unity to a deep polarization.",
        "I think that the parliamentary of the fall of 2011 or early winter 2012, and then the presidential elections, are a clear indication that the country was divided and that no one political party was going to be able to impose its political will and political agenda on the others.",
        "And that is the primary reason why we're seeing this political instability, these periodic spasms of violence.",
        "It seems, however, in this case - and really this is a continuation of protests and demonstrations that began in November with Morsi's decree essentially exempting himself from judicial review and exempting the constituent assembly, that was the body that was writing the constitution from judicial review - this is an extension of those demonstrations.",
        "What's worrying is the amount of violence and the threats and the breakdown of central authority in critical parts of the country to the extent that the military has said that it is concerned about state collapse."

        "But more than that, the loss of control of state use of force to stop the violence and the loss of the aura of the state, as I said that's really something - that's why, you know, I see it as an immediate short-term crisis, at least.",
