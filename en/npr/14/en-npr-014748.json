        "Neal, can I just respond to one thing that Shibley said?",
        "Of course.",
        "You know, let me just remind that, you know, two years ago, people were no doubt on your program saying that one could not imagine Hosni Mubarak being forced from office in the same way that Ben Ali did.",
        "I think that certainly there is not an appetite in Egypt for the return of military rule.",
        "However, even well before the political ferment in Egypt, a decade or more ago, the Egyptian military had made it clear that threats to social cohesion and the stability of the state were things that would - regardless of what public opinion might be - would be things that would motivate them to intervene in the political system in some way, shape or form.",
        "They're not eager to get back into the business of politics, but indeed if what we are seeing is a breakdown, and of course it's really limited, as Rami said, we're not looking at an entire country that is in - that is in chaos.",
        "But I think the statement on their Facebook page is a warning to all of these political parties - none of whom have a stomach for the military returning to politics - that the military is at least, at least, considering this and that it remains an option for the military.",
        "And Rami...",
        "Can I just say that just briefly...",
        "I agree that it's possible.",
        "But the point I made was not that it's possible the military may contemplate this, but I just - it simply can't work.",
        "I just think that the public is mobilized to reject this, just as they are mobilized to reject anyone imposing authoritarian rule.",
        "Let me get Rami Khouri back in the conversation, and on this point of the military.",
        "A lot of people thought effectively they were bought off when their privileges, their economic position, was enshrined, and their budget was enshrined in the constitution by the new constitution.",
        "Is this a threat to democracy?",
        "You know, I think one of the things that we've seen across the region, which is very interesting, and some of this comes through in polling that people like Shibley and others have done across the region, generally in recent years, even under the autocratic systems, people had respect for the army."

        "They didn't like the police and the intelligence, because they're the people who beat up people and tortured them, but the army was seen as a force that was protecting the nation and giving people a secure life.",
        "And Egypt's army and the transition period had a lot of respect and legitimacy, and people were getting a little bit antsy after the thing was, you know, was drawn out for over a year.",
        "And they wanted a transition to civilian rule that happened last June, but during the transition, people had a lot of trust for the military, as long as they didn't think the military was going to just repeat the Mubarak and Sadat years and take over everything.",
        "So I think there's a - and there's a great yearning across the region, you know - you hear it in Iraq, you hear it everywhere - that people want stability.",
        "They just want to have a normal life.",
        "They want to be able to go to work and have their kids go to school and come home.",
        "So the military offers this kind of stable situation, maybe revival of economic development.",

        "I don't - I agree with Shibley and Steve.",
        "There's no way that the military would ever come to run the country.",
        "But if there was chaos, if there was more burning and fighting and killing in the streets of Egypt, that's clearly a situation where the military could come back as a very short-term transitional process.",
        "And they - in a way they might repeat the situation, make the mistake they made last time, them and the political system as a whole, which is the mistake they made was to go on with these presidential elections and parliamentary elections and things, before they had a consensus on the constitution.",
        "And that's why there's such a mess in Egypt today, whereas in Tunisia it's a little bit - the rules are a little bit more clear, and the process is a little bit more smooth.",
        "So I think the fundamental problem in Egypt today is that there is no clear constitutional agreement, and we saw it in the referendum today and other things.",
        "So it's really up in the air.",
        "I mean, you might have the military come back, briefly, if there was total chaos on the streets.",
        "Absent that, I think there is no chance for the military to take over.",
        "But they're sending warning signs now, and the real problem in Egypt now, how do we regain the integrity of a political process, where the opposition is not even willing to sit down and have a dialogue with the president.",
        "Both of them have legitimacy of a certain kind, and both of them are acting like rank amateurs, and in some cases, some of them are acting like friends.",
        "So it's a real dilemma for this great country.",
        "And they have to get through it in a political process that is more mature and that is more effective.",
        "People want that in Egypt, but they've never done this before.",
        "You know, none of this people, the opposition, the - President Morsi, the Muslim Brothers, the army, none of these people have ever run a democratic transition.",
        "They don't know beans about, you know, constitutional republicanism.",
        "These are all concepts that mean absolutely nothing to them in practical reality.",
        "They're learning on the job, and it's a tough learning process when you're dealing with the emotions that you have in Egypt and the economic stress and all the problems that they have.",
        "So we have to hope with the best and wish them the best and trust that they will get through this.",
        "Let's get Sal on the line.",
        "Sal is calling us from Los Angeles.",
        "Yes, Neal, I'm a huge fan.",
        "And I want to thank you for having Mr. Khouri, Mr. Telhami and Mr. Cook.",
        "These are the best.",
        "When it comes to that part of the world, they're absolutely best.",
        "My question is: Are we - the West or Europe or the U.S.",
        "- expecting too much, too soon?",
        "Those nations are - have no clue what democracy is, not the same as the Western nations, been decades and decades under oppression.",
        "So it may take time to sort things out.",
        "And I think - and I'm not a fan, or any way of Mr. Morsi, or the new Libyan leadership.",
        "But I think we should give him time.",
        "Perhaps helping the opposition - the more we criticize them, I believe that could backfire.",

        "Well, certainly, this is all new to all of these political actors in Egypt.",
        "I think in response to your caller, transitions from one form of government to another do take time.",
        "It has only been two years since Mubarak's fall.",
        "And Egypt in particular is a country where questions about the kind of government, the kind of society, the relationship between religion and state, none of these issues have ever really been settled.",

        "They have a particularly majoritarian view of politics, and as a result, have resorted to authoritarianism.",

        "Just on the democracy issue, there's no question, you know, everybody is right on this.",
        "You know, it's new.",
        "But, you know, it is interesting to watch the freedom of the press, even though, obviously, there are - many people are worried about measures that the government is putting in place that could limit it.",
        "But the government is very fond of saying that, you know, 75 percent of the press has been critical of the government, and it has been open, and I hope it remains to be open press.",
        "But the problem goes beyond an experiment in democracy.",
        "Remember, the Muslim Brotherhood is the big party right now that is ruling, and they've been a repressed party for 80 years.",
        "They don't really have experts, and that's so obvious in every level.",
        "And given the mistrust of the existing elites, most of whom had to work with the previous regime, they are really struggling at almost every level, from the police, to the bureaucracy, to - everywhere.",
        "They can't - they don't have the well-trained people who have the experience to govern, and they don't trust people from the outside.",
        "It's really a problem for them in the short term.",
        "Steven Cook, let me ask you about another barometer of democracy, and that is the rights of minorities.",
        "And in the Arab context, we have to ask about the rights of women.",
        "Well, these are both issues of considerable concern to Egyptian Copts, Christians, and women in Egypt.",
        "There are members of the Muslim Brotherhood who clearly have retrograde views of these two groups, and it's not just the Muslim Brotherhood.",
        "Even the Muslim Brotherhood, which is relatively open to - in some ways, to women being part of the political system in the life of country, are being pushed by Salafist groups who have very different views of women and Copts and their role in society."
