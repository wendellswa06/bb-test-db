        "But that's not true.",
        "The allegations in general, that Sheriff Smith misused forfeiture money, and in particular, that he used it to pay inmate labor, were serious enough that a federal grand jury in Savannah is now looking into them.",
        "Federal guidelines specify that forfeiture money is to be used strictly for law enforcement purposes.",
        "Smith would not comment on the investigation, except to say all the expenditures were legal, documented, and he can account for every penny.",
        "The accusation that Sheriff Bill Smith used forfeiture funds at his whim is at the heart of wider criticism that there are scant controls over how seized drug money is used.",

        "It's difficult to find the cases in which people say that they had cash effectively robbed from them by officers in highway stops because there are so few challenges to these forfeiture cases - lawyers would say because it's very difficult to challenge and it's expense.",
        "And the police say they're not challenged because people are guilty.",
