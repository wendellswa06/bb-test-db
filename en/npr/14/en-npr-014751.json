        "When can the public start to have access to these films?",
        "Well, they can be - they're available for research now at the Library of Congress, but further work needs to be done because, in fact, even though these were American movies, they all have Russian language intertitles.",
        "So we will conduct further research in not only in our own collection at the Library of Congress, but in archives around the United States to see if we can locate copies of the original scripts and/or what they call cutting continuities to see if we can find the texts of those original American language intertitles.",
        "And in those instances where we do, we will restore them to the films, and eventually, we will begin to showcase these at the library, at the Packard Campus and at other venues.",
        "We will make them available to film festivals and so on, who may want to see these and bring them back to the American public."

        "That's Tim Hanson, a senior analyst with research company The Motley Fool.",
        "He says what happened this year was a total flip of the supply and demand curve.",
        "Six months ago when oil prices were so high, what everybody saw was that we are finding and drilling for fewer and fewer barrels of oil every year as we exhaust proven reserves and that the demand for fuel product is going up very quickly, particularly in places like China and the other emerging economies."

        "And when factories slow down and start making less, you know, we're going to use less energy, and oil prices are going to drop, which on the other end of things causes drilling to slow down a little bit, which maybe in a few years causes oil prices to go back up a little bit.",

        "I talk about something in the book called linked fate, and it's this idea that some academics talk about that says that people of color, black people in particular have done this, make some choices based on the welfare of the entire group and not necessarily their own welfare, right?",
        "So someone like Colin Powell, who is a Republican, calls himself a conservative, and has served under Republican administrations, also is very sensitive about the issue of affirmative action and very sensitive about making policy choices that relate to the welfare of African-Americans in general in this country.",

        "Yeah, and again, it gets to the idea of institutional prejudice and racism and how do you gauge that and how do you judge when it's subsided enough that you don't need programs like affirmative action.",
        "And the other thing that strikes me about affirmative action is that's a blanket name for a lot of different programs and a lot of different ways of trying to squeeze out prejudice and stereotypes from institutions.",
        "So you know, you look at something like the Rooney Rule in the NFL, where they basically ask NFL teams to seriously interview at least one person of color when they have a head coaching job or a major job open in their front office.",
        "And that's been credited with increasing diversity amongst head coaches just because they're pushed to consider people that maybe they normally would not have considered.",
        "And do you equate that with a program where you have quotas, and you say you must hire, you know, 12 percent of a certain type of person?",
        "That, you know, our terms are so imprecise, we have such a hard time talking about this, and one of the things I wanted to do in the book is just pull some of these ideas out into the light, add a little bit of consideration, and really talk about them so that we understand what we're talking about.",
        "Well, it was interesting, me reading the book, that I wondered if there might not be a - well, a lot of criticism - let's not put too fine a point on it - about commentators on Fox News.",
        "But you took care to point to the Trayvon Martin case and an apparent conflict of interest in MSNBC, the left-leaning cable news outfit, where of course this is - you have Al Sharpton, who's a host of an hour-long program there in primetime, but also as we hear here in this clip from Florida, an advocate and a representative of the family of Trayvon Martin.",
