        "But then he turns around and hosts his program from the rally site.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And you know, I've talked about this in the past, and I've talked about this on NPR, and I've written about it.",
        "You know, MSNBC's defense is that all of this is happening out in the open, and everyone knows who Al Sharpton is, everyone knows what his priorities are and what his activities are, and the audience can sort of judge for themselves how they want to deal with the message.",
        "The only thing that - or the main thing that bothers me is that Al Sharpton is the most visible anchor on a cable outlet that still calls itself a cable news channel.",
        "He's the most visible anchor of color, and he's not only not a journalist, he's very much an advocate, leading a civil rights organization that advocates for specific legislation and advocates for specific electoral results.",
        "And you know, that bothers me.",
        "And I've tried to talk about that while at the same way - at the same time I talked about my own tussles with Bill O'Reilly on Fox News Channel.",
        "The book's title comes from the fact that Bill O'Reilly called me a race-baiter on his show years ago for the articles I've written criticizing the way he talks about race, and also talking about conservative voices like Rush Limbaugh and other people on Fox News Channel.",
        "So I tried to look across the spectrum as much as I could while also acknowledging that my viewpoint is probably more friendlier to the liberal side of things, and I'm talking about talking about race in a way that a lot of liberals would find comfortable.",
        "But part of the development of this, you site at the beginning of the book, is a transition from a day when we had three - and we're just talking television here for a moment - three major broadcast networks that tried to appeal to everybody and to transition to a world where we have an atomized media landscape.",
        "Yes, the networks are still the big boys on the block, but there's a zillion cable TV channels, not to mention, well, the Internet.",
        "Exactly.",
        "You know, we have - at one point we had a media universe where the goal was to amass the biggest audience possible.",
        "So the goal was also to avoid anything that might reject parts of that audience.",
        "You were constantly trying to figure out how to put together a presentation that would appeal to everyone.",
        "And of course, you know, TV got criticized for that sometimes, for being too milquetoast, for being - for not taking enough chances.",
        "But now we're in a media environment where you succeed by targeting the biggest niche of viewers or the biggest niche of media consumers.",
        "And I call it in the book the tyranny of the broad niche.",
        "You try to find these slivers of the audience, the biggest slivers that might be interested in whatever type of media you're presenting, and you target them in a way that draws them to you and also encourages them to reject your competitors."

        "It's not - you never see a true representation of my community, I don't think.",
        "And do you see - you see that's true in the news, as well as on, well, reality TV and scripted TV?",
        "I feel it's true in the news.",
        "It depends on the news source, but - and some news sources, like you're talking about some of the cable TV news, I definitely think that they do that.",
        "But I think maybe more reputable news sources don't do it as much.",
        "But definitely on TV, whether it's scripted or reality TV.",

        "And stereotypes, Eric Deggans, well, gay people certainly suffer from that representation, but they're not alone.",
        "No, exactly.",
        "No, they're not, although I would say I think things are changing for the way that gay people are portrayed on television.",
        "And I would suggest a few shows - for example, \"\"The Real L Word\"\" on Showtime is a show that's centered on the lives of lesbian women in an urban city.",
        "And I think you do get to see a lot of shades of how gay people live their lives.",
        "One of the things I've written about recently, and it's not necessarily in this book, but I've written about the modern stereotype on television and scripted programming about gay men, which is that they're all white, they're all middle-class, and they're - when they're shown as couples, there's the one gay man who is more stereotypically a gay caricature, where, you know, a love of theater, very flamboyant, very effeminate, and then there's a type-A gay man who is much more straight-laced, much more conventional.",
        "The Odd Couple\"\" comes out of the closet.",
        "Yeah, has an upper-middle-class job like a lawyer or an architect or something like that.",
        "And we've seen that on the CBS show \"\"Partners,\"\" we've seen that on the ABC show \"\"Modern Family.\"\" We see that on the NBC show \"\"The New Normal,\"\" and that's something that I've encouraged them to get beyond.",
        "But it's a step better than the stereotypes that the caller was talking about.",

        "What do we make of a question like that?",
        "I think it's trying to get at that sentiment that somehow black people remain aggrieved about the oppression they've endured in way that other groups who came here as oppressed minorities did not.",
        "But of course, you know, none of those groups were brought here in chains as slaves.",
        "None of those groups were officially defined as non-humans for hundreds of years in this country.",
        "And those groups didn't have to deal with the brunt of official segregation, legal segregation, legal subjugation - even as late as the 1960s.",
        "So we're talking about a very different circumstance.",
        "And, you know, one of the things I try to talk about in the book is this idea that black and white race difference is, sort of, a special scar in America because of those things.",
        "We have so often defined the struggles over race difference as the struggles between a black culture and white culture and trying to bring those two things into harmony.",
        "Sometimes we lose sight of the fact that there are other groups in this country that also struggle.",
        "I just got a Twitter message from a Muslim who is talking about some of the problems that he faces with stereotyping, and certainly that's an issue.",
        "Hispanic people of varying ethnicities are also dealing with their own special types of prejudice and stereotypes.",
        "But the book does talk a lot about black and white, because I think that's a very special circumstance that America constantly is struggling with.",

        "Did you know that he would later grow up to be an opinion shaper of national importance?",
        "No, I always knew that he was very smart, but I would have never predicted that for myself or for him.",
        "It's interesting, when we try to talk race across racial differences, where does communication tend to break down?",
        "Well, I think in part it's that we haven't yet accepted that members of different racial and ethnic groups often just have different perceptions of racial and ethnic relations.",
        "So, you know, there's academic research and national polls that suggest that on average, black Americans tend to perceive greater racial discrimination in the U.S.",
        "compared to white Americans.",
        "And they - black Americans also tend to perceive less progress towards racial equality than white Americans.",
        "And, you know, there's a couple of reasons for this difference.",
        "On the one hand, I think it's the frames of reference that they're using in making these judgments, that whites tend to make these judgments in relation to how far we've already come, not necessarily seeing what we need to do in the future, whereas blacks tend to see and make these judgments in relation to how far we still have to go.",
        "And, you know, I think oftentimes, you know, kind of parallel to the debates that are on colorblindness and multiculturalism, where whites tend to show a preference for colorblind ideologies, perhaps not understanding why race should matter so much, whereas members of racial and ethnic minority groups tend to prefer more multicultural ideologies, perhaps resonating with their experiences of being seen as different from a white majority.",
        "And so you often hear these differences come out in dialogues between white people and people of color, where whites are essentially saying why can't you accept that I don't see you in terms of color, that race doesn't matter, whereas people of color are saying how can you not see the role that skin color plays in my life, that race does matter.",
        "And they might actually both agree that race shouldn't matter, but they have different views about the current state of affairs.",
        "There's also the reality that those - some white people say if you're not colorblind, you're acting against me."
