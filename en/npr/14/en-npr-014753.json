        "Right, and I think that's what I would see as part of the problem or issue that we currently face in this society is that talking about race is such a taboo topic so that we don't get much practice in doing so and that by broaching the topic of race, it becomes more anxiety-provoking than it perhaps needs to be.",
        "And so it makes us perhaps more likely to respond defensively if someone expresses a view that's different from ours.",
        "So we basically spend our time focusing on how to get our viewpoint across, make sure that we're understood, rather than being open to hearing alternate viewpoints on this issue.",
        "Is there any group anywhere in the world large enough or prosperous enough not to see itself as an aggrieved minority?",
        "Unfortunately, I think any group has the potential to see themselves as aggrieved, or disadvantaged or disempowered in some way.",
        "It depends a lot on the context.",
        "And I think it's useful for us to recognize that any group, or members of any group, can see themselves both as the targets of prejudice and discrimination or perhaps those who engage in prejudice and discrimination against others.",
        "And Eric Deggans - I didn't mean to interrupt, but I was going to say, part of what you write about in your book is the fact that some people seem to be playing on these perceptions, well, to increase profits, not to put too fine a point on it.",
        "Yeah, exactly, and I wanted to point out a couple of things.",
        "Number one, I hate the idea that discussion about race is focused on this idea of aggrieved minority status, because I think one of the things that people of color react to when other people say well I don't see color, is this idea that, you know, we're proud of our culture, and we're proud of the things about our ethnicity that make us who we are.",
        "And we don't see that as being aggrieved.",
        "We see that as sort of fully inhabiting who we are, and so I think part of the struggle is to have a discussion where our differences are valued, and our differences are appreciated and savored, and not seen as some platform where we can fight with each other.",
        "The other thing here is that we're trying, also delicately, to talk about white privilege.",
        "And this idea that white people do have a culture and white people in America do have a culture.",
        "And they have to acknowledge and talk about that in a way that's constructive while also not raising it up above other ethnicities and other cultures.",
        "So the struggle is to say, hey white folks, you do have a culture, and it's not racist or prejudiced to acknowledge that and talk about it.",
        "It's just that we all have to figure out a way to, sort of, value what's special about each other while not subjugating or downplaying what other people are about and what makes them special.",
        "Let's get another caller in, this is Keith(ph) and Keith with us from Sacramento.",

        "I think the - I mean, there's plenty coverage about us on the media, but I don't see enough showing whites in poverty, you know.",
        "There's plenty of people in that situation, but, you know, even on NPR there was a segment this week where you were talking about people in different classes and how they got there.",
        "And the NPR focused on three minorities.",
        "I think a couple of them are immigrants.",
        "I mean, \"\"Honey Boo Boo\"\" might be the only show that's seen on network covering families in that situation, but...",
        "Oh boy, that's troubling.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "I'll tell you that right now.",
        "But - and it also sounds like, you know, you may have been thumbing through my book because there's a whole chapter on how poverty is under-covered by the media, and I totally agree with you in what you're saying.",
        "And, you know, I was asked at a recent presentation about the book if there's some things that - some disadvantages that white people have that I could talk about.",
        "And I think one of them is the fact that I think the white working poor and the white poor often get overlooked.",
        "Thank ya'll.",
        "You know, when we talk about poverty, we often talk about it in racial terms, and we talk about people of color in that context.",
        "One of the things that we don't do enough, I think, is talk about the white poor and the things that they go through, as well, with stereotyping and prejudice, because race is often used as a shorthand for class, anyway."

        "So a lot of the negatives that are classically attributed to people of color are often classically attributed to the poor.",

        "OK, thank you.",
        "Here's an email from Linda(ph) in Brooklyn: The best picture of race relations today was on \"\"The Daily Show,\"\" when Jon Stewart was talking to the senior black correspondent Larry Wilmore.",
        "They both swore to have a serious talk about race.",
        "They tried very hard, but it ended up talking about sports.",
        "Even though it was probably scripted, they did a very good job of personifying our discomfort.",
        "And that discomfort, Linda Tropp, it extends to all levels.",
        "Yeah, I think it does.",
        "And I have to say, I think it becomes more uncomfortable the less we do it.",
        "The more we actually give ourselves opportunities to engage in those types of discussions and really accept, from the get-go, that we're not likely to agree on everything, we're not likely to have the same views on everything, I think that can actually help to reduce the anxiety that we have approaching these types of discussions.",
        "And so what I think we really need to do is use that as a strategy, saying, you know, some degree of anxiety is going to be natural to help reduce people's defensiveness and help them, you know, help them to construct situations where they feel and can trust that they're going to be heard and listened to so that they might, in turn, be willing to listen and acknowledge other points of view.",
        "Let's go next to Cynthia(ph), Cynthia on the line with us from Jacksonville.",
        "Hi.",
        "I just came from Obama - Michelle Obama's speech in Jacksonville, and we waited in line for a long time.",
        "And I'm white, but the majority of people were black.",
        "I would say probably 80 to 85 percent were black.",
        "And when we got inside, we were standing, waiting, waiting, waiting.",
        "And they brought in a group of people that apparently had been out there to sit on the stage behind where Michelle Obama was going to speak.",
        "But the group behind her did not look like the audience.",
        "They had apparently, in my opinion, kicked out people that look like America.",
        "In other words, it was very diverse.",
        "It wasn't 80 percent black back there.",
        "And so I thought how odd that they want to show, they want to give the impression that the support is equal for all races, which I suppose there's a reason for that strategically.",
        "But I - it just struck me as very calculating, and I wondered if you have any thoughts on that."

        "I guess I'm naive.",
        "I kind of was surprised they did that.",
        "Well, what I will tell you - and one of the messages of the book - is that media messages are almost always, at that level, very highly thought about and manipulated and controlled.",
        "Even when you talk about something like a reality TV show that - where there's supposed to be some level of unpredictability, they're supposed to be showing real life in some sense, all of those images are very closely controlled and manipulated.",
        "So when you see a political rally on television or even when you attend one, the background behind the candidate has been very carefully selected because they know those images are going to go beyond that community where that person is talking and reach the entire world.",
        "I'm surprised to hear so many black people were at this rally in Jacksonville because, you know, Jacksonville is not predominantly black as a city.",
        "So I wonder if it wasn't located somewhere where that tilted the mix of people.",
        "I know in Florida, there's - you know, obviously, the president has a huge amount of African-American support, but he also has a lot of support in other ethnic groups as well.",
        "So I'm curious as to why that particular rally was weighted that way because we haven't seen that kind of mix, for example, in rallies here in the Tampa Bay area in Tampa, St. Petersburg and Sarasota.",
