        "It was so bad that you had to have the street lights turned on at noon in downtown Pittsburg a number of days during the winter and the fall.",
        "So even though - I know sometimes white people can feel like black people or people of color have the ability to initiate conversations about race that they can't do without fear of being called racist.",
        "And, you know, one of the things I want to say is nobody owns these subjects.",
        "You know, white people, you have, as I said, you have a culture, and you should be able to talk about this as well as anyone, as long as you do it with sensitivity and an open heart.",
        "Well, that's what I was trying to do, was talk about white privilege...",
        "Yeah.",

        "I just - I really want to follow up on this point that Eric's making that no one owns this type of dialogue on race, and this is something that comes up often.",
        "I teach an undergraduate course on prejudice, and I often find that students of color in my class feel very ready to enter into discussions and the white students in my class are very concerned about saying the wrong thing.",
        "And so one of the things that I found that I do, and I think this is also common practice in interracial dialogue programs, is to basically set ground rules for those types of discussions and try to help people feel confident and be able to trust that everyone has something legitimate and valuable to say about race because we all live in a society obsessed with race.",
        "We may not necessarily all agree or have the same views, but we all at least have the right to have our own views and to express them.",
        "And it often helps move that dialogue further."

        "This one sent bulk shipments across the country, including 14,000 doses of the potentially tainted steroids to 23 states.",

        "One of the distressing things in your reporting, nothing to do with your reporting, is we learn that this is a very slow developing infection.",
        "You can develop an illness months after you've gotten the shot.",
        "Yeah, that makes it very difficult for patients and doctors to know when we're out of the woods.",

        "It can't come any too soon, can it?",
        "Yeah, but I mean after November 8, then that - we'll be mostly out of danger, but there still could be cases because, as you say, it's slow-growing, people respond differently, people may have had different doses of the fungus in whatever they got.",
        "And back a decade ago or so, there was another case, very similar to this one, involving many smaller people and - a smaller number of people in North Carolina.",
        "And they were seeing cases as long as five months after the exposure.",
        "So it could drag on.",
        "But the main bulk of cases should taper off maybe around Thanksgiving or so.",

        "Doctors have to make judgments about when a patient should get a spinal tap to see whether there's any evidence of infection, and that's not a casual procedure.",

        "And so I just wondered: Is there a danger in that regard?",

        "And they're among these 328 known cases so far.",
        "But, of course, those all resulted from patients who got injections of the drug from - the steroid from this company.",

        "There shouldn't be anybody getting any steroid from this company.",
        "You know, that's not to say there aren't any risks out there that was don't know about, but I think it's - if you're looking ahead, you probably are pretty safe.",

        "But clearly there were multiple problems.",

        "Yes, they would have had the authority to go in.",
