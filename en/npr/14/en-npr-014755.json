        "And then also why aren't they, you know, having like a recall notice going out to all the patients so they know hey, you may have received a bad dosage of this thing, so be aware of, you know, any - because like you're saying, it can take six weeks to get this onset.",
        "And if you had something a month, where you're having headaches and a stiff neck, how would you know?",
        "Yeah, that's been a big problem.",
        "Well, there is, as of this week, I think yesterday, I believe, the FDA has posted on its website, and you can get it, a list of all of the doctors and clinics and hospitals that received drugs from New England Compounding Center and the drugs that they did get, it's like 300-and-some pages long, it's, you know, thousands of drugs.",
        "I don't think there's any practical way for the government to know the names of the patients who got the drugs.",
        "I think they have to go through the doctor who prescribed it and, you know, the hospital or clinic that gave it.",
        "But they are saying that - go ahead.",
        "No, I was going to say, I mean, at that point you would think that the physicians would then in turn, you know, find out who, who received steroid injections during this, you know, couple-month period or whatever it was that these tainted batches were released out and then notify their patients.",
        "...can I tarry forth?",
        "Toad stool.",
        "But, you know, I'm not sure if that's something that's being done or, you know, maybe this kind of opens the door for a good procedure or a process for medications and keeping track of patients who are taking these medications because you never know.",
        "I mean, the next bad batch could come out from, you know, an FDA-approved piece that all of a sudden has a bad, you know, whatever's wrong with it.",

        "Compounding pharmacies fall into a very gray area in terms of regulation.",
        "So in that regard they're not unusual.",
        "But certainly we don't have many examples of compounding pharmacies with this level of fungal contamination, and certainly not with this many people that are sick and who have died.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "And so it's a - these are several of them, at least, that are pretty fair-sized manufacturers?",
        "That's a loaded word, but that's what they are?",
        "When you're Pfizer, Merck or one of the big drug companies, and you want to build a drug plant, it's registered with the FDA, and the FDA inspects it in advance.",

        "For a compounding pharmacy, I can't answer your question because we don't know exactly how many compounding pharmacies are shipping large quantities across state lines.",
        "So there's a gap in regulation that allows them to do this?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "The FDA in 1992 began to expand regulation of compounding pharmacies, and the pharmacies responded, and they were able to get a law passed by Congress in 1997 which kind of channeled the FDA's ability.",
        "But that law itself was challenged, went all the way to the Supreme Court.",
        "A pharmacy who didn't like the law challenged it.",
        "And in 2002, the Supreme Court effectively struck down the entire law.",
        "Since then, the FDA has been on fairly uncertain ground when it comes to trying to aggressively identify, in advance of a problem, compounding pharmacies that are violating the law.",
        "And so there - you would think that these compounding pharmacies were primarily neighborhood operations with - well, this particular patient has an allergy to the preservative that's in this eye medication, can you make up a special batch?",

        "But the New England Compounding Center was required by FDA rules to make something that was slightly different, and so what they did, amazingly, is that they left out the preservative.",
        "The preservative was left out so they could say it was a different product designed for patients who had perhaps an allergy to the alcohol used as a preservative.",
        "But in retrospect, keeping a preservative out of this drug was a very bad move.",
        "Richard?",
        "I'm sorry, I just wanted to add a point of information here on that very thing.",
        "I think Professor Outterson is exactly right that when you're leaving a preservative out of something, then you have especially stringent need to make sure that it's sterile because there isn't any preservative there to, you know, preserve sterility.",
        "However, I'm told that the reason that they leave preservative out of drugs that are in steroids in particular, that are intended to be injected into the spine, is that the preservatives that are used in the commercially available products can be toxic to nerve cells, and so that's why there's a special demand for preservative-free methoprednisone.",
        "Let me ask another question, though, about procedure.",
        "Sterility, we think you boil it in water for a few minutes, it should be fine.",
        "It's apparently a lot more complicated than that.",
        "You were describing, Richard, these clean rooms where these preparations are compounded.",
        "And they pulled back, despite the investigator's suggestion, you know, recommendation to file a consent decree, and we really don't know much about the political lobbying effort that went on behind the scenes on that.",

        "shot him in the chest.",
        "Yes, I mean if you - these fungi are out in the environment, I mean although it's extremely rare to have it cause human infection.",
        "They are out in the dirt in the grasses and so on, and so a spore can be carried into a room, and it can be - you know, obviously they're invisible.",
        "They can multiple.",
        "They can get - contaminate the equipment, the people involved.",
        "And so you have to be really very stringent to keep that from happening and to make sure that you know if it's happening so that you can, you know, stop and clean everything up."

        "The Massachusetts Interim Report had some very interesting details on this.",
        "It appears that there's not a good record of these particular batches being sterilized for the full period of time that's indicated by the pharmacy regulations.",
        "And when they began the actual physical inspection of the pharmacy, when they went out there - I'll have to look at the date - they found employees cleaning things and a strong smell of bleach, indicating that the company was trying to clean things up, you know, because the inspectors were on the way.",
        "The other thing that's safe here or that relates to safety is in addition to sterilizing, they're supposed to take an adequate number of samples from each batch and send it to an independent laboratory.",
        "And the Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that apparently this batch, or at least one of them, went to the Analytic Research Laboratories in Oklahoma City, but a very inadequate number of samples were tested out of the batch, statistically not nearly enough to establish that the whole batch was actually safe.",

        "There's an email on a similar point, Anthony, this from Judy in Boise: I'm concerned that all compounding pharmacies will be mistrusted after this terrible episode.",
        "We have here in Boise at least two locally owned, highly professional compounding pharmacies that fill individual prescriptions and are invaluable, as I know from personal experience with a healing compound after surgery for skin cancer and a medication compounded for a pet dog.",
        "And so should, Kevin Outterson, all compounding pharmacies be tainted with the New England Compounding Center's brush?",
        "I think most Americans before a couple weeks had never heard of a compounding pharmacy.",
        "So really it's quite unfortunate that the entire industry is being tainted by what happened at NECC.",
        "I don't think that anyone in Congress is considering regulating at the federal level the traditional, local compounding of drugs.",
        "So while it's a public relations disaster of the first order of magnitude for the entire industry, I think your caller and the email, it's unlikely that the FDA wants to really get involved in that local type of business.",
        "Richard, though, it's fair to say that there is an industry lobbying group which has been active in working against the approval of regulations that might cover the industry."
