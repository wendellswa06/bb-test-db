        "Yeah, and I think we're going to see a lot of lobbying as this goes forward.",
        "I do think it's - let me just make one point about compounding pharmacies, because as Kevin says, you know, until recently nobody knew about them.",
        "You get a drug that's prescribed by your doctor, you think, well, it must be good, it must have gone through all kinds of usual regulation, I can trust it.",
        "The compounding pharmacies are a pretty wide spectrum of operations.",
        "Many, many hospitals do, you know, compound drugs.",
        "Some pharmacies out there make up drugs to order for particular patients and particular needs, and there are many firms like this one in Park City that are, you know, perfectly respectable and conscientious and important firms.",
        "Hospitals and doctors rely on these places to provide a fairly substantial fraction of drugs, and often they're critical drugs for patients who need to have special compounding.",
        "So it would be really unfortunate if all this led to, you know, obstructions of that necessary process.",
        "But obviously the industry, you know, trade organizations, can be expected to fight federal regulation, which imposes a lot more strict standards and processes and procedures that would be onerous for a lot of their members.",
        "Anthony, might it be reasonable for compounding pharmacies like yours to avoid regulations, to say, well, OK, then we will not ship across state lines?",
        "Well, I think that another point that goes hand-in-hand with all this is the difference between sterile compounding, where there's a medication being injected directly into the bloodstream, versus a non-sterile, like a topical cream or something that's ingested or a suppository, things along those lines, where the risk factors are much lower.",
        "And a lot of these small compounders don't deal with sterile medication.",
        "They intentionally forego that and deal with other types of applications.",
        "And I think that's an important distinction to be made; also, of course, only preparing compounds per a doctor's prescriptive order and not doing what these guys in New England were doing.",
        "I understand.",
        "And Kevin Outterson, that's already supposed to be in the rules, but might these other restrictions that might be common sense, if you want to be a compounding pharmacy, don't ship across state lines and don't try to make sterile medicines?",
        "Yeah, I think the problem for...",
        "Excuse me, I was asking Kevin Outterson, forgive me."

        "Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "That's OK.",
        "I'm sure that's on the menu in Congress, you know, probably after the election, to take a good look at this and look at those choices.",
        "But lobbying also affected a lot of things that happened in the past, and so this very pharmacy in Massachusetts, NECC, the compounding pharmacy, for the exact drug that we're talking about, there was a series of regulatory actions taken by the State Board of Pharmacy in 2002 and 2006, when Mitt Romney was governor, which decided not to file a consent decree, which would have caused a lot of scrutiny of this pharmacy.",
        "At the rate things are going, you could definitely come out with a second volume.",
        "We also have, you know, publicly reported as well the donations from one of the owners of this pharmacy in a fundraiser not that long ago for Senator Scott Brown at one of the owner's houses.",
        "So there's just a lot of, you know, politics that goes into regulating an industry like this.",
        "But I think after this outbreak, it's going to be very difficult for them to have political lobbying as usual.",
        "It's going to be a different ballgame in Congress.",
        "Richard Knox, I think it's also fair to say that the Obama administration, during the Obama administration there had been some thought of regulation affecting compounding pharmacies but backed off for fear of raising the cost of drugs.",
        "I hear that.",
        "I haven't reported that directly, so I don't know that whole story.",
        "I do find that one interesting aspect of all this is that people seem to be, including government officials, seem to be surprised, at least in public, that there was this pharmacy shipping in such bulk and, you know, nationally, basically.",
        "But that really shouldn't be any surprise.",
        "They've been doing it for years.",
        "They've been doing it in broad daylight.",
        "They market their product at meetings.",
        "I think people in the pharmacy business know that there are these companies out there.",
        "So it really shouldn't have come as any surprise that this was happening.",
        "And I think that one of the big questions now is whether the states can realistically regulate companies that are engaged in that kind of business.",
        "I mean many state pharmacy boards, I'm told, don't even have their own staff of inspectors.",
        "They share inspectors with the cosmetology and the barbers and the, you know, contractors and stuff.",
        "This is a pretty specialized and highly technical realm, and if you're going to regulate carefully and appropriately, it requires more expertise than many states, and more personnel, than many states have."

        "And then I'm also wondering if the people running this pharmacy might be - they might face criminal charges.",
        "That's it.",
        "On that first point, Richard, I've read, I think, in your reporting, most of the people taking these injections tended to be older.",
        "I don't know about compromised immune systems.",
        "Yes, there's a lot we don't know about the population involved, both who died and those who got seriously ill.",
        "I think probably it's a good bet that many of them were older.",
        "But I don't think all of them were.",
        "I think the first case was a man in his 50s who died.",
        "His case report was published in the New Journal - by the New England Journal last week, and it makes for very grim reading, just massive destruction of brain tissue and both hemorrhagic and strokes and strokes caused by blood clots.",
        "It was just really a mess.",
        "And so I don't think we can assume it was only older people with compromised immunity.",
        "And Kevin Outterson, on criminal charges - I know you're a professor of health law, but maybe you can help us out here.",
        "If I could say something briefly about the case report in the New England Journal, the 50-year-old man was there for back pain, and he was not taking any, you know, immune drugs whatsoever.",
        "His immune system was normal and healthy in the report.",
        "An interesting thing is that the medical literature is unable to support, is unable to find any clear evidence of efficacy of using these types of steroid drugs to eliminate back pain.",
        "It's been a controversy for 15 years in the literature, and there was a report in the New England Journal in 1991, and dozens of studies since then, unable to find, you know, efficacy for this procedure.",
        "So it's - one of the other tragedies of this is that these people have died doing a process that may or may not have helped them at all for their underlying back pain.",
        "As for criminal charges, it will require, obviously, evidence of intent.",
        "But the fact that when the Massachusetts investigators arrived in late September out at the plant, they found them trying to clean things up with bleach, I think will - may be able to show some intent on behalf of the owners to hide what had happened."
