        "They said, you don't have the right to a speedy trial.",
        "And I said, Okay.",
        "And then I filed the lawsuit.",
        "The suit was filed in Swift's name in Seattle, Washington, Swift's legal residence because he lived there when he enlisted in the JAG Corps nine years earlier.",
        "But neither Swift nor Katyal was licensed to practice law there.",
        "And they needed a local lawyer to file the suit.",

        "The former student now worked at one of Seattle's leading law firms, Perkins Coie.",
        "By evening, the managing partner was on the phone pledging major help, including partners who would continue to work on the case for the next three years.",
        "The defense team by then had settled on Hamdan's case as the best one to use to challenge the military tribunals.",
        "Commander Swift focused on Hamdan after watching a documentary about the Nuremberg trials in which he noticed that Hitler's driver was not prosecuted as a war criminal.",
        "They didn't prosecute him.",
        "They interviewed him.",
        "In the law of war, the idea is to charge the principals, not the foot soldiers, unless of course, they are shooting civilians on a battlefield, lining them up.",
        "Yes, says Neil Katyal, the defense lawyers knew they would take a PR hit for defending Osama Bin Laden's driver, but -",
        "Hamdan stood out as being the one who had done nothing bad himself besides being the driver to a bad guy.",
        "A lot of the other individuals had actually picked up guns, shot people and the like.",
        "As the months dragged on though, Hamdan, who remained in solitary confinement, went into a spiral of depression, refusing to eat or drink.",

        "While all this was going on, the Supreme Court announced it would decide whether the other detainees at Guantanamo - not those charged as war criminals - had a right to challenge their detention in court.",
        "The Hamdan lawyers saw this as an opportunity and they notified their superiors of their intention to file a friend of the court brief in the regular detainees' case unless ordered not to.",
        "The letter was CC'ed to their civilian lawyer, Neal Katyal.",
        "Our fear at the time was they could shut this brief down and the world wouldn't know about it and so the CC to me was designed to make sure that there would be some repercussions if they decided to gag the lawyers.",
        "According to Bush administration sources, there was a desire to veto the brief.",
        "But White House officials finally decided it wasn't worth the hit they would take in the press, and the brief was filed with much accompanying publicity.",

        "In June of 2004, the Supreme Court ruled that the detainees could go to federal court to challenge their detention.",
        "And for technical reasons, the Hamdan case was moved back to D.C.",

        "The victory for the defense, however, was short lived.",

        "In response, what the government did was change some of the rules to make them on paper look a bit fairer to Mr. Hamdan and then told the Supreme Court, don't hear this case in legal filing because we've changed the rules now to make them better.",
        "Katyal then wrote a reply brief contending that these very changes proved his point that the rules were not rules at all, but an ever moving target, a system completely at the whim of the president.",
        "Pittsburgh has come a long way from the early post-war years when it produced half the country's steel and a lot of its soot.",
        "In November, the Supreme Court announced it would Hamdan's case and three days later, Arizona Senator Jon Kyl introduced and immediately won passage of a bill he had prepared with White House help to strip the courts of jurisdiction in these cases.",

        "Lawyer Tom Goldstein worked on the case.",

        "And stay alive it did.",
        "In the months that followed, Katyal, who had never argued a Supreme Court case before, would devote thousands of hours to preparation.",
        "He made a list of the lawyers across the country who intimidated him the most and flew out to do dry runs in front of them.",
        "In all, he did 15 moot courts, working with as many as 1000 other lawyers.",
        "He coordinated some 40 friend of the court briefs filed by retired military officers, diplomats, human-rights groups and conservative as well as liberal legal scholars.",
        "And he honed his own arguments, resolving much conflicting advice he got from all over the country.",
