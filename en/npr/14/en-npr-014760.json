        "And several of these governments have fallen.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "I've talked to some of them, and they are really scary people.",
        "And it was very much - it was the most worrisome aspect of the Greek elections.",
        "They went from something like a totally negligible .29 in the last elections to seven percent.",
        "But the latest polls in Greece are showing a drop in popularity in Golden Dawn, and Greek analysts are saying that the vote for Golden Dawn was the real protest vote, while the vote for Syriza, the radical left coalition, is seen by a growing number of Greeks as the only viable alternative."
