        "They are hoping - they are trying to present themselves now as the real alternative to save Greece, to save Greece from leaving the euro and trying to form some kind of coalition with other fringe, small, centrist or center-right parties that are - were all in favor of the terms of the bailout.",
        "The voters voted overwhelmingly against austerity.",
        "We'll have to see what the climate of fear, of sense of self-confidence that Greeks will have in three weeks from now, 20 days from now, when they vote again to see exactly which way it could go.",
        "But again, it could be a problem of numbers and of forming the government again.",

        "Thank you for having me.",
        "And we keep hearing the Greeks overwhelmingly in favor of keeping the euro, and now we find also they are overwhelmingly opposed to further austerity.",
        "Are these two things mutually exclusive?",
        "Well, they'd like to put them together, you're absolutely right.",
        "The Greek people, over 70 percent say we want to remain in the euro.",
        "And two-thirds of them say we absolutely cannot stand these austerity measures.",

        "We've seen it a lot.",
        "In fact, if you can remember back to the 1970s, it seemed like one Latin American country after another was defaulting on something; other crises in the late '90s; you know, the Mexican bailout of the peso crisis, which was so famously or perhaps infamously solved by Robert Ruben and Larry Summers, and then of course a variety of Asian currency and debt crises.",
        "So it's not like in this particular moment that Greece has invented the notion of crisis.",
        "They may have invented Western civilization, but not financial crises.",
        "In the meantime, if this is inevitable, though, that follow-on effect, that could be pretty serious."

        "Yeah, I mean I think we do have to put this in the context of an extremely fragile global financial market psychology, for lack of a better word, that has really not dissipated since the fall of 2008.",
        "And it's one of the reasons why what would otherwise appear to be manageable issues - Greece is a $300 billion economy, certainly not tiny but about the size of the state of Maryland - there are 11 million people in Greece - I think these facts are well-known, but they bear repeating.",
        "And yes, the concern is that Greece as a domino or as a metaphor for the viability, or lack thereof, of the European system, is what sends global markets into such a tizzy.",
        "But like any other thing, it requires a certain psychology for those dominos to be seen as falling.",
        "You know, we can always spin Armageddon scenarios at almost any period of time of if, if, if and if, then things completely fall apart.",
        "And I think right now markets and to some degree the political class is gripped in a world where those fears seem much more viable and much more real and much more probable than any actual solutions.",
        "Sylvia Poggioli, there in Rome, are the political elites taking council of their fears?",
        "Well, you know, you have, as I said before, there's Prime Minister Mario Monti, who, since he came into power after - when the Berlusconi government had - basically was pushed out, he took over, and he also had to introduce a very stiff austerity.",
        "But he has always been in favor of balancing that with more growth, and he has many times taken to task also German Chancellor Angela Merkel for not accepting - being so rigid in her austerity first policies.",
        "Definitely both the Hollande victory in France and the other elections we've been talking about have given much hope to politicians like Mario Monti that something could be changed.",
        "I think this is certainly going to be one of the major topics at the G8 in the U.S.",
        "starting this weekend, where Greece will be again center-stage, and I think there's going to be an awful lot of pressure on Germany to start to promote more stimulus.",
        "Already Mario Draghi, the head, the director of the European Central Bank, has been also pushing more for growth, and as you said, Neal, I think Chancellor Merkel is beginning to soften.",
        "Perhaps she's beginning to start to blink first.",
        "Heather Conley, if Chancellor Merkel wants to blink twice, she's going to have to go before the Bundestag, the German parliament, and ask for money to essentially bail out Greece, an unpopular move.",
        "You're absolutely right.",
        "She's already begun to blink.",
        "When Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande met yesterday, although the body language was stiff and certainly made clear that Greece needed to continue its austerity measures, she's already signaling, yes, of course we will look at growth.",
        "The question is how they're going to do that, whether they're going to negotiate a new growth pact.",
        "And again, the devil here is in the details.",
        "And as much as Hollande's victory certainly strengthens Mario Monti's call, clarion call for growth, where is this growth coming from?",
