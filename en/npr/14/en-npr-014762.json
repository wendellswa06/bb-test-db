        "And as you remember, there was a much more acute - or at least we'll see if it was, in fact, much more acute than what's going on now - crisis at the end of November of last year that led to an agreement or a consensus amongst the leading European nations that indeed there had to be a rejiggering, a renegotiation of this entire compact of the EU that would include much more coordinated financial policies.",
        "And everyone has talked about the great failing, supposedly, of the EU is that it was, you know, fiscal union - monetary union without fiscal governance and no transfer payments, like the way we would in the United States be able to -basically New York tax dollars go to help unemployment benefits in...",
