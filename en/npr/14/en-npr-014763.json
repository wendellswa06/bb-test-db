        "We begin with Dana Priest, a correspondent for the Washington Post, who joins us from her office here in Washington.",

        "Congratulations.",
        "Nice to have you back on the program.",
        "Thank you, Neal.",
        "Glad to be here.",
        "Director of Central Intelligence used to be a pretty grand sounding title, but said less in reality than it did on paper.",
        "Well, it was suppose to organize the 15 intelligence agencies together, and sort of coordinate them and cut out duplication.",
        "That same person happened to wear the hat as the director of the CIA, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the premier spy organization.",
        "And you're right, that didn't work very well.",
        "That's one of the things that the 9/11 Commission pointed out and wanted to separate that.",
        "What that has meant for the CIA, that we see today, is a pared down mission, as you suggested.",
        "The main job now is supposed to be what they call HUMINT, human intelligence.",
        "What that really means is using human beings to collect intelligence, spies.",
        "And that is, everyone agrees, the toughest job that the intelligence community has.",
        "Now if you bring General Hayden, the nominee into the equation, he is not a HUMINT guy.",
        "He's a SIGINT guy.",
        "And that is signals intelligence.",
        "He ran the National Security Agency, which is responsible for collecting information using, basically, technology.",
        "Eavesdropping, spy platforms, that sort of thing, but not human intelligence.",
        "And I think that'll be, for those in the intelligence community, that'll be a big question mark for him.",
        "Does he know what we're about?",
        "He also comes in a military uniform, and they tend to see the world in a more black and white way than many spies would say they are brought up to live.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "That gray world that we become -- I guess we only become accustom to it in espionage novels.",
        "Exactly.",
        "But nevertheless, we see a little bit more gray areas there.",
        "Interestingly, Porter Goss left after -- well, during his tenure there was, a lot of people left the Central Intelligence Agency.",
        "There was almost a cull of some senior officers there.",
        "Was that in part what he was there to do?",
        "I do think that the White House sent Porter Goss, a loyal Republican who had chaired the Intelligence Committee in the House, over to the CIA to conduct a sort of political purge.",
        "The White House believed that the CIA was at war with the White House over the Iraq issue.",
        "I think, you know, there may have been some people who were upset about how that worked out.",
        "But in general, I think, it was seen as a misperception of what the agency is all about.",
        "If you give them a different opinion on a subject doesn't mean that you're necessarily a Democrat or a Republican.",
        "It just means that you don't agree with how they might see the issue.",
        "What happened in Goss's case is he unleashed a group of staffers that he brought over on Capitol Hill, who were rather brusque in their manner.",
        "And according to CIA people who worked there at the time, did not appreciate what they did, did not even really like the culture there, and really got crossways with some of them, including the head of the Clandestine Service at the time, who quit rather than carry out what he considered to be an unfair request.",
        "And then his deputy quit.",
        "And then after that you saw an exodus of probably over 20.",
        "And then, if you go down lower in the ranks, many more people who left because they didn't like that attitude, thought they'd been dissed, and not appreciated for the difficult work that they do.",
        "And according to some, this is the best and brightest, an entire generation, who have left.",
        "And in the opinion of others, this is a whole raft of dead wood that had to be gotten rid off."

        "Well, if you take the opinion that it's dead wood, you'd be hard pressed to prove it, since one of the things that the Director of National Intelligence, John Negroponte, did today was to say that the leading candidate, as Hayden's number two, is the man who I just mentioned who left because he refused to carry out one of the orders given by Goss's underlings.",
        "And that would be Steven Kappes, who headed the Clandestine Service branch of the CIA until November of '04, one month after Goss got there, and who left.",
        "And so, he's now being talked about as a possible number two for Negroponte, which is going to send a very warm signal to people in the agency that they do understand the value of experience, because Mr. Kappes had a lot of experience.",

        "Sure.",
        "When you start looking at the people that are leaving and the various approaches they take, it feels like the White House, the executive branch, is narrowing any kind of dissent, or plurality of thinking, down to just the people who think the way they think.",
        "And that the president is coming in contact with fewer and fewer people on a daily basis.",
        "What's your thinking about that?",
        "Dana Priest?",
        "I have to explain that we're talking with Gregory Treverton at Rand Corporation and Mark Riebling, author of Wedge: From Pearl Harbor to 9/11: How the Secret War Between the FBI and CIA Has Endangered National Security, and that you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And Sam, if you'd go ahead.",
        "That was a movie called \"\"Still Crazy\"\" in which I played another rock 'n' roll idiot and I...",
        "I do think that's the charge, but I think that with the appointment of Hayden, and if it's true that Steven Kappes is going become his deputy, there is a recognition that that's not a good way to operate.",
        "And add on to that -- so maybe they're riding a course, you could put it that way.",
        "The president's advisory board on intelligence met in the last several months to talk about Goss's leadership of the CIA.",
        "And they really came up with the quite disparaging report about his leadership.",
        "And one of the things that it said was this fostering of dissent is a good thing in the intelligence world.",
        "So, you saw that carried out with the dismissal of Goss.",
        "It really was a forced resignation.",
        "So perhaps, if your view is correct, and I don't know if it is, but I think you're seeing changing...",
        "Well, Goss's body language, when you look at any of the press footage, he clearly was falling on his spear and was being cut, right?"

        "You know, I've heard about this report, but I'd have to say, that would be a total shocker to me.",
        "For one thing, I think its more nuance than that.",
        "The Pentagon, has been out to, under Secretary Rumsfeld's leadership, an aggressive push into clandestine operations.",
        "They're tiptoeing into covert operations, which is a slight but very important difference.",
        "And they have set up units, new units, to do this and lots of money to do this.",
        "But they are no way seizing the entire mission, from the CIA.",
        "And I don't think that would be wise to do because a lot of those missions are carried out by people who work in a gray world, where the military tends to work in a black and white world.",
        "And that's the big difference.",
        "So, I think, again, the appointment of Hayden and Kappes, if that comes true, signifies a return to the core mission of the CIA, which is espionage and covert action.",
        "Let's get a call from Dennis, Dennis in Minnetonka, Minnesota.",
        "Hi, I'd just like to start by saying I've got like 25 years of military service, and I'm still going.",
        "But I kind of parallel this to Hurricane Katrina.",
        "Now had there been one command in control, instead of FEMA, I can guarantee you, if the military were involved in this situation, and all the travesty that surrounded it, that wouldn't happen.",
        "And also, likewise, in regard to this appointment of this military person, I think that's going to kind of, you know -- commenting with your black and white perspective there --I think it's going to make it much better, because that's going to establish a command and control as well.",
        "So, I'll just listen what your person gets to say about that.",
        "Thanks, Dennis.",
        "Well, I think that what you say is interesting, especially coming from yourself, as a military person.",
        "You know, but it's a totally different culture.",
        "And whether or not command and control and the type of numbers accountability that the military is used to fits in the spy world, is really, I would say dubious.",
        "And it is a gray world.",
        "People operate on the borders.",
        "They have rules that are very different from the military, and that's for a reason.",
        "They are unique in that way.",
        "And I think that the feeling in the agency, and on Capitol Hill, where they know in the committees how the agency works, is that these are two very different institutions, and they have a very different mandate.",
        "And if you give it over to the military, you're going to lose the edge that the gray world gives you."

        "How does the current CIA compare with what President Truman created shortly after the Second World War?",
        "But, Dana mentioned a very interesting phrase to me, which I think is at the key of this whole transition, and really should be at the core of the debate about the future evolution of the intelligence community, and that is, the phrase was the president's confidence and the confidence of policymakers in the CIA.",
        "I believe in its entire history, the CIA has only enjoyed consistent confidence of policymakers, and specifically of the president, for five years, from 1955 to 1960, and that that essentially ended with a shoot down of Frances Gary Powers in a U2 spy plane, over Russia on May 1, 1960.",
        "Since then, this has been an agency, which has not consistently enjoyed the confidence of the president, especially after President Eisenhower was caught out lying to the American people about the existence of these spy flights.",
        "After that point, we've seen a journalistic, kind of interest developing into a kind of feeding frenzy against CIA at times.",
        "And I think its position in Washington and his position in the republic has been in erosion since then.",
        "So perhaps this is a kind of shake up which is somewhat over due.",
        "And, in fact if the military is indeed ascendant, we're returning much more to the model we had before the Cold War, during which for the first 150 years of the republic essentially, the military conducted our intelligence operations.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Gregory Treverton, would you agree?",
        "Well, I think I agree in part and disagree in part.",
        "I mean, certainly the CIA, as Mr. Truman intended it, was going to be mostly a coordinating operation, not do much of anything itself.",
        "That obviously changed as the CIA became organized, became active in all sorts of things.",
        "So then, at some point in that history, it stopped being the coordinating center and became another agency to be coordinated.",
        "To have it now return, or turn in earnest to the HUNINT, the espionage, covert operations mission, that, in a certain sense, makes a good deal of sense.",
        "The other thing that's happened over that time period is that all of the technical collection, that used to not be fast enough...",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "...we couldn't get pictures back in time to help war fighters on the battlefield.",
        "So, all of that technical collection that -- in which the CIA was engaged at the beginning, but decreasingly engaged over time -- now, the big change is that all that's available.",
        "It can get back to cockpits and tanks in time to help the war fighters.",
        "And that has raised the big question, which your guest referred, and that is, how much of this is really going to be in support of war fighters, and how much are we -- how are we going to preserve the intelligence that the civilian leadership needs for other national priorities...",
        "I guess...",
        "...the question in front of us.",
        "I guess that would be symbolized -- the U2 pictures, of course, back in the ‘50s were strategic intelligence.",
        "They were pictures of missile silos and that sort of thing, in Russia, run by the CIA.",
        "Now all of those operations, satellite photography, overhead photography and imagery, I guess, is probably the better word, all that's run by the Pentagon."
