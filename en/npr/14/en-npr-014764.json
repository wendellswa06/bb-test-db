        "Well, exactly and at some point the task kind of outgrew the CIA and the Pentagon assets infrastructure, all that became necessary.",
        "But the really big change is all that, those pictures, which took us then some time to get back the photograph, we were actually dropping photos out of satellites and picking them up over the ocean, that took some time.",
        "Now with technology, we can actually get the pictures, or better said, images, back in time to help some commander in the field locate a tank column that he wants to destroy.",
        "The problem is that's an essentially open ended mission.",
        "We could spend lots more money to provide even better support to war fighters in the field.",
        "And, therefore, the question arises, how do we balance those legitimate, very legitimate Pentagon activities and needs, with still making sure that civilian policymakers get the best intelligence they need for the decisions they're making outside of the military realm?",
        "And, Mark Riebling, the trend, certainly for many of the past years has been to move more and more of that into the Pentagon.",
        "This battle that you're writing about now, it seems like a little one sided.",
        "Well, certainly I think the turning point in recent history, was after Gulf War I, under the first Bush administration.",
        "There was a great backlash in the after action and after battle reports written up.",
        "And I talked to a number of officials.",
        "And nobody in the military was happy about the CIA's support during...",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "...the first Gulf War.",
        "And there was an impression, rightly or wrongly -- I think probably mostly rightly -- that the CIA was not answering the military's mail and, as Mr. Treverton says, was not really equipped to provide actionable, tactical, battlefield intelligence.",
        "And so what we saw, I think, during the ‘90s, was a gradual reassignment of a number of functions to the Pentagon, including the use of paramilitary units to collect human intelligence, which I would disagree with Dana Priest, that the military can't fit in, in the covert clandestine world.",
        "I think they can, especially in terms of these paramilitary drops where you put people behind lines, you send in the SEALS or the Green Berets to conduct intelligence and forge alliances with tribal groups, as we saw in Afghanistan.",
        "Clearly, I believe what Rumsfeld is doing is trying to solidify control over that.",
        "And this has been something the military's done since World War II, was doing even in Vietnam, they took over all the CIA's information...",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Yes, one of your previous callers mentioned low morale at one of the agencies.",
        "I think that has to do directly with the lack of civil service commission participation in the intelligence agencies and the counter-intelligence activities which create a climate of fear among the employees, so that they are afraid to do anything.",
        "All right, Sam.",
        "Thanks very much.",

        "Let's go now to Marcos, and Marcos calling us from Miami.",
        "...programs in the North Vietnam.",
        "So there's a long history of this.",
        "And in the course of writing my book, Wedge, I interviewed three former directors of central intelligence, Turner, Helms, and Webster, and they all thought moving covert ops in that sense, real black operations, into the military was a good idea.",
        "Because they thought, frankly, stuff like, you know, Iran contras dropping weapons to people in, you know, in Nicaragua and stuff like that, had only served to tarnish the reputation of the agency and get it in trouble with Congress.",
        "And they were frankly happy to dump it off into the Pentagon.",
        "Well...",
        "I don't know that that's changed, but that's one view.",
        "Let's get some more listeners' involved in the conversation.",
        "And let's go to, John.",
        "John's calling us from Rockville, Maryland.",
        "Yes, I'm a former senior analyst.",
        "I've been both at NSA and CIA.",
        "My tenure goes back to 1973, during Vietnam.",
        "And I left NSA in 1989.",
        "My feelings, based on my experience, are that the core issue has always been the tendency to collect intelligence for the sake of collecting intelligence without outlining priorities and significant and appropriate analysis, and appropriate weight being placed, or given to the analysis.",
        "I don't see anything, in that sense, that's changed.",
        "Furthermore, as far as the cadre of people who worked at NSA, by the time the late ‘80s rolled around, this was a dispirited, demoralized group of people, who were essentially doing assembly line work, and poorly compensated for it.",
        "Again, I don't see anything that's changed.",
        "I think we're in a position to predict only in hindsight, and that's very dangerous.",
        "That is easier, but dangerous, you're right.",
        "Gregory Treverton, is John right?",
        "Well, the problem is, I think it's, to some extent, a perennial.",
        "That is it's hard to get people to be very specific, policymakers to be very specific, about what they need.",
        "You know, they know what they'd like today, but what they're going to need six months from now, and how they're going to prioritize that against other things, is very hard to get them to do.",
        "It's also very hard to stop providing something once you provided it.",
        "The intelligence community is basically a service industry.",
        "And so once you develop consumers, it's hard to go back to them and say, oops, our priorities have changed.",
        "You were important yesterday, but not today.",
        "Therefore, we're not going to provide you the stuff you've been getting and liking.",
        "One of the main purposes of having a Director of National Intelligence would be to really try and do much better at that process of both learning what people need and want, both on the military and civilian side, and then beginning to reshape both current capabilities, but more importantly, longer term capabilities to meet them.",
        "And that's in some sense the real reason, in my view, to have a director of national intelligence and so far we've only seen sort of skimpy tracks of his influence on that set of truly a strategic management of the community, making sure we're getting the best for our $40 billion of intelligence across all the agencies, reducing what's called the influence of the stove pipes, getting people to work together more.",
        "That's the real reason in my view to have a Director of National Intelligence.",
        "John, thanks very much.",
        "Thank you."

        "Hi.",
        "My comment is that essentially nothing has changed in spite of all the bureaucratic reshuffling.",
        "And that the finished product of the intelligence process, which should be a finished intelligence report, is skewed because it's not coordinated.",
        "Not coordinated under the old DCI system, and not coordinated now under Mr. Negroponte as Director of National Intelligence?",
        "Yes.",

        "Mark Riebling, is that accurate?",
        "I think that there's always a problem of institutional bias and it certainly is not confined to the intelligence community.",
        "So you see there the same kind of favoring the home team or the world you know, or the conclusions which you want to draw, which you see in other walks of life.",
        "Perhaps it's more damaging and more dangerous when national security's at stake.",
        "Going back to something Mr. Treverton said, I think he really put his finger on something important when he talked about the role of policymakers.",
        "And often when we discuss about intelligence, we're more concerned with what the intelligence community can bring to policymakers.",
        "But I think it's also important to remember what policymakers can do for the intelligence community to make their jobs easier.",
        "And looking at the broad sweep of American intelligence history, I believe we only had two presidents who came to the job really understanding the intelligence process and the importance of prioritizing things and giving people clear marching orders.",
        "And they were, ironically enough, since we're talking about military leadership of the CIA in this case, these were both military commanders, George Washington and Dwight Eisenhower.",
        "Both came to the job with a very acute understanding of intelligence."

        "So I think the more that policymakers can be clear about what their needs are, and look into the future and prioritize, the easier the job of the intelligence community will be.",
        "And I'd also just, you know, remind listeners that the intelligence community can only advise and inform, but ultimately the real interpretation of the data in terms of whether it rises to actionable, is in the hands of policymakers and that a lot of this so-called twisting of the intelligence, say from weapons of mass destruction, occurred at the policymaking level, whether within the Pentagon or within the upper levels of the president's team.",

        "I have another comment, if I may?",
        "Can you hold on just a moment?",
        "Sure.",
        "My question was, as our government has check and balances between military and civil, I thought the gathering of information would also have that check and balance.",
        "In other words, CIA would confirm or not confirm, but you know, but they would keep each other in check.",
        "And then my other question would be, if the military takes over the CIA and the spying, let's put it this way, and a spy is caught, wouldn't that be considered an act of war?",
        "Hmm.",
        "I'm not sure that matters whether or not the CIA is run by a military officer or not, but Mark Riebling, on that first point, is the CIA supposed to be some sort of check and balance on the Pentagon?",
        "I think that's certainly the view within the CIA In fact, I talked to a person named Richard Anderson who was an analyst in the CIA for many years and then on congressional committees overseeing the intelligence community.",
        "And he said, you know, one of the things he really learned was that the CIA exists to give the nation skeptical opinion about whatever the defense department says and that the CIA is basically the president's truth squad when it comes to the Pentagon.",
        "You know, the people in the Pentagon would take a different view.",
        "But I think there is this sense that the military, because it's job is protecting the nation, has a vested interest in accumulating as many resources as possible for that task, since we've never lost a war by being too strong.",
        "So, they will argue that it's better to err on the side of, you know, seeing the threat in a dark way and therefore appropriately resources accordingly.",
        "And so, whenever there are these B teams brought in by the Pentagon, as we saw under Rumsfeld to review the CIA's work, sometimes you end up with a disaster.",
        "And this is definitely attention which comes from two conflicting world views.",
        "CIA tends to be more like the state department, rather liberal, some independent I would say, utopian in its belief and the perfectibility of human nature or the effectiveness of dialogue and engagement.",
        "The Pentagon takes a darker and perhaps more politically conservative view about human nature, that things will go wrong, utopia will never arrive, and therefore it's best to plan for the worst.",
        "Gregory Treverton, we just have a minute or so left, but I was wondering if you would endorse that?"

        "Now, intelligence, I've coordinated a lot of national intelligence estimates in my time and there's a temptation I think in the intelligence world too to say, to focus on what could go wrong, where policymakers are always focusing on what could go right.",
        "I think one of the happy things, the good things, or good possible things, that's come out of both the 9/11 and the WMD commissions is that we're now thinking hard about analysis, about how to do better by way of, not collecting the information, but putting it together in ways that will be useful to policymakers.",
        "A long way to go, but at least there is a discussion of it and support for innovation, new efforts out there, that I think that across the agencies is really an important possibility.",
