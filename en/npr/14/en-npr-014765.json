        "Really, the one thing that's different this time as sort of an evolution, certainly compared to Medicare, is the emphasis on cost control, and I think that's particularly interesting in the Senate bill that Senator Reid has put forward, so that's really over 45 years the one thing that has emerged as a new item in the debate.",
