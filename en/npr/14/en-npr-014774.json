        "But somebody else went in and complained about the Line Item Veto Act, and they did have standing.",
        "But if the Obama administration, which represents the executive branch, won't defend the law and the House Republicans can't defend the law, what in the world happens?",
        "Because in New England and in New York, the Defense of Marriage Act has been declared unconstitutional, it's presumably constitutional in the rest of the country, and that's what we have the Supreme Court for.",
        "They're supposed to, you know, make sure federal law is the same everywhere.",
        "So somebody - somewhere along the line they've got to decide this question, and that's why after all this procedural debate, something tells me that they will find a way to decide this issue.",
        "There was an argument that, you know, this case doesn't apply, but we could wait for the next case to come up.",
        "And then the counter-argument, why would the next case be decided any differently than this one, why would the standing arguments be any different next time?",
        "Yes, that's - I think that's exactly right.",
        "You could say, well, bring us another case, but you'd have the same problem is that somebody else would sue, and then who's going to defend the law?",
        "Well, the only people who want to defend it are the House Republicans.",
        "So I don't see how they get out of this box.",
        "And so then on to the merits of the case, and this is where you talk about the case, and again we're talking about Defense of Marriage Act passed overwhelmingly by Congress back in 1996, signed by a Democratic president, William Jefferson Clinton, who has since changed his mind on this.",
        "Indeed, the original House sponsor of the bill, Bob Barr, has changed his mind on this.",
        "They now regard this as unconstitutional because, well, everybody has a different remark on this, and we'll find out how the justices see it as they listen to arguments from various sides on this.",

        "Indeed, the Obama administration considers it unconstitutional and sides with the challenger, Edith Windsor.",

        "And this is on the argument of many of the liberal members of the court, the four members of the liberal wing of the court, who find that the Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional because it denies legally married couples the same benefits of other legally married couples, in other words under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.",

        "Clement, for the most part and historically, the only uniformity that the federal government has pursued is that it's uniformly recognized the marriages that are recognized by the state.",
        "So this was a real difference in the uniformity that the federal government was pursuing.",
        "And it suggests that maybe something - maybe Congress had something different in mind than uniformity.",
        "So we have a whole series of cases which suggest the following, which suggest that when Congress targets a group that is not everybody's favorite group in the world, that we look at those cases with some - even if they're not suspect, with some rigor to say do we really think that Congress was doing this for uniformity reasons, or do we think that Congress' judgment was infected by dislike, by fear, by animus, and so forth?",
        "I guess the question that this statute raises, this statute that does something that's really never been done before, is whether that sends up a pretty good red flag that that's what was going on.",
        "A couple of responses, Justice Kagan.",
        "First of all, I think I would take issue with the premise, first of all, that this is such an unusual federal involvement on an issue like marriage.",
        "If you look at historically, not only has the federal government defined marriage for its own purposes distinctly in the context of particular programs, it's also intervened in other areas, including in state prerogatives.",
        "I mean, there's a reason that four state constitutions include a prohibition on polygamy.",
        "It's because the federal Congress insisted on them.",
        "There is a reason that, in the wake of the Civil War and in Reconstruction, Congress specifically wanted to provide benefits for spouses of freed slaves who fought for the Union."
