        "Well, Justice Kennedy, you heard in the end of that clip, his view is that marriage has always been a matter of state law and that this statute sort of intervenes and tries to regulate marriage from the federal government.",
        "And Kennedy's view is a matter of federalism, meaning, you know, the states get to decide some things and the federal government gets to decide others.",
        "Kennedy views marriage as - and divorce - these are matters of state law.",
        "And so I think he's inclined to write an opinion that says this is unconstitutional because it tramples essentially on the states' turf.",
        "And you heard Donald Verrilli and the more liberal justices say, well, we, you know, in some level, we could agree with that.",
        "Justice Kagan seemed to agree.",
        "But they want to say this is a denial of the equal protection of the laws.",
        "So, one way or another, it seems to me that there are five justices who are opposed to DOMA as it exists, and they have different rationale: one federalism and one - and so-called equal protection violation.",
        "And if they all agree it's unconstitutional, it doesn't matter what their rationale is.",
        "That's the majority.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "It - one way or another, it seems to me they will - the liberal justices will either sign on to Justice Kennedy's opinion and say, and besides, we also think it's an equal protection violation, or they can all get together and - but the main thing is the five of them are likely to agree it's unconstitutional and the statute falls on that basis.",
        "David Savage, Supreme Court correspondent for the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune, who was at the Supreme Court earlier today listening to arguments over DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And one more clip of tape.",
        "This is Justice Stephen Breyer questioning Roberta Kaplan, who is the attorney who represents the litigant in this case, the person who challenged the law because her marriage was in Canada and then the - required to pay federal tax, excise - estate tax after her partner died, which she would not have had that been a same - an opposite-sex marriage.",
        "Anyway, Justice Stephen Breyer brings up a point about why the federal government has an interest in defining marriage.",
        "Look, the federal government needs a uniform rule.",
        "There has been this uniform one man, one woman rule for several hundred years or whatever, and there's a revolution going on in the states.",
        "We either adopt the resolution - the revolution or push it along a little, or we stay out of it.",
        "And I think Mr. Clement was saying, well, we've decided to stay out of it.",
        "I don't...",
        "A way to stay out of it is to go with the traditional thing.",
        "I mean, that - that's an argument.",

        "Section 3 of DOMA is stopping the recognition by the federal government of couples who are already married, solely based on their sexual orientation.",
        "And what it's doing is undermining, as you can see in the briefs of the states of New York and others, it's undermining the policy decisions made by those states that have permitted gay couples to marry, states that have already resolved the cultural, the political, the moral, whatever other controversies, they're resolved in those states.",
        "And by fencing those couples off, couples who are already married, and treating them as unmarried for purposes of federal law, you're not taking it one step at a time.",
        "You're not promoting caution.",
        "You're putting a stop button on it, and you're having discrimination, for the first time in our country's history, against a class of married couples.",
        "The discrimination is on not the sexual orientation, but on a class of marriage?",
        "Is that what you're...",
        "It's a class of married couples who are gay.",
        "David Savage of the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune.",
        "As we look back at these two days of arguments, it's remarkable to those of us who don't do this for a living.",
        "How much time was spent on procedural issues, those issues of standing?",
        "Well, quite a bit, Neal.",
        "I - my sense is that it is true that both of the cases had an unusual posture because California state attorneys would not defend Proposition 8, and the federal - the Obama administration attorneys would not defend DOMA.",
        "So that's a little bit of an unusual situation.",
        "My belief, though, is that John Roberts, the chief justice, who's a stickler for procedure and precedent - procedure would sort of like both of these cases to go away.",
        "And he was the one probably arguing the most strongly, in both cases, on the procedural issues.",
        "I think he wanted to schedule the extra time on the procedure.",
        "So it sort of - it makes it hard to read, makes it complicated to figure out how they're going to decide it.",
        "But as I said earlier, I do think, in the case of DOMA, that they've got to resolve the constitutionality of a federal law that's been struck down some places and upheld others."

        "It again strikes what is unusual that given the opportunity to decide a fundamental case that's going to be debated for decades, likely, that the instinct of at least the chief justice is to duck.",

        "My guess is that there are five of them to allow gay marriage to resume in California.",
        "But they could do it a number of different ways.",
        "When these cases came up in the fall, we actually thought that they would hold the Prop 8 case until they had decided the Defense of Marriage case, and then sort of send back Prop 8 to California to the 9th Circuit.",
        "I still think that's a possibly.",
        "In June, they might hand out a big decision explaining why the Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional, talk about equal protection for gay couples, and then send the case back to California, because there was a strong sense yesterday that even the liberal justices did not want to, you know, go too far, too fast to mandate gay marriage across the country.",

        "Although she came very close, 18 million votes, she was just a few delegates behind, and so it is a great deal for her to swallow to say, now I am going to serve this man who defeated me.",
        "But I think she is a large enough person to do it, and I think she certainly realizes that the best thing for her to do now for history and for her future and for women who have looked to her for leadership is to step into this new job and do as well as she possibly can to serve the foreign policy interests and needs of the United States and the Obama administration.",
        "And I think they'll have that in common, and that will be the basis of their new relationship.",

        "And I mean that in the sense not only of policy, Iraq, what have you, but also in the sense of the relationships within the Pentagon, which have been rarely worse than they were during the Rumsfeld years.",
        "And so Bob Gates had a big job.",
        "He has handled it well.",
        "He has been applauded almost universally and certainly across the aisle, bipartisan-fashion in Congress.",
        "So he provides some continuity, and I think he's also going to surprise a lot of people with his willingness to shift his priorities measurably, substantially, in order to serve his new boss, in order to serve a new set of policy imperatives that are going to come down to him from the rest of this foreign policy team we saw on stage today.",
