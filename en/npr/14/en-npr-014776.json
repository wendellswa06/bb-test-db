        "Just last week, after a segment on a caravan of Central American migrants, President Trump called his defense secretary to the White House.",
        "And he's now deployed National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border.",
        "Fox News may be the most important news organization in America right now simply because it has a devoted audience inside the Oval Office of one.",
        "David Folkenflik is our media correspondent and our resident Fox expert.",
        "He told me what the president sees when he turns on the network.",
        "Well, I think the first part of it is an almost continual bath of affirmation, particularly on the opinion side, which is really the dominant parts of the day that he cites and the dominant part of the day that people tend to watch.",
        "Within that affirmation, you're hearing a lot of concerns being raised, a lot of policies being suggested, a lot of personnel being touted, many of them from the payroll of Fox itself at times, ways in which people are trying to appeal to try to bend the administration this way or that by simply appealing to the guy in the Oval Office himself."

        "Pruitt's, you know, sat for an interview with Henry.",
        "And Henry asked him some tough good questions about at least some of the major, major questionable judgments that Pruitt seems to have made during his relatively brief tenure at the head of the Environmental Protection Agency.",
        "It's worth noting that this doesn't cut entirely against Republican or Trump administration interests in that the Trump administration right now seems to be divided.",
        "We've had leaks in recent days of the chief of staff's interest, John Kelly, in getting Pruitt out of there, out of the cabinet because there's just one or two or three scandals too many.",
        "But, you know, let's credit Henry, who among some other senior journalists there are capable of doing good work.",

        "You could almost run out of fingers on your hands very quickly to think of the number of people that Trump turns to for advice directly.",

        "You're one of the early creators of the Tea Party movement, of which - one of the main tenets was fiscal responsibility, yet this tax bill is expected to add, I think, more than a trillion dollars to the national debt over 10 years and, if the tax cuts are extended, as it is hoped by the party, far more after that.",
        "Do you support the plan and why?",
        "Well, I do support the plan, but I don't disagree with you about the crazy levels of spending by the federal government.",
