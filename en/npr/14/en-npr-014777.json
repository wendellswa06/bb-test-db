        "military.",
        "He says when he looked at the data, right away, he knew the vaccine had a problem - that it was putting some kids at risk for a potentially deadly side effect where your blood vessels start to leak, like with Ebola.",
        "The trouble is that it occurs very rapidly - just a matter of hours.",
        "And this is what's so scary because, you know, there's nothing on the outside of the body that tells you, oh, that's a person that's leaking fluid inside.",
        "A child can go into shock.",
        "Then everything gets worse, and you - maybe it's impossible to save your life.",
        "It's a complication called plasma leakage syndrome.",
        "Halstead says the risk is small, but still, he was so worried, he started writing editorials to scientific journals, even warned the Filipino government about the problem.",
        "I just say, no, you can't give a vaccine to somebody - some perfectly normal, healthy person - and now put them at risk for the rest of their lives for plasma leakage syndrome.",
        "You can't do that.",
        "Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccine manufacturer, disagreed, and the Philippines campaign continued.",
        "Then, in November 2017, more than a year after kids started getting their shots, the vaccinations came to a screeching halt."
