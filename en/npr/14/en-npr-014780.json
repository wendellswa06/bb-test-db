        "Pleasure talking to you.",
        "And our last headline takes us to the classroom.",
        "Last week, the U.S.",
        "Supreme Court ruled in two cases that public school systems can't use race to determine enrollment.",
        "Here's NPR's Tony Cox talking with Harry Korrell.",
        "Korrell was a lead attorney for Parents Involved in Community Schools, a group of plaintiffs based in Seattle who won their case last week.",
        "Some schools are better than others quite honestly, and no systems have been hit hardest by under-resourcing and overcrowding than many of our intercity schools where without integration plans historically, the vast majority of African-American students wind up.",
        "How can we make sure that these schools and those students do not get left behind?",
        "You know, I think that's one of the most important questions to come out of this.",
        "And I hope that the answer is going to be - if the problem is lack of resources and weak teachers and weak administration.",
        "That the answer is to improve the resources, improve the teachers and improve the administration and not shuffle kids around based on their skin color.",
        "It seems to me to be looking at the wrong issue if they're looking at race when the problem is the performance of the schools.",
        "Mr.",
        "Korrell insists that when it comes to dollars, some public schools get a lot less funding than others and that funding has a major impact on the quality of education.",
        "Joining me now to talk about money in public schools is Bill Spriggs.",
        "He's professor and chair of economics at Howard University.",
        "How are you doing?",
        "I'm doing fine.",
        "Thank you for having me.",
        "So one thing that I know is that property taxes pay for a lot of what goes on in schools.",
        "And so, you know, at my age, in my late 30s, I see a lot of my friends are really struggling with where should they live just based on how to take care of their kids.",
        "Explain a little bit about how property taxes affect education and how that, in turn, affects race?",
        "Well, at the end of the 19th century, what the school district comprised of was a school.",
        "And early in the part of the 20th century, we realized that single school districts didn't make sense.",
        "They weren't economically viable for the type of training people are going to need for the new industrial age.",
        "And we expanded the size of school districts and went to milling or taxing based on the school district.",
        "And because this came out of an old system, it was taxing property.",
        "And that's the basis for why we get school districts being based on property tax.",
        "The problem is, in some areas, like Texas, as an example of a state, where the school district may not be the entire county, the lines for the school district may be what economist would call endogenous, that is I exclude some people from my school district because I don't want them in my school district.",
        "And so those who have very wealthy homes can stick together.",
        "This can even be arbitrary in the sense of, when you look at the expansion of some cities over time - Virginia is an example where cities and counties are independent governing bodies.",
        "And cities in Virginia, as an example, have expanded to heat up some counties over time.",
        "And so - and so these…",
        "I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear."

        "Most of the people in this database are white.",
        "Each person in this database is a beacon that illuminates hundreds of distant relatives.",

        "But you can also use this technique for other purposes, maybe purposes that could be illegitimate.",

        "The police currently is using these techniques to find these really like, you know, murderers and bad people.",
        "But are we OK with using this technique to identify people that - I don't know - in a political demonstration that left their DNA behind?",
