        "You know, there are certainly some Republicans who don't sound ready to close the door yet on repeal, but the GOP has really hit a wall on that front.",
        "There is no viable Republican health care plan that can get a simple majority of votes, as we've seen.",
        "And so what Senators Alexander and Murray are doing really is the most concrete, the most serious bipartisan effort to shore up the Affordable Care Act.",
        "Senator Alexander said...",
        "And this is about getting the marketplaces to work a little better now - getting more insurance options out there?",
        "And that's right.",
        "And Senator Alexander says the goal is to come up with a short-term solution so that people can buy affordable insurance next year.",
        "And they've scheduled hearings to start September 4.",
        "And, you know, whereas the failed Senate health care bill was crafted entirely out of public view, they are making a promise to do this in public - with hearings, with markups, where lawmakers can then amend the bill in committee.",
        "It all sort of falls in line with the return to regular order that I'm sure people heard John McCain call for on the Senate floor.",
        "Right, so this is probably the most definitive signal we have now that any attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act are going to be put on hold for a while, yeah?",
        "Yeah, because even the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, laid out the Senate's August to-do list yesterday, and they also - you know, health care was nowhere on that agenda.",
        "And Senator John Thune - who, as you know, is the No. 3 Republican - he told reporters that we've got other things to do.",
        "So you know, Republican leaders have expended a lot of political capital on a bill they weren't all that committed to in the first place.",
        "And despite all the political maneuvering, all the political drama that surrounded that collapse of that Senate health care bill, the fact remains that Congress has to do something to prop up the exchanges, particularly for people who live in rural areas where there is only one insurer or, in some cases, no insurer at all.",
        "Geoff, what enthusiasm - if any - is there in the Senate for the president's proposal to hurt insurance companies, as he phrased it, by maybe withholding funds from them that help prop up the insurance market?",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF SWEARING-IN CEREMONY)",
        "There is zero enthusiasm for that because, if he does withhold those payments, it would send the health care system into a death spiral.",
        "So Democrats and Republicans are both together in hoping that he does not make good on his threat.",
        "Lack of enthusiasm for a death spiral - good to know."

        "But it's having a huge impact on the political class and a massive impact too, Steve, on the perception that people have of their politicians.",
        "I mean, I've had lots of conversations with people here, and not one of them hold their politicians in anything that could be described as a positive light - deep cynicism.",
