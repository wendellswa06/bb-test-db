        "After the tragedy at Virginia Tech a year ago, when a young man named Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 students and faculty members and then himself, colleges across the country have reconsidered the issues around the mental health of students.",
        "Mass killings are very rare, of course, but many schools decided to change policies that emphasize the privacy of students, who are almost all over the age of 18, and focus instead on identification and treatment for young men and women who might be a danger to themselves and others.",
        "Cornell University started up such a program well before Virginia Tech.",
        "Faculty, counselors, psychologists, administrators, RA's, campus police, even janitors, share information about potentially troubled students, and while it's impossible to tell whether that's prevented mass murder, the number of students who commit suicide is down.",
        "Students, professors, counselors, and administrators, how does your school address mental health on campus?",
        "What works and what doesn't?",
        "Our phone number is 800-989-8255.",
        "The email address is talk@npr.org, and you can also tell us your story on our blog.",
        "'That's at npr.org/blogofthenation.",
        "Later in the program, movie maker Morgan Spurlock's search for Osama bin Laden.",
        "But first, mental health on college campuses, and we begin with Tristan Davies.",
        "He teaches writing at The Writings Seminars at Johns Hopkins University and joins us now from the 'studios of our member station in Baltimore, WYPR.",
        "And welcome to Talk of the Nation.",
        "Thank you, Neal.",
        "And I understand, just yesterday, you confronted a student about her writing.",
        "It was.",
        "It happened just that recently.",
        "A young woman had written a story about an exchange student in Tokyo who was on a commuter train in the morning into town that struck a woman who had stepped in front of it to commit suicide at a place that's very well-known.",
        "In fact, it exists where people do this.",
        "It started - in the story, it started this complex thinking on the part of the character about his own isolation in Tokyo and his lack of human connection, which then triggered some, frankly, delusional behavior.",
        "And finally, a scene where he looks out over an empty courtyard with a sort of cement floor far below the room in which he is staying in the suburban dormitory.",
        "And I asked her if she'd come - you know, I mean, it was very concerning.",
        "I asked if she come and see me, and she did.",
        "And she said - I asked her how things were going.",
        "And she said, first of all, he wasn't trying to kill himself, and second of all, everything is fine.",
        "And frankly, in that case, I was fairly confident that things were OK with her.",
        "I know her well.",
        "She is a smart and really talented young woman.",
        "But I asked just the same."

        "In every instance.",
        "You know, I think that anytime that someone - fiction is something that didn't happen, not something that isn't true, and any time someone writes - you see in a person's writing violence, hatefulness, scenes of self-destruction, I think it's incumbent upon you to address it.",
        "On the other hand, of course, just because somebody writes about someone who is depressed doesn't necessarily mean that they are depressed themselves.",
        "Sure.",
        "The overwhelming majority of the time it is purely creative.",
        "But it is still - fiction is generated by counterfactual conditionals, which means it could happen.",
        "And for the student to write it, the student's thought it.",
        "And generally speaking, most of the time, I'm quite happy it is benign.",
        "And yesterday, you were convinced that it was benign.",
        "There have been examples in the past, though, you have taught in this program for 15 years, where it's not been benign.",
        "Sure.",
        "Once, and it was one of the more disturbing things that has ever happened to me.",
        "I ended up walking a woman to meet the car that took her directly to the hospital.",
        "It was deeply painful.",
        "And what were the red flags in that case?",
        "In that case, I think it was one of those situations where the red flag was, you know, the stress.",
        "Particularly this time of year, I was thinking as we were waiting to go on.",
        "This is an extraordinarily difficult time of year in the academic calendar.",
        "School is winding down.",
        "It's the end of the full year, as opposed to the semester.",
        "It's a beautiful day, like it is today in Baltimore, and there are just a lot of conflicting thoughts that come to mind.",
        "And in this instance, the sort of terrible one that I had, it was just merely a question of a schedule for class the next semester that conflicted with something else.",
        "But very quickly, I could tell that it was - that was just the pretense for her being upset.",
        "And do you do this as a result of some policy at Johns Hopkins University, that there's a guideline somewhere saying, if you're concerned, you should talk to the student?",
        "Well, Hopkins is extraordinarily careful, a very good undergraduate advising program and counseling center, and I think they are very thoughtful about it and have been for a long time.",
        "But I think it's a part of being - it's a part and parcel what I do."

        "But there is some darkness, and you have to be sympathetic to it.",
        "Sure.",
        "But would more information help?",
        "If, for example, one of your students was writing something that disturbed you or raised questions for you, in any case, and if the campus police knew that this person had been arrested for binge drinking two days ago or something like that, would this information - would some coordination here be useful?",
        "Sure.",

        "Was there a first time when that red flag first popped in your head?",
        "Well, I think that that's the thing that I find sad about some of the stories that I have heard, is that, it seems to me that people aren't getting the attention that they need.",
        "Not because they are in distress, but because they are just not getting the attention that they need.",
        "They're not in an environment where there are people who are paying close attention to what they do week in and week out.",
        "And that strikes me as the shame, not just for the person in danger, psychologically, but for the happy and thriving student, as well.",

        "And just by way of asking, have any of your students ever said, you know, I'm really offended that you are talking to me about this, this is my business, leave me alone?",
        "They teach you in - when you see the proverbial red flag, or you're particularly afraid of someone who's considering self-damaging behavior, to ask a person, have you ever considered suicide?",
        "Because it's true that a suicidal person will usually tell you that they have, whereas the person who isn't genuinely suicidal will say no. So, you see all sorts of - I mean, there are all kinds of hints to it.",
        "Let's get a caller in on the conversation.",
        "This is Matt, and Matt's calling us from Ames in Iowa.",
        "Yes, I wanted to comment on - I think that the issue of privacy would be much less important if we were able to eliminate much of the stigma that surrounds mental illness.",
        "If people felt more comfortable in getting help, in telling their friends that need help and teachers, I think that it would be less of an issue for outside parties to intervene, if the students thought that they would be cared for as a capable person that has a health problem that is often times like any other."

        "But I know a lot of people that have been in my life that needed help, and for one reason or another, didn't seek help.",
        "They thought it was for somebody that was much worse off than they were.",
        "The fact is, if mental illness is interfering in your life, it's worthwhile to seek help for it, like you would anything else.",
        "And in the cases of those friends that you're talking about, who you thought needed help, would you have thought it appropriate for you to mention that to officials at the school, to their parents?",
        "Well, in one case, I mentioned it to a parent.",
        "And unfortunately, the parent felt much the way - the same way that my friend did, as well.",
        "It's something that I think a lot of people just feel is somebody else's problem and not theirs.",
        "I think part of the issue that even with the Virginia Tech massacre, even though it was a horrible thing that happened, this was clearly a sick person that could have received help.",
        "This isn't a person that was just playing a monster.",
        "And I think, when we demonize people like that with mental illness, we're just encouraging more of those events to occur.",
        "What's that?",
        "I was just going to say, I think we - I think you may be right.",
        "We demonize mental illness, but not necessarily the people.",
        "But go ahead.",
        "Well, sure.",

        "Well, yes.",

        "But there's a fine line.",
        "But again, there's a lot of people that don't want to address those problem and even with professors, even with people that I've talked to myself, as someone who suffers from depression.",
        "There are a lot of professors that want to be understanding, but it's difficult for them to know when someone is using mental illness as an excuse.",
        "So even those who try to be really understanding, have trouble finding spot where they can really intervene and really take care of that student.",
