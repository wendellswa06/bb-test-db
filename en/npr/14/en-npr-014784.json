        "Professors aren't the only ones responsible for the warning signs.",
        "We were talking - I think you heard part of our conversation with Tristan Davies at Johns Hopkins a moment ago.",
        "Yes.",
        "And the fact is, there are others who on campus who may see more of or, perhaps, different sides of students than professors.",
        "That's right.",
        "And one of the things we've tried to do is educate people on doing the things that Tristan just talked about, noticing the symptoms, noticing the signs, knowing how to get help, knowing how to direct people how to get help.",
        "We've developed some programs that really focus on educating faculty, educating staff, educating advising staff, even educating residential staff, including some of the janitors, which was a story feature in the Wall Street Journal.",
        "So we've really tried to take a very comprehensive campus approach.",
        "In the Wall Street Journal story, one of the custodial staff noticed, well, one of the students vomiting a lot and was concerned about the possibility of an eating disorder.",
        "That's correct and was able to get that student connected with appropriate resources.",
        "I mean, that's the goal that we try to bring about is, with our counseling services connecting, people to care, and that's our goal within the whole health service.",
        "And taking a very comprehensive approach involves education.",
        "Other things we do with our health services, screen for depression, connect with the counseling service.",
        "So a lot of our efforts are really about trying to connect people with care because, when people do get care, they generally get better with medication, with counseling.",
        "And a couple of concerns that I know people will ask about.",
        "One of which is, are students aware that this large group of people, who they are in and among every single day, are monitoring them, effectively, for mental health problems and meaning to share information about them?"

        "I wouldn't say it so much as it's monitoring.",
        "I like the way that Tristan talked about it.",
        "It really is caring.",
        "It's a way to notice someone that you care about if they're struggling, if they're experiencing difficulties.",
        "Our goal at Cornell, and I think many universities, is to create caring communities, where people across the campus aren't monitoring, per se, but are really noticing because the genuinely care about the students that they're dedicating their lives to serve.",
        "I think a lot of - I know a lot of faculty, a lot of support staff, a lot of council center staff, and janitors feel the same way.",
        "So hopefully it's not perceived as monitoring.",
        "And even noticing each other's students, I think, is a piece that we try to talk to many of our students who are pure educators about, that it really comes from a place, hopefully, of genuine caring across the entire university community.",
        "And these are adults.",
        "Young adults, for sure, but nevertheless adults.",
        "Aren't they responsible for themselves?",
        "So let's just break this down a little bit though, it's legal for rich people essentially to band together and create their own school districts?",
        "Hi, how are you guys?",
        "I think a lot of times, when people are experiencing a mental health difficulty, whether it's an eating disorder, depression, anxiety, it's someone's own mind turning against them, turning against their experience.",
        "So a lot of times, what's needed is a caring community, that provides support and helps direct people and helps them kind of respond to their better judgment.",
        "And one other criticism I've heard about is that there is so much concern about critical cases and so much attention that people who are merely stressed out have a hard time accessing the same kind of resources.",
        "Yeah, I think it's a continuum.",
        "The reality is, it's not that someone just wakes up, and they're very dangerous to themselves or somebody else.",
        "It's a continuum of suffering and pain.",
        "And hopefully, like some of the things we've tried to do, is take a public-health approach, that you reach people before it gets to that critical point.",
        "Your connection with faculty or staff or other students, that if you can connect before it gets to that critical point, and something awful happens, hopefully you can prevent that.",
        "That's the general public-health philosophy that we've tried to embody through many of our efforts.",
        "Let's get another caller on the line.",
        "This is John, and John with us from Oxford, Illinois."

        "Hello, Neal.",
        "Hi.",
        "I was calling to talk about an experience I had in high school, when an instructor was actually generating a discussion group and the topic was suicide, and I very rationally took the approach that, if you're going to do it, there are more and less certain ways to do it and that landed me a mandated meeting with a psychiatrist weekly for two months.",
        "And if anything, that has made me more resistant and more wary about seeking out any assistance because my mental state was not taken into account and no further investigation was done.",
        "I'm unclear.",
        "Did you think this was an overreaction or an under reaction?",
        "Absolutely an overreaction.",
        "And I feel like the resources that were given me could have been used better for someone else.",
        "Do you understand the idea that, well, better safe than sorry?",
        "Better safe than sorry.",
        "But to not take any other mitigating information into account, and like I said, to spend two months worth of resources, not consulting my parents at the time, I think was wasteful.",
        "John, thanks very much.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "I wonder, Gregory Eells, have you encountered any similar situations?",
        "Well, I think there, what the caller was talking about is, there is - if people are feeling like they're forced into treatment or forced into care, or it's not really perceived as caring.",
        "Clearly, from his response, it didn't feel like there was a caring response from his high school.",
        "So I think a key piece that needs to be thought about is, how do you meet people where they are?"

        "I think, many of the things that we need to be aware of in response to Virginia Tech is not overreacting.",

        "We want them to be caring communities where there is a safety net.",

        "I was diagnosed with depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and social-anxiety disorder in high school and went off the school, from North Carolina to Minnesota, and did some counseling.",
        "There was counseling service on campus, very good.",
        "Did some counseling my freshman year.",
        "The summer after my freshman year, I started using new medication.",
        "And then, about three weeks after starting medication, went back to school for my fall semester, had a very bad reaction to the medication and ended up attempting suicide.",
        "And I feel like, if there had been continued monitoring, if my doctor had gotten in touch with one of the counselors at the school and continued monitoring how the medication treatment was going, it could have been prevented.",
        "And how are you doing now, Kate?",
        "I'm doing great.",
        "I'm on a great medication.",
        "I've been through therapy.",
        "I'm now, obviously, taking some time off from school, finished graduating here at UNCG, it's in Greensboro, and doing very well.",
        "Well, thank heavens for that and congratulations.",
        "Could I respond to that, Neal?"

        "Yes, please.",
        "I was going to ask you to.",
        "Well, I think that's a great story.",
        "And I think, one of the issues that we try to work on, is coordinated care.",
        "I mean, a lot of times, if people are on medication.",
        "They may be getting medication from a physician who may not be in touch with the counseling service at the university, and I think it's an issue of resources and available psychiatry.",
        "Often times at universities where - you know, Cornell we have psychiatrists in our center that work closely with the therapist, continue people on their medication throughout the summer.",
        "Hopefully, they can re-engage in treatment.",
        "And obviously, that's not a panacea to mean that nothing bad's ever going to happen.",
        "Good, thanks.",
        "Solar map?",
        "But I think, it helps at least facilitate the likelihood that the care's going to be coordinated, and that's going to continue throughout a summer or breaks.",
        "Because this is one of the difficulties in treating college students, is that there are these breaks in the summer, other breaks around the holidays, and other times people go to spring break and so forth, that sometimes maintaining care and keeping connected with them is a challenge that is a little more challenging than some other environments.",
        "Kate's call also illustrates another aspect of this situation.",
        "And that is, because of improvements in treatment and medication and that sort of thing, a higher number of children, kids, who have mental problems are going on to college and university.",
        "That's right.",
        "That's one of the things we try to do.",
        "We ask students, when they come to Cornell, is - they fill out a health history form.",
        "We ask them to voluntarily give us information.",
        "It's not related to admissions, but it's really related to, you know, if you have these concerns, and you've had this dream in the past, would you like to transfer your care to us?",
        "Would you like to continue with your medications?",
        "This is how you do that, how you get connected.",
        "Because I think you're right, many people are coming because of better treatments than 15 or 20 years ago, maybe wouldn't have been able to go to college.",
        "Kate, thanks very much for the call."
