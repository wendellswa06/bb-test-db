        "I hope not.",
        "Like I was saying before, hopefully what colleges and universities are doing, a better way to respond, is to look at ways you could reduce the risk of these things happening by keeping students connected.",

        "Yeah.",

        "Now, when you talk about study abroad programs, I think sometimes those feel kind of scary for universities because the student is away.",

        "And, if you go to a training on suicide assessment, which not all mental-health professionals do, but hopefully would, one of the first things they get you to look at is, look at your own reactions, as a therapist or mental-health professional, to people talking about suicide, talking about sometimes just depression and pain and wanting to escape that pain, which is a fairly normal part of human experience.",
        "So - but many times it elicits fear among mental-health professionals.",
        "So you know, more than just a general response, I think this call illustrates how sometimes that can be problematic.",
        "And I think all of us in the mental-health field need to be trained to respond as appropriately as possible because we're trying to balance the - I think, the ethical dilemma of, how do you care for somebody who sometimes, because of their illness, can't make good decisions about themselves, with the fact that, people are still, often times, rational and autonomous.",
        "And you want to support them and really find out what's going on with them.",
