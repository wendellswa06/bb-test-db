        "It makes sense that the companies who gave out mortgages, at least in general, have been making money off of interests.",
        "But there are other people who essentially have invested, aren't there?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "This is what I meant when I talked about mortgages being sold back to Wall Street.",
        "What happened was if a company - if a mortgage company gave you a mortgage, right, you've borrowed that money from that company.",
        "Now, a bank, traditionally, needs you to be able to pay the interest back on that mortgage in order for them to make money.",
        "But the reason why so many of these mortgage companies were making loans that banks couldn't make is because they had an ace in the hole, and their ace in the hole was Wall Street.",
        "Many of the mortgage companies would essentially take a mortgage, lending you money, and then sell that mortgage as a bond or basically as debt to Wall Street, and the Wall Street investor would then take the risk off the shoulders of the mortgage banker.",
        "It's essentially me lending you money without having to worry about whether or not you pay me back because I've sold the IOU to my brother or my sister.",
        "That person takes the risk off of my shoulders so I don't really have to care whether or not you're a good credit risk because they've taken the risk off my shoulders, and in turn, they will make the money off of you paying the interest on the mortgage.",
        "So it's like a chain reaction, people are passing these things on.",
        "So who's left holding the buck?",
        "The person left holding the buck is going to be the investor at the other end of the table, the person who's - or the company, typically, a hedge fund or something like that who has bought that mortgage paper, that security or that bond from the company that lent you the money originally.",
        "And unfortunately, you, you're going to be left holding the bag because you've gotten the mortgage that you probably couldn't afford to begin with.",
        "And when that interest rate readjusts upward - we're talking specifically about somebody who was in the subprime mortgage that was also in adjustable rate mortgage, meaning that it was typically a very low rate for a year or so, maybe three years, and then it would readjust upward once rates changed in a couple of years.",
        "Those are the people who are left holding the bag.",
        "So when you have the Federal Reserve lowering the interest rate, is this something that's going to really affect somebody who's just stretched and who's saving every dollar to try to make sure they pay their mortgage?",
        "Is that who's affected by this drop in rates?",
        "Well, the unfortunate part about it is you could - there's a strong argument to be made is that it doesn't really help the person who's stretched by their mortgage payments.",
        "There are a ton of these mortgages that are still out there that haven't readjusted - with the interest rates, haven't changed yet.",
        "They're going to come do the - you know, the readjustment period is going to take place over the next one year, the next two, maybe even three years.",
        "So you're still going to see more and more people whose rates are going to adjust upward, I mean, even with the rates being bumped down slightly, they're still above where they were three years ago when many people bought the houses that they bought.",
        "So it's not necessarily going to help that person.",
        "What it is going to do is stimulate the economy, hopefully, in some other ways by making credit more available to people who haven't yet bought houses or to companies who haven't invested in equipment, to companies or investors who want to do some borrowing and put more money into their own enterprises.",
        "But it's not necessarily going to help the person who's in trouble with the mortgage right now.",
        "True or false: Someone who is not an economist said, oh, this is a great time to buy real estate if you have perfect credit because everyone is searching for people with perfect credit."

        "You know, it's not really - what's happening in the market is not really helping them.",
        "Mortgage companies and bankers got so restrictive with what they lend because of the problems that they had with all these subprime loans that, really, many of them should never have been made in the first place, I mean, that's where you need to start is that many of these loans should never have been made.",
        "But because they've had so much - so many problems and so many defaults and so many foreclosures go on, that even people with perfect credit today are having a tough time borrowing the money to buy a house that they can afford.",
        "So, theoretically, yes, it's a good time to buy a home right now.",
        "You're definitely in a buyer's market.",
        "You've got many more options if you're a buyer.",
        "You've got much more negotiating power than you had three years ago.",
        "The big question is whether or not you can find somebody to lend you money.",
        "And, in many cases, people who have impeccable credit can't find a lender to give them the money.",
        "Is that going to actually cause housing prices potentially to go down even lower?",
        "Because if you have people who actually want to buy, and a lot of people don't want to buy right now, but they can't get the loans, I would assume that that means that the people who've got the for sale signs out are going to have even more trouble.",
        "But Don Tapscott argues that universities must change or die, radically alter both the way they teach and how they develop a curriculum.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "Every economist, every realtor that I've talked to has said that this trouble is not over.",
        "You've probably got at least another year, maybe, you know, another 18 months of downward pressures on housing prices especially in markets on the coast where you've got these housing prices that have gone up by incredible, unrealistic multiples for several years, double-digit percentage gains in the cost of - or the going rate for a home or for a condo over the last three, four, five years.",
        "Some of that - some of those prices just - really, honestly, they need to come down.",
        "And that's going to hurt some people who are trying to sell houses.",
        "But that's really the only way for the market to get back to some stability.",
        "I mean, if you, you know if you're charging, if the going rate for a condo is $400,000 in a marginal neighborhood in Boston or $600,000 in a really not so desirable neighborhood of New York, I mean, at some point, there just isn't going to be a buyer left out there for that condo or for that single family until the price comes down.",
        "It has to come down for there to be some rationality back in the housing market again.",
        "Now, getting back to this whole question of the interest rate, is there any possible downside to individuals or to investors or to the health of the country in lowering the interest rate?",
        "Actually, there is.",
        "Remember when we started the conversation and I talked about this, or you actually brought up this house of cards effect.",
        "Well, so many things in the economy are tied to so many other things.",
        "And the point that I made was that, you know, the economy was really kept afloat for the last several years by consumer spending, and much of that consumer spending has been fueled by borrowing."

        "Actually, many people - many economists do think right now that the impact of lowering interest rates, really, is to help Wall Street and not necessarily going to help consumers that much at all, that this is really a bailout for wealthy investors who are having problems because they can't borrow the money that they used to be able to borrow to make some of the investments that they were making.",
