        "We'll have to take one at a time, first pedagogy, how we teach.",
        "Well, if someone were frozen 100 years ago and they miraculously came back today, and they looked at the professions, a doctor in an operating theater, a pilot in a jumbo jet, an engineer designing a bridge, they'd say: Wow, has the world ever changed, and technology has been at the heart of these changes.",
        "If they walked into a lecture theater at a university, they'd look around, they'd say, well, I recognize this.",
        "I mean, the model of pedagogy has remained unchanged for centuries, and it's a broadcast model of learning.",
        "You know, as I said, I'm a teacher, I have knowledge, you're a student, you don't; get ready, here it comes.",
        "Well, this is a teacher-focused model, it's one way.",
        "It's one-size-fits-all, and the student is isolated in the learning process.",
        "And we need to move towards a collaborative model of learning that's student-focused, it's highly customized and that is a model appropriate for a new generation that learns differently.",
        "And if we don't do this, I think that the university is going to come into a period of very deep crisis very quickly.",
        "I was struck by the example you used in the book of a - you used a psychology professor who comes on and has to develop a course for his students, and well, you describe it.",
        "Well, there are a number of examples, but let me just give one that's quite personal and that really gets to the point.",
        "It was 1975, and I was doing a Master's degree in educational psychology, and I took a grad course in statistics.",
        "And it was all online.",
        "We had a lab, and the prof was there to structure a customized learning experience for me.",
        "I went over things I didn't understand until I got them right.",
        "I remember thinking: You know, if someone was watching me right now, they'd think I was really dumb.",
        "But I did it until I got it.",
        "Things I did understand I went through quickly.",
        "There were no lectures, but let's face it, the statistics lecture by definition is a bust, right?",
        "There's no one-size-fits-all for statistics.",
        "Everyone in the classroom is either bored or else they don't get it.",
        "And you know, I got an A, and so did most kids, up from a B-minus, on the same class of standardized tests from two years earlier.",
        "This is 35 years ago.",

        "You also cite an example of MIT, which has, well, taken the next step.",
        "Well, MIT's taken the next step but largely on the second big issue, which is how content gets created.",
        "I mean, how bizarre that there are thousands, I don't know, tens of thousands of statistics professors or math professors around the world teaching kids what an analysis of variance is, and they've all got their own notes and their own little tests and their own routines and their own PowerPoint and increasingly their own little software tools and so on.",

        "From the 19th century, you know, it's been used to designate a world where intellectuals engage in pursuits that are disconnected from others and from the practical concerns of everyday life.",
        "And we need to break down these walls to create what we describe in \"\"Macrowikinomics\"\" as a global network for higher learning, and I'd be happy to talk about that one too.",

        "What ideas can you share for using social media in the classroom without ending up having students Facebooking throughout my class?",
        "Well, in a sense, Neal, what we're talking about is social media.",
        "It's about applying social media to create social learning or collaborative learning.",

        "And it's appropriate for this new generation.",

        "You know, my generation, the boomers, grew up watching 24 hours a week of TV per kid.",

        "But this is affecting actual brain development, and overall the brain science says - this is still controversial - but the brain science that I've studied, and I did a $4 million research project on this - is that this is creating a brain that thinks and learns differently, and it's more appropriate for the 21st century.",
        "I mean, let me just give you an example.",
        "I have parents come up to me and say: How is it that my 14-year-old can get A's, and she's doing her homework while she's also doing five other things at once?",

        "So it looks like she's doing five things at once, but she isn't.",
        "And she's grown up collaborating.",
        "So I grew up being broadcast to, and the whole broadcast model in the university was fine for me.",
        "I mean, I went to lectures, and that's kind of the way I learned.",
        "But this is a generation that's grown up interacting, and this is actually affecting the wiring of their brains.",
        "Most - a third of the human brain gets built during extended adolescence, age eight to 18.",
        "And how you spend your time determines - after your DNA that's the most important variable determining what your brain is like.",
        "So all these kids that have grown up collaborating and thinking differently walk into a university, and they're asked to sit there and passively listen to someone talking about Peter Drucker when they could go and interact and collaborate and just learn much better about him.",
        "So even if that broadcast model served you and me and a lot of other people well enough, it is not going to do well enough now.",
        "Well, that's a huge driver on why we need to change the model of pedagogy, is we have a new generation of student that learns differently.",

        "And it's a pretty sensible idea.",
        "It's got, very quickly, five levels that we describe in \"\"Macrowikinomics,\"\" but the first would just be content exchange.",

        "At a fourth level, teachers and students use this platform to collaborate and create whole new knowledge beyond courseware, and in doing so start to change the way that scholars research, collaborate and generate knowledge that's going to be required for a new century."
