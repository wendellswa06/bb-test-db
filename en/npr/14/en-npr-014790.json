        "And so I just want to let you know we got a strategy.",

        "Well, the problem is a good deal for a buyer is generally a not so good deal for a seller who's facing foreclosure.",
        "Here's what the instructor - his name is Steven Goff - told me afterwards.",
        "If the seller can't make the monthly payments, that's really not our problem, and one thing that we stress in our seminars is not to take advantage of people, to actually help them out of their situation, maybe give them some moving money and save their credit with the bank.",
        "It's okay to make money, but also help the other person out at the same time and make it a win-win situation.",
