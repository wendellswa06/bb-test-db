        "And, Emily, first off, how many people will end up having to go to a clinic that's not, as you suggested there, the one they want?",
        "Well, this clinic in Clarksville used to take about 50 new patients each week, which is about 2,500 a year.",
        "And the VA notes that these veterans can still technically get on the waiting list even here, but in reality they're going somewhere else for their care.",

        "I showed them my VA card, and they told me that I couldn't be seen because they had no room for any more new patients.",
        "So since then, they've been paying out of pocket for some care, and for more extensive appointments, they have to drive down to the VA hospital in Nashville, which is about an hour away.",
        "They're OK with that for now because they're in their early 60s and can still drive long distances",
        "As you say, can still drive long distances, but I'm taking a guess they don't want to.",
        "Right.",
        "Steve told me that driving an hour instead of driving 10 minutes is a pretty big difference.",
        "If people who can't get into the clinic at Clarksville are referred somewhere else, doesn't that just make the wait longer at those other clinics?",
        "Yes, that is a problem.",
        "I visited this tiny clinic in Dover, Tenn., which is one of the places where patient who can't get into Clarksville are being referred.",
        "The clinic's manager told me that about a third of his new patients are coming from Clarksville, which is making everything busier."
