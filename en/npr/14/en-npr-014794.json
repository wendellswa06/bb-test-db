        "Yeah.",
        "So I think Eric and I have had exactly the same debate between ourselves.",
        "This is where I say we were right until we were wrong.",
        "Justin Wolfers says, look, what they were measuring was pretty simple.",
        "They were looking at moments where key events happened in the campaign.",
        "When, say, the FBI said it was looking at Clinton's emails, the odds of Clinton winning went down, and the stock market went down.",
        "They could do math and figure out how much this was affecting the stock market, and both economists stick by their numbers.",
        "And on election night, at first, the market kept behaving that way.",
        "As the count proceeded and it became increasingly likely that Trump was going to be president, we saw stock markets cratering.",
        "By about midnight on election night, the U.S.",
        "stock market was down about 5 percent, which actually hit the circuit breakage, so our predictions looked very good.",
        "But then Trump came out and spoke.",
        "He talked about infrastructure spending.",
        "He looked more presidential.",
        "Maybe that's why, but for some reason, more investors got more optimistic and started buying stocks, and the market went up.",
        "Now, maybe it's not surprising that the economists agree that they were measuring things properly, but here's the part that they admit Uri is right about.",
        "Uri asks what is the use of research like this if the accuracy of the results is so short-lived?",
        "They were right for maybe the first few hours after it was clear that Trump won.",
        "But I think they failed to understand or predict what would happen when people started to absorb the Trump victory.",
        "It's dead right, and I plead guilty.",
        "And let me say the other people who should plead guilty is every trader in financial markets.",
        "But why did investors in the market so completely change their minds?",
        "There are a bunch of theories out there.",
        "One is that there's something about human psychology that makes us look at things differently once they're a reality and not just some imagined future.",
        "So maybe that's why investors started focusing more on the stimulus of tax cuts and infrastructure spending instead of fear and uncertainty.",
        "Also, maybe there's a momentum factor here.",
        "For most of us, Thanksgiving is the most stress-free of holidays, when we gather in our reindeer sweaters, maybe watch a little football and stuff ourselves silly, except of course for the cook, who in between cooking a 17-pound turkey and arranging flowers over the in-laws' heirloom china can be overwhelmed and maybe even terrified."
