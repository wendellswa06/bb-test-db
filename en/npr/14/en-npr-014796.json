        "Ina Garten, you might be surprised to know that Ina Garten did not start out as a cook.",
        "She started as a wonk in the White House, in fact, before she was the Barefoot Contessa.",

        "And I just think it's wonderful.",
        "You know, cooking really is not about the food as much as it is if you cook, everybody comes to your table.",
