        "This is a huge loss for NBC.",

        "So Procter & Gamble, they're an actual sponsor of the Olympics.",
        "And that meant that they could use Lindsey Vonn if she were actually competing.",

        "Does that open some opportunities for some of those companies now?",
        "Yes, the clear winner is Under Armour.",
        "They developed a winter ad campaign that features Lindsay Vonn throughout the advertisement.",
        "And they're going to be able to keep that advertisement up and running during the Olympics, when Lindsey is still going to be a topic of conversation, and still going to be a top of mind for a lot of viewers of the Olympics - even though she's not participating.",
        "So in a funny twist here, you actually see a sponsor who's going to be able to use an Olympic athlete during the games, in a way that they wouldn't have been otherwise.",
        "But Procter & Gamble, which is an Olympic sponsor, was going to make her the face of their advertising around the Thank You Mom campaign that they've developed.",
        "And if you've seen these commercials you basically need to wipe your eyes after you've seen them, because they're just very emotional - talking about moms picking up kids from the age of four all the way up until they come down the slopes in their first Olympics.",
        "And Lindsey -Lindsey was just going to be a spokesperson for that.",
        "And they're not going to be up to use her the same way they would have after the Olympics.",
        "They'll be a use her leading up to it but not afterwards.",
        "Any long-term implications for Lindsey Vonn when it comes to either her skiing career, or on the business side, the endorsements that she hopes to have?",
        "I think the long-term implication will really play out over the next four years.",
        "Lindsey is 29, she's got one more Olympics in her.",
        "Now, if she's able to come back and perform well at that Olympics then she could still cement her name among all-time Olympic greats.",
        "And that could be great for her opportunities for appearances and endorsements after her competing days are over."
