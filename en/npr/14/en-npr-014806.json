        "I'm wondering how much affect or change can a retired general have, and is there any avenue within the active military to voice these concerns?",

        "Lt.",

        "I just - I get so frustrated hearing - you have so much experience, direct knowledge, and you seem to be the one, or one of the few, who probably can give us a set of ideas or maybe were positioned to give us the right map or roadmap, if you will, early on.",
        "And it seemed to be that your concerns were not heeded, and now here we are, you know, still dealing with this so many years later.",
        "And I wish there was an avenue for the active military to really get their point across and it would be listened to.",

        "If it's about national security or foreign policy, the executive privilege is at its greatest, balanced against other interests, but if it's about Hurricane Katrina, for example, I think the presidential interest is not nearly as strong.",
        "Professor Shane, let's turn to you.",
        "Do you notice distinct differences in how recent administrations have interpreted and evoked executive privilege.",
        "The Clinton administration had a more pragmatic view, more like the Ford and Carter administrations, until of course, the impeachment investigations led to a series of executive privilege claims, most of which were unsuccessful.",
        "Yes, yes, go ahead, Mr. Marcus.",
        "If I could just add one thing, I think, to Peter's summary, and that is that the increased emphasis on executive privilege in the current administration coincides with their view that it's very important to reassert a strong doctrine of presidential power, and you see that reflected in the current controversy about the NSA surveillance program, for example.",
        "So the two go hand in hand, I think.",
        "Well, both Republican and Democratic administrations have said it's very disruptive and quite a chore for them to have to marshal their thoughts together and testify, and they've also expressed the opinion that not only is it a chore that interrupts their everyday acquittal of their duties, but that it could encourage of just cover-your-backism mentality.",
        "And I wonder how both of you gentlemen, who both served in government, feel about that.",
        "I think there's something to that, but I do think, when the issues are important enough, that in today's world it becomes untenable for the White House to maintain the position that officials like the National Security Advisor and the Domestic Policy Chief can never be required to come up and testify before Congress."
