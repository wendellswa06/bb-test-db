        "I do think what Dan said is exactly right, that there's been a trend over the last 30 years toward the concentration of decision making authority in the White House, often to the detriment of decision making at the cabinet level.",
        "If the decisions, same decisions were made at the cabinet level, there's no question that these people would be susceptible to testifying before Congress, and part of the dynamic here, and you can see it in the examples we're citing, is of course, the dynamic of partisan politics, and it's interesting to note that one of the big differences between the current Congress and, say, the Democratic Congress that President Carter faced or that President Clinton face in the opening years of his administration is that during those years, even though you had a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress, the members of Congress were still enormously vigorous with regard to protecting the institutional prerogatives of the legislative branch.",
        "Their allegiance was at least as much to the institution as to the party, and the Republican Congress has been much more deferential to the executive, much less willing to go to the mat over institutional prerogative of the legislature than their Democratic predecessors.",
        "Gentlemen, thank you both very much for being with us.",

        "So far, President Trump has tried to run the White House a lot like the way he ran his family business.",
        "That means little rigid organization and a small group of staffers who are loyal but not necessarily experienced.",

        "That's not the case to the northeast of this fire.",
        "There are thousands of people and a city in that direction, so that's where most of the efforts and aircraft are being focused right now.",
        "Today, it is a bit cooler here and that's helping a lot.",
        "The problem the firefighters have been running into for the last week, when the fire was doubling and tripling in size, is that this fire is so massive and so hot that it's generating its own weather.",
        "So, every day you see these big columns of smoke building up tall enough that they can be seen from Fresno or 100 miles away.",
        "And then those columns collapse because they can't support their own weight.",
        "And when that happens, you get this huge outflow of air from the collapsing column that sends fire in every direction.",

        "Now, Nate, you mentioned a city potentially in harm's way here.",
        "There was some worry that this fire could threaten the water and power supplies of San Francisco.",

        "And two of the three hydroelectric power stations up here have been shut down because of the fire.",
        "The utilities commission has said that people shouldn't expect any outages, though.",
        "They can get the power from elsewhere if and when it's needed.",
        "Now, we've also been hearing that two stands of giant sequoias are threatened by this fire.",
        "Have crews managed to keep the flames away from those trees?",
        "Yeah, so far.",
        "I mean, so there are two separate groves of giant sequoias that are threatened.",
        "Those are groves that have trees in them that are up to 2,000 years old, so that's a pretty high priority.",
        "Firefighters have put in fuel breaks around the trees and are wetting them with sprinkler systems, but you gotta understand that the fire is still about three to five miles away from both of those stands."

        "The thing that they are concerned about is that when this fire was up and going, like it was most of last week, it was moving at about a mile an hour, so it can cover that ground pretty fast if it gets a head of steam.",

        "Sequoias are naturally fireproof, for the most part.",
        "Their bark can be 24 inches thick.",
        "So in a lot of ways, they're even fire dependent.",
        "I talked to one of the park officials yesterday and he says that fire releases the tree's seeds from their cones and they clear out a lot of the brush, which helps the young sequoias grow.",
        "The problem is, is that this is not like a normal fire, a healthy fire.",
        "It is destroying everything, even burning the nutrients out of the soil.",
        "So if it hits those trees with that sort of intensity, it won't do any good.",
        "Well, apart from the sequoias, what would be the biggest concern for Yosemite National Park now?",
        "Well, the fire's only burned about 15,000 acres of the park, which is pretty small in comparison to the whole lot of it.",
        "The bigger thing is, the fire's burned across highway 120, which has closed the road and the park's bigger attractions, like Half Dome, are off that road so they're nearly inaccessible.",
        "You got to remember it's still tourist season here.",
