        "Trump is a wrestler; the others are boxers.",
        "As Barthes wrote, quoted by Legum, a boxing match is a story which is constructed before the eyes of the spectator; in wrestling, on the contrary, it is each moment which is intelligible, not the passage of time.",
        "I'll let you wrestle with that one.",

        "(Laughter) Yeah.",
        "He's completely writing the handbook for everything that we know about politics.",

        "We base it all on history.",
        "And you know, if you look at the electorate today, it really shouldn't be that surprising because people are so fed up with the system that along comes this guy with huge brass clankers throwing up a middle finger salute to Washington, and that's exactly the message that people want to send today.",
        "They love this alpha male.",
        "They like this predator hunter who's tapping into our caveman DNA.",
        "Voters just want someone to go out, hunt and kill some prey, and that prey is the politicians in Washington.",
        "He's also very anti-illegal immigrant in a party whose base is very anti-illegal immigrant.",
        "He's a very rich businessman in a party that greatly honors businessmen and nominated a very rich guy - Mitt Romney last time.",
        "Maybe he's just a man for his times in the party.",
        "Is that the explanation?",

        "Do you think this can go on for another year, or do you assume that it peters out sometime in the spring?",
        "I think there's three scenarios.",
        "Scenario one is the conventional wisdom, which is that Super PACs will unload on him; Carly Fiorina and Jeb Bush and others will beat up on him and that that will ultimately mean that he fades away.",
        "If that was going to happen, it would've happened by now.",
        "I think a more likely scenario is that he sustains now, goes all the way through the nominating process and actually gathers enough delegates - not the nomination, but enough delegates - to be a real nuisance at the convention where he can leverage some agreement or get something out of it so that he can walk away with a win.",
        "Scenario three is wild and improbable, but think about it.",
        "He starts to gather enough delegates where it actually looks like he could win the nomination.",
        "The Republican establishment completely freaks out.",
        "They get together and say, this is unacceptable, but it looks like it's going to happen.",

        "And it will be all about the money and who they back.",
        "Last night's debate was the first time when the other candidates seemed not to assume that Donald Trump will sink of his own weight, but they better try to torpedo him fast.",
        "How do you think he did?",
        "I think Trump did just fine.",
        "I don't - I mean, he took a lot of shots, but I didn't think - I saw nothing that suggested that it was a mortal wound.",
        "But in presidential campaigns, people don't really vote on issues.",
        "They vote on a constellation of attributes.",
        "The attributes that are most important are strength, trust and values.",
        "And the most important of those attributes is the procession of the candidate as a strong leader.",
        "And (laughter) the strongest guy on the stage that exudes that sort of confidence, strength and power is obviously Donald Trump.",
