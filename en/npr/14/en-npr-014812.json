        "We started walking up to the base just after 3:00 a.m. and we're now - I guess we're at about 8,500 feet elevation, they're telling me.",
        "But more importantly to me, right now, is that we're all hanging off - about 800 feet up the Snake Dyke, which is a pretty sheer rock face and we're looking out at a gorgeous view of Yosemite.",
        "The smoke is coming in a little bit from that rim forest fire, but it's gorgeous looking around, and I won't waste any more time.",

        "The weather's perfect and we're hanging off the side of a mountain at about 800 feet.",
        "Now, as we mentioned earlier, you are a veteran who's suffered an injury and I was wondering if you could tell us what happened to you and how you reached this point where you're kind of hanging off the face of a mountain.",
        "Yes, ma'am.",
        "On August 17th, 2009, I was shot in the left forearm by a Taliban insurgent with an AK-47.",
        "It tore through the medial and ulnar nerve of my left arm and as a result I lost movement and feeling in my left arm and hand.",

        "And, you know, that's kind of the same way that people that have certain, you know, to make adaptations or have certain disabilities that they got to get over, you know, everything's a problem that they got to just learn how to work through.",
        "That's kind of the way climbing is.",
        "Andrew, tell us a little bit about your disabilities.",

        "How do you feel that this honors other veterans like yourself and those who have fallen in the wars?",

        "I just couldn't fathom it.",
