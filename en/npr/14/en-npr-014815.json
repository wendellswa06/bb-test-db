        "I guess just really hoping to conspire with the people that make good, you know, good steps forward, good strides forward to improving their life and taking on these challenges and seeing what - there is life after injury and, you know, they can be that person.",
        "What is it like for you to climb with a prosthetic?",
        "I mean, hearing you make the adjustments there, I'd love to get some idea of what this process is like for you.",
        "It's - I guess for lack of better words, it's just a constant adaptation.",
        "You know, climbing, you know, it takes a lot of thinking, a lot of chest type work, I guess you could say, and learning how to trust the prosthetic and knowing what it can do and what it can't do, because it's nothing like trusting your true, you know, your muscle and your bone, and you know, it's not your real body.",
        "So it's just a constant challenge for me.",
        "And it's just really just a constant - it's really just a constant gut check, nerve check for me, really.",
        "A nerve check?",
        "Really?",
        "After all you've been through?",
        "Yeah, it is.",
        "I mean, when you think of everything I've been through, I mean, I didn't set out that gate knowing that I was gonna get hurt that day, but we set out anyways.",
        "So I mean, in a sense, you know, death is kind of around the corner just about everywhere you go.",
        "So I mean, you can't never choose how you're gonna go, but you can choose how you're going to live, and this is how I choose to live.",

        "I lost my left eye.",
        "I lost the use of my right ankle.",
        "And I lost my upper palate and the upper roof and upper jaw of my mouth.",
        "So even though my injuries were - I guess - pretty severe, I had a rather quick recovery and decided to figure out how to get back to the things that I loved doing growing out, but doing it differently."

        "So to combine all of that experience, that brings us all together, is pretty powerful.",
        "Here, sitting halfway up Snake Dike, which is one of the greatest rock climbs in America, and to do it relying on your belayer, relying on your fellow members of the climbing team, is absolutely no different than that feeling you get when you're out with your fire team or your squad, your platoon or company and you're downrange and you're relying your life on somebody else.",

        "What made the speech underwhelming is that Mr. Kibaki's remarks were surprisingly mild considering what has been going on in the country for these past five or six days."
