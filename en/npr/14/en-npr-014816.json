        "I've just come from Western Kenya, from a town called Eldoret, where there has been terrific ethnic tension and some terrible killings.",
        "In fact, the hospital administrator there told me that as many as 50 bodies have been located by hospital officials around the area, but they're not able to bring the bodies to the morgue because the security situation is so tense on the ground.",
        "Also this morning, when I flew out of Eldoret on my way back to Nairobi, I saw no less than 37 farmhouses that were either on fire or had been burned to the ground.",
        "So this political context has enraged so many people around this country and they are paying with their lives.",
        "And how is the challenger - Raila Odinga, the man who says he was voted in as president - how has he responded to all this violence?",
        "You know, his comments, Renee, have been just as mild as the president's.",
        "It's as if these two men are in a death grip with one another and they're unable to see their constituents.",
        "You know, when asked, for instance, whether it might be more wise to ask his supporters not to (unintelligible) riot police and defy a governmental order not to rally today, he said - Mr. Odinga said that he did not want to deny his constituents their right to free speech.",
        "In other words, he was willing to send his supporters into a rally where they might face a water canon and tear gas or something worse.",
        "Absolutely, absolutely.",
        "Now he also today, this afternoon, went to the city morgue and made a very impassioned speech accusing members of other ethnics groups - he himself is a Luo - and he was accusing them and other ethnic groups of targeting his constituents and finding many of the remains of those constituents at the morgue.",
        "So you know, Mr. Odinga is a populist, he is adept at capturing the mood of a crowd, and people here have been taken aback by the kind of violence that we've seen over the past several days.",
        "No one really knows what to make of it, and you know, and so all there really is at this point is wonderment and passion.",
        "South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu is in Nairobi to help mediate the conflict.",
        "Officials in Washington and the European Union also are reportedly working on proposed measures to resolve the crisis.",
        "Does it look like any of that is having any effect?",
        "Not an immediate effect.",
        "There is a lot going on behind the scenes.",
        "I think both of these men - on the president as well as Mr. Odinga - are both under a great deal of international pressure.",
        "But at this point, there is no outside entity that can be called a hero in this situation.",
        "Perhaps it's too early in the process for any resolution that is satisfactory to all parties to be reached.",
        "Gwen, thanks very much.",
        "Thank you, Renee."

        "I'm sure there are many aspects to this case we're going to be studying for a long time, and in the etiology of the actual problem itself and the responses of the Obama administration versus the way the Bush administration responded, when the so-called shoe bomber, Richard Reid, had his aborted airline attempt in late 2001.",
        "So far, we can see that President Obama has been quicker to take personal responsibility himself and to issue a report.",
        "But in a way, that's understandable, in that the Bush administration was still, you know, recovering from the shock from 9/11.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "And, Tamara, I mean, this is basically a pep rally, right?",
        "Or was there more to the president's message?",
        "Oh, it was totally a pep rally, right down to the introduction where Congressman Xavier Becerra called him the captain of the Democrats' team.",
        "And then there was applause and the president came in.",
        "He talked about things that he's talked about before, about prioritizing job creation and creating an economy that works for everyone, talked about education, got very passionate when talking about the sequester, those automatic spending cuts that are supposed to hit.",
        "He feels that Democrats are in a stronger position there than Republicans.",
        "And then, he talked about immigration reform and reducing gun violence.",
        "And he said that particularly on those two issues that he knows that there are what he euphemistically called regional differences, that some Democrats are going to have a hard time getting on board with what he's asking for.",
        "Those are Democrats in conservative districts.",
        "And this is more of an issue in the Senate than in the House, but there are certainly House members who can't get on board with what he's asking for."

        "And this included non-controversial items, but then they also talked about wanting universal background checks, which have gotten sort of controversial, and things like banning large ammunition magazines or calling for a strengthened assault weapons ban.",
        "And there's a growing political consensus that the assault weapons ban is just not going to be politically possible in the Senate and especially in the House, where Republicans just won't bring it up.",

        "I mean, what kind of questions did they put to them?",
        "You know, it's interesting.",

        "And, you know, you would think that the questions would include gun control or the sequester, but instead there was a real strong focus on climate change.",
        "Apparently, there were three questions on climate change.",
        "And the president apparently said that he feels it's a very big, important issue.",
        "Obviously, he does because he talked about it in his inaugural address.",
        "But he also said that they can't do everything at once and that immigration has to come first and dealing with the sequester and budget issues and gun control.",
        "So it seemed like he was preparing Democrats to have patience on that one."
