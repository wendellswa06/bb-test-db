        "But, you know, I thought Gonzales came out and said that he was responsible, but then he had nothing to do with it.",
        "He says the chief of staff had resigned, but then he said well, yeah, he's actually still working in the building.",
        "So I'm not sure how he advanced the ball yesterday and he's probably in just about as much trouble right now.",
        "And this was a quick news conference.",
        "It was nine minutes on my analog watch, but he couldn't get out of there fast enough.",
        "I was watching his toes wiggling, and his feet.",
        "He was shifting his feet back and forth.",
        "The questions were just being shouted, and he finally just turned and wheeled after saying that he thinks after all this that the right decision was made, which sort of begs the question of what he was out there apologizing for in the first place.",
        "He had, you write, the look of a hunted man.",
        "Well, and he is.",
        "I mean, you know, it's one thing for the, you know, Democrats like Chuck Schumer in the Senate to call for your resignation.",
        "I mean, that's something of a badge of honor for an administration official.",
        "But even the guys like John Cornyn, the senator from Texas who's very loyal to the administration, was saying, you know, this really doesn't look good.",
        "And you know, the best he could say for Gonzales was that he should have a fair trial before the hanging.",
        "But he wasn't sort of ruling out the hanging, which is not exactly what Gonzales wants to hear."
