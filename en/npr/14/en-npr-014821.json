        "I'm interested in your guest's comments about his recent revelation in light of Clinton - what their party did to the Clinton administration behind the Lewinsky thing and that Rudy Giuliani is one of the top frontrunners, and his moral stance where marriage is concerned is very questionable.",
        "You comment on that.",
        "Okay, Ken Rudin?",
        "Well, I mean, Leon has basically talked about the problem a lot conservatives with the Republican frontrunners.",

        "I did.",
        "But the point is is that the Republican Party has always been the pro-family, pro-family-values party, and you have leading Republican candidates who have had questionable incidents in their past.",
        "Not that Democrats are any less or more moral, but that they don't make such a big case out of it.",
        "And the voters don't seem to care as much.",
        "Democratic voters don't seem to care as much as Republican voters do.",
        "Well, let's also talk briefly about the story that's coming out from campaign consultant Bob Schrum, advisor to Democratic candidates.",
        "He says that he was the guy who talked John Edwards into voting for the war authorization back when John Edwards was a member of the United States Senate and, well, this is a little embarrassing for John Edwards, is it not?",

        "He said no, I really voted for it on the merits.",

        "And the last thing he wanted to do is have to stand up and say no, no, no, no. I made that decision to vote for the war all on my own.",
