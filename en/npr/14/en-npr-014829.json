        "I apologize.",
        "I was - I've been confused about what Iran is doing, which is actually illegal.",
        "I had heard before that uranium enrichment was considered okay under the terms of the treaty to which Iran's a signatory, but that the motivations were suspect.",
        "We're think they're motivated to make nuclear weapons.",
        "Iran's saying they're motivated to make nuclear power.",
        "So if you could clear up my confusion, I'd appreciate it.",
        "Okay, Joe Cirincione, the Non-Proliferation Treaty does allow signatories to enrich uranium.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "If you were to look at what Iran is doing right now and assume that all their doing is what we could see, everything they're doing is legal.",
        "The treaty allows you to build nuclear reactors.",
        "It allows you to build factories to make the fuel for those nuclear reactors; that's the uranium enrichment process.",
        "All that's legal.",
        "There are two problems.",
        "One is, as you mentioned, suspicion about their motives.",
        "Normally, a country does not make their own fuel; it's way too expensive to do that.",
        "You have to have 20 reactors to make this economically viable.",
        "Iran doesn't even have one reactor operating yet, yet they're rushing ahead to build the fuel.",
        "And the reason to be suspicious is because those same facilities that can enrich uranium for fuel could be used to enrich uranium for bombs.",
        "So you're suspect.",
        "The illegalities come in in the fact that Iran hid most of this uranium enrichment work for over - almost 20 years now.",
        "And there's a series of violations of their treaty obligations.",
        "They should have disclosed that they were importing this material.",
        "They should have disclosed that they were beginning to do experiments that involved nuclear materials and centrifuges.",
        "There's 14 specific instances where they should have reported this, and they didn't.",
        "Obviously, this is serious because the purpose of the reporting is to give other countries a heads up that a country is moving in this direction.",
        "Those are the violations that Iran is being held accountable for now.",
        "And just today, Mohamed ElBaradei, the head of the IAEA and, of course, recent Nobel Peace Prize winner, said that he's unable to issue verification of what exactly Iran is doing; still unable after all this time.",
        "It's actually surprisingly tricky to cut things with those giant scissors, so make sure you practice once at the office before you go out there."

        "Thanks very much.",
        "That's a great answer, and it's scary because it rings of the same thing that we went to war on Iraq, the hiding of the evidence, the hiding of the motives.",

        "And part of the reason why the Iranians are not just rushing towards a weapon -and this is important for us to understand in Washington because sometimes we're making too many assumptions - is because of the fact that Iran, within the region, is one of the largest and most powerful states.",
        "It has a natural, conventional superiority vis-à-vis many of its neighbors.",
        "If it were to weaponize - and it would kick off - spark a nuclear arms race in the region, many of the smaller states would also go for a nuclear weapon and then suddenly Iran would find itself at a strategic parity with small countries like Bahrain, whereas right now it has a superiority vis-à-vis them.",
        "The Iranians are well aware of this and they are very careful not to make that mistake.",
        "Bahrain is, I guess, a potential threat down the road; perhaps Saudi Arabia working with Egyptian technology is what some people are worried about, as well.",
        "Nevertheless, Iran right now has nuclear neighbors on one side -Pakistan and India - on the other side, Israel.",
        "Sure, but the Iranians have deterrence capabilities against almost all of those countries.",
        "The one country the Iranians lack a deterrence capability against is the United States.",
        "And when we're looking at nuclear proliferation, we have to also take into consideration the demand side of it.",
        "What is it that causes nations to demand a nuclear deterrence?",
        "Right now, in the case of Iran, it is because of the animosity between the United States and Iran; that is the primary driving force of their program.",
        "If we can do something, and I think the Bush administration is trying to go on the right track here to reduce that animosity, much of that demand can also be eliminated.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "As you look at the negotiations, and these are, as Joe was saying, as our correspondent in Iran was saying, still talks about talks thus far.",
        "But are they headed down the right track, do you think?",
        "Well, talks about talks is - at the end of the day, still a step forward.",
        "That's right.",
        "Because in the past, we didn't even have that.",
        "As agreeable as the pre-conditions set has been for the United States to join the talk, there is a risk with that, and that is that pre-conditions beget pre-conditions.",
        "Thus far, the Iranians have not set any pre-conditions, but we shouldn't do anything to invite them to do so."

        "What I think the big question mark in Tehran is right now is to see, is this new initiative from the United States a strategic initiative or is it a tactical initiative?",
        "Is the United States strategically involved in this to be able to find a diplomatic solution, or is this a tactical maneuver to make it easier to go to the Security Council?",

        "Faithfully the office of president of the United States...",
        "Let me just say, one of the ways the Iranians might test this is they'll come back with a pre-condition of their own, and that will be that while they're negotiating, this docket be removed from the Security Council agenda and sent back to the IAEA.",

        "is going to come after you.",

        "They look at North Korea and they say look, North Korea had nuclear weapons, North Korea wasn't attacked.",
        "India has nuclear weapons and they've been accepted now as an ally of the United States, or offered a special sweetheart nuclear deal.",
        "The lesson, they say, is we have to get a weapon as quickly as possible.",
        "And if we just stay firm with our course, eventually the U.S.",
        "will back down.",
        "If I could also add something to that.",
        "The thinking that the caller referred to does exist in Israel.",
        "It's within a small number of people, but they're somewhat growing.",
        "And they're thinking basically is that as long as there isn't parity between Israel and Iran, Israel will be trapped in a situation in which it will try to find an absolute victory, a complete victory.",
        "But if there is parity, then both states will be forced to increase their communications in order to define red lines.",
        "And they say that that could actually be a positive thing.",

        "Two questions quickly about that Trita Parsi, and that is - well, parity.",
        "It would take a long time for Iran to develop parity with Israel, which is believed to have hundreds of nuclear weapons i.e. a second-strike capability.",
        "Iran would take a long time before it had that kind of capability.",
        "And B, you mentioned before, Iran's neighbors, the Gulf States - Turkey, Russia, the United States is not only in Iraq, but in Afghanistan, Pakistan - that's going to have repercussions throughout the region.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "But when it comes to strategic parity, you don't necessarily have to have 100 if the other side has 100.",
        "I mean, these are really, really horrific weapons.",
        "You just need a couple of - perhaps even one.",
        "What the Israelis have signaled to Iran, and done so quite clearly, is that Israel does have a second-strike capability.",
