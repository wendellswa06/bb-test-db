        "The debate was - the assertion was that by mistranslating what he said, by insisting that he said that Iran wanted to see Israel wiped off the map, that this was leading to misinterpretation of Iranian intentions and then to bad policy."

        "The second part we can talk about, the first part I think we've - I wrote a story that appeared in yesterday's New York Times which laid out the reasons that wiped off - should be wiped off the map is as accurate a translation as we can get.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And so therefore, that is, apparently, given the limitations of metaphor, what he said.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, you know, we don't need to go through the entire philology, but in brief, it's that the Ayatollah Khomeini had said something like that in the early days of the revolution.",
        "It became a kind of slogan that you see on - written on missiles at military parades in Tehran fairly often -in English - Israel should be wiped off the map, and so on.",
        "And what happened is that when President Ahmadinejad spoke last October, he quoted Khomeini, he actually slightly misquoted him.",
        "And if you look at what Ahmadinejad said, it looks like he said something slightly more passive.",
        "But his own office on his own website has translated as wipe away, all the translators in Tehran did so at that time.",
        "And I think that the clear intention was that.",
        "Now, what does that mean?",
        "That's a separate question.",
        "Okay.",
        "Let it - getting back to what he said, though, he does not say -or what he doesn't say - the one word he does not say is Israel.",
        "That's true.",
        "Although he - although, Israel is written fairly often on these posters and on these missiles.",
        "But it's true that the president of Iran today says - talks about the occupying regime over Jerusalem, and that is part of the dispute.",
        "There are those who argue that what he's really saying is that Israel should disappear in the same way that the Soviet Union disappeared, in the same way that the Shah's regime disappeared.",
        "He's not calling for a military action against the Jewish State.",
        "But the other point of view - which to me is persuasive - is, again, not that he's calling for military action, but his refusal to say the word Israel is not because he wants to distinguish between the regime and the state; it's because he has such contempt for the state that he won't even say its name, as has been quite common in the Middle East for 50 years among many people.",
        "And one other factor is that he has raised doubts, at least in his mind, about the Holocaust.",
        "That's right.",
        "He continues to - in fact, he was interviewed by a German magazine only about a week ago.",
        "And this fascinating interview in which the correspondents are saying, but you must understand the evidence is just overwhelming.",
        "And he said no, no. There are two points of view.",
        "There are those who argue that the Jews were killed and then there are those that argue that they weren't killed.",
        "And I think that the reason that you're not looking at the second one is because you're under the sway of the Zionists and the Americans and nobody is willing to look at the truth."

        "Currently, those people are in the minority, and the pragmatists, sort of led by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, have pointed out to the president that that policy has been failing and that what it needs to do is open up a negotiating channel to see if they can negotiate it here.",
        "I think, quite frankly, this struggle is still unresolved.",
        "The hardliners that are willing to go along with it in the short-run, they may believe that the Iranians will never actually negotiate and the president will turn back to military options come the fall or spring, so that's why they don't want to take if off the table completely.",

        "Well, part of the thing - there's many things that President Ahmadinejad wanted to do.",
        "One of it was to make sure that there were a lot of talk shows in the United States about this.",
        "Because what we are doing right now is that we're pondering what is the other side thinking?",
        "The president wanted to make sure that he was throwing balls at the United States so that Iran could be in a greater control of the unfolding of events, instead of having to suffer the fate of Iraq, in which the United States was clearly in control of the unfolding of events.",
        "The other thing that's very important for the Iranians is to try to drag Israel into this equation, to make sure that Iran's nuclear issue is not spoken about and not discussed in isolation from Israel; not only Israel's nuclear arsenal, but Israel, in general.",
        "Because the more aggressive Iran's rhetoric becomes against Israel, the more difficult it will be for Arab states in the region that are U.S.",
        "allies to take a strong public position in favor of the American position.",
        "Because then they will come across, in their domestic political context, as if they're siding with Israel against another, right now quite popular, Islamic state, which is Iran.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "That is a useful point that Trita is making, Neal.",
        "And, in fact, today on the wires there is a poll showing that the inhabitants of several neighboring countries of Iran - I think they're Pakistan, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia - a majority of those polled said that they are more sympathetic to an Iranian nuclear weapon than to the American efforts to stop it."
