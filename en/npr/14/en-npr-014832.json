        "He's served nearly a decade on the city council in Santa Cruz, Calif.",
        "It's about the same size as Baytown, and the issues facing city governments are surprisingly universal - zoning regulations, pothole repair, parking restrictions; you name it.",
        "So to get some advice, Charles Johnson of Baytown sat down with Ryan Coonerty for our series Been There in which someone about to take a big step talks to someone who's already taken it.",

        "I certainly remember that oath of office, that moment where all of a sudden, you ran, campaigned, and then you're standing before your community with your hand in the air.",
        "And you know, you're upholding to some pretty high ideals to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and to really serve your community.",
        "And you realize it's quite an obligation you've undertaken, and it's humbling and inspiring and scary all at the same time.",
        "That is true.",
        "I had someone tell me that when I went up to my seat at the dais, they said the expression on my face was, wow, this is a lot.",
        "(Laughter) You know what?",
        "I take that to be a good sign - when you have that wow expression.",
        "You know, you'll pretty quickly realize the folks who don't have that wow expression on their face are going to be the most difficult people to work with whether they agree with you or not because this job humbles you pretty quickly.",
        "What was your relationship like with your colleagues, and was it hard interacting with people who had more experience than you?",
        "It is a challenging thing, and this is one of the things that's - you know, when you ran for office, it's an individual sport.",
        "You are out campaigning for yourself and trying to hit that one goal of just getting elected.",
        "Governing is a team sport, and it's a big, big change.",
        "And so getting to know your colleagues - ask them to give you a tour of their districts, and they can point out to you what their schools are and where there are potholes and where the traffic backs up 'cause they're going to know their district in a way that you won't.",
        "And then when it comes for the board, you understand what's motivating them.",
        "OK.",
        "What's motivating them - I've never thought of it in those terms.",
        "Already I've had people recognize me in public.",
        "How did you manage that?",
        "So somebody told me this when I first got elected - which was, when you go to the grocery store, buy your frozen food last..."

        "It's a challenge for your family.",

        "And I was like, wow, they - they're really playing on my emotions on this one.",
