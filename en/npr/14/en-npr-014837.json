        "Thirty-six-year-old former chemist Annie Dookhan is expected to plead guilty and start serving at least a three-year sentence for allegedly causing what may be the nation's largest forensic testing scandal.",
        "Massachusetts officials identified more than 40,000 criminal cases affected by testing Dookhan did during the nine years she worked at the now-closed Hinton State Lab.",
        "Michael O'Keefe, president of the Massachusetts District Attorneys Association, says prosecutors have sifted through hundreds of cases, and close to 350 people have been released from prison.",
        "MICHAEL O'KEEFE: Prosecutors have been pretty reasonable about this; dealing with a problem that is not of our making, and that has to be addressed by balancing individual liberty and public safety.",
        "But defense attorneys are quick to point to documents from the Dookhan investigation showing that some prosecutors would often contact her directly, and Dookhan would try to get their tests done more quickly.",
        "One prosecutor resigned after his emails with Dookhan became public.",
        "Anne Goldbach, of the Massachusetts Public Defenders Agency, says forensic scientists are supposed to be impartial.",
        "You can tell that Annie Dookhan felt a sense of allegiance to the prosecution, and that is absolutely unconscionable.",
        "The documents in the Dookhan case also show that for years, she tested thousands more drug samples than her colleagues.",
        "A WBUR analysis shows that between 2009 and 2010, the time it took Dookhan to conduct a test went down by more than half.",
        "Tom Workman is a defense attorney and forensic expert.",
        "She continued to decrease the turnaround time.",

        "They were dry-labbing.",
        "Dry-labbing is when a chemist just looks at a sample, with no actual testing involved.",
        "State police say Dookhan admitted to dry-labbing when they questioned her about a year ago.",
        "After Dookhan's arrest, five of her co-workers and state Public Health Commissioner John Auerbach resigned.",
        "In announcing his resignation, Auerbach admitted that his department - which oversaw the Hinton lab - was at fault."
