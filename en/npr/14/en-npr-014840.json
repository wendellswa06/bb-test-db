        "You're trying to influence people through the political process.",
        "It looks like the enemy is also now trying to influence people through the political process.",
        "And looking at this as a very, very long conflict, does that make your job harder?",
        "I wouldn't say the enemy is trying to influence things through the political process.",
        "They are--Zarqawi is actively trying to disrupt the political process and it's one of the problems he has with the Iraqi people, because they're interested in the future.",

        "I don't know if it makes it harder.",
        "It certainly makes it longer.",
        "But we have built a strategy that is based on increasing the capability of the Iraqis to deal with the situation and we're in the process of implementing that.",

        "So people will get a tattoo right there on their chest where they would put the paddle, telling people don't do that.",

        "The answer is yes.",
        "So fractals are these beautiful geometrical shapes that have - are sort of infinitely rugged, and the more you zoom in on them, the more detail you see on them.",
        "And so yes, there's this particular fractal called the Julia set.",
        "I have Julia sets sent to me.",
        "The question I always have is, you know, how detailed of a tattoo can you get if something is infinitively detailed?",
        "It might be a tricky thing for a tattoo.",

        "I think in general I like the ones that tell you a lot about the scientist, him or herself.",
        "And some of them are funny, but some of them are quite poignant, actually.",
        "So just to give you one example, there's a neuroscientist named Lindsey Reese(ph) who has a neuron on her foot.",
        "Now, that might seem obvious to you, but there's a deeper story there.",
        "It's a particular kind of neuron that we use to send messages to our body to move our bodies around.",
        "That's the kind of neuron that dies when people get Lou Gehrig's disease.",
        "So this woman's father actually died of Lou Gehrig's when she was 18, and that's what made her decide to become a neuroscientist.",
        "So this tattoo is really about her loss, her life and her science all in one."
