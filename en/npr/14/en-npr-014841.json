        "Well, I think that's why the dates were pushed back, but it may backfire because now you've got such a bunching on the front end that no candidate has really a lot of time to spend on the specific issues in any of states, so things will be more general.",
        "Given who's in the field and who the frontrunners are, there maybe some jamming by the time you get to the end, and the states that are left after February 5th may end up having more influence than the ones at first.",
