        "Well, inspired by your column, my colleague Carol Klinger, who's in the studio with me now - this is the woman who we count on to track down all kinds of interesting people all over the world - managed to track down all the ingredients, including the hardest part, which was the cherry blossoms.",

        "Now, General, in some recent congressional testimony, you were talking about the desire to pull some American troops from Iraq when conditions permit and you said it's about dependency, meaning that you want the Iraqis not to be dependent in the end on US forces and allied forces.",
        "As you look forward over the next few years, are you prepared to let Iraqis run the risk of being defeated in order to take that step of making them stand on their own two feet?",
        "I mean, that's, again, a very good question.",
        "And when I go around and talk to all of my subordinate commanders, I tell them that that is exactly a judgment that has to be made at the battalion and the brigade level.",
        "But our strategy is designed to not automatically just give it to them and say, `You've got it now' and walk away.",
        "But it's designed to put them in the lead so they're actually leading operations with our help, so while they're leading, we intend to gradually build their capabilities so they can do this by themselves.",
        "You said in congressional testimony that in your estimation, the border between Iraq and Syria, the border region, is not under control at this time.",
        "What has made that region so important and also so difficult to control?",
        "What's made it so important is it is the major route that the foreign fighters and the suicide bombers take to get into Iraq.",
        "What's so hard about it, it's far away, there are logistical challenges in supporting the Iraqi security forces that work out there.",
        "And then there's a tribal element really on both sides of the borders.",
        "And there's historical smuggling contacts that, you know, have been out there for hundreds of years.",
        "So put all that together and it's taking a very sustained effort by us and our Iraqi colleagues here to go back and take that border back and we will do that, I believe, here prior to the election.",
        "Do you think that you're killing insurgents faster than insurgents are being recruited at this time?",
        "You know, we go around and around on the numbers of the people in the insurgency and our job--what we're out to do is not necessarily kill everybody.",
        "Whether we're killing them faster than they're signing up is not necessarily a measure of success here.",
        "Whether they're joining the political process and voting, that's what we're primarily concerned with.",
        "Well, I guess this is what I'm driving at.",
        "I know that the two things you're trying to do simultaneously is build up the Iraqi security forces so they're stronger and also reduce the threat to Iraq by battering down the insurgency.",
        "Is the insurgency weaker than it was a year ago?",
        "I tell you, Steve, it's about the same.",
        "It's still contained in about four of the 18 provinces, which it's contained.",
        "It's not spread to a countrywide insurgency.",
        "Now what's changed and what's become more visible outside of Iraq has been the suicide car bomb attacks on the Iraqi people.",
        "That is an element that has increased, although I will tell you that it has gone steadily downward over time."

        "So we tried to pick broad topics that represent all those questions that arrived in our inbox, and let's get right to it.",
        "The first question comes from Jason Burt(ph) of Maple Valley, Washington.",
        "He says, I'm still puzzled at how the downturn of the subprime mortgage market has had such a dramatic effect on big financial institutions like Bear Stearns, if the subprime mortgages are only a small portion of the American housing market and even smaller portion are in jeopardy of default.",
        "How is this problem causing so much financial difficulty for banks and investment companies?",
        "Adam, so could you give us a basic explanation of how the subprime crisis became such a huge problem?",
        "I know this is very complicated, but if you could do this briefly for us.",
        "First of all, it is ridiculous.",
        "It seems to make no sense.",
        "Housing altogether is only 5 percent of the economy.",
        "Subprime is a much smaller percentage of that.",
        "And then the subprime mortgages that are at risk of default is a much, much smaller percentage of that.",
        "It's like finding out that the rubber band business went under, and that's going to crash the entire economy.",
        "One of the explanations is something called leverage.",
        "We received many questions about the executives at Bear Stearns, the people that Adam referred to them as the middleman or the middle-woman.",
        "John Maser(ph) sent in this question.",
        "Is there some practical way that the bridge-playing CEO and other top executives of Bear Stearns can be monetarily punished by preventing them from walking away from the fiasco with multimillion dollars severance payments?",
        "And, Laurence Meyer, that's exactly what you (unintelligible)…",
        "But the Senate's number three Democrat, New York's Chuck Schumer, called the House GOP plan defunding Obamacare insane.",
        "Senate Democrats, he added, would never go along with it.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)",
        "Basically, big banks like Bear Stearns, in fact Bear Stearns almost more than anybody, used these subprime mortgages - they would leverage them.",
        "Here's how that works: They have, say, a million dollars but they borrow $30 million and invest that in securities backed by the subprime mortgages.",
        "If things are going up, that's a great idea because you get $30 back for every dollar you make.",
        "It's a wonderful way to make money.",
        "But it also works in reverse.",
        "If you have borrowed, if you're in debt by $30 for every $1 you own, if this starts going down just a little bit, just 1 percent goes down, suddenly that's magnified.",
        "Why in the world would you put yourself in that position?",
        "Well, it made total sense to put yourself in that position because on average across the economy, housing prices have never gone down in the history of the United States."
