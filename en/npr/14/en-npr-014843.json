        "So in 2003, who in the world would have thought that in the next few years, for the first time ever, housing prices would fall?",
        "I mean, back then housing prices were rising faster than they ever had before.",
        "The problem is that by making those choices they were so exposed, and that exposure was multiplied so many times, that just the tiniest downtick in housing prices and the tiniest uptick in foreclosure rates just collapsed this entire system.",

        "I thought that these people where super smart.",
        "What was the motivation to make such bad debts?",
        "Well, they certainly knew they weren't liquid but they purchased them because they thought they were really high valued paper.",

        "And what would the chain of events have looked like?",
        "And how would it have trickle down to middle-class working folks?",

        "Bear Stearns serves as what's called a counterparty.",
        "They are the middleman for countless billions of dollars in transactions.",
        "So working men and woman might have their retirement funds for Bear Stearns, or lots and lots of smaller bags or smaller hedge funds might trade gold or trade stocks or trade other securities through Bear Stearns.",
        "Now, if Bear Stearns truly did go bankrupt, if they had completely gone out of business, you would start just an unbelievably long and complex legal process.",
        "You can imagine how complicated just a personal bankruptcy is.",
        "So, just imagine this huge investment bank with just tens of billions of dollars and assets, and all of these counterparty duties for people all over the world.",
        "We know that there would be thousands of Bear Stearns customers all the way from small retirees, all the way up to big, big hedge funds, who would have huge amounts of money just frozen.",
        "And that's what the Fed wanted to avoid.",
        "Okay, kindly just follow us up on Mr. Zanger's question.",
        "Perhaps Laurence Meyer, you can answer.",
        "There have been brokerage houses, investment banks that have gone out of business: Drexel Burnham Lambert, Kidder Peabody -these places failed.",
        "What's the big difference?",
        "Well, I think the financial world is different and more complex.",
        "It is simply unthinkable that a major global investment bank or commercial bank could simply say, we're out of business, we'll meet you in bankruptcy court.",
        "The two intertwined with the rest of the financial institutions and the rest of the economy allowed that to happen.",
        "So there are two big (unintelligible) in the sense of just closing the door and going out of business, but the way you avoid moral hazard, people thinking that they're going to get bailed out, and they can take on riskier assets, the way you avoid that is to wipe out the shareholders.",
        "And that's what happened.",
        "The stock went from a 170 to 2.",
        "Okay?",
        "So, they didn't feel bailed out, workers are loosing their jobs, senior management that had most of their wealth in Bear Stearns - boy, that situation is different.",
        "And workers who have most of their pension in Bear Stearns stock are devastated.",
        "So Bear Stearns certainly wasn't bailed out.",
        "But it simply can't go out of business.",
        "It could loose its name, but its counterparty obligations have to be taken on by somebody else.",
        "Well, I think, it's, yeah, exactly as Adam talked about.",

        "Now what I don't know is about the severance packages, but my guess is none of those severance packages come into play here.",

        "They will now become customers of JPMorgan Chase.",

        "And I'm wondering why the markets feel comfortable with the said actions to help JPMorgan buy Bear Stearns, but not with government action to provide real relief to homeowners who cannot pay their mortgages.",
        "This action is really quite controversial.",
        "There are differences of views of people who are represented in the market.",
        "People do worry about moral hazard although I think that Bear Stearns was significantly punished.",
        "But it is very controversial.",
        "The Fed has taken some credit risk onto its portfolio that it wasn't really setup to do, and that's controversial as well.",
        "But as we noted before, these big global investment banks are simply too big to simply go out of business.",
        "Now what about the homeowners, don't they deserve a break too?",
        "Well, one of the things here that it's important to understand is there are certain things that the Federal Reserve can do and there are certain things that the government, the administration and Congress have to do.",
        "Now when you're talking about helping the homeowners, you're dealing with Treasury and the president and the Congress.",
        "Again, there's moral hazard issues as to whether you should do that.",
        "But the problem is so significant here.",
