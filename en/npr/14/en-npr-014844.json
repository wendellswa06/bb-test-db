        "Back in his home state of Kentucky, where he's seeking reelection, he's facing a Tea Party-backed challenger who strongly endorses defunding Obamacare.",
        "At the same time, a standoff over Obamacare leading to a government shutdown - or possibly to a default, if the debt ceiling isn't raised next month - could badly damage Republicans' chances of taking back control of the Senate in next year's midterm elections.",
        "Durbin says McConnell is in a no-win situation.",
        "And I think, at this point, that he has basically backed off from playing a leadership role in resolving the budget and debt ceiling issues.",

        "His new book, \"\"Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki And His Years of Pilgrimage\"\" takes place in contemporary Japan, but it really exists in the writer's interior world - a cerebral one that often veers down unexpected corridors.",
        "When we meet colorless Tsukuru, we're told he lacked the striking personality or any qualities that made him stand out.",
        "But colorless also has a literal meaning.",

        "Then, dramatically compounding his loneliness, this group of friends ditches Tsukuru.",
        "They don't return his calls, and they announced that they did not want to see him ever again.",
        "It was a sudden, decisive declaration, Murakami tells us.",
        "They gave no explanations - not a word for this harsh pronouncement.",

        "Along the way are moments of gorgeous, contemplative prose.",
        "Murakami writes, a nearby willow tree was like a distraught mind.",
        "The branch quivered slightly, then returned to stillness.",
        "At other times, though, I wished I could edit out some boring descriptions of dreams and stilted language like (reading) the tension of suppressed sexual feelings began to take on greater significance than Tsukuru could imagine.",
        "And there is surprising moments too, like a story within the story about a piano player who has accepted deaf in exchange for a supernaturally enhanced sight.",
        "This tale informs the tone of the book.",
        "It takes spirits and ghosts and the devil at face value.",
        "It puts the ordinary and the fantastical in close proximity.",
        "You get the sense that for Murakami the wall between the two is flimsy and might easily be knocked down if the author chooses, but he never does.",
        "Still, the simplicity and depth of this book make it irresistible.",
        "It's easy to read and not so easy to understand, but I didn't mind.",
        "I like Murakami's brand of originality made up of sex, music, ghosts, auras and a yearning for connection.",
        "This is an imperfect novel that feels like a riddle, a puzzle, or maybe like a haiku full of beauty, strangeness and color thousands of syllables long.",
