        "Is this threatened mass migration into sanctuary cities even legally or technically possible?",
        "Hard to imagine it could be, Scott.",
        "And, you know, Homeland Security officials had been denying this idea was really under consideration right up until the president said he was still thinking about it.",
        "So it was much like the way he threatened to close the border earlier this month, then said he'd wait a year, then said he was still thinking about doing that, too.",
        "So look.",
        "In all likelihood, the president does know that these are just rhetorical devices.",
        "But he sees how they dominate the discussion.",
        "And they reassure anyone who might have doubted this president will go on trying to win his border crisis with ever more extreme measures to punish the migrants and their defenders.",

        "And that's far from ideal for those officials or for the government.",
        "But they also do not have to go before the Senate for confirmation hearings or to answer questions.",
        "And that's a trade-off that the president apparently likes.",
        "We didn't get the Mueller report this week, redacted or otherwise, but Attorney General Barr still managed to keep his name in the news.",
        "There was this battle to have enough available phosphorus for optimum crop production.",
        "An extraordinary performance in front of the House Judiciary Committee one day, followed by a truly stunning one in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee the next.",
        "The attorney general said spying occurred on the Trump campaign in 2016, but offered no indication of why he thought so or who might have done it and then said it was possible there was reason for surveillance, but he hadn't gotten all the information yet.",
        "So Barr is supposed to be the steady hand here.",
        "He's a veteran.",
        "He's been attorney general before.",
        "So it was amazing to hear him make such statements without having that information.",

        "For those who worried, and I was among them, his cat was apparently resettled last year in a more conventional home.",
        "President Trump was once a big fan of Julian Assange's, wasn't he?",
        "Said he was.",
        "Trump repeatedly said, I love WikiLeaks at his rallies during the campaign.",
        "That was when Assange was involved in hacking the Democrats' national committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign and so on.",
        "Now the immediate charge Assange is facing has to do with the hacking of a Pentagon computer nearly a decade ago - totally different matter - exposing half a million U.S.",
        "documents.",
        "But since that time, Assange has also been busy, even from his refuge in the embassy, as we know.",
        "And there could be more charges.",
        "And there could be more revelations about Mr. Assange coming.",
        "All we know is, at this point, it capped a wild week at the White House."

        "But more, because I'm a parent, my son is old now, but I wanted a book that if my kid was younger, I could look at it with him and learn something, and recognize what's good and what's maybe not so good, what I would let him listen to and what I would prefer that he didn't.",

        "Thank you.",
        "How did you come up with this idea?",
        "Hip hop is a legitimate artistic form and it just appeared to me that there was a hole in the market someplace.",
        "And it seemed to me that parents wanted to say to themselves, you know, should I let my children listen to this music?",
        "Well, this is wonderful music, and you can't let some of the other ends of hip hop determine, you know, how we look at it.",
        "So, I wanted to put a book together that I thought gave us some historical foundation, taking it back to its origins and bringing it up to, essentially, Tony, the future."
