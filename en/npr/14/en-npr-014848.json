        "So let's start out with Mumia, former Black Panther and radio reporter Mumia Abu-Jamal who has been on Death Row for 26 years.",
        "In 1981 he was convicted and sent to Pennsylvania's Death Row for the killing of a white policeman.",
        "He's always maintained his innocence and there are groups of dedicated activists trying to secure his release.",
        "They say the prosecution used unreliable witnesses and a predominantly white jury to secure his conviction.",
        "On the other hand, Abu-Jamal has been the subject of several books that call his defense a sham, including one called \"\"Cop Killer.\"\" Now, Abu-Jamal and his lawyer have been fighting for a new trial.",
        "Yesterday a U.S.",
        "federal appeals court upheld the murder conviction but said Abu-Jamal deserves a new penalty hearing.",
        "His death sentence could be reviewed by a lower court.",
        "So Cynthia, what do you think about this?",
        "This case has been going through the court for years, and do you think that this marks a turning point where advocates for his freedom have won a victory?",
        "Or is this just the process unfolding?",
        "Well, I think that, well, you're right, it does depend on what side you sit on.",
        "But certainly his advocates feel as if they've won a victory because it appears that his life, you know, will be saved.",
        "I think that, though, as people look at this court system and the history of our court system and our justice system throughout the years, there's a lot of room for people to feel as if he didn't get a fair shake.",
        "And based on that, when it comes to saving someone's life or sending them to death, then I think that is what causes people pause.",
        "I do think, though, when you look at the timeframe of everything, particularly in 1981, and the assertions, of course, that the jury had flawed instructions, based on that, that's enough to, to at least cause you to stop, reconsider, and do the fair thing.",
        "Bob, his lawyer argued in court that prosecutors deliberately took blacks off the jury.",
        "There were ten whites, two blacks that served on the jury.",
        "And why do you think the court decided to give him a penalty hearing, which basically doesn't deal with his guilt or innocence but just deals with what he should be serving for?",
        "It sounds like the court's just trying to cover all its bases, to cover its, to cover itself, because I mean if there's any kind of impropriety, it could be overturned on appeal, although there have been many appeals in this case.",
        "Sounds like the court just said, look, okay, here's something that we can't automatically, we can't definitively say things were right.",
        "So let's just go back and just see whether he should be put to death or spend his life in, the rest of his life in prison.",
        "And you know, if you're a Jamal supporter, that's not going to really be acceptable, because you want him to get out, and that doesn't seem like it's going to happen.",
        "In your opinion - and Marc, I'm going to get to you in a second - but Bob, in your opinion, what significance does this case have in the black community?",
        "And what I mean by that is, you know, there are plenty of people within the ranks of the African-American communities around America who say, well, yeah, I think he did it; and then other folks who say he didn't do it; and other folks who say, well, maybe he did but it wasn't proven.",
        "Do you have a sense of how public opinion is flowing, particularly among African-Americans?",
        "Well, this is similar to the O.J.",
        "case, when you have a guy who all the evidence seemed to indicate that he did it, people thought he did it, but it broke down our racial lines.",
        "If you were a black person, you think, well, maybe he did it, but you know what, there's been plenty of white folks who've gotten away with stuff like this and this is one for our side.",
        "Before 5:30 we've seen some tanks moving close to the city, opening fire from their heavy guns to the civilian boys sitting on the barricades.",
        "A lot of people killed and wounded.",
        "The city came down screaming.",

        "But Harder said world outrage is growing at what he called the horrific brutality of the regime against its own people.",
        "And if this government wants to try to strong-arm its people into staying home during Ramadan, well, apparently it can try.",
        "But if the past four months are any indication at all, the people are going to continue to go out on the street and try to ask for their rights.",
