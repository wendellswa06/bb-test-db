        "We have to realize the appropriate deficit for this year or next year is much different than what the appropriate deficit is out in 2016 or 2017.",
        "We are living in exceptional times, the difficulty is that by providing tax relief and additional spending, deficits help to spur economic growth, but then when the situation returns to a more normal environment, the effect flips and becomes adverse.",
        "We need to transition from one to the other, and thats a very difficult line to walk.",
        "I want to grant the argument youve just made, that the administration is arguing that deficit spending right now is good or essential to keep the economy going.",
        "But give me an idea of a deficit you can live with for the next fiscal year, which is what you are planning now.",
        "Youre looking ahead months and months, but its what you have to do.",

        "And they actually still haven't started the counting process.",

        "There's also been a lot of focus on the question of fraud in this election from President Trump, as well as Republican Senate candidate Rick Scott, from current Senator Marco Rubio.",
        "How are election officials dealing with these fraud allegations?",
        "Well, it's important to say at the onset that despite all of this talk, we actually haven't seen any evidence of voter - widespread voter fraud.",
        "Rick Scott asked Florida law enforcement to investigate the issue, and nothing has turned up there.",
        "And at a hearing today, a judge said the same thing while also begging both sides to, quote, \"\"ramp down the rhetoric."

        "That line, especially when they have a role in making sure it's done well, really struck me as about as much of a shot at the president/the governor as you're going to hear from an election official.",
        "Why?",
        "What do you think he was meaning there?",
        "Well, it's really interesting.",
        "What's kind of getting lost in this conversation as Trump and Rick Scott are taking these shots, especially at Broward County and Palm Beach County, specifically about shoddy election administration, is that they have some degree of control over a lot of this stuff.",
        "Rick Scott, specifically, has been the governor in Florida for the past eight years.",
        "The supervisor of elections of Broward County has been the supervisor during that entire time.",

        "We are currently projecting a 10-year deficit of $9 trillion.",
        "That $9 trillion reflects three things: The fact that we did not pay for policies in the past, including the Medicare prescription drug benefit in the 2001 and 2003 tax legislation, the effect of the severe downturn that were experiencing because revenue goes down and spending on things like unemployment benefits and food stamps goes up, and then somewhat under a 10th of that projected 10-year deficit comes from the Recovery Act, which was intended to help mitigate the economic downturn.",
