        "You know the Congressional system very well, having worked on Capitol Hill, and youve been through a year as director of the budget here.",
        "I would like to know if you think, when it comes to restraining or cutting spending, is the political system broken?",
        "Well, I think there are some things the political system deals very well with.",
        "It tends to deal better with crises than with gradual long-term problems.",
        "And thats true in the political system, just like its sometimes true in our own lives.",
        "The question is how can you refocus attention on those important, but not yet crisis issues?",
        "The House, of course, recently passed a health care bill.",
        "One of your hopes for health care, as youve discussed before, is to reduce the share of the federal budget that goes to health care, as well as the share of the economy, if you can - to bend the curve, as youve said.",
        "This is a bill that does, according to the Congressional Budget Office, reduce the deficit, but not by very much, given the huge amount that is spent on health care.",
        "Is this a missed opportunity?",
        "No.",
        "I think both the House and the Senate have captured important opportunities.",
        "Given the need to actually enact legislation, we are doing about as much as could be done.",
        "Now, I acknowledge it was a lot easier when I was sitting at the Brookings Institution to dream up the ideal health care cost containment package.",
        "But in the real world of actually passing legislation, its about as good as youre going to do in a real piece of legislation.",
        "I want to come back to the deficit.",
        "Is there a political risk in going year after year, maybe several years with trillion-dollar deficits, all the while saying, were being fiscally responsible, were concerned about this, were working on it and were running up another trillion dollars?",
        "Well, again, the short-term deficits are directly responsive to and actually turn out to be beneficial to addressing this severe economic weakness that weve been experiencing.",
        "And I do think its important to step back.",
        "If you know, were now in early November 2009.",
        "If in November 2008, someone told you that credit spreads would be back to normal levels and the economy would be growing by three-and-a-half percent, you probably would have looked at them like they were a little bit crazy.",
        "So a lot has been done.",
        "Is the deficit not a political problem?",
        "I think it is, but you have to I think the thing about the politics of the deficit is that the deficit is unpopular, but so are many specific steps to reduce it.",
        "There are some who will decry the deficit, but are unwilling to embrace anything that will actually bring it down, and we need to avoid that, too.",
        "Peter Orszag, thanks very much.",
        "Thank you for having me."
