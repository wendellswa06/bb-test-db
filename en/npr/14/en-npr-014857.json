        "How does it damage U.S.",
        "foreign policy?",
        "In the future, it's very unlikely that people would be at all candid with us, even in the limited spheres where they have been candid.",
        "And they will not have any confidence at all that we will keep their confidences.",
        "Just on the basis of some of the things we've learned, to hear that the king of Saudi Arabia and others in the Gulf, particularly the king of Jordan as well, are urging the United States to attack Iran and cripple its nuclear programs before it gets too late, that they are deeply worried about the prospect of nuclear weapons in Iran, does not -would not Israel be happy to hear that?",
        "Oh, I think the Israelis have seized on this with glee to try to make the case that their view is the same as that of others in the region, but that is simply not true.",
        "In what way is it different?",
        "Well, there's no novelty whatsoever in Arab countries being deeply concerned about Persia, or Iran as it is now known.",
        "That's been going on for thousands of years.",
        "So the fact that they're concerned about Iran - primarily, the growth in Iranian prestige and influence in the region, which is a direct result of mistaken U.S.",
        "policies, basically allowing Iran to have the dominant political role in Iraq, empowering Iran's friends, Hezbollah, in Lebanon, and handing over Hamas, the elected government of Palestine to the Iranians because they had nowhere else to go.",
        "So this is all very disturbing to Arabs, and the nuclear weapons in prospect - add to the prospect that Iran might have even more prestige in the future.",
        "That's alarming.",
        "Yet, the United States' goal is to prevent an Iranian nuclear weapon from being deployed.",
        "Surely, that's the Israeli goal as well.",
        "Well, the difference is this, the Arabs look to the United States as a protector, to protect their interests, in this case to try to reverse the rising prestige of Iran, including its nuclear prestige.",
        "The Israelis have a very definite program, which is that they favor air strikes on Iran.",
        "That's what they're urging us to carry out.",
        "They have said that if we don't do that, they will carry out air strikes which basically will leave us no choice but to join them in a war with Iran.",
        "So they're very different positions.",
        "One is looking to the U.S., deferring to the U.S.",
        "to handle the problem.",
        "The other is prescribing to the U.S.",
        "what ought to be done.",

        "The - you were ambassador to Saudi Arabia during the first Gulf War.",

        "You see the Gulf States, in particular, saying we have a problem.",
        "Will you, the United States, come in and help us with it?",
        "This is a long-standing habit.",
        "It's partly because their capabilities are quite limited and it's partly a cultural thing.",
        "It has another side to it which needs to be borne in mind, and that is these conversations which are reported, are conversations between the leaders of places that look to the United States for leadership...",

        "They are, as you just said, pleas with the United States do something to handle the situation they really don't know how to handle.",
        "Should these statements be taken at face value, cut off the head of the snake?",
        "Well, I think they should be taken as a serious indication of concern.",
        "I don't think cut off the head of the snake means launch a bombing raid.",
        "Yet, some people might interpret it that way.",
        "Indeed, they have.",
        "That is Mr. Netanyahu's interpretation.",
        "And there are quite a number of people in this country who've picked up on that line and tried to advance it.",
        "The United States has said the military option is not off the table.",
        "But everybody from the president, secretary of defense, the heads of the intelligence services, everybody says if this is an option, it's a very, very, very bad one.",
        "The probable effects of an American - or for that matter, an Israeli air strike followed some sort of American air strike on Iran would be catastrophic for global energy supplies.",
        "We'd be talking about oil in the hundreds of dollars per barrel, not as at present, around $90 a barrel.",
        "The disruption of the economy aside, this would do huge damage to Western interests throughout the entire Islamic world."

        "Yet, why is there - well, it's scarcely under consideration by Washington.",
        "Obviously, Israel feels differently.",
        "It feels that it's a central threat from a nuclear armed Iran.",
        "Yes, that - I think there are two considerations on the part of Israel.",
        "The Israeli government has made a rather coolheaded judgment that were Iran to develop nuclear weapons and thus cost Israel its nuclear monopoly in the region, Israel would not be free, as it currently has felt it is, to carry out strikes on its neighbors.",
        "That is to say, Iran might be able to deter that.",
        "So from a foreign policy point of view, the Israelis absolutely do not want a nuclear rival in the region.",
        "That aside, the Israeli government, I believe, has quite deliberately stirred up hysteria among the Israeli people about an alleged, gratuitous disposition on the part of Iran to carry out another Holocaust.",
        "There's no indication of that, but it sells well in the Israeli politics.",
        "And it really has caused a good deal of panic in that country.",
        "I've had former U.S.",
        "intelligence chief sit exactly where you're sitting and say the same thing, that Israel cannot abide the possibility of some Holocaust denier and somebody with that kind of lack of restraint, having nuclear weapons.",
        "Well, I don't think Mr. Ahmadinejad is widely respected in the region, although he says things that please people politically, simply because they're in bad taste and anti-American or anti-Israel, nobody, I think, takes him terribly seriously.",
        "Are you of the school that believes that should Iran acquire nuclear weapons - and it seems to be on track to do that, if everybody is to be believed, in the next two, five, eight years, something like that.",
        "Then there's going to be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East that Egypt and Saudi Arabia would be interested in having some sort of deterrent themselves.",
        "Well, that's one of the arguments for being concerned about Iranian nuclear programs.",
        "I'm laughing a little bit, though, because in 1991, I was instructed to brief, now King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, that Iran was about two years away from a nuclear weapon.",
        "And it's been about two years away from a nuclear weapon ever since.",
        "So I'm not sure if the Iranians, in fact, have made the decision to develop a military capability, although they're certainly working hard on control of the -and mastery of the nuclear fuel cycle.",
        "I don't think it's necessarily the case that an Iranian decision to make a nuclear weapon would drive everybody to have their own programs.",
        "After all, Israel has nuclear weapons, and that is not had that effect.",
        "Email from Dennis(ph).",
        "Does it not seem Iran is flexing its muscles since we defanged their nemesis, Iraq?",
        "Well, we've been very helpful to Iran and the Iranian Revolution.",
        "We eliminated their principal enemies in Iraq right after we eliminated their enemies in Afghanistan.",
        "By trying to isolate Hamas, we left Hamas with nowhere to go but in their arms.",

        "Well, actually, I would say that one of the things that the leaks reveal is that we have a pretty effective foreign service.",

        "There's some spectacular examples of descriptions of events and personalities, very striking descriptions in this treasure trove.",
