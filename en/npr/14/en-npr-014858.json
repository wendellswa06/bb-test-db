        "If you look, for example, at the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, which the Saudis, including the king, told the then President George Bush they thought was running into an ambush and was absolutely the wrong thing to do, they nonetheless quietly cooperated to allow the staging of Special Forces and aircraft out of Saudi Arabia for that invasion.",
        "Why?",
        "Because the United States is a friend and protector, and they did not want to break with us, even though they fundamentally disagree with us.",
        "That's actually fairly valuable to the United States to have countries that are willing to cooperate with us even when they have great qualms about the wisdom of what we're doing.",
