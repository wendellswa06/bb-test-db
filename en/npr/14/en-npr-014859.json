        "No.",

        "Not to be not to lie, because lying also breaks your fast; to present a very good person, as a human being, to others in the community; to try to be a good Muslim and to explain what Ramadan is, because theres a lot of people that are non-Muslims that do not know what the month may represent."

        "But I more typically observe the fast start the fast I will be starting it at dawn tomorrow - as a bachelor, and I do not have family around me.",
        "So I tend to observe the fast and break the fast every night of Ramadan on my own.",
        "And I know that is not as spiritually enriching as being around other Muslims or family members, but my situation just doesnt allow that, perhaps, for practical purposes.",
        "But what I like to ask your guest is, when youre practicing the faith and youre observing the the reason Ramadan apply so much to me.",
        "Is number one, its an opportunity and its a thanksgiving, and its really a gift from God, because he's allowed you to observe and to live through another month of Ramadan - which is a month of blessing, a month of forgiveness, and a month of repentance.",
        "What I like to ask your guest, as an expert or a teacher of Islam, is the fast really just as fulfilling or spiritually acceptable to God if youre doing it on your own and youre more or less breaking your fast in the evening, on your own, as a bachelor.",
        "And, you know, it is a month of reflection, and I really enjoy it in a sense that it offers me a chance to regain or reestablish some humility."

        "But in other words, to put your best foot forward really as an ambassador for Islam.",

        "Nobody eats in front of you.",
        "You know, that youll be participating whether alone or with your family in the same activity.",
