        "So I was wondering if that's the same type of - excuse me, extreme fasting that takes place through most countries or was this just unique, this one country that I lived in?",
        "Michael, thank you very much for that.",
        "So, Vali, what's the answer?",
        "Well, the fasting does tax the body, and it's customary.",
        "Most Muslim countries that probably - the time period between the afternoon and the evening, people rest.",
        "They don't go out.",
        "They pray.",
        "And then life comes alive at nighttime.",
        "I mean, you go out in nighttime in Cairo or Beirut or Damascus, until late hours of the evening, the entire cities come alive with cafes, shops open.",
        "There's a lot of activity happens.",
        "But, you know, if you're in southern Africa when the weather is extremely hot and Ramadan happens to be during the summer, it is taxing.",
        "Here's an email, and there's another question also.",
        "The email: what do diabetics do for the celebration?",
        "How about competitive Islamic athletes?",
        "Changes in dietary habits of elite athletes can have severe impact on - in - on performance.",
        "This comes from Daniel(ph) in Ithaca.",
        "And, as a matter of fact, to Daniel's point, there is a player in the National Football League, Husain Abdullah, who just announced that he will continue with pre-season practice without drinking water during the day.",
        "Does anyone get a complete pass from fasting?",
        "Well, the fasting is incumbent, first of all, on people of a certain age and above who are not sick, who are not infirm and also who are not traveling beyond a certain distance.",
        "In other words, the idea is not to put physical pressure on people who cannot handle fasting.",
        "So, you know, in the old times, people - whenever you went beyond six, seven miles, you were forbidden from fasting.",
        "If you're sick, like you're a diabetic person, you're not supposed to be fasting.",
        "If you're very old, if fasting in any way is a threat to your health, you're not supposed to be fasting.",
        "Let me ask you this because this is an interesting question that we got.",
        "What if you slip up?",
        "Okay, you make a mistake and you eat during the day or you drink during the day, which I'm assuming is a sin, then are you able to atone in any way?",
        "Do you have to start over again?",
        "What do you do?",
        "Well, it's not a sin.",
        "It's that your fast is broken.",
        "So, you know, there's - you can always make up for it.",
        "You can do additional days of fasting outside of the month.",
        "And even sometimes people who happen to be sick during Ramadan, for instance, they have the influenza or they're sick and they can't fast, say, for six, seven days, they often try to make it up after - at other times in the year.",
        "The only day in the year that you really are forbidden from fasting is the last day of Ramadan, which is the Eid ul-Fitr.",
        "Any other day of the year, you can make up for what you lost during Ramadan."

        "The main thing people would speak to us about was the restrictions on their movement, you know, the fact that they were confined to these camps.",
        "What we then found as we started researching the situation in other parts of Rakhine State was that they were also trapped and that the government was basically confining them to these villages.",
        "That meant they couldn't access their hospitals, their kids couldn't get to the nearest high school.",

        "Well, we've been investigating the situation in Rakhine State for the last two years, and we're very clear that what's happened over the last three months in the north constitutes crimes against humanity.",
        "The military have committed rape, torture, murder.",
        "But we found the denial of rights of the Rohingya very clearly fits the denial of rights elaborated in the apartheid convention, and that is the denial of a nationality.",

        "Yes.",

        "As I say, it's a crime against humanity.",
        "It's also a system.",

        "I think the Myanmar authorities have issued a number of denials, dismissals of allegations of human rights violations in Rakhine State.",
        "I mean, they don't stand up to scrutiny.",
        "And, to be honest, if they really were serious about sharing their full situation as they say it, they would allow international observers into the area.",
        "They're not doing that at the moment so all we can assume is the worst, which is not just something that we've documented in this report today, it's something that you can see on the bodies of the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who have fled to Bangladesh in recent months.",
