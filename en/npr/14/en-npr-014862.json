        "The question is what happens after that.",
        "It goes back to Congress, and what'll the Democrats do?",
        "There are some who say that let's just keep making him veto it.",
        "Let's put the Republican Party on the defensive.",
        "There are others, more centrist Democrats, who say look, we made our point.",
        "We know where the American people stand on this, but we still have to fund the soldiers.",
        "We have to fund the troops.",
        "And so, perhaps maybe we pass a short-term war-funding measure, maybe two, three months, and then see how the surge works and how Petraeus's strategy works.",
        "And both sides have accused each other of playing politics on this.",
        "You know, the administration has said you knew you were going to veto anything with a timetable, you put it in there anyway just to win political points.",
        "You know, the Congress says we're trying to figure out what the people - you know, give the people what they want in terms of withdrawal from the war.",
        "It's led to some heated words between Vice President Cheney and the Democratic leader in the Senate, Harry Reid.",
        "Is there going to hit a tipping point here where compromise can't be reached?",
        "Well, it has to because, again, the soldiers have to be funded.",
        "But there is the kind of rhetoric that makes a lot of people, like, wish didn't happen.",
        "We saw the Republican Party effectively run against Democrats on the war in 2002, 2004, certainly less effectively in 2006.",
        "Some of the rhetoric you heard from Vice President Cheney about the Democrats, about the fact that they are waving the white flag of surrender, that their policy means the terrorists win, that is the kind of rhetoric that I think has lost favor with the American public.",
        "Let's hear from Paul in Panama City, Florida.",

        "I'm a conservative evangelical.",
        "And I just don't see a candidate out there.",
        "I thought Fred Thompson might have been a white horse - riding in on a white horse to be more palatable for us.",
        "But, you know, I just don't see a candidate that I can really support.",
        "McCain, his age is a big concern, and of course the way he's moved back and forth on some issues.",
        "And I'm just wondering if there's a Republican sitting in the wings waiting to swoop in as a savior and I just don't see it.",
        "And one more note and I'll go off air.",
        "Field of Dreams\"\" has got to be the movie for guys to cry.",
        "Thanks for your call, Paul.",
        "Well you know, a lot of times when a party is on the defensive and pessimistic about its chances of succeeding in the next election, they come up with dream candidates.",
        "Republicans in the past talked about, oh, if only Colin Powell would run.",
        "Democrats said, oh, if only Mario Cuomo would run.",
        "Basically the people are just not satisfied with the field out there now.",
        "Now, there are candidates who ostensibly would appeal to evangelical conservatives: Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, a very strong religious conservative; Sam Brownback, the Republican senator from Kansas, also very pro-life, very strongly conservative.",
        "But they're not raising the kind of money or the attention that they need to succeed.",
        "And therefore if only Fred Thompson would run, if only a Newt Gingrich would run, I suspect that perhaps with the possible exception of Fred Thompson, the field you see now is the field that's going to be there.. And I kind of think that because a sign that the Republican Party's in trouble because they've raised far less money than the Democratic candidates so far -that's unusual for the GOP; usually the most money goes to the Republican Party.",
        "And part of this, I think, is just dissatisfaction with the war and the president and pessimism for '08."

        "How do you think Mitt Romney plays with Christian conservatives?",
        "Well, he's certainly working very hard to appeal to them.",
        "Of course, his Mormon religion is - some of the evangelical community has some concerns about that.",
        "But more importantly, I think the concern about Romney is that is he really the way he portrays himself?",
        "When he ran for governor of Massachusetts in 2002, when he ran against Ted Kennedy for the Senate in 1994, he was pro-choice, he was pro stem-cell research, and he certainly moved to the right to appeal to conservative voters for 2008.",

        "You know, who is it going to be?",
        "Who is it going to be?",
        "Is that going to be beneficial or detrimental to whoever he chooses?",

        "I mean, there are a lot of people who thought that the most winnable - the best - the strongest Republican candidate was a guy named Bush from Florida, the former governor Jed Bush, the president's younger brother.",
        "There were a lot of people in the Bush administration who said they would have loved to have seen that.",
        "I think that given the fact that the Bush name is not exactly making very many people excited for 2008, Jed Bush has to stay out of it.",
        "But I would suspect that the president will stay out of the contest.",
        "Of course this is the first time since 1928 that you don't have a sitting president or a sitting vice president expressing interest in the presidential race.",
        "This is really a wide-open race.",
        "But again, there is no - unlike the past, when you've had Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, Bob Dole and both George Bushes, you don't have an obvious frontrunner.",

        "Matt from Madison, Indiana is still on the line.",
        "And Matt, you had a second question for the Political Junkie.",
        "Yeah, depending upon who gets the Democratic nomination - let's say it's Barack Obama or let's say it's Hillary - what's the possibility, do you think, of a Barack Obama/Hillary ticket or a Hillary/Barack Obama ticket?",
        "Well, that's a good question.",
        "I mean, there are some people who - first of all, Hillary Clinton, many Democrats will tell you, is - as strong as she is, as smart as she is, they feel that she's very polarizing.",
        "What if she finds herself with the nomination, because she can't be denied the nomination, but she can't win in November.",
        "She may be - she may be faced with the prospect of having to pick Barack Obama to appeal to an African-American electorate, to appeal to younger voters.",
        "So it's not out of the question.",
        "I mean, we always think, you know, Kennedy/Johnson is the perfect example in 1960 of two people who never would have run together on the ticket, but probably would not have won had they not run together.",

        "Ken, you're actually off to South Carolina tomorrow?",
        "I am.",

        "It's extremely important for him.",
        "But of course half the - maybe 50 percent of the Democratic electorate is African-American.",
        "Great opportunity for Barack Obama, and again, Hillary Clinton.",
        "A lot of people will be watching to see - if she is supposedly the frontrunner, why is she?",
        "And they'll look to see how she does.",

        "And it might be difficult to get -bore down into a lot of substance.",
        "So what do you think a candidate has to do to stand out?",
        "Well, that's a good point because apparently there's not opening and closing statements, so the second-tier candidates are going to have to really fight and work to make themselves known and give voters or viewers a reason to support them and help trying to elevate them to that first tier.",
        "And so you've got to expect that in a minute it's going to be difficult for Chris Dodd, for instance, to explain his global warming plan - his energy plan in a minute.",

        "I think it's most important for one of them to try and make a score tomorrow night, make points and find a way to try and elevate themselves at least into shouting distance of third place, which right now none of them - nobody outside of Clinton, Obama or Edwards are pulling above, you know, three or four percent.",
