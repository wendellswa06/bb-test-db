        "We have e-mail, Ken, from Ed in Durham, North Carolina, who says, how soon before the Democratic presidential candidates go negative?",
        "Do you expect the sniping to begin in earnest at the upcoming first debate or do you expect them to hold off until X months before the actual election?",
        "Also, is it possible for a candidate, for example, John Edwards, to eschew negative campaigning - good word, Ed - or it's just political reality that personality-destroying negativity will intrude at some point?",
        "Well, I think given the fact that this is the first opportunity for many voters to see the Democrats for the first time, I don't think you'll see outward negativity in a debate.",
        "But there are always behind the scene - behind the scene things that go on.",
        "For example, there is a whole bunch of reports coming out of Chicago about Barack Obama's relationship with a slum lord that he's had relationships with in the past.",
        "And some people are hinting that may have come from another campaign to try to knock Obama off his stride.",
        "But on the stage itself I think coming out negatively from the start would be a big mistake, and I don't expect to see it.",
        "Getting back to the political battle over the war in Iraq for a second, things got a little personal last week.",
        "Vice President Dick Cheney attacked Democrats for taking on what he called the far left anti-war platform of the days of Democratic Senator George McGovern.",
        "For his part, McGovern fired back in an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times saying Cheney twisted his views beyond recognition.",
        "Senator George McGovern is on the line with us from his hotel here in Washington, D.C.",
        "Senator, welcome.",
        "Well, it's a pleasure to be your guest.",
        "So do you see any parallels between your '72 anti-Vietnam War campaign and the current Democratic candidates?",
        "Absolutely, because in both cases we were fighting a war against a little country that wasn't the slightest threat to us.",
        "As soon as we got our troops out of Vietnam after all those years of slaughter and death, the Vietnamese became our friends and have been ever since.",
        "In Iraq, Cheney and Bush and others have painted Iraq as a hotbed of terrorism.",
        "It wasn't that until we put our Army in there five years ago.",
        "There was no terrorism problem.",
        "There was no insurgency.",
        "There was no civil war.",
        "All those things have erupted in the five years since Bush ordered the American Army in there.",
        "We've now smashed their country from one end to another.",
        "It's not surprising that there's an insurgency against our troops, that they're fighting among each other, and that the country has become a hotbed of terrorism, which it was not until we occupied it."

        "Senator, there's obviously tremendous differences between Vietnam and Iraq.",
        "But going back to your '72 campaign, since then the Democratic Party has been fairly or unfairly listed - described as a party soft on the military, soft on defense.",
        "Do you see parallels to that, to what went on with the Democrats in '72 to the Democrats of today?",
        "Well, you know, there's a certain element of the Republican Party that always runs on fear - fear of communism, fear of terrorism.",
        "And they build those things up to the point where they're on everybody's mind.",
        "And if you don't agree with everything the high command orders, you're said to be soft on security, soft on the enemy.",
        "I think the softheaded people are those that get us into ill-advised wars like the one in Vietnam so many years ago and now this one in Iraq.",

        "Is it just an expression of his loyalty to his old Texas friend?",
        "I'm having trouble understanding what sort of political advantage Bush hopes to gain by supporting a man who has lost much of his credibility.",

        "It's a question that many Republicans are asking as well.",
        "We've seen more and more Republicans saying that this is an embarrassment to the administration, that the attorney general did not acquit himself well testifying last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee.",
        "And the president has shown that he's a very loyal person.",
        "He stuck with Harriet Miers longer than he should have for Supreme Court.",
        "He stuck with Donald Rumsfeld far longer than many people thought he would.",

        "The president, who has a reputation for knowing and understanding politics, given that Karl Rove's role in everything, why isn't he doing something about it?",
