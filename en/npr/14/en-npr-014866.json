        "Mm.",
        "E-mail question from Phil in Susanville, California.",
        "I fail to understand how the Bush administration seems unwilling to ask for an immediate cease fire - or at least to put pressure on the Israelis to limit their attack on Hezbollah in the south of Lebanon - when the administration made such a big deal out of Lebanon being an example of democracy in the Middle East.",
        "What does the rhetoric about democracy really mean?",
        "It seems the U.S.",
        "government is not doing anything to strengthen - and indeed is weakening - the Lebanese government.",
        "You know, it's a very difficulty issue that the administration has got to be dealing with right now.",
        "One that I'm frustrated by.",
        "The fact is, Hezbollah has successfully penetrated a lot of civilian neighborhoods throughout southern Lebanon - throughout Beirut - where they store and launch weapons into Israel.",
        "And it is in their headquarters and operational planning strongholds are in a number of these civilian areas.",
        "And if Israel is serious and we're serious about letting Israel confront Hezbollah, it means, unfortunately, going into these civilian areas where civilians get killed.",
        "This is not an easy call.",
        "I would not want to be in the shoes of the Israeli commanders that have to make these decisions.",
        "The tension, though, is to just say we need to avoid civilian casualties.",
        "Therefore, we're going to ignore the threat, which will only encourage not only Hezbollah, but it will encourage terrorist organizations throughout the region to do just that.",
        "They figure out if they put their weapons in civilian areas, no one will ever respond.",
        "No one will ever confront them, and that is a recipe for disaster.",
        "Let me ask Joseph Nye.",
        "Does this not risk - continuing these operations with these civilian casualties - does this not risk alienating moderates in Lebanon who are now becoming - Hezbollah's becoming increasingly popular.",
        "I don't think there's any doubt about that.",
        "That's the great irony of this is that the more civilians you kill -particularly children who get their pictures on television - the more you recruit for Hezbollah and for al-Qaida.",
        "In the long run, you have to use hard power against some of these terrorists, but if you forget the soft power of attraction and attracting the moderates, you're going to lose.",
        "And that, I think, is the great danger.",
        "Israel needed to reply with force to set the threshold of deterrence back, but the question you have to ask - or Israel has to ask itself is - how many children do you kill in terms of recruiting new Hezbollah participants and losing moderates before you realize that you've overdone it?",
        "And I think that's where they are now.",
        "I agree partly with what Mr. Nye is saying.",
        "And I agree killing civilians does radicalize moderates, but so does showing a soft hand and showing that the radicals - like Hezbollah - have momentum.",
        "That radicalizes moderates, too, in the Arab-Muslim world.",
        "I saw this firsthand in Iraq.",
        "When the insurgency has momentum and looks like it can attack with impunity, the moderates begin to bet on the insurgency and say well, at least they're reliable.",
        "At least they have the upper hand.",
        "The Americans or the Israelis or whoever it may be look weak, I should bet on the extremists.",
        "And so, this dilemma, this scenario that Mr. Nye is describing actually cuts both ways, unfortunately.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's get another caller in.",
        "This is Hugh.",
        "Hugh's calling us there from the Jersey Turnpike.",
        "Yeah, hi.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Both of your guests are very intelligent and it's a real pleasure to hear them.",
        "The question I have is this: what in the track record of U.N.",
        "operations - U.N.",
        "peacekeeping - leaves anyone to conclude that they can be effective in being a buffer or useful in this conflict?",

        "Well, the U.N.",
        "peacekeeping operations will not be effective unless there's an underlying political deal.",
        "I mean, after all, there is a peacekeeping force there now.",
        "The observer group in Lebanon, UNIFIL, and - in fact, I think a Guinean soldier from that group was killed just the other day.",
        "So they are not effective unless you have an underlying agreement - a political bargain - which is based on realist interests in which they'd say we can't let this get out of control.",
        "We can't get it out of hand.",
        "Then you can find that international forces can have a role once you have that kind of underlying diplomatic effective strategy among states.",
        "But the idea that Kofi Annan can go in there and send a group of people in blue helmets from small countries and in itself stop the violence, that's just not going to happen.",

        "Yes.",
        "I just wanted to say that I think it's - and this is coming from a person who's Jewish - that I think Israel has brought all of this on themselves.",
        "They are an over militarized, over funded power that just does whatever they want.",
        "And I don't think that the Palestinian issue has ever been really fleshed out in the media here at all…",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "And I think if people understood what the Palestinians have gone through since 1948 with their own country being carved up without their permission by colonial powers - that the same colonial powers have created the situations in Iraq and Iran.",
        "And this is why we have the kind of enemies we have today.",
        "Roger brings up a good point.",
        "We're ignoring the idea that there are also operations underway in Gaza at the moment, and of course, the situation on the west bank remains - well, unresolved.",
        "Can there be a solution to one problem without a solution to the other problem?",
        "Dan Senor.",
        "I think they're disconnected.",
        "I think U.S.",
        "policy's been driven over the years by the notion they are connected, but take a look at something here.",
        "Israel was told for years that you are subjected to Palestinian violence.",
        "The Palestinian violence is justified because of the hell that they have lived under, which Roger describes quite well.",
        "They have lived under hell, and there's been some resistance and violence - certainly brutal violence against Israelis - and the message has been if Israel withdraws from the occupied territories, the violence will end.",
        "In 1990 - in the late ‘90s, Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon where Hezbollah has launched attacks from.",
        "Just last year, Israel withdrew from the Gaza strip where an Israeli soldier was kidnapped from the other day and Hamas has taken over.",
        "Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is planning to withdraw from the West Bank and what these terrorist operations have resulted…",
        "That's 34-year-old attorney and lifelong Republican Melissa Anderson.",
        "Parts of the West Bank - have resulted that being halted.",
        "Not sped up.",
        "It's been halted.",
        "There's no way the Israeli government now, can go to the Israeli people and say we're going to continue with withdrawal from parts of the West Bank when the two areas they have withdrawn from have been the source of violence against Israelis.",
        "You know, it's like the former Clinton administration and former Bush - George H.W.",
        "Bush's Middle East Coordinator, Dennis Ross said - the line used be, was about, land for peace.",
        "And what the Israelis are learning is that the predicate is, land for war."

        "Joseph Nye, what's the connection between these two situations?",
        "Well, I think what we've learned from these recent events, is that unilateral withdrawal is not sufficient.",
        "You have to strike a bargain in which is a political will on the other side to hold to the bargain.",
        "The Sheron/Olmert strategy has been to unilaterally withdraw, build a fence, and ignore the Palestinians - essentially to impose the peace that they want, along the lines they want.",
        "That's not going to work.",
        "I mean, what you have to have is something where somebody on the other side of that line is willing to prevent people from launching rockets.",
        "I think that's a sad story of what we've seen.",

        "Yeah, thank you.",

        "You hear many in the media and foreign leaders, saying Israel's response is disproportionate.",
        "I'm always amused to hear that when our government, the U.S.",
        "government, because of a brutal terrorist attack on our own country one September morning, decided to wage two wars in two foreign countries halfway around the world, which involved removing those governments from existence.",
        "When you look at what happened with what Putin did in Groznyy and Chechnya to respond to the - what he regarded as the terrorist threat there.",
        "If you want to talk about a disproportionate force, I think those examples are relevant and certainly analogous."
