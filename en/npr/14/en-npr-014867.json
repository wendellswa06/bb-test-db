        "government has been just too close to Israel.",
        "I would just say three points.",
        "One, it was President Jimmy Carter who went - used - expended enormous political currency to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Manachem Begin, back in the late 70s, to cut a deal with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to withdraw from the Sinai, piece of land three times the size of Israel.",
        "Two, it was President Clinton in the 1990s who put enormous pressure on the Israeli government at Camp David, again, to cut a deal.",
        "It involved re-dividing Jerusalem.",
        "The United States has gone to wars in the Middle East, not to protect Israel.",
        "The two countries they've actually gone to war to protect, where Americans have been killed, have been Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.",
        "So the idea that the U.S.",
        "has been too, you know, too biased an unbalanced in its support of Israel, I think is disconnected from the great currency America has expended, politically, militarily and economically, for the Palestinians in broader Arab world.",
        "We have just a few seconds left.",
        "Joseph Nye, if you could just give us two or three quick points that you think ought to be priorities as we think about this in the coming days.",
        "Well, as we look ahead, we got to ask, how do we get back to a bargain on both sides of the wall, fence, whatever you want to call it.",
        "You cannot go along the lines of unilateralism.",
        "You cannot, on the other hand, turn this over to the UN.",
        "You're going to have to get a realist diplomacy underneath it, probably involving Syria, which creates incentives to make an international force effective.",
        "And until the Bush administration begins to work on that, we're going to be in deep trouble."

        "And Dan Senor, a couple of priorities to keep in mind over the coming days?",
        "It is in everybody's national interest - the Lebanese, the Israelis and the Americans, and the broader Muslim world - for Hezbollah to be weakened, if not eliminated, even tragically if involves continued war.",
        "And we need to keep an eye, a focused eye on Iran's focus in developing a nuclear weapon.",

        "Let's turn now to a different side of this story which is that now that we know that there is a story, how should we be telling it?",
        "Last night and for much of the day if you turned on the cable networks or clicked on the home pages of most major news organizations, you were likely to see the same cell phone footage - frightened victims, pictures of emergency vehicles racing to the scene.",
        "And as these attacks and the images that go with them are becoming sadly more common, more people are asking if the way the American and, indeed, the international media cover these stories needs to change.",
        "Indira Lakshmanan is one of the people asking that question.",
        "She's a veteran journalist, and she holds a chair in journalism ethics at the Poynter Institute.",

        "You said, look, yes, the attack is news, but does replaying footage of victims for hours or turning over the entire home page to this story as CNN, Fox News and Breitbart did, elevate the public understanding of why terrorism is committed or - and I'm editing a little bit here - or is it just lazy and sensationalist tabloid journalism blowing the murder of 22 people out of proportion to stoke fear?",
        "I take it your view is it's the latter.",
        "(Laughter) My view certainly is it's the latter.",
        "And I think the problem with this is that by playing this endless loop of the same images of terrified people running away from the scene of an attack - we are essentially playing into the hands of the terrorists.",
        "We're doing exactly what the terrorists want.",
        "We know - study after study shows that - terrorist groups and particularly ISIS is extremely savvy about the use of social media and mass media.",
        "They are looking for the spotlight.",
        "This is what they thrive on, and they, in fact, use this spotlight in order to recruit among vulnerable people who are attracted to this sense of notoriety.",
        "But we also know that all terrorist attacks are not treated the same way.",
        "For example, yesterday in Kabul which experienced a horrific car bomb attack, you know, just a week ago, which killed 90 people and wounded hundreds of people just yesterday that seven people were killed and another suicide bombing at a funeral in Kabul.",
        "And we also know that somebody drove up to a bar, shot people in northern Mexico.",

        "One of the questions about a memorial like this is does it somehow bespeak the Second World War, but another question is: is it American?",
        "That is the cruelest thing you can say about a Second World War monument is that it looks like what the other side would have built if they had won.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I've heard that criticism before, and I know the architect's answer to that is that it's inspired by Roman architecture, which is a form that, you know, Roman and Greek architecture is a form that we've used to symbolize democracy."

        "Yeah, it was intended to echo the Statue of Liberty.",

        "So if you ask me if we're going through a cold streak, I think we're just going through kind of growing pains, one architecturally and artistically, but also just as a culture."
