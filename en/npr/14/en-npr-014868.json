        "It's a relief to know that there are great toys out there that don't require batteries, wires, power supply, and that you can power them just by imagination.",
        "A shoe box can turn into a diorama or doll furniture.",
        "Another sort of box might also turn into a garage for your toy cars.",
        "But the ones that ring truest to all of us are those special boxes, those giant appliance boxes.",

        "(Singing) Amazing grace, how sweet the sound...",
        "That's equally horrific, but I would venture to say that most people don't know that those latter two things happened unless they are very close watchers of the news.",
        "And so the question would be why is it that some of these incidents receive a tremendous amount of attention and some of them don't?",
        "You're right.",
        "And if you do a close analysis of the news, you'll see that Western media outlets, the closer that a terrorist attack is to the United States or to some Western country, the more coverage it gets.",
        "Now, in a way this is natural.",
        "We are naturally more worried and scared if an attack is happening in Orlando or in Paris or in Manchester, England, than we are if something is happening halfway around the world where we don't live or we don't know people who live there.",
        "My issue is more with the fact that, you know, how do we cover this as journalists in a way that is for the people who we are trying to serve?",
        "Right?",
        "Our readers, our listeners, our viewers - what is the purpose of our coverage?",
        "Well, if we're news journalists, our purpose is to - we have to cover the news.",
        "If it happens, I'm not saying we should cover it up.",
        "Obviously, we have to cover it, but we have to elucidate, illuminate the incidents that have happened and inform people in some way, tell them more.",
        "What does that look like?",
        "What does that sound like?",
        "How does that work?",
        "Well, I would say add to the conversation.",
        "Tell people something they don't know, give them more information that is clear, that is precise, that is responsible, that is not based on bias or assumptions that have not yet been confirmed by authorities.",
        "So, for example, just yesterday, the president tweeted out a link from the Drudge Report that called the attack in London a terrorist attack before the authorities had done so.",
        "As it turned out, that was correct, but for Drudge to be reporting that it was a terrorist attack before the authorities had even said so, London authorities came out and said please don't do this.",
        "You know, we don't know what this is yet.",
        "So you really have to be wary of unsupported theories because sometimes things aren't what they appear to be, and there are many, many cases where things that are were initially assumed to be terrorist attacks turned out to be just a crazy person who didn't have another agenda.",
        "And the other point that you said in your piece is reconsider referring to terrorists as claiming responsibility.",
        "Aren't they admitting guilt?",
        "Tell me about that.",
        "That's right.",
        "I mean, I dislike this convention of saying ISIS claimed responsibility for this in this.",
        "I mean, it's murder.",
        "You know, if a hundred people are killed, that's murder.",
        "That's not responsibility.",
        "It's not responsible in any way.",
        "So why are we adopting the lexicon of what they say?",
        "I mean, what I find really interesting is that study after study has shown that these groups thrive on the attention they get.",
        "Michael Jetter, a behavior economist studied 60,000 terrorist attacks between 1970 and 2012 that were reported in The New York Times.",
        "And he found that terrorist groups are increasingly seeking in recent years to exploit social and mass media.",
        "And what keeps them alive is the oxygen of this publicity.",
        "Another separate study found that terrorism deaths are the single most heavily covered type of death per capita in the first pages of The New York Times compared to every other way that a human can die.",
        "Again, this fuels the perception that we are living in some sort of a terrorist state out of proportion from the reality that it is."
