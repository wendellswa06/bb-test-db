        "And at a conscious level, we know those people are not actually in our physical presence.",
        "But at an unconscious level, the machinery in our brains, which evolved in this different time period, makes us feel as though these people are actually our real companions.",
        "And so this is why when people hear about scandals and gossip involving celebrities or politicians, we react to those scandals and that gossip as if we're hearing about actual people in our lives when in fact we have no connection with those people whatsoever.",
