        "There can be no grateful solution at this point.",
        "I think that what Blair is doing is indicating the very simple fact that the American presence in Iraq fuels so much of the tension at this point that it leads to questions as to whether any other concerns - such as what we're going to leave behind because of our mistake if we leave - are things that we should consider."
