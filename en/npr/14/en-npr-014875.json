        "Exactly right.",
        "Well, do you think, John, that there are going to be changes in these laws and requirements or more monitoring leading up to 2008?",
        "Well, I get the feeling that leading up to 2008 we're going to see a great push to have more of these laws instituted because, to tell you the truth, I do think that there is no reason to believe that there isn't a certain kind of operating behind these laws.",
        "Because of course the fact is that it's never been quite clear exactly what major fraud they were designed to counteract.",
        "I think that there's a sense among many people that these laws might be a way of discouraging people who vote for a particular party from voting.",
        "And that is unfortunate.",
        "And I think that in addition to decrying the practice to the extent that we cannot completely stamp it out - and that seems to be happening in more states - we also have to give out an effort in our community to just get people ID.",
        "You know, 10 years ago it was considered big news that middle class, black kids tended to not do as well in school as you would expect.",
        "Now parents across the country, Cosby parents, are getting on their kids and starting clubs and groups.",
        "An effort has gone out, same thing with breast cancer among black women.",
        "We need a move in this case for people to get ID, so that if there's any shadyness in this practice, we can not only complain about it but also use our strength to counteract it.",
        "All right.",
        "We've got one last and very little time issue.",
        "It's about guns.",
        "Now there was a ban on assault rifles initiated in 1994.",
        "It expired nearly three years ago.",
        "Since then, apparently criminals have upped their war weapons.",
        "And now 20 departments across the country are upgrading their own firepower to AK-47 assault rifles.",
        "Is this simply staying ahead of the curb or do we need to change the law so that there are fewer of these guns in criminal hands?",
        "John, I'll stay with you - quickly.",
        "Well, briefly, I'm not sure how we could keep guns like that out of criminal hands with enforcement the way it is.",
        "And so unfortunately I think that we have to give our enforcement agencies these sorts of weapons.",
        "It's a tragic thing, but we're stuck with it at this point.",

        "I worry about the escalation.",
        "And at least if there are laws in place it makes it a little bit harder.",
        "I know that John is right that they get out there.",
        "But anything to try to slow it, and certainly I think the assault ban should be back in place.",
        "All right.",
        "Michael?",
        "Well, you know, we're in an arms war.",
        "And I remember the old six-shooter that was replaced by the nine millimeter, in New York City at least.",
        "AK-47 assault weapons, they are sort of a far cry from when the London police didn't carry weapons, I think.",
        "We're living in a different world and different society and even the Beverly Hills cop used to have to go to the trunk and pick up a shotgun.",
        "Now they want the shotguns inside the car with the police.",
        "We are in an arms war.",
        "The important thing here is that people, police, have to have guidelines for the use of these more powerful weapons including the nine millimeter.",
