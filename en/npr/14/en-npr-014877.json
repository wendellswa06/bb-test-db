        "But interestingly, in many ways, the United States and Pakistan are in lock-step on this.",
        "Both are extremely unhappy at the revelations these contain.",
        "And from the American point of view, the revelations that reportedly are coming out, we have not yet seen, we have not yet gained access to these the revelations that have reportedly come out are among things like the involvement of the Haqqani network, one of the deadliest forces operating in against American forces, and they're allowed to operate unfettered on Pakistani soil.",
        "This is a wound.",
        "This is a festering thing that goes on here, and what you end up getting then, Tony, is the divergence of views about what are the interests of this alliance?",

        "What it needs to have done is to shut down all the militant groups.",

        "Well, in theory, it is a big advantage not only because obviously he almost always has the advantage in the matchup but also because he can throw twice as many pitches as most pitchers.",
        "You know, if his right arm is getting worn out, you know, he can go to his left arm.",
        "That's a fascinating point.",

        "On the other hand, he could be the first person ever to have two Tommy John surgeries.",
        "(Laughter) Well, it's funny, he had a right-shoulder injury about three years ago, but he was able to keep pitching even while he was rehabbing that right arm with his left arm, so he just...",
