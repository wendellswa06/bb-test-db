        "So I think what you're going to have is a little bit more pressure put on Pakistan but not a whole lot of difference in action.",
        "Well, before we bring some of our listeners in to join the conversation, we have an in-studio guest I'd like to bring in right now.",
        "His name is Bill Harlow.",
        "He knows all about the fallout created by leaked information.",

        "My first question to you, before we get to the callers, is this -and Julie, I want you to stick around, as well - what do leaks like this do?",
        "Well, a leak of this size is somewhat unusual.",
        "Usually, they are much more focused than this.",
        "This is a broad leak of a lot of information.",
        "And I'm not sure yet whether anybody knows whether there's some real significant, hugely important nuggets of information among those 90,000 documents.",
        "But what it does do is send a terrible signal to everybody who the United States is trying to get to work with us in these ongoing warfronts.",
        "It tells people, if you share information confidentially with the United States government, if you're a human source, if you're helping to facilitate some electronic gathering of information, that we may not be able to protect your identity.",
        "We may not be able to protect the information that you have shared with us.",
        "And so, as hard as it already is to get people to share with us, it will be even more difficult because of this kind of leak.",

        "I'm doing well.",
        "Thanks for the call.",
        "Really interesting subject for me as a history and political science teacher, but it seems that these days, when there's leaks, the story becomes more about the leak than the actual information.",
        "And especially in this case, it seems like the information is all is not too surprising to anyone.",
        "And, you know, the rhetoric coming from the White House and the administration is about the usual that is expected.",

        "Is that the case that we're facing at the moment?",
        "It seems a bit, so far, from what I've heard.",
        "Nothing that has been reported has been particularly remarkable.",
        "It is fairly consistent with what you've heard in other places.",
        "And you have to keep in mind that even as bulky as this leak is with thousands and thousands of documents, this is raw intelligence, raw data, which may not in fact be accurate.",
        "There certainly is much more information.",
        "There may be countervailing information out there.",
        "And so what happens is that the information is mildly interesting to some folks.",

        "Well, you know, Julie McCarthy, let me come to you because you're in Pakistan, and we know that you have already heard about the leak, although the specifics of it may not have reached you yet.",
        "Is there any way to determine whether or not the folks there where you are are in anticipation of what may be leaked that they haven't yet heard about?",
        "Well, what they say to you is, look, The New York Times and Der Spiegel and The Guardian newspaper were given weeks to pore over these documents, thank you very much.",
        "We will do the same, and we'll get back to you on that.",
        "But there is, you know, when we talk about how the leak itself has become the nature of leaking has become the story over the substance of these, I think what you have to see in this relationship is that there's already a huge deficit of trust.",
        "And this furthers that deficit.",
        "It gives fodder to the critics of Pakistan that they haven't done enough, that they are consorting with the enemy, that they are not interested in being on the same page with the Americans.",
        "And it leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the Americans who have been trying to change this public diplomacy, to make it one where we can be liked in a place where we are loathed.",
        "That cannot be underestimated here in Pakistan.",
        "The anti-American sentiment is enormous here.",
        "So I think that these instances have all kinds of reverberations that are that can have legs.",
        "And absolutely true, we don't know how much of this is half-rumor, how much of this is speculation, how much of this is sort of tit for tat, let's, you know, let's try to impugn the reputation of the Pakistanis.",
        "But there seems to be a big-picture revelation here, that you've got an alliance that in some ways is a deeply troubled one.",

        "Does that put this in a category of being more, much more critical to the interests of the Obama administration than something of a smaller size?",
        "Well, a single piece of paper could be devastating, depending on the information that's in it.",
        "But because there is so much material in here, and it potentially can do some serious damage to our relations not only with the Pakistanis but with others, I'm sure the administration will approach it very seriously.",
        "This administration has been very aggressive about going after leaks and leakers, perhaps even more so than the previous administration.",
        "So I think I'm sure they're going to go after it very aggressively, if for no other reason than to send a signal to other people who are thinking about leaking that there's a price to be paid for dumping out this kind of material.",
        "And clearly, when you dump out 90,000 pages or documents, nobody can go through it carefully and know exactly what's in there.",
