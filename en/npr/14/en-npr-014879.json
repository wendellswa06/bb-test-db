        "And that was at a time when I was as well-known a figure as Julian Assange, to say the least at that point.",

        "Well, yes, I do see a difference.",
        "I think each one has its challenges for the government and is dangerous for the government.",
        "But whatever the reason behind it and I don't buy that this Army specialist who did the leaks to WikiLeaks the first time around was necessarily doing so for high moral purpose, but even if he were, if you believe that so strongly, then I believe the right thing to do is to announce what you are doing, not try to hide, not try to do it anonymously."

        "But on - I do want to follow up on one thing that was just said, as the previous speaker knows very well - and I can agree with him, by the way, that putting this volume out does - stuff that can't all have been vetted or read or whatnot is more than questionable.",
        "It's a - it does have some risks depending on the kind of material you're putting out.",

        "I think the big message of putting out that volume of material will be if people have come to grasp, as I expect they will, that nowhere in that vast amount of material will they find a good reason for us to be in Afghanistan or for escalating or for spending another $30 billion come this Wednesday or for more.",
