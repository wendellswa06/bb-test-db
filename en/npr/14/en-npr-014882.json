        "And I wanted to ask you, there's been, over the past few days, an extraordinary exchange between the president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, and Karl Eikenberry, the outgoing U.S.",

        "This is all in the context of the planned announcement by the president, but start, if you would, with what President Hamid Karzai had to say.",
        "Well, Saturday he made a couple of speeches, and it has to be said that they were at the end of months and months of similar digs at coalition forces.",
        "It's been over a year now since the first time President Karzai, in a public speech, actually threatened to join the Taliban.",
        "And oftentimes he'll be making these criticisms after a mistaken U.S.",
        "airstrike that killed perhaps a dozen civilians, and his criticism is very harsh.",
        "He'll get an apology later from the Americans, but the - sometimes, for example on Saturday, this happened almost at the same time that three suicide bombers attacked a police checkpoint in the center of Kabul and killed 11 people, most of them civilians.",

        "Eikenberry has been here for two years.",
        "Before that, he was here twice as a military man.",
        "And it's not clear whether this was just a personal - when Eikenberry made his remarks yesterday, he said he was speaking from the heart and responding, without naming the president, to the remarks that President Karzai had made.",
        "Yet the embassy was quick with copies of those remarks.",
        "These were - well, had they been cleared with Washington?",
        "Well, they weren't as quick as we would've liked.",
        "It was quite a while before they sent out what they called an amended speech.",
        "They said he had gone off of his prepared remarks, but I'm not sure if that's plausible deniability because there was some warning to some journalists that he might be saying something.",
        "Now, we don't know where Eikenberry's next assignment is.",
        "His relationship here was off to a bad start very early on, when Bob Woodward's book released a cable where Eikenberry was talking about President Hamid Karzai as being someone who's possibly mentally ill.",
        "The quote that everyone might remember was he's on his meds, he's off his meds.",
        "And that poisoned the relationship between the U.S.",
        "ambassador and the president of Afghanistan from the start.",
        "After that, there were more WikiLeaks, again giving frank assessments of Karzai's weakness as a leader, all under Eikenberry's name.",
        "So it wasn't that he had much of a relationship to destroy with the president.",
        "And at this point, have the Afghans, so far as anybody knows, been told of the U.S.",

        "In recent years, big oil companies have been getting out of the retail gas game, selling stations to focus on drilling and production, where they can make more money.",
        "That keeps jobbers like Johnson busy as more stations have a choice - contract with a brand name or go generic.",
        "If it's not a branded convenience store, typically they don't really care what brand it comes from.",
        "And you do get different pricing from each major oil company every day.",

        "He calls himself a believer in the benefits of the extra additives brands put in their gas, though many experts say they don't make much of a difference.",
