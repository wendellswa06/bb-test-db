        "No, everyone's waiting to hear what the number will be.",
        "We don't know that they have any advance warning on that.",
        "Everybody's been speculating about it for quite some time, and it's happening at the same time as seven areas in the country will be transitioning to Afghan control.",
        "Most of them are not a huge challenge.",
        "They're places in the country where in fact Afghan security forces, police and soldiers, have been in control for some time.",
        "But it's sort of a pilot project, hopefully a confidence-building measure where Afghan forces will be in the lead, and American forces will step back, and this is supposed to build people's trust in their armed forces, et cetera.",
        "And as this transition happens, are Afghans - let me put it this way: Is President Karzai cognizant of the need for continued U.S.",
        "presence, combat presence, to bolster his regime, or is he thinking about, as he said, joining the Taliban?",
        "It's almost without a doubt that President Karzai knows that his regime is really being held up by the 130,000 foreign troops in country; 100,000 of those are American.",
        "And most Afghan analysts say he's just playing a double game.",
        "One the one hand, he knows he has to keep the American troops here; on the other hand, there's a growing anti-American sentiment after 10 years and many mistakes by the Americans here, and he's certainly playing to the gallery and perhaps to the Taliban with whom he'd like to strike a deal.",
        "And on the third hand, he knows that the Americans can't really pull out that fast.",
        "The Americans need a stable Afghanistan, and Hamid Karzai is probably their only option, at least until the next election cycle in 2014, when the U.S.",
        "is supposed to be leaving anyhow.",
        "And finally, President Karzai said the Americans are in negotiations with the Taliban.",
        "The secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, said on TV over the weekend only very preliminary feeling-out kinds of discussions have happened so far, and he doesn't expect anything to bear any fruit at all until maybe next winter.",
        "We've been trying to parse this for months here.",
        "It's been kind of a discussion of how many high-level Taliban commanders can dance on the head of a pin.",
        "There's been attempts to get in contact with the Taliban.",
        "It's been very clear that NATO here on the ground, especially the British, have been reaching out to people who, in one case at least, an imposter who they thought was a high-ranking Taliban member.",
        "But we've had nothing confirmed on the ground here.",
        "The Taliban are constantly denying they're in talks.",
        "We've had several reports of meetings in Germany or in Britain, and really when President Karzai said this on Saturday, it was in the middle of one of his typically I guess contradictory speeches.",
        "He was contradicting things he had said in the past and even sometimes things he'd said in his own speech.",
        "And so it was difficult to say really how seriously you should take it when he said the Americans are in negotiations, but he was implying that the Afghan government isn't.",
        "And then what was even more surprising was when Secretary of Defense Gates came out on the Sunday morning talk shows yesterday and confirmed that there were preliminary contacts.",
        "Still, the Taliban deny any contact at all.",
        "Quil Lawrence, thanks very much for your time.",
        "We appreciate it."

        "And speaking of the president's options, you've said in fact he has three.",
        "Yeah, I've testified recently in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and laid out three options.",
        "One would be the sort of classic counterterrorism strategy that many people, including some in the White House, have advocated, which is reducing most U.S.",
        "forces to a bare minimum, perhaps several hundred Special Operations forces who do primarily targeted actions against al-Qaida and other foreign fights and potentially some senior Taliban in Afghanistan and across the border in Pakistan.",
        "The second would be something along the lines of the status quo right now, which is a fairly robust conventional and Special Operations footprint, which would do both counterterrorism and counterinsurgency, still probably several divisions in Afghanistan, maybe 60,000 forces by something along the lines of 2012, '13 and then slowly decreasing by 2014.",
        "And then a third option, which is where I came down with really something in the middle, downsizing especially the conventional presence over time by 2014 pretty significantly and focusing on the use of Special Operations forces both for targeting action but also for training Afghanistan national and local security forces.",
        "So there are a whole range of options not just in terms of the force presence but I think also in terms of the strategy that's used.",
        "And how would the president signal that by withdrawing, say, 5,000 support troops, he might signal that he wants to keep a lot of combat forces there for as long as possible.",
        "I think, you know, the way this has happened over the last several years, and I've been - I was involved in last year's review for the president, is this often happens year by year.",
        "So the decision on decreasing the number of forces this year still leaves a fair amount of options open for next year and the year after."
