        "And that means a quick, some might say a quick withdrawal of U.S.",

        "Well, you can be subtle about it.",
        "I mean, you don't have to rush for any exit.",
        "You can simply gradually change who's in the lead in these patrols.",
        "And the key to doing that is this new team that's coming in.",
        "I'm absolutely convinced, by the way, Neal, this is going to happen.",
        "I mean, you know, I really am, because you have an entirely new military team coming in in October, and if you look at them, you have General Allen who's going to be in charge in Afghanistan; General Madison, Central Command; General Dempsey as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs; General Odierno in charge of the Army and General Dunford as the assistant commandant of the Marine Corps.",
        "What those five gentlemen have in common is they all went through the transition experience in Iraq in Anbar Province in 2006-2007, and I am absolutely convinced they're going to take that playbook and quietly apply it in Afghanistan, which will lead to fewer forces being there but in a very quiet manner.",
        "Here's an email we have from Aaron(ph) in San Antonio: Today, June 20th, marks the third anniversary of the death of a fellow Marine from San Antonio in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.",
        "His name is Sergeant Matthew E.",
        "Mendoza(ph).",
        "The mission is an important one, but the cost is great.",

        "Hi.",
        "You know, I just got back, and I'll tell you, what your caller, the person you were just talking to on the air said is wrong because I had a 200-man company of ANA, Afghan National Army, working with us on missions, and we'd get the same 22 people each and every time.",
        "They don't want to take the lead.",
        "We had to kick (bleep) - pardon my language, but...",
        "I understand, and I apologize for excising the word in question, but I understand your anger at the loss of your buddy's life.",

        "Hey, skipper, look, Tim, I understand exactly what you're saying.",
        "The dilemma we have is if we don't have them do it, we don't want to be doing it for them forever.",
        "I believe it's going to end up a mess.",
        "I understand from being out with all the advisor teams that it's really hit or miss with the Afghan soldiers.",
        "And I don't know more than anybody else how to infuse the Afghans with a sense of their own patriotism and to take responsibility for themselves.",
        "But I do know that it is wrong, after 10 years, for us to continue to give them all the money we're giving them, and we've spoiled them, and we've inculcated into them this sense of entitlement so we have this semi-nutcake as a president over there, Karzai, feeling he can say whatever he wants, whenever he wants.",
        "If we don't start becoming firm and saying, look, you have to do this, we're not going to do it all for you forever, we're going to be stuck there.",
        "Now, the other thing that I believe is I do believe in a straight-up fight today, the Taliban would beat the Afghan army because the Taliban have more ferocity.",
        "But at the same time, we're negotiating with the Taliban.",
        "Now, that tells us that our top leaders do not believe the Taliban is the same as al-Qaida.",
        "That is, they don't see the Taliban as our mortal threat because if they did, and it was our critical interest, we wouldn't be trying to negotiate with them.",
        "So I think we can end up with a pretty messy situation but one that doesn't require so many of our soldiers, so many of your troops, so many of the Marines down in Helmand having to carry the burden for them.",
        "Tim, we're sorry for your loss.",
        "And thank you, but - and I agree with him.",
        "I'm just saying, you know, everyone says how are we going to get a clean or a good pullout, and let's get it through our minds now, it's not going to be clean, it's not going to be a good pullout.",
        "If we just pull out, it's going to collapse anyway.",
        "So it's like ripping a Band-Aid off.",
        "Let's just rip it off and see where we go.",
        "'Cause that's...",
        "Tim, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Welcome home.",
        "And Seth Jones, let's bring you back into the conversation.",
        "Some people say there is no amount of time that is going to get the Afghan forces up and ready for this challenge.",
        "So let's face the facts now.",
        "Well, I think there are two challenges for that line of argument.",
        "One, is we've already seen, in southern Afghanistan in particular, locals rise up against the Taliban in multiple provinces... Well, I think there are two challenges with that line of argument.",
        "One is we've already seen, in southern Afghanistan, in particular, locals rise up against the Taliban in multiple provinces.",
        "One of the best examples, I think, is virtually every single district in Oruzgan province, just north of Kandahar, a range of Ghilzai Pashtuns and some Hazaras have risen up against the Taliban with support from U.S.",
        "and Afghan special forces.",
        "It's not been a large Afghan national army or police push, but it's mostly locals.",
        "So, I think we're seeing - and public opinion polls in Afghanistan continue to indicate very low levels of support for the Taliban, so I think there is a sustainable element.",
        "The problem is, most people want to do this using only the central government in Afghanistan.",
        "The reality, in a Pashtun society, is that tribes, subtribes, clans and communities end up being quite significant."

        "The other bases, we shut down the Pesh River Valley.",

        "The fact is we'd be on missions and we'd be puling security, we'd be, you know, five minutes away from a vicious firefight, the ANA would be smoking hash, playing grab-ass or whatever you may want to call it, and sticking flowers into their gun barrels and behind their ears and laying around doing nothing.",
        "There's a few good ANA, but they are definitely not as disciplined, well-trained or as in the battle as the Taliban are.",

        "You know, though, what I think for our interests, American interests, the only reason we went into Afghanistan was to prevent Afghanistan being a sanctuary for al-Qaida kinds of attacks against us in the West.",
        "I think we can accomplish that because, as you know as well as I, our air is really incredible at finding targets, so I could imagine a situation in which the Taliban end up being like Hezbollah in Lebanon where they have an awful lot of control over different areas, and they have their own weapons, but they'd be damn careful not to go over certain lines so that they cause us to come down on them like a ton of bricks.",
        "And that certain line would be allowing al-Qaida to come back in en masse, and I could imagine us having a mess...",

        "She does have a point, and I think it's it'll certainly require, I think, as Bing West noted, pushing a lot more responsibility into the hands of both central government and local individuals.",
        "I've served multiple tours for U.S.",
        "Special Operations command in Afghanistan, most recently left in February of this year.",
        "But I would say one other issue in response to a range of individuals, and that is, one: I don't think the United States - it would be in its interests for a large Taliban reconquest, backed by the Pakistan government, of Afghanistan, for two reasons.",
        "One is we saw these human rights violations committed by that government in the 1980s and its treatment of women; but, second, as Bing noted, and more importantly, the Taliban and most of the Afghan insurgent groups, including the Haqqani network, have a very close relationship, not just to al-Qaida but to a range of foreign fighters - the Tariqi Taliban in Pakistan, for example, that have targeted the United States homeland.",
