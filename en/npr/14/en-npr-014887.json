        "He has lawyers under him who are working with the case officers on what the proposals might be.",
        "And he would also be consulting with lawyers at the NSC and lawyers at DOJ.",
        "And at some point, I'm sure they all decided that this was an issue that needed to be addressed head-on, and have a formal ruling made on it.",
        "The formal ruling, in the form of the recently released Justice Department memos, has ended up thwarting Rizzo's career.",
        "Despite his years as acting general counsel, John Rizzo has never ascended to the permanent top job.",
        "He came close in 2007.",
        "President Bush nominated him.",
        "The Senate Intelligence Committee held a confirmation hearing, but it did not go well."

        "They're a little bit different, and the distinction matters.",

        "This only applies to one chamber, so it's not a law.",
        "It doesn't have to be passed by the Senate.",
        "What that one does is it establishes a new office of employee advocacy that will essentially represent employees when they file complaints.",
        "Lawmakers always had a legal advocate in these complaints.",
        "Now employees will have them, too.",
        "It will also require congressional offices to certify that they haven't used any taxpayer funds to shield payouts for any harassment complaints that may have been settled in their offices.",

        "That would still need to pass the Senate.",
        "But that fundamentally overhauls the federal law that handles how - that dictates how complaints are handled on the Hill.",
        "It will do things like streamline the process, eliminate mandatory wait times, enforce mediation.",
        "And supporters say this is all about supporting victims' rights.",
        "Just to take stock here, at least four lawmakers have resigned in recent months over allegations of sexual misconduct - one senator, three members of the House.",
        "How do these changes affect lawmakers and the way that they operate in Congress?",
        "These measures are really about sending a message of zero tolerance.",
        "California Democrat Jackie Speier - she's been one of the leading voices in this debate, and she talked about that dynamic on the floor today.",
        "Here's what she said.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "Members are going to be held responsible for their bad behavior, and we will require them to pay the settlement in full in 90 days.",
        "And if they can't do that, we will garnish their wages.",
        "We will garnish their Thrift Saving Plans (ph), and we will garnish their Social Security.",
        "So what she's talking about is that this would be a law that says any lawmaker involved personally in a settlement would have to pay out of their own pocket.",
        "Currently taxpayers pay for those settlements when they're handled.",
        "And a lot of this conversation, I would say, has always focused on sexual harassment complaints, but this would apply to any harassment or discrimination complaint against a lawmaker.",
        "And as you noted, there is now a new House rule that is effective immediately that would ban any member of the House from engaging in a sexual relationship with anyone who works for them in their office.",
        "If they were, it would make them subject to an ethics violation, which is something that would be very new.",

        "Staffer-to-staffer dating is still OK.",
