        "There's no agreement on who should be speaker.",
        "Why is it so difficult to find somebody?",
        "Yeah, well, not because, I think the idea is that the speaker would be part of a package deal which would also include nominations for President, for Vice-President, for the Prime Minister, for the deputy premiers and so on.",
        "Although there is absolutely no reason why we can't elect a Speaker of the House right away.",
        "But you see, many of these parliamentary blocks feel that it should be part of a package you know a large package which includes all the major posts in the government.",

        "Hopefully, I mean it's just a hope, that we will be able to form this government by the end of this month, two week's time.",
        "Or else if we can't agree on the whole package, I believe, you know, we should try to at least agree on the nominations for the Speaker of Parliament and his two deputies.",
        "Because then when this is done, when they are elected, then the Parliament can start working.",
        "But now, until a Speaker is elected, Parliament really can't do anything.",

        "Though I also, in a sense, have to fault some Democrats and some on the left for creating this atmosphere, because they, you know, they have been - 2000, admittedly, you know, was a one in a million election in Florida and it was a complete mess and we can understand that.",
        "But the margin in Ohio, for example, was close, but it was a lot farther apart clearly than 2000.",
        "But amongst the liberal media, you had this idea that Ohio was stolen as well, so the presidential election was stolen.",
        "So I think you have this drumbeat on the left saying, you know, that oh, the machines are going to be hacked and so your vote won't count.",
        "And so, you know, to communities that feel vulnerable and feel sensitive to some of these issues, and they're going to be listening to it, they're going to think, oh well, okay, that's right.",

        "I won't show up.",
        "So, I mean, I really think that members on the left have to take a look at themselves and figure out - just as Callie said - how they could help safeguard the vote, while at the same time not sending these defeatist messages themselves.",
        "Callie, though, I mean, if the message is accurate and we can discuss different aspects of what messages are out there about, you know, voter fraud and voter intimidation, are you really stuck if you are trying to inform people about what's going on and at the same time encourage them to vote?",
        "How can you do one without the other?",
        "I think you're not stuck if you make this point.",
        "This is the point I would make to particularly any African-Americans: there is too much history with people literally dying to make certain that we could get to those polls.",
        "So I don't care if you think everybody in the world is trying to steal the vote.",
        "Then - think about it this way - it's volume.",
        "So if they steal three votes, then the more of us are there, there's three more they're going to count.",
        "That's how I'm looking at it.",
        "I mean, if you want to go with the conspiracy, I'll go there with you.",
        "But that means get more folk to the poll, because they can't, you know, not count everybody's vote.",
        "So the point is get there, and get there because not only folks have died and made this a reality for all of us, but that you are taking your own lives back in your own hands when you do it.",

        "And what it does is bring folks here and teach them some very formal negotiating skills, but also it's a way of raising the issues, not only about rape as a war tool but I think what also has to be paid attention to, which is happening increasingly, are the attacks on schools that are teaching women.",
