        "Now, Thomas Cromwell, who of course was Henry VIII's main advisor, he was the person who really built a case against Anne Boleyn.",
        "Before we talk about the case, I want to ask you why he was after her.",
        "Originally, he'd been her supporter.",
        "But by 1535, a year before her downfall, they'd become rivals, and probably this has something to do with his planned measures in respect to the monasteries.",
        "Rowan Moss(ph), a computer scientist by trade, says he knows what the problem is.",
        "Municipal Wi-Fi proponents have discovered that radio signals are degraded by everything, from the metal framing in your building to your height above the ground.",
        "Meaning if you live in a skyscraper, you could be in for double trouble.",
        "Everything else, including glass, is a real inhibitor.",
        "You have metal blinds on your window, that's an inhibitor.",
        "Any metal internal structures that might, you know, like a frame or shelving, you know, everything is going to contribute to degrading.",
        "The laws of Physics dictate there are going to be some holes in the network.",
        "But that doesn't mean the concept can't succeed.",
        "Or that MetroFi and the city can benefit each other.",
        "Here's how it works.",
        "In exchange for letting MetroFi bolt antennas onto its traffic lights and street signs, the city gets a free Wi-Fi cloud.",
        "In theory, it can use the cloud for everything, from inter-office communications to controlling the timing of stop lights.",
        "On the other hand, MetroFi gets to make money by advertising to the thousands of Portlanders who use the free Wi-Fi service.",
        "At least that's the theory.",
        "It's a flawed motto because I do not believe in most cities that you can support the entire cost of a network just based on local advertising, or even a few were lucky enough to get some national advertising as well.",
        "Craig Settles is a Wi-Fi consultant in California.",
        "He says Portland got a sweet deal.",
        "Cities that are just starting to build Wi-Fi networks are having to promise to pay to use part of the service or attract large businesses to subsidize it.",
        "Meanwhile, Portlanders like Russell Senior are starting to grumble about MetroFi.",
        "Basically I think what they want to do is at greater distances from access points they want people to buy boosters or more powerful radios that the access points can hear."

        "So are boosters a way MetroFi can make money of the free Wi-Fi system?",
        "The company's marketing vice president, Adrian van Haaften, says absolutely not.",
        "We don't buy and sell these units.",
        "So this is not something that we use as the revenue generator.",
        "These are separate companies that are selling these units, and they just make the network connectivity easier.",
        "Still, says van Haaften, a special antenna is a small price to pay to shrink the digital divide.",
        "Indeed, despite such problems, about 400 cities across the nation are trying to go wireless.",
        "Some, like Philadelphia, have bigger plans than Portland and are further along.",
        "free Wi-Fi has been slower to arrive than expected, partially because bigger cities are harder to wire, and because the financial model under which Wi-Fi is going to work is still being tweaked.",

        "This story obviously brings up many moral questions, questions that Jim is wrestling with.",

        "Welcome to the program.",
        "A pleasure to be here.",
        "Okay.",
        "So let me ask the first question that comes to mind, and that is, is Jim doing anything immoral by living with Nancy and while he's still married to Anne, who obviously knows nothing about what's going on?",
        "Well, that's really the million dollar question, of course, and I think it's something concerning which reasonable people can disagree.",
        "It's a surprisingly complicated issue to think about for such a simple case.",
        "Let me just mention quickly a couple of factors that seem relevant to thinking about it.",
        "One issue is simply whether or not his wife, Anne, still exists.",
        "That's not straightforward.",
        "Arguably a case can be made if the dementia's gone - sufficiently progressed - that the wife, Anne, no longer exists.",
        "Then we might think, well, if it's straightforward, we think that fidelity is required in marriage but only until the death of the spouse.",
        "If the spouse no longer exists, then perhaps in the relevant sense the promise of fidelity is no longer binding upon Jim.",
        "That's one issue."

        "A second issue - even if we put aside the question of whether or not Ann still exists, if we assume that she still does, I think it's fairly clear from the story that Jim certainly treats Anne as though she still exists.",
        "He's not just visiting a body.",
        "I think he takes himself to be visiting his wife.",
        "So if we suppose that the wife still exists, then the question is, is he violating his marriage promise?",
        "And interestingly, that's not straightforward either because the question is what exactly did he promise to his wife?",
        "Well, what about the idea that she doesn't know what's going on and so she is not being harmed in any way?",
        "Would that be a reasonable excuse, to use that word?",
        "The common view about this is perhaps might be what you don't know can't hurt you.",
        "And clearly if we accept that thought, then that might drive the conclusion that Anne's not being hurt by the relation between Jim and Nancy.",
        "And if so, then why not go ahead?",
        "But there maybe more to individual well-being, more to the kind of life you'd like to have than just getting the insides right.",
        "And so we have to at least open the door to the possibility that Anne is being harmed by the relationship, even though she's unaware of it.",
        "Once we recognize the possibility that things that you're not aware of can still be bad for you, then we have to raise that possibility.",
        "But having raised that possibility is still not clear whether that's true in this case.",
        "It's not clear that Anne does have any interest - as we might put it - whether she's got an interest in Jim's continuing fidelity.",
        "And so even on the straightforward question, what appears to be the straightforward question, who's helped and who's hurt, isn't it clear that Ann's not hurt, I think that's not straightforward either.",
        "It's a difficult case.",
        "Okay.",
        "Well, let me just pin you down to a very simplistic answer.",
        "You're Jim.",
        "Do you do it or not?",
        "Well, on balance he is doing her some slight harm.",
        "But the key word, at least in my current thinking, is that it's slight enough harm so that given the benefits to him and to Nancy, on balanced it's a legitimate thing to be doing.",
        "That's Yale philosophy professor Shelly Kagan.",
        "Thanks again for joining us.",
        "Also, I think he saw her as a threat to his own power.",
        "His natural inclinations tended towards an alliance with the emperor who was the nephew of Catherine of Aragon, and Anne would be an obstacle to that.",
        "Talk about how Thomas Cromwell built the case against Anne.",
        "Well, some of the first evidence is said to have come to him from abroad, from the French court.",
        "We don't know what it was, but he himself said that there were rumors going around the queen's household about her infidelities and that her servants became so shocked that they couldn't keep it to themselves any longer.",
        "And they came and, you know, revealed what they had heard to himself and other members of the privy council.",
        "And thereafter, interrogations took place of every member of her household."

        "Many historians have looked at the evidence and have concluded that it was, at best, flawed but most likely just wrong, just made up.",
        "That's true.",
        "What do you make of it?",
        "I mean, when you actually look at the evidence, was it I mean, you come to the conclusion that it was wrong, but it was - was it actually crafted in a way that was convincing?",
        "The problem is most of the evidence doesn't survive.",
        "But it was sufficient at the time to convince the king, Cromwell and 97 judges and jurors that Anne was guilty.",
        "But if you look at the surviving evidence, and a lot of it's inferential or circumstantial, and you look at the reasons for her innocence in the case for her guilt, you will find an overwhelming case for her innocence almost to be conclusive.",

        "Yeah, that's the big contradiction of our system.",
        "And we have a set of agricultural subsidies that are designed in such a way that they encourage farmers to overproduce things like corn, and that big corn crop gets turned into soda in the form of high fructose corn syrup and other sweetened beverages."
