        "And you know, even if you take the government's case at its very best, all you really have are allegations that he, like Zacarias Moussaoui before him, like Yaser Esam Hamdi before him - did some bad stuff, wanted to do some bad stuff, but there is no clear line to draw between him and any specific bad act other than sort of generally wanting to advance the interests of al-Qaida.",
        "And that has been a problem in these terror prosecutions from the get-go.",
        "Well, what conclusions do you draw about these terror prosecutions, say, starting right after 9/11?",
        "I think that two things happened and they happened very quickly, Alex, and they're related.",
        "The first was that the government, the Bush administration, decided to focus on interrogation and detention as opposed to fair trials.",
        "Right from the starting gate they said we want to grab these guys and question them.",
        "They're all ticking time bombs.",
        "And we don't really care what happens down the line, if they don't have lawyers, if they don't know the charges against them, if we've shipped them off somewhere to be questioned illegally.",
        "All of that is not our problem.",
        "We want to get these guys and get information.",
        "We'll work out the trials issue later.",
        "The second thing that happened, and it's related, is that in order to claim the authority to do that - to grab these people and keep them for years in detention without access to attorneys - the government had to overblow the charges against them.",
        "In other words, if you grab a Moussaoui, you have to call him the 20th hijacker, even if it's clear he's not.",
        "If you grab a Padilla, you have to claim he's a radiological bomber, even if he's not.",
        "And so these very, very broad statements of wrongdoing were made.",
        "We have these criminal masterminds.",
        "And therefore I think they felt that they were justified in holding them for years without charges.",
        "Well, the problem is years later, when it turns out they were just kind of duds, you know, they were these low level foot soldiers - yes, they wanted to do bad things against the United States.",
        "Yes, they were sort of vaguely involved in advancing the interests of al-Qaida.",
        "But they were not criminal masterminds.",
        "And now you have a problem: A) you have duds; and B) you've completely tainted the evidence that you can use against them.",
        "Their confessions are illegal.",
        "They can't be used at trial.",
        "They've had no access to lawyers.",
        "And in some cases they have been damaged.",
        "Sandy Rosenthal with the group levees.org unveiled the historical marker.",
        "Well, if the government fails to win a conviction against Jose Padilla and his co-defendants, what's it going to mean for future terror trials?",
        "Well, I think that the wrong lesson to learn is the one that the government is going to say, which is we can't get these guys.",
        "Clearly, trials aren't working.",
        "We need to cook up even more rigged trials with a heavy sum on the scale against the defendant, and that way we can nail them.",
        "Of course, that's completely the wrong lesson.",
        "The right lesson is, hey, if you want to put a guy on trial, treat them fairly.",
        "Give him these basic sort of indicia of what it means to have a fair trial and then you can prosecute them.",
        "But it seems to me that with every trial that they lose - remember, they lost the death penalty against Musawi - they had to let Hamdi go back to Saudi Arabia.",
        "With every trial that they lose, I think there's a growing sense that we have to be more and more unfair to the defendants.",
        "And as I said, I think that's completely the wrong lesson."

        "He was generally for 9/11, and I think that's what they're hoping will happen, that this jury will say, you know what, we couldn't get those guys but maybe we can get this one and maybe that's good enough.",

        "But we're not the only ones who like to eat calamari, Humboldt squid are also on the menu for big ocean predators like sperm whales.",
        "And one place the sperm whales hunt down Humboldt squid is in the Sea of Cortez, between Baja California, and mainland Mexico, where the waters are just teeming with squid.",
        "But how do the big whales get the squid?",
        "Do they just gobble them up as the squid zip by?",

        "And these - this is the first type of tag to combine the both.",
        "And it took data every couple of seconds for up to a month, tracked all of their movements.",
        "Essentially, these are flight data recorders for whales.",
        "So what they had done was they had tagged three whales in a social group of about 10 to 15 whales.",
        "These are typically females and groups of females and calves.",
        "And previously, the idea was that they'd form these groups to share the burden of rearing their calves or to ward off, you know, the unwanted advances of young, non-dominant males.",
        "But this study is the first to suggest they also collaborate when they hunt.",
        "And by downloading the data, comparing it, they were showing that during some periods, these whales that were tagged and presumably others in the group would simultaneously dive really deep, sometimes downward to around a kilometer of depth.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "And researchers had thought they would all dive to a similar depth and just kind forage around.",
        "But the data is showing that typically two of the whales would go to the same depth, but the other one that was tagged would dive a few 100 meters deeper.",
        "And they would take turns doing that.",
        "I mean, some dives it would be one whale and the others would not dive deep.",
        "And this is just that the whales may have been herding the prey and into those large schools often called bait balls.",
        "Right.",
        "And they would take turns lunging into the foray and feeding.",
        "Right.",
        "And, you know, porpoises and seals are noted to do this with fish, but in this case, presumably, the deep-diving whale is going to patrol in the bottom of the bait ball to keep the squid from escaping into the depths.",
        "Well, how do we know they're eating squid and not something else?",
        "I mean, you were only tagging the whales - not you, but the researchers were only tagging the whales, in this case, right?"
