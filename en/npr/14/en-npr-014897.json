        "The hardliners, although they pretend that they have won the election fair and square, they know that, at the minimum, even according to their own statistics of voting, a large fraction of the population does not believe in the legitimacy of the election.",
        "And as if instability in the government and continuing street clashes were not enough, most of the senior ayatollahs within the clerical establishment in Qom, Iran's center of Islamic learning, have now made their disapproval known through their silence, says Farideh Farhi, an Iran specialist at the University of Hawaii.",
        "None of them has actually congratulated Mr. Ahmadinejad for his presidency, and they have remained quiet.",
        "Now, it is true that you have some clerics that are close to centers of power, and are considered to be hardliners, that have supported Mr. Ahmadinejad and Mr. Khamenei's action.",
        "But the silence that you hear from Qom are very significant.",
        "There is also growing evidence that many more than 20 — the official figure — were killed during clashes with police since the election, says Muhammed Sahimi.",

        "And, I mean, that's just one of their favorite prey items, I believe, from just, you know, monitoring stomach contents of other dead whales and things like that.",
        "And, indeed, one researcher told me this suggests but doesn't prove the notion of the tag team hunting particularly because you're not seeing what the prey is doing.",
        "And indeed, they don't even know that squid form these bait balls like fish do, but the researchers are now developing ways to track squid, sonar for example, so future work might strengthen the evidence for this collaborative hunting idea.",
        "Okay.",
        "Now, there was another study that I gather you covered while you were out there involving whales, but this had something to with industrial whaling and the carbon cycle.",
        "What's all that about?",
        "Well, I mean, this is essentially looking at the carbon footprint of what's called industrial whaling, which really commenced in the early 1900s, when you got, you know, ships with engines and they were going out to essentially harvest lots of whales in the ocean for meat and for oil and whale oil and things like that.",

        "And besides being big, they're on the few creatures in the ocean that's very long lived.",
        "They can live up to a century or more.",
        "So for both of those reasons, in marine ecosystems, whales are like forests.",
        "They hold a lot of carbon and they do it for a long time.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And this researcher looked at, again, the effect of industrial whaling during the 20th century.",
        "And in 1900, the researcher estimated that there was 110 million tons of whales in the ocean.",
        "And of course, the large-scale whaling continued into the '70s, and there have been some recovery since then for some species.",
        "But overall, the researcher estimated that industrial - hello?",
        "Oh, I'm here.",
        "Yeah, go ahead.",
        "Okay - estimated that industrial whaling during the 20th century returned about 105 million metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere, which is equivalent to about 385 million tons of carbon dioxide.",
        "And that's kind of small potatoes compared to the 7 billion tons of emissions that, you know, people generate each year.",
        "But it's not inconsiderable because that emission is equal to driving 128,000 Hummers for a century, or from burning all of the forests in New England at once.",
