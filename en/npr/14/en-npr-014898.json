        "And every Cruz supporter that I've talked to today and yesterday - they all say they want him to stay in it, that there is still a chance and that he could win this thing.",
        "So Don, what would it mean if Trump wins big today as expected?",
        "Well, going into today, Trump needed just 42 percent of all the remaining delegates.",
        "Again, that's before we allocate Indiana.",
        "Say he sweeps Indiana, which is possible.",
        "At that point, he'll need just over a third the rest of the way.",
        "So he doesn't clinch it today, but he becomes essentially unstoppable after today."
