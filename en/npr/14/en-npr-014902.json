        "Today's other case before the Supreme Court is not as sexy, but is important.",
        "It challenges a cornerstone of the nation's political money laws, the notion that candidates have a constitutional right to spend as much as they want to get elected.",
        "NPR's Peter Overby reports.",
        "It's safe to say that nobody in the Vermont campaign finance case ever undressed for Playboy Magazine.",
        "But it is fair to point out that the case itself lays bare a weird contradiction in campaign finance.",
        "Thirty years ago, the Supreme Court gave government the power to regulate campaign contributions, the money given to candidates and party committees.",
        "But the court said nobody can limit the amount politicians spend.",
        "Here's the logic of that ruling.",
        "Contribution limits help prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption, while spending limits violate a candidate's first amendment First Amendment rights.",
        "Or, in political shorthand, a candidate's campaign money is a form of free speech.",
        "But as campaign costs rose sharply in the 1990s, Vermont lawmakers decided to challenge that precedent head-on.",
        "They passed a law saying that no candidate for governor can spend more than $300,000.",
        "Here's Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell.",
        "No comment, no comment.",
        "Yes and no, maybe.",
        "You know, that's a very interesting point.",
        "The answer in short is no. It seems like everyone has kind of reached back to something that you know, their grandmother did or something that they heard about when they were traveling in Hungary or some kind of strange, you know, amorphous story emerges.",
        "So it doesn't seem like people really take advantage of the modern cures.",
        "They do harken back to the old things.",
        "Actually, New Orleans, one thing that, speaking of soup, that's very popular, is doing something that Holly was just talking about.",
        "There's something called the Crescent City cure, which is known as yaka mein or old sober.",
        "And in a lot of neighborhoods, actually, ones that have now been destroyed by Katrina, you could go into a bodega and ask for an old sober.",
        "And what it was, was spaghetti with some meat, usually beef or pork chops, and some boiled eggs.",
        "And there was often the amalgam of, again, the protein and the carbs and the fat really did help people feel better.",
        "Well, I'm prepared to share with America one of the things that I was told worked.",
        "I'm not prepared to swear that it does work, but I don't know if you've ever heard this, but there's a dish of a tripe stew.",
        "It's not the singing group but it's a stew called menudo.",
        "And supposedly -",
        "Yes.",

        "Yes, I have.",
        "Actually, that's one of the remedies that we talk about on Epicurious.",
        "All those soups - the Mexican menudo and the Korean sul long tang, ramen, duck soup, you know, Vietnamese pho - all those soups really do help, because they're rehydrating us, because one of the problems that you have when you do have a hangover is you are very dehydrated.",
        "So, obviously, the best cure of all is drink a lot of water both before you go to bed and when you get up.",
        "I think probably the most interesting remedy that one of our users has posted is burnt marshmallows.",
        "Burnt marshmallows.",
        "Yes.",
        "Apparently, she tried this on a camping trip and - after consuming a lot of tequila - and it really worked.",
        "And then she told a girlfriend, and her girlfriend did it.",
        "Now does it apparently often.",
        "And essentially what you're doing is you're charring the marshmallow, eating the charred bit.",
        "And if you continue to do that and if you eat up to two marshmallows, apparently, your hangover is done.",
        "Interesting.",
        "We're talking with Tanya Steele, editor of Epicurious.com about hangover cures.",
        "Our number is 800-989-8255, if you care to share a hangover cure with us.",
        "And now we're entering today's lightning round where we're going to try and talk to as many people who have cures to share as we possibly can in the remaining four minutes and 52 seconds.",
        "So we start with Mary Anne in Cleveland, Ohio.",
        "Mary Anne, what's your cure?",
        "Hi.",
        "I don't know how scientific it is, but it seems to me that dehydration is the whole thing behind hangovers.",
        "And so what I do is drink a large amount of water right before I go to bed, causing me to have to urinate in the middle of the night, and then drink a big glass of water every time you wake up, hopefully visiting the bathroom a couple of times during the evening, during the night time, and then by morning, you feel fine.",
        "It's never failed me.",
        "Excellent.",
        "Well, Mary Anne, thanks for that.",
        "Let's try someone else.",
        "Here, we'll try Sean in Arkansas.",
        "Go ahead, Sean.",
        "Boy, just the thought of drinking all that water when you're drunk makes me feel sick.",
        "Well, there you go.",
