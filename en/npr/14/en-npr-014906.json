        "And to form a government, your need a two-thirds majority in the parliament to pick up a president in a packaged deal that would then bring in the prime minister, and the rough shape of what the Cabinet would look like.",
        "So he's going to have to get to two-thirds of the 328-seat parliament to form a government.",
        "But if he can drag out the government formation process, with the fighting going on in different parts of the country, and his ability to split rival politicians who are competing for plum posts, he could do it.",
