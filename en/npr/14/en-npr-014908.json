        "So when you see an increase - or even if it stays the same - that has to alert you to something going on in the environment.",
        "Yeah, I know that you focused on Flint, but lead levels, as we are finding out, are higher than is optimal in a lot of cities around the U.S., despite these laws that you just told us about - laws that mandate disclosures about potential lead problems in homes.",
