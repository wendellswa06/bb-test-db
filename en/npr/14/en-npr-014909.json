        "And what are those?",
        "Anthropods are small bugs; they're in the crustacean family, and they live on the sea ice.",
        "So how long will you be in the water?",
        "We usually make it 25 to 30 minutes before we get too cold.",
        "Yeah, what is the water temperature there?",
        "It's about 30.",
        "A couple days ago we took some sample jars down.",
        "We had filled them with fresh water at the surface just to get water in them before we took them down.",
        "We got down, and I looked in the jar and I thought, `That's weird.",
        "It's frozen,' but it's because it was fresh water and we took it down to the salt water, and it was colder.",
        "It's frozen in the jar.",
        "I thought, `Boy, it's really cold if it froze under here.'",
        "And you were swimming in that."

        "And the first five minutes are the worst, you kind of get an ice cream headache.",
        "Elizabeth and her diving companion, Katrin Iken, get on their wet suits...",
        "So we also attach everything that we take with us.",
        "To us, that's because of the mile and a half of water underneath us.",

        "Right.",

        "A lot of people became aware of this - the two men kind of drifting apart towards the end of President Bush's second term.",

        "That's an amazing list.",
        "It's a pretty striking list, right?",
        "So they come into these final days, and Cheney comes to Bush, basically saying, I - there's one thing, then, left that I'm asking for, and I've never asked for anything like this before; a pardon for Scooter Libby.",
        "Scooter Libby, of course, had been his chief of staff, convicted of perjury, obstruction of justice in the CIA leak case.",
        "And Cheney thought it was a bogus prosecution, that it was political.",

        "The president's reluctant.",
        "He doesn't want to do this.",
        "He had commmuted his sentence, but he didn't think that a pardon was necessarily justified; sends out the lawyers, asks them to relook at the case.",

        "And they came back to the president, and they said, we think the jury was justified in its verdict.",

        "Right.",
        "What's your takeaway now, with a bit more perspective on the Bush-Cheney years?",
        "Well, I think, you know, a second draft has the benefit of hindsight, has the benefit of a little distance.",
        "It's been five years.",
        "The reason to do a book like this is because as a journalist, you discover how little you know in the moment.",
        "And only after years later, when people are willing to sit down and be more candid and thoughtful, are they willing to share further understanding of what was really happening behind the scenes.",
        "But I think this, as a second draft, tries to put things in perspective.",
        "As one of the reviewers put it, neither accuses nor excuses but simply tries to bring the reader into the White House and understand what happened in these rather extraordinary and consequential years."
