        "I had actually written about tuberculosis before in the 1880s, in the upper Adirondacks.",
        "I was then interested in people staying in those cure cottages.",
        "But as I did the research for that, I started to see these large buildings tucked away from the villages in the woods, and to think about what it must have been like to be confined to one of those.",
        "And then I started to read a lot about immigrants in New York City in the early part of the 20th century who had been sent there.",
        "There really was no choice for most of those people.",
        "They didn't have the money to afford proper medical care.",
        "They really had to go if they were given the option.",
        "Then there is a situation where you have a large group of people bound together not because they like each other or necessarily have things in common, but simply because they're all caught in one place.",
        "And that, too, was always a really interesting situation for a novelist.",
        "The climate here is that the United States is on the cusp of and it enters World War I, and there is, sort of, vigilante...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...committee that springs up in the town, and there's a character who's involved in this league that springs up to sniff out saboteurs and spies in their midst.",
        "Yeah.",
        "He's based not on a real person but the group is real.",
        "There were many, many people like that just as America was about to enter the war.",
        "There were a number of incidents of industrial sabotage especially along the East Coast.",
        "There were ammunition plants that were blown up.",
        "Those were all blamed on German spies and saboteurs, and probably that was correct.",
        "But those incidence were in turn used to whip up a really savage, kind of, war hysteria and anti-immigrant hysteria.",
        "What I really was more interested in though was once he starts that motion, the passage of the other patients in the sanatorium who thinks that they are against him, who slowly become frightened enough to, if not, act against their fellow patient, to close their eyes to the actions taken against their fellow patient.",
        "I've read that you really started diving into the research of this book in New York City on September 10, 2001.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I had the good fortune to have a fellowship at the New York Public Library for that year.",
        "On September 11th I got up to - go to work and brought the dog to the dog sitters, and I heard a big noise and turned around, and that was the first plane hitting the first tower.",
        "And that inevitably changed the book, which then was just an idea in my head.",
        "It had been more of about tuberculosis purely before then.",
        "I had not thought I would bring the war into the book.",
        "But the atmosphere in New York that year became very dark very fast, and that was of great interest to me too to see how quickly, we, as a city and as a country, begin to search for someone to blame, how quickly we got involved in a war.",
        "Almost everyone got on board about the war for fear of being labeled unpatriotic.",
        "And that's a situation that was very similar to what was going on in World War I, and that was very horrifying to me.",
        "And my response is to simply hurl myself into the bellows of the library and into the newspapers from 1916 and 1917, and to look for those things that have been going on in the city than it what seem to be to be an analogous time."

        "So when you started digging back, what were the parallels that you'd found or were there points of which you felt this is a completely different time and there really is now analogy.",
        "I wish I felt an analogy.",
        "But for me, maybe because I was very sensitive right then, the analogy seemed overwhelming.",
        "There - in the months before America entered World War I, there were gigantic preparedness parades marching down Fifth Avenue carrying giant banners.",
        "There were training camps all over the country in the woods where bankers and lawyers and doctors would go off for two weeks and be trained by someone who once had been in the military for a short period of time.",
        "They would march around really carrying sticks as pretend rifles learning how to march.",
        "And there was an enormous amount of anti-German sentiment in particular, anti-immigrant sentiment more generally.",
        "The feeling that people were spying on Americans and they were sending special messages back overseas.",
        "That resonated with me quite strongly.",
        "Do you think of yourself as a political writer?",
        "I don't and I think most of my friends would be horrified to think that I would do something like this.",
        "I've always written about people who have very abstracted in a certain way.",
        "I write about scientists and artists and musicians.",
        "I write about people who live in their heads who are very obsessed about a certain set of details in the physical world.",
        "I think my work until this book has actually been notable for its lack of politics.",
        "So it's quite strange for me, too, to be writing something that was so caught up even at a distance of 90 years.",
        "With my current world, I'm still startled by it.",
        "Is it uncomfortable?",
        "Winning enough votes to past this historic constitution may be as difficult as writing it.",
        "Yes it is.",

        "I send money to this group and that group like everyone does.",
        "I write the occasional letter to the newspaper.",
        "But I have never really been engaged bodily, politically, and I seem to be at a point in my life or may be the country's at a point in its life where that's coming a lot closer to me.",
        "Andrea Barrett, thanks very much for coming in.",
        "Thank you.",
        "It's my pleasure.",

        "This Easter Sunday, a story about the bronze and gold doors of the baptistry of the Florence Cathedral.",
        "They are among the most beloved works of Renaissance art, famed for their castings of biblical scenes by sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti.",
        "After a major restoration, three of the door panels are about to leave Florence for the first time and will go on tour to the United States.",
        "NPR's Sylvia Poggioli has our report.",
        "(Speaking foreign language)",
        "Tourist guides of different nationalities jostle for position to ensure their groups get a good look at the baptistry's monumental entrance, with its 10 panels depicting Old Testament scenes.",
        "Ghiberti completed the gilded bronze doors in 1452, 27 years after he began them.",
        "They're considered an icon of Western art.",
        "The biographer of Renaissance artists, Giorgio Vasari, wrote that Michelangelo himself remarked: They're so beautiful.",
        "They would grace the entrance to paradise.",
        "And ever since, they've been known as the \"\"Gates of Paradise\"\" and Ghiberti a pioneer in the use of perspective.",
        "But many tourists don't know they're looking at replicas.",
        "Five hundred years of outdoor exposure left layers of dirt and damaged the golden surface.",
        "A quarter of a century ago, the original doors, each 16 feet high and weighing two tons, were brought to Florence's conservation and restoration center.",
        "Cristina Acidini, superintendent of Florence museums, says it took years to determine the nature of the damage and the best remedy - a bath of salt.",
        "It is amazing.",
        "At that point, you have that brilliance and that golden surface visible for the first time after so many centuries."

        "The restoration took almost as long as it took Ghiberti to complete the doors.",
        "Researchers also pioneered specially designed laser beams to clean difficult-to-reach areas of the intricate reliefs, from nearly in-the-round sculpture reaching outward from the panels to distant landscape barely etched on the surface.",
        "Anna Maria Giusti has headed the restoration team since 1996.",
        "In the lab where the panels are being packed for travel, she describes one that will be seen in the United States: the creation of Adam and Eve.",
        "(Italian spoken)",
        "She points out that there are four separate episodes in just one three-foot-square panel: on the left, God waking up Adam; in the center, Eve helped by angels, emerging from the sleeping Adam's rib; in the top left, the temptation, with a serpent circling a tree trunk; and finally, on the right, an archway and the archangel ordering the couple out of the garden with an imperious gesture.",
        "Giusti says Adam can just barely be seen lurking behind Eve, who's trying to cover her naked body.",
        "These are scenes, she says, of rich and intense narration and, Giusti adds, they demonstrate how Ghiberti's art is a watershed between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.",
        "(Through translator) He created a revolutionary style, both as storyteller and as sculptor.",
        "His space gained depth and became three-dimensional.",
        "There is so much to reflect on, and one is enchanted by the beauty, grace and exquisite nature of the figures.",
        "Ghiberti is a true heir of the elegance of the Ancient Greeks whom he dearly admired.",
        "Ghiberti was a goldsmith, sculptor, architect, and one of the first artists to write an autobiography, but he revealed little about his craftmanship.",
        "It was only through the restoration effort that it was learned that the massive doorframes were cast in a single piece, probably not in a furnace but standing vertically in a large hole dug in the ground.",
        "Scholars agree that Ghiberti had used the lost wax technique in which a wax model is placed inside a fire-resistant mold.",
        "Molten bronze is poured in and takes the place of the wax that melts from the heat.",
        "Giusti says Ghiberti was the first sculptor to make large bronze castings since the Ancient Romans.",
        "(Through translator) In Italy, this craft had been lost during the Middle Ages.",
        "Ghiberti was the first artist to revive it in a thousand years.",
        "We have no idea where he learned how.",
        "It's a mystery.",
        "The Gates of Paradise will ultimately be placed in a Florence museum, in a specially designed and hermetically sealed glass case.",
        "But before that, three panels will go on view in the High Museum in Atlanta, the Art Institute of Chicago and New York's Metropolitan."
