        "Janet lives in a small town in upstate New York, where there aren't too many health-care choices.",
        "So she did another thing that people can do: She asked a friend, who is a clinical social worker, for advice.",
        "Fortunately, I met - or I have a very good friend, and she had recommended a therapist that she had worked with.",
        "It was perfect.",
        "That therapist practices psychodynamic therapy, which has been shown to help with depression.",
        "As far as she's concerned, Ohlsen says that therapy has been a huge factor in her recovery.",

        "Anyone who watched that debate, I don't think there's any doubt that Congressman Ryan and I, Governor Romney and the president, we have a fundamentally different vision for America and, quite frankly, a fundamentally different value set.",
        "Biden delivered many of the attack lines last night that President Obama failed to in his debate, hammering at Mitt Romney's tax rate, which is lower than some middle class Americans, as well as Romney's 47 percent comment about people he said don't pay income tax and won't take responsibility for their own lives.",
        "Biden says many of those are working people, seniors or in the military.",
        "That's the 47 percent - the 47 percent this nation depends on to build this country.",
        "Folks, it's about time Governor Romney takes some responsibility - takes some responsibility to help the American people in the middle class.",
        "Politically, both the vice president and Congressman Ryan serve as ambassadors to the middle class for running mates who can sometimes seem distant from it.",
        "Ryan noted during the debate that he and Biden grew up in similar communities.",
        "But, the vice president says he doesn't recognize the country that the Republican candidates describe."

        "And there are other services which Google provides in China like Gmail and Google Maps, which has a Chinese version.",
        "Of course, that 30 percent market share is not that much, but it is a toehold and would represent, you know, future possibilities for Google.",
