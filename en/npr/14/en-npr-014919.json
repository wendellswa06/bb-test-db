        "We use a prophylaxis for treatment on prevention of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, as well as emergency contraception.",
        "However, in this case, because the fighting lasted so long and people were not able to respond and come to a health facility during the window of opportunity when you can use that treatment, most of the women did not actually receive the standard rape kit treatments that - is normally provided.",
        "However, basically since the case, we've been treating and providing medications for management of sexually transmitted infections.",
        "What about psychological counseling, Miel?",
        "Psychological counseling is both at the individual level as well as the community level because it's basically essential for the entire community to come together, particularly after an event of this kind and this scale.",
        "Because you have a specific number of survivors but you have a much larger - basically the entire community has been affected."
