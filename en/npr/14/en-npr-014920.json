        "They need daylight.",
        "So therefore when the days were shorter in winter and the sun wasn't as bright, perhaps early people saw a relationship between the egg and the seasons and the world and the universe.",
        "Can you leave us with a recipe for an egg dish that would work tomorrow morning for those of us who are celebrating Easter or Passover, or even just spring?",
        "One of the recipes that I think is a lot of fun and really simple for people to do is to bake an egg in a baked potato.",
        "And the recipe I have in The Good Egg is one for a russet potato that you simply bake in your usual way, and then you take it out of the oven when it's soft inside and make a slash in the center and push on the ends and take out some of that soft inside and mix it with a little bit of olive oil and a sprinkling of grated cheese, and maybe parmesan would be delicious, and then you push it back into the potato and make a little indentation.",
        "You break an egg into a cup and then very gently slip it into that indentation, put the potato with the egg.",
        "Of course it's in a baking dish.",
        "You put it back in the oven at a high temperature, about 400 degrees, at the same temperature you were using to roast your potato or bake your potato, and then you bake it until the egg is set to the desired doneness, usually about 10, 12 minutes is plenty.",
        "You could sprinkle a little cheese on the top.",
        "And I was thinking, as I'm telling you this recipe, that it would also work beautifully with sweet potatoes.",
        "That would be very delicious and very pretty.",

        "Eric Rudolph was back in court today, this time in Atlanta, where he apologized to the victims of the 1996 Olympics bombing.",
        "Rudolph received four life sentences plus 120 years for that attack and also for blasts at a women's clinic and a gay nightclub.",
        "Last month, Rudolph received two life sentences for bombing a clinic in Birmingham, Alabama.",
        "Rudolph confessed to the attacks as part of a deal to avoid the death penalty.",
        "From Atlanta, NPR's Kathy Lohr reports.",
        "The government said Eric Rudolph used violence to intimidate civilians and challenge the government, that he's a murderer and that he has earned a spot beside the likes of Ted Kaczynski and Timothy McVeigh with his cowardly acts of cruelty and destruction."

        "He targeted the largest peacetime event ever conducted in the United States, the 1996 Summer Olympic Games.",
        "After that, he set his sights on a clinic where abortions are performed, then on a gay nightclub.",
        "Rudolph wore a blue suit in court today, and he was much more subdued than at his sentencing hearing in Alabama when he winked at some in the courtroom.",

        "So I'm hoping that she's looking down smiling this day.",
        "Hawthorne described Rudolph as a small man whose twisted hatred extinguished a bright flame.",
        "Rudolph read almost verbatim from a statement he released last April, explaining he was targeting the ideals of what he called `global socialism' and saying that his purpose of the attack on Centennial Park was, quote, \"\"to confound, anger and embarrass the Washington government in the eyes of the world for its abominable sanctioning of abortion on demand.\"\" Rudolph apologized to the civilian victims of the Olympic bombing, but added no apology for victims of other bombings, including Lori Simmons(ph).",
        "The level of hate and anger and frustration--not just for myself, but for the families of those who lost their loved ones, for those who were injured, I feel for them.",
