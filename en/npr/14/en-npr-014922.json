        "From NPR News, this is All Things Considered.",
        "I'm Robert Siegel.",
        "And I'm Michele Norris.",
        "Now we're going to hear about one man who made a major bet this weekend.",
        "While lots of people were bailing out of investments, Kenneth Lewis doubled down.",
        "Lewis is the CEO of Bank of America which bought Merrill Lynch for 50 billion dollars.",
        "Some say he overpaid, but Lewis calls it the opportunity of a lifetime, as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports.",
        "As Ken Lewis himself said, it took almost no time to decide to buy Merrill Lynch.",
        "It didn't take but about two seconds to see the strategic implications, the positive implications.",
        "And so then it got to the harder parts.",
        "You know, the deal itself.",
        "In his seven-year tenure at the helm of Bank of America, Lewis made many big buys - FleetBoston, MBNA, LaSalle and Countrywide, to name a few - but none quite matched the risk, expense, and scope of Merrill Lynch.",
        "Merrill Lynch, after all, has 60,000 employees who work in areas where Bank of America isn't a big player: investment banking, securities, and wealth management.",
        "Lewis' predecessor was know as a spendthrift who bought dozens of companies.",
        "And for most of his four-decade career, Lewis was the cleanup guy who made those deals work.",
        "He focused on cost cutting in the bank's branches.",
        "He hired part-time tellers to keep lines shorter during lunchtime and on pay days.",
        "He invested in ATMs and other technologies that increased efficiency.",
        "In fact, during an interview with CNBC in June of last year, Lewis insisted he was still focused on businesses that dealt directly with retail consumers.",
        "He even said he wasn't interested in many of the companies he later ended up buying.",
        "Here he is dismissing the possibility of buying Countrywide.",
        "We've stated pretty specifically over and over, we just don't like the total business.",
        "Lewis, a native of Mississippi who was raised in Georgia by a single mother, grew up in a Southern bank, far removed from the downtown New York culture.",
        "And when asked in that same interview whether he'd consider buying a Morgan Stanley or Merrill Lynch, he said the different cultures would make such a deal difficult.",
        "Instead, he said, he would build an investment banking unit to compete with them.",
        "We will continue to build out our investment banking capabilities, and we're doing that.",
        "But the last year wrought enormous change.",
        "Once mighty investment banks that waded in too deep with risky mortgage-backed securities now need stronger partners.",
        "And Wharton Professor Michael Useem says Lewis simply changed his mind."

        "Ken Lewis obviously has a vision here, because we've seen it unfolding before our very eyes, of building a full-service financial institution.",
        "It's not without risk.",
        "First of all, there are critics who say Lewis could have gotten Merrill Lynch for far less if he'd just waited.",
        "And there's the challenge of integrating two very different companies in different business lines.",
        "But yesterday Lewis said he's long believed retail banks would eventually own investment banks.",
        "As we weighed everything, we said it is better to seize on this opportunity as we see it at the moment, as opposed to trying to catch the very bottom and possibly not catching it at all.",
        "And I have to try to return all my library books for a long time.",

        "We had it towed in to a dealer and had them look at it; this was a Honda dealer.",
        "And they looked at it and can't find anything wrong.",
        "And we've been in contact with national Honda company, and they're basically--can't find anything wrong or won't admit that there's anything wrong with it.",
        "And the problem we're having is that, you know, we're thinking about it and we're saying, `Gosh, you know, no matter what they say, we think that something's wrong with this vehicle.'",
        "And so the question that we've got is: What do we tell somebody--because we're not going to keep this vehicle.",
        "We're going to trade it in and get it out of our hands.",
        "But we're struggling with: What do we tell the dealership that we're going to trade it at about the vehicle's history, given that Honda says there's nothing wrong, but we really think there is something wrong with it?",
        "So you would actually go to a different dealership than the one you contacted already?",
        "Yeah.",

        "Have you gone to an independent mechanic for any second opinion?",
        "We had it looked at at the original Honda dealer that was looking at the body work, and then we actually decided to have it sent somewhere else to have the repairs done.",
        "And we asked them about it as well, and they kind of deferred to the original dealer.",
        "OK.",
        "Randy, now...",
        "Well, I sympathize 'cause sometimes when I'm at my mother's house, she suddenly accelerates rapidly backwards, and it's extremely disconcerting.",

        "You have to tell the truth.",
        "I hate saying it.",
        "I hate to be the bearer--it makes me--I'm sick about it, but you have to fully disclose what's wrong with the car.",
        "You know, if it were a house, in most jurisdictions, you would have a legal obligation to disclose any flaws, especially the ones that you can't immediately see, like, say, your basement flooded in the spring and someone was looking at it in the summer--that most states now require you by law to do that.",
        "And that's as it should be.",
        "If there's something wrong with your car, the buyer has a right to know.",
        "And that's especially true if you think what's wrong with the car would actually put the new owner in danger.",
        "That the dealership said there's nothing's wrong is neither here nor there; you believe that there might be something wrong with the car.",
        "So what you have to do is you have to disclose the full history of the car.",
        "You can tell them that the dealer said there was nothing wrong with it, but that you've--you have to tell them what happened and that you think there is something wrong with it.",
        "And, you know, the real solution, of course, is sell it to that dealer who thinks there's nothing wrong with it.",

        "If there is, indeed, something wrong with the car, it seems completely unjust that you should have to bear the burden of that loss, that you're a victim here, too.",
        "But you can't just pass that loss on to the next unsuspecting dupe that buys the car, the same way, Jennifer, that, you know, if a burglar steals your TV, you know, you can't come over to my house and steal my TV, although you could come over and watch me, but, you know, call first.",
        "John, have you talked to any dealerships yet?",
        "Yeah, we have, and it's interesting.",
        "It's one of those things where most of them, when we mention it, they kind of blow it off.",
        "I think they just think that we're crazy and we must have done it somehow and just can't admit to it.",
        "But it's one of those--and it's one of those hard things 'cause I can understand why they think that it must have just been driver error, but we don't believe that to be true.",
