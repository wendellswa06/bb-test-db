        "Speak to me a little bit about what's going on with the unions because I know that it's a really big sticking point, even though GM has said it is cutting tens of thousands of jobs this year and shutting many auto plants.",
        "What more can it ring from the unions?",
        "Well, we got a peek of what they could try to get from the unions in a deal that the United Auto Workers union made with Ford Motor Company.",
        "And at the heart of the deal was a restructuring of something called a VEBA, which is a big health-care fund that takes the burden away from Ford and puts it on the UAW shoulders essentially.",
        "Now, what Ford agreed to do - what the union agreed to accept was more Ford stock in lieu of cash.",
        "The problem with General Motors is if you agree to that, General Motors files for bankruptcy protection, essentially the value of common stock is wiped out.",
        "And so the UAW is likely to demand something in return from General Motors for getting this assistance.",
        "I remember last year - at the end of last year when the automakers were testifying and they said bankruptcy is just not acceptable because that would send a message to the public that they shouldn't buy the cars anymore because they couldn't rely on the automaker to service the cars or to be around.",
        "What do the automakers and GM - what do they say now about that?",
        "Well, they're still saying that bankruptcy is a terrible option and that cars sales would probably dry up.",
        "But, you know, car sales are drying up anyway because of the economy.",
        "We're having the lowest selling rate since the early 1980s, and I think last month, Ford Motor Company sales alone were down to 50 percent.",
        "So, this is almost like a preview of what would happen in bankruptcy, if people just say, I don't have the confidence in you to buy your cars.",
        "I think the bigger issue is that consumers can't get loans that they can afford or leases that they can't afford, so they're sitting on their hands.",
        "In a sort of perverse sense, this wouldn't be a bad time to file for bankruptcy because people aren't really buying a lot of vehicles anyway.",
