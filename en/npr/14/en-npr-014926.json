        "The score was two to one.",
        "Now that's fine, you might be saying.",
        "But what's the American angle on this?",
        "Well, here it is.",
        "Liverpool, one of Europe's premier teams, is owned by Americans.",

        "Hello, Stefan.",
        "Hey, Michele.",
        "Now two years ago, you and I talked about the first takeover of an English soccer team by an American.",
        "That was Malcolm Glazer's purchase of the storied team Manchester United.",
        "It seems like this has begun a trend.",
        "Yeah, Glazer was first, then you had Tom Hicks and George Gillett, two investors who own North American baseball and hockey teams, buying Liverpool who we mentioned just a few months ago; Randy Lerner, who owns the Cleveland Browns bought Aston Villa; and now you've got billionaire Stan Kroenke who owns teams in the NFL, the NBA and Major League Soccer last month increasing a stake in Arsenal to 12 percent, and he could attempt a full takeover, then you've got several other Americans who are in the market for teams.",
        "Now Stefan, you work for the Wall Street Journal, so I don't need to tell you that the exchange rate between the dollar and the pound is pretty awful right now.",
        "So what's prompting Americans to buy all these English soccer teams?",
        "Well, we stopped at the airport, and the next thing we know, we were told that we were being charged for our flights home.",
        "Somebody at the American Embassy said it was probably not going to happen, but next thing I know, they had taken all of our Chinese currency (unintelligible) and at the same time taken our credit cards, and they began swiping our credit cards and charging us for the flights."

        "So what about all the stuff that you brought, all the video equipment.",
        "Yes and no. FEMA officials were saying that they're obviously coordinating all their efforts in terms of power outages with both states, governors and private power companies.",
        "The latest in - as far as Sandy was concerned was that according to FEMA, the system is now over central Pennsylvania.",
        "The coastal impact is much less now than it was last night.",
        "Strong winds, though, are still hurting the New England coastline.",
        "There are 18 to 20-foot seas in that area.",
        "Strong winds throughout the impacted area, especially now as far west as Lake Michigan, are really creating treacherous conditions.",
        "The snow in West Virginia could reach two to three feet, which again is making some areas impassable.",
        "Flooding is still a huge concern in the next few days, and, of course, New York and New Jersey are still inaccessible.",
        "The Coast Guard there is monitoring the coastal conditions, especially.",
        "There were tons of questions that reporters had for FEMA, especially about the capabilities to restore power.",
        "But there was also a question about how many people were left homeless.",
        "And FEMA made the point that it's a very inaccurate count at this point, and that just watching the people who are in shelters is not necessarily a good way to count the number of homeless, because no one really knows how many homes are really, really damaged.",
        "Public health concerns was also the topic.",
        "Those concerns are wide-ranging, including conditions in hospitals.",
        "The Centers for Disease Control has apparently mobilized to help move people into safer areas if those hospitals are near or close to being flooded.",
        "Health care systems, apparently, according to FEMA, are coming back online.",
        "FEMA is warning the public, though, to stay home, because more people get injured when they come out and get hurt during the recovery efforts.",
        "As far as the flooding, that is the greatest concern in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.",
        "But again, many other areas are still vulnerable according to FEMA, especially in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, and in a wide, huge area.",
        "The number of employees that FEMA has deployed initially was 1,500, but that's gone way up.",
        "Nobody's really sure about the numbers at this point.",
        "And then there was some discussion about President Obama's conversation with the governors.",
        "Mr. Obama acted, according to FEMA, on the declaration of emergency conditions based exclusively on what the governors have told him.",
        "And the overall death toll, according to FEMA, it's again somewhat vague, but the latest is that there have been 30 deaths, although those have not been verified.",
        "And finally, a final question, Neal, on the National Flood Insurance Program, how many had it and what the costs are estimated to be, FEMA was only able to say that it has a borrowing authority of $17 billion, but that number might go up.",
        "And it has obviously the authority to borrow more."

        "And there's always confusion between was it wind damage, was it...",
        "Exactly, that gets into such a gray area.",
        "There was at least one question about whether FEMA was prepared to deal with what has historically been a problem with fraud, and FEMA directors said that, you know, they are better now at doing that and verifying the identity of people claiming damage, and so forth.",
        "And so they feel they're better prepared.",
        "And, of course, flooding, there's going to be less coastal flooding because the storm has moved on.",
        "And now the rain dumping into streams and rivers in places like central Pennsylvania, upstate New York, the flooding concern is going to be shifting north and west, as well.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And as you look at the questions, were there concerns about beach erosion?",
        "Obviously, this is a major factor along the East Coast.",
        "Beach erosion did not come up specifically, but I think that the Coast Guard was - made the point that they were monitoring the damage along those areas, even though some of them are essentially looking for, you know, life-threatening conditions still and maybe even people who have not been - or who have been reported missing.",
        "But clearly, the damage along those beaches is extensive, and who knows when they're going to know what the restoration's going to entail.",

        "When you have power going down left and right, it's not hard for you to start losing Internet access, as well.",
        "Sometimes you have the cell phone networks going down, and ultimately, what's often left standing is either text messaging or ham radios.",

        "Old-school technology, but, you know, when everything else is coming down and crashing, they seem to stand up pretty well.",
