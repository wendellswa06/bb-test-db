        "Not really in the mountains.",
        "This is - it's a little unusual to have eight inches of snow at this time of year, but not unusual to have a snow.",
        "And how is your community reacting?",
        "What decisions are you having to make?",
        "Well, the only decision I made, because we're kind of used to this, is bring in more firewood last night.",
        "We always stock up with extra water and food, but I brought in some more firewood.",
        "But we didn't need it.",
        "The power never went out.",

        "The more you follow instructions, the easier it is for our first responders to make sure that they are dealing with true emergency situations.",

        "Our thoughts and prayers go out to all the families who've lost loved ones.",
        "Unfortunately, there have been fatalities as a consequence of Hurricane Sandy, and it's not clear that we've counted up all the fatalities at this point.",
        "And, obviously, this is something that is heartbreaking for the entire nation.",
        "And we certainly feel profoundly for all the families whose lives have been upended and are going to be going through some very tough times over the next several days, and perhaps several weeks and months.",
        "The most important message I have for them is that America's with you.",

        "Were it not for the outstanding work that they and their teams have already done and will continue to do in the affected regions, we could have seen more deaths and more property damage.",
        "So they have done extraordinary work, working around the clock.",
        "The coordination between the state, local and federal governments has been outstanding.",
        "Obviously, we're now moving into the recovery phase in a lot of the most severely affected areas.",
        "New Jersey, New York in particular have been pounded by this storm.",
        "Connecticut has taken a big hit.",
        "Because of some of the work that had been done ahead of time, we've been able to get over 1,000 FEMA officials in place, pre-positioned.",
        "We've been able to get supplies, food, medicine, water, emergency generators to ensure that hospitals and law enforcement offices are able to stay up and running as they are out there responding.",
        "We are going to continue to push as hard as we can to make sure that power is up throughout the region.",
        "And, obviously, this is mostly a local responsibility, and the private utilities are going to have to lean forward, but we are doing everything we can to provide them additional resources so that we can expedite getting power up and running in many of these communities.",
        "There are places like Newark, New Jersey, for example, where you've got 80, 90 percent of the people without power.",
        "We can't have a situation where that lasts for days on end.",

        "And part of what we're trying to do here is also to see where are some resources that can be brought to bear that maybe traditionally are not used in these kind of disaster situations.",
        "For example, there may be military assets that allow us to help move equipment to ensure that pumping and getting the flooding out of New York subway systems can proceed more quickly.",
        "There may be resources that we can bring to bear to help some of the private utilities get their personnel and their equipment in place more swiftly so that we can get power up and running as soon as possible.",
        "So my message to the governors and the mayors, and, through them, to the communities that have been hit so hard is that we are going to do everything we can to get resources to you and make sure that any unmet need that is identified, we are responding to it as quickly as possible.",
        "And I told the mayors and the governors if they're getting no for an answer somewhere in the federal government, they can call me personally at the White House.",
        "Now, obviously, you know, the state, local, federal response is important, but what we do as a community, what we do as neighbors and as fellow citizens is equally important.",
        "So a couple of things that I want the public to know they can do.",
        "First of all, because, you know, our local law enforcement, our first responders are being swamped, to the extent that everybody can be out there looking out for their neighbors, especially older folks, I think that's really important.",
        "You know, if you've got a neighbor nearby, you're not sure how they're handling a power outage, flooding, et cetera, go over, visit them, knock on their door, make sure that they're doing okay.",
        "That can make a big difference.",
        "The public can be the eyes and ears in terms of identifying unmet needs.",
        "Second thing, the reason we're here is because the Red Cross knows what it's doing when it comes to emergency response.",
        "And so for people all across the country who have not been affected, now's the time to show the kind of generosity that, you know, makes America the greatest nation on Earth.",
        "And a good place to express that generosity is by contributing to the Red Cross.",
        "Obviously, you can go on their website.",
        "The Red Cross knows what they're doing.",
        "They're in close contact with federal, state and local officials.",
        "They will make sure that we get the resources to those families as swiftly as possible.",
        "And again, I want to thank everybody here who is doing such a great job when it comes to the disaster response.",
        "The final message I'd just say is, you know, during the darkness of the storm, I think we also saw what's brightest in America.",
        "I mean, I think all of us obviously have been shocked by the force of Mother Nature as we watch it on television.",
        "At the same time, we've also seen nurses at NYU Hospital carrying fragile newborns to safety.",
