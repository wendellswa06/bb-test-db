        "Yeah.",

        "It's - you know, there are a lot of workers who have to hustle to put together those reports on consumer confidence, on the labor situation.",
        "And with offices being closed for two days - and a lot of people being without power.",
        "I mean, one thing is you could think, well, they could work from home, but you can't really work from home if your lights are out.",
        "So there are - government reports that are very important, and we've had this delay now in people's ability to do their work.",
        "We've had a delay in trading.",
        "Stocks haven't traded since last Friday.",
        "So, you know, it'll be kind of interesting to see how the rest of the week goes.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Well, the thing is that's interesting about that is, you know, that's a great example of the kind of redundancies and opportunities we have to keep working - that is, you can often work from home, but only if you have a generator, and then your generator only works if you have the gasoline.",
        "So we do have lots of ways to keep the economy going, but it's not always smooth.",
        "And that's where the economic friction comes in.",

        "So there are going to be costs associated with all of this.",
        "The estimates right now are something in the range of 30 to $50 billion in losses.",

        "And that's just - that's lost inventory.",
        "You can never get it back.",
