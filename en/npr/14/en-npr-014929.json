        "Yeah, Ocean City, Maryland, actually.",
        "And thanks for taking my call.",
        "And my best wishes and prayers to those north of me who were not so lucky.",
        "And were you among those one to make a decision about evacuation?",
        "Yeah, I think that a decision that we always make, and depending on the front that's coming in - we actually live on the waterfront behind Ocean City, Maryland, and there was an advisory for us to evacuate if we're down in the waterfront property.",
        "But we instead chose to stay and try to protect our property (unintelligible).",
        "Our real threat was the rising water from the creek due to the winds from the northeast, forcing water up in the creeks into that place.",
        "And did it turn out to be a wise decision?",
        "It turned out to be a wise decision.",
        "Actually, we found out I think (unintelligible) a few of my friends that did not lose power, which is unusual.",
        "We almost always lose power when nobody else does.",
        "We had one other decision.",
        "In the midst of it was a mother (unintelligible) facility about seven miles away from us that was being evacuated, and we had to make the decision that she really shouldn't come to us.",
        "She should go to a shelter where she could get medical care.",
        "Nobody would be in danger trying to get to her.",
        "So you've actually survived OK, though?",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I'm now on the road actually.",
        "(Unintelligible) of Hurricane Sandy right now that's coming from the south.",
        "I'm heading south into the eastern shore of Virginia to check on some property down here that may very well had been more at risk than my property on the coast.",
        "We've had a lot of flooding on the western - actually, the eastern shore of the Chesapeake, the western shore of Delmarva.",
        "When the winds came around to the northwest and west from Sandy, it actually protected my house in Ocean City and forced the water back down.",
        "But unfortunately for others, like those in Crisfield, Maryland, and Stafford, Virginia, they experienced probably the worst flooding they've ever had.",
        "And I'm going to check on our property now, which unfortunately had similar characteristics to those areas.",
        "Well, good luck, Chuck.",
        "Thanks very much for the phone call.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks, Neal."

        "And, Amanda Ripley, that decision whether or not to evacuate, we kept hearing, for example, from Mayor Bloomberg, about people making that decision.",
        "He said we can't put first responders at risk.",
        "If you don't get out now, somebody is going to have to go in and get you.",
        "And inevitably, a significant percentage of people decide to stay.",
        "Right.",
        "And it's a hard - that's an important point to make, and I'm glad he made it.",
        "On the other hand, the people - the reason they're not evacuating is because they think they're going to be fine.",
        "And they have reasons for thinking that.",
        "And so they don't think a first responder is going to have to save them, right?",
        "And so it's important I think to - and some politicians are getting better at this, to address why they think it's going to be fine, you know, to talk explicitly about Hurricane Irene and what's different, for example, to talk explicitly about the fact that the most at risk are the elderly.",
        "The elderly that are the least likely to evacuate before every kind of risk, really even nuclear, they don't want to leave.",
        "And you understand, right?",
        "I mean, so it's important to speak directly to them, just to make it clear that that's the biggest risk, and to tail our communications of warnings to them.",
        "There are places that have gone to great lengths to try to make this point more emotionally salient by going door to door and delivering toe tags, for example, to people who haven't evacuated and trying to really bring it home to people.",
        "And sometimes that works.",
        "And I wanted to ask you also that we're talking about people making decisions as individuals or small groups.",
        "As they get into bigger groups, dynamics change.",
        "Yes.",
        "And actually we know that before most hurricanes.",
        "If people are told - once they're told to evacuate, they check with four to five different sources of information, on average.",
        "So it is a group effort in every case, but they can be larger or smaller groups for sure.",
        "And I wonder, as you see our response to this storm, no different because it was New York City, no different because it was in Ocracoke in - along with the outer banks of North Carolina, or as we just heard, on the Delmarva Peninsula in Delaware, it's one place after another.",
        "It's interesting when you have big storms like this hit media centers, you know, the place where reporters live, you do tend to get much more emotionally salient coverage of the event, of course.",
        "And so there was, I think, a level of build-up around this event that you wouldn't have seen if it were happening in, you know, the Gulf Coast even.",
        "Amanda Ripley, thank you very much for your time today.",
        "Thank you."

        "And then about five men and women both pulled her down and sort of pulleyed her down each of the eight floors that we were...",
