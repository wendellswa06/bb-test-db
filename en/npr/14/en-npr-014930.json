        "We are about 350 miles inland, but we're still getting some pretty heavy rains and some snow and just making everything all sloppy and dirty here.",
        "And we've had the power flicker and go and off.",
        "But just like a pretty severe storm that happened back in June, once the hysteria wore off and everyone decided that, hey, we're stuck in this for a little while and it's going to be a little bit before everything gets back on, neighbors started helping each other out.",
        "People who did have generators were inviting others over to spend the night, while my wife and I personally went and spent the night with our pastor for a couple of nights because he had a generator at his house, and there was plenty of food to go around.",

        "And I believe that just along the East Coast, as long as everyone just keeps the faith in the country that has provided for us for a long time, as long as we just trust those who are experienced in these kinds of situations, we'll definitely be able to get through everything together.",
        "Kyle, thanks very much for the call and for that expression of faith.",

        "Yeah.",

        "It's like, would it be canceled?",

        "I don't know.",
        "Well, as we've mentioned just a few minutes ago, the organizers, the Road Runners Club of New York, has said they plan to go ahead with the marathon as scheduled and don't think that the aftermath of the storm is going to take effect.",
        "But obviously, people like you have to make decisions about whether to arrive from places like Asheville and even more remote places.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, you know, that's good news for me, and I hope people - this is the largest sporting event in the world.",

        "Tom Grant is now back in New York, where he spoke with me earlier today about his ordeal.",
        "We were told to disrobe, put on red shorts, red shirts, going through metal detectors several times and then brought up to a second floor, you know, with two other people that were detained, actually James Powderly and Jeffrey Rae, the two people I was apprehended with to begin with, brought down this long corridor."

        "At that point, I mostly just knew code names, and that's all I gave them.",
