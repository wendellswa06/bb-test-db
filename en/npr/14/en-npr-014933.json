        "A lot to cover here - let's start with Paul Manafort, Donald Trump's former campaign chairman.",
        "Remind us what he has been found guilty of doing and what kind of punishment he could be looking at here.",
        "Well, he could be looking at up to 24 years.",
        "He was convicted on bank fraud, tax fraud - all this had to do with his political work for very important people in Ukraine.",
        "His attorneys argue that he should get a lighter sentence because he is a first-time offender and because his case had nothing to do with the alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian interference and Russians in the 2016 election.",
        "Which is important to remind people - I mean, it did come from Manafort's work pre-Trump election days.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, as we mentioned, I mean, that's all happening as Michael Cohen, President Trump's very close former lawyer/fixer back on the Hill, bringing in a suitcase, presumably full of documents.",
        "Do we know what he told the Intelligence Committee behind closed doors?",
        "We don't know exactly what he told them.",
        "The Democrats on the committee seem pretty happy with what he said.",
        "We know that he said that he was going to bring documents, edited statements, that he says were edited by White House lawyers that are going - that would prove that the lawyers and the president encouraged him to lie to Congress about how long the negotiations between the Trump Organization and Russians took place over how to build Trump Tower Moscow, something that never got built.",
        "Which would be significant if he actually shows that - I mean, he's acknowledged lying himself - but if he tied that lie to people in the White House with documents.",
        "Right.",
        "That would be significant.",
        "Now, Republicans and the White House have dismissed Cohen.",
        "They've said he has no credibility, he lied to Congress once so he's lying again now.",
        "We should even emphasize - Cohen, in addition to his own credibility problems, has not testified that the president explicitly told him, go to Congress, and lie.",
        "He said that the president suggested that by the way that he spoke.",
        "So documents would seem to be essential to back up that claim at all.",
        "Right.",
        "He said that's not how the president operates.",
        "He operates in code.",
        "He says things like, I never negotiated with Russia to build a Trump Tower, did I?",
        "You know, things like that."

        "There's no doubt that's still a risk for them.",
        "They want to hear a lot more about Trump Tower Moscow.",
        "They are calling before them a guy named Felix Sater, one of Trump's business associates who's been linked to the Russian mob and has served time in prison.",
