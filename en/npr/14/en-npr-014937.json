        "I loved running for - not necessarily for the physical aspect or anything like that.",
        "It was more of a sense of freedom.",
        "You know, imagine, you know, you're halfway across - you're 20 miles across town and your car breaks down and, you know, you have that thing in the back of your mind; like, that's OK.",
        "I'll just grab a bottle of water and run home.",
        "You know, and that's a little extreme, but that's the sense of freedom that - I enjoyed running so much because I could tell you, honestly, I ran more than I drove, and it was at least seven or eight miles to work.",
        "And what do you do now to replace that?",
        "Oh, anything, really.",
        "Anything can replace it.",
        "It's an act of - for me, it's just an act of mental conditioning.",
        "You know, I - there's other things - the idea behind the philosophy of it is to attack the insecurities in your mind, at least that was for me.",
        "Now that I'm more or less confined to a wheelchair, I've taken up - because I grew up in the martial arts community.",
        "I've gone back, and I've started training again.",
        "Moreover, I've begun to teach, and we're - I've been working with a local studio.",
        "I'm working with developing a serious self-defense program for guys in wheelchairs.",
        "So that would very much replace that, and that sense of freedom of not being limited to what you think, or what other people think you're capable of doing.",
        "I mean, it's a number of things.",
        "My right hand, for example, is damaged, and I have limited or, you know, relatively limited dexterity.",
        "So teaching my hand to do fine motor skills; for example, I'm big into firearms for, you know, obvious reasons.",

        "And there's another expression that some people use when people come home from Iraq or Afghanistan: You're all heroes.",
        "I wonder, Greg, have you heard that?",

        "America also doesn't realize that the 3-5 is a very elite unit, and you don't just get drawn out of a hat to go in that unit; you're selected because you are an exceptional Marine."
