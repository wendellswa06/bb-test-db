        "We put John on hold, and we'll get him that information.",
        "He did mention, Jake Romo, the 3rd of the 5th, an elite unit.",
        "People who saw the miniseries on HBO, \"\"The Pacific,\"\" that was the 3rd of the 5th.",
        "This is one of the most famous units in a famous outfit, the Marines Corps.",
        "That's right, and they saw service in World War I, at Belleau Wood, and some of the other tough fights in Vietnam, as well And the caller raised a really interesting point.",
        "Now remember, these guys, many of them are in their early to mid-20s.",
        "And they have a certain sense of responsibility, and they've seen things that most of us double their age have never seen.",
        "And I think that's what's really remarkable here, a maturity level.",
        "And some of these guys not only are fighting for their country, but they're doing things like running villages or towns in Afghanistan and Iraq.",
        "There's a gunnery sergeant that's in charge of education programs in this huge district of Afghanistan.",
        "So the responsibility not only, you know, facing enemy fire but just what they're doing day-in and day-out over there, for their age, is really quite remarkable.",
        "Here's an email that we have from Dave(ph): The man who would have been my brother-in-law, Corporal Stephen McGowan(ph), drove over an IED and was killed on March 4, 2005.",
        "Despite the horror of what his comrades experienced recovering his body, many have re-enlisted and prolonged their careers.",
        "These men have so much faith in their mission and their country, it puts the rest of us to shame.",
        "We complain about traffic and day-to-day problems while these men spend multiday missions living out of their backpacks, sleeping in the sand.",
        "Let's go next to Angela(ph), Angela with us from Suffolk in Virginia.",
        "Hi, yes.",
        "I just wanted to say - well, actually this is a great show for me because my husband got home from Afghanistan a year ago today.",
        "And he spent most of last year - he's a Navy medical type with the Marines Corps in Helmand province.",
        "And, you know, what most people don't understand is, you know, the lack of communication for the family members.",
        "I mean, I never felt sorry for myself, but I never spoke to him for five months, either.",
        "And, you know, we have three kids.",
        "And it's very hard to - you sort of put your life on hold.",
        "It's not like, you know, they go away for a business trip, and they come back, or you could call them if things come up.",
        "There was a period of time I couldn't even email him.",
        "So that's what people - they just, you know, he - I would have to send him food.",
        "You know, the food was - you know, they had no mess hall.",
        "I mean, it was just different, and people don't understand that.",
        "Angela, we're glad your husband made it.",
        "And Tom, there's that dichotomy.",
        "A lot of the time, the troops in the Marines are able to speak with their families by Skype or email almost instantly, or Facebook.",
        "Yet, as Angela says, a lot of the time they're completely out of touch."

        "That's right.",
        "If you were in some sort of combat outpost, a small combat outpost, you have very little communication back home.",
        "The larger bases, like Bagram and Kandahar - I mean, it's almost like being at Andrews Air Force Base when you go to some of these places.",
        "There are plenty of computers and telephones and everything else, so you can communicate back home.",
        "Way out in the field, though, where we spent some time with the troops back in June and basically look like vacant lots, or they would take over a house or something, there's no way to get a message out from there.",
        "So sometimes it can be very difficult.",
        "Jake Romo, I was wondering if you could speak for a moment about the Navy corpsmen.",
        "They're the medics who work with the Marines.",
        "Do they still call them squids?",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "No, no, no. Squids is more or less a more derogatory term for, you know, Navy personnel who don't really – don't want anything to do with combat.",
        "So we - you know, the Marine Corps and the Navy have a little bit of a rivalry; we always have.",
        "No, no. The corpsmen we very affectionately refer to as doc, unless they just don't deserve it - but they usually do.",
        "They're right up there at the front with us.",
        "And we - they command a huge respect because most of the time when we're all shooting back, you know, what the - any reasonable person would do when fired upon, they are ignoring fire and looking for casualties and, you know, exposing themselves to take care of, take care of our wounded.",
        "So they command a huge respect.",
        "There's - I can't think of any, you know - they're definitely way up there at the top with anyone I would serve with.",

        "Well, he's still in the Navy, 20 years, and he's at a hospital in Portsmouth, the naval hospital in Portsmouth.",
