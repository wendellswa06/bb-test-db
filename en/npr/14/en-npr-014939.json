        "And you say for the same amount of money spent on buying cans for a food drive, donors can feed 20 times more families by providing cash as opposed to cans.",
        "That's absolutely right.",
        "One of the things that we have available to us now in the United States, is actually a surplus of food.",
        "That surplus, when it gets donated to food banks, can then be made available to local pantries and soup kitchens around the country.",
        "And because these are either donated food or food that is purchased by the network of food banks at wholesale prices, the same $10 that you would spend to, say, get three cans of food, could actually buy retail value 20 times more food.",
        "And that can be the difference between just providing enough for lunch for a couple of people to actually feeding a family of four for a week.",
        "And I wonder, you say half the food that is donated in those donation boxes is wasted, is never used?",
        "I mean, some studies show that up to half of that winds up not being used.",
        "But actually the bigger bang for buck, is not from the food that's not being used that goes into food drives.",
        "I mean, there are places where some of that food is quite helpful.",
        "The bigger bang for buck comes from taking advantage of all of the food that would be wasted, but that could actually go to feed families across the country when regional food banks are able to purchase it from this national network.",
        "No, I understand what you're saying about efficiencies and economics of scale.",
        "But if somebody gives a can at Thanksgiving and it's not used this Thanksgiving, it's going to be good - perfectly good on Christmas and probably good next Thanksgiving too.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think the question is, given the current economic environment and the growing number of families who are unable to feed themselves, how can donors make sure that as many families as possible don't go hungry this Thanksgiving?",
        "I understand the argument, as well.",
        "But there is something about the spirit of Thanksgiving, which is sharing food.",
        "It's a different psychology of here's a can of food as opposed to here's a check.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I think that's something that too often people think the difference is between personal engagement and communities really coming together in the spirit of giving, or a very cold efficient writing of a check.",
        "And it doesn't have to be that tradeoff.",
        "There are some wonderful examples of communities that provided financial contributions to feed more hungry people in their communities, but, at the same time, used some of the traditions that we think of around food drive to really bring that spirit of giving personally and together for families and communities.",
        "It doesn't have to be a tradeoff between the two.",
        "Well, such as?",
        "Give us an example, if you would.",
        "So here's one great story.",
        "There was a church where one of their most valued traditions was a time during the offertory where children would come with their donated cans of food and bring it up.",
        "And it was quite heartwarming.",
        "People would see the youngest people in their community making a difference in addressing hunger."

        "What they wound up doing, though, instead, is they took the cans of food that they may have used for dinner the night before.",
        "And instead of bringing a full can of food, they actually put a check in each of those cans.",
        "So you wind up still having that same heartwarming scene, but even better, you wound up actually feeding 20 times more people.",
        "And that's - those are some of the really creative ways that people are still honoring their traditions, coming together as a community, and knowing with confidence that they're providing more people food than they ever have before.",

        "If I give money, the more money that comes in, the greater chance for, you know, administrative fees and then eat and pay, and a lot of that gets watered down.",
        "And I know a lot of that is not going to get there anyway.",
        "So I feel better about giving food knowing that it's probably only going to be used as food for the intended purpose, for the intended people.",
        "And there have been, sadly, too many examples of, well, a lot of charities that have very high administrative costs and, indeed, corruption.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And that's a concern, I think, not just with nonprofits that provide emergency food but it's a concern that a lot of donors have with any nonprofit.",
        "The good news is that with emergency food providers, you actually can deposit funds directly into an account that can only be used for purchasing food.",
        "Most of the regional food banks have these kinds of food accounts with the national Feeding America Network.",
        "Some of them actually have local restricted funds where you give directly into that fund, and it can only be used for purchasing food from the - this national network of food providers that I described.",
        "Dominic, if you were aware of such a system, would you feel more confident.",
        "I suppose.",
        "But I don't see how that will be any different from giving food in the first place, although it would make me more comfortable with it.",
        "All right.",

        "Sometimes it has to do with health issues or it's just inappropriate to the family.",
        "If you have very young children, they are able to eat different things than older people.",
        "You're talking about often very poor families whose health could be compromised, which prevents them from eating certain foods.",
