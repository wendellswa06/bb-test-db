        "But neither she nor Keliher believe the publisher of \"\"The Testaments\"\" will hold Amazon accountable.",
        "So in theory, they could decide not to ship additional copies of \"\"The Testaments\"\" to Amazon's warehouses as a consequence of this violation of the embargo date.",

        "Well, there's a lot of studies being done about that, and the Pew Research folks have done a great deal of work on that.",

        "I mean, how does all this fit in looking at the larger economic picture?",
