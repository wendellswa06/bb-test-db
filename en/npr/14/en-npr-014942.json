        "If somebody recently asked me why I'm out there and I don't think that, you know, the work that I do everybody else can do it, and nor do I think that's a bad thing.",

        "So yes, we've seen - there really are lots of middle-class people who feel like they've come down a notch or two.",
        "But there's also a lot of young people who have found opportunities in the new economy, and they're starting to move up.",
        "So we have some fluidity here.",
        "I think we'll need to get further away from this Great Recession to really see how much of it was temporary, you just lost your job, maybe you need to go back to night school, and how much of it is a structural change that has really, really hurt the middle class.",

        "And your most recent study, this did reveal some good news, right?",
        "Sure, I think as Marilyn said, there are different ways that we look at economic mobility.",
        "On the one hand, we can look at absolute change in income or wealth over time.",
        "And by that metric, we absolutely see this glass half full.",
        "Over the last generation, the economy has grown a lot, and Americans at all rungs of the income ladder have felt that growth.",
        "So we see that overall, more than 80 percent of Americans today have higher family incomes than their parents did, and that's tremendous.",
        "But when we look at this other metric, which is where they fall in the economic distribution as a whole, what their rank is, we see a lot of stickiness at the ends.",
        "So even though someone has started at the bottom may have significantly more money than their parents did, they're still stuck at the bottom in a relative sense.",
        "They haven't been able to get out of, say, the bottom 20 percent.",
        "And that stickiness is really what challenges our notions of the American dream and calls into question whether we truly do have equality of opportunity.",
        "And Marilyn was referring earlier to the fact that education is so important.",
        "What do you see in terms of that bottom level, where it's really hard to move up?",
        "If a person is able to get a good education, does that guarantee that they're going to move upwards?",
        "There's not a guarantee, but it definitely increases the chances.",
        "Research that we've done looking at the benefits of a post-secondary education and specifically having a four-year degree show that for someone who starts in the bottom, whose parents were in that bottom fifth of the income distribution, them having a post-secondary degree increases their chances of making it all the way to the top by about three times.",
        "All right, let's take a call now.",

        "Hi, go ahead.",
        "Yes, I'm just calling about the situation with the baby boomers staying in the workforce longer.",
        "I personally have experienced some upward mobility issues in my workplace based on, you know, people not stepping out of positions and creating chances to move up.",
        "And I'm kind of wondering if that's something a lot of people are experiencing or if that's more of just kind of my experience with the workforce.",
        "Is that part of this issue that we're talking about of economic and social mobility, or is that a different kind of economic issue?",
        "Well, really, as I said, there are some different ways of looking at things, that is the relative position, where you have economic mobility over generations.",
        "But there's also individual economic mobility, that is you start out as a college student, and you want to move up, and you get a promotion, and you get a transfer, and eventually you end up with a nice office and a good income.",
        "And that sort of individualized mobility is very important to people, as this caller is saying.",
        "So I think that that's almost a different set of studies about how fast can you rise in this economy, and, you know, it's complicated because you can see individuals like Mark Zuckerberg, you know, the guy that founded Facebook, went straight from his dorm to, like, billionaire overnight.",
        "So there are a lot of people who on an individual level, if you're creative and hardworking, and you're sometimes just plain old lucky, you can still jump a lot as an individual.",
        "But when you look at it sort of as a generational issue, where there are lot of younger people today who would like to move up, but there are a lot of baby boomers who may be sort of blocking those positions.",
        "There are a whole lot of Americans that are in their 50s right now, and, you know, that's actually - they're a good thing or a bad thing for employers because those baby boomers have a lot of experience in the workplace, but as they hit their 60s and 70s and clear out, it will give a lot more room for people like this younger man here to move up with individual mobility.",
        "I'm curious, Eric, do you feel like you're sort of sliding down the ladder?",

        "And that's not particularly - those kinds of individual cases are not overly - that's not a big concern of public policy, shall we say.",
        "That's an individual choice, should I move here or there, or how do I get ahead of all these baby boomers.",
        "But what we're more concerned with in terms of public policy is this idea of big groups of people having relative mobility.",

        "Well, I just wanted to point to a couple of examples.",
        "You know, when you look at the Supreme Court, I really think that the case of Justice Sotomayor, who recently has this book out, talks about how she went from being a Puerto Rican girl in the South Bronx living in, you know, pretty dire circumstances, her father was an alcoholic, he dies when she's a - she ends up at Yale Law School, and she's on the Supreme Court.",
