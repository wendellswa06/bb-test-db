        "Because that is certainly sort of deep in our blood, I think, that we think that's the case.",
        "I think that it's sort of true and not true in that OK, it's definitely great if you have wealthy parents, but usually what that suggests is that you also have access to really great education.",
        "I mean, if you come out with a degree from an Ivy League college, and your parents are well-connected, your chances of doing well in life are probably pretty good.",
        "But most of those people who graduate from a good college don't just sit with their feet up on the desk.",
        "They pretty much get to work, too.",
        "They may be a top-notch surgeon, or maybe they work on Wall Street or whatever, but mostly people in this country who make pretty good incomes really do work, and you can move yourself up from lower levels to higher levels through hard work if your hard work involves not just backbreaking work - I mean there are people who work very, very hard physically - but unless you're getting that education, I don't know how we can stress that enough.",
        "If you're hard work is directed towards getting a really good degree, and you can start out at a community college, move up to a state college, flip that into a graduate degree and eventually get to be a doctor or whatever, if you can stay on that education ladder, you can move up.",
        "I've got to stop you a second because I think that we also once had a very strong middle class that was made up of working-class people who may not have had an education or may have had, you know, skills that don't require a higher education.",
        "And not everybody, not everybody is that kind of a person, Erin.",
        "I mean, just how do you address that?",
        "Well, it has been the goal of our project to really deconstruct what's happening with economic mobility and to understand not only what people's chances are for movement up and down the economic ladder but also what factors really drive that mobility.",
        "We absolutely know that education at all levels is critical, but we also know that other things matter, too, and they're all interrelated, and sometimes they're difficult to separate out.",
        "What is it about the neighborhood that's driving that mobility?",
        "Certainly it could have something to do with the education systems.",
        "It could have something to do with the labor markets in that neighborhood.",
        "It could have something to do with access to green space, access to grocery stores, right?",
        "It's difficult to know all of those mechanisms.",
        "But clearly the neighborhood poverty and the education are related.",
        "Similarly, we know that savings and assets matter a great deal and that for people to be able to take advantage of educational opportunities, for example, they may need access to student loans or other assets that their family has in order to make those inroads up.",
        "All these things are interacting with each other all the time, and they're all important and critical for mobility.",
        "Complex, it's a complex picture."

        "So that's a pretty high percentage, but that still means that a little less than 60 percent make it up out of the bottom.",
        "They don't necessarily make it far.",

        "And allow me to say that you don't have to have a college degree, but you have to have a high level of skill.",
        "So maybe you're a skilled machinist or a skilled plumber or other kinds of things.",
        "But you can't just think you'll show up on a factory floor, push a wheelbarrow somehow and make money.",

        "You know, I wasn't living with my parents anymore.",

        "This is something we refer to as social capital.",
        "It's this idea that the networks and the people that you're connected to can be really helpful in getting you that leg up, in helping you maneuver through education, but also potentially getting you an internship or getting you that summer job or giving you good advice when you need it.",
        "Those things are difficult to track quantitatively, but we know that they matter and that they influence mobility.",
        "You know, I have the impression - this is totally just, you know, an impression, and I'm wondering if there's anything you've studied that would - you know, if there's any studies of it that have been done of this, which is that the people that - I mean, the people who make it out of the bottom seem to be - seems to me they have to be exceptional people.",

        "And another thing that we have noticed a lot with our research is that more often than not, we need two earners in a household, instead of just one, in order to achieve upward mobility.",
        "So, more and more, we're seeing that mobility is a family enterprise, that that matters.",

        "And two educated earners?",
        "Education always helps.",

        "Yes.",

        "So public libraries, schools, Pell Grants for poor students, affordable student loans, all of those kinds of things, job training programs to help people improve their skills.",
        "A lot of these things right now look a little endangered, but I want to just add a note of optimism that something that is maybe getting a little bit better is more access to free education from online learning.",
        "There are a lot of courses that you can actually sort of sit in - go to a public library, sit in front of a computer and take some classes where you can start to learn and move up, improve your own education, just through your own efforts.",
        "So one can only hope that some of those kinds of online learning experiences will help democratize education and give some more people an opportunity, but, of course, they need to have access to a public computer so that they can actually sit there and spend their time learning.",

        "Well, I'm sure Erin could confirm this, as well, but the thing about having education is that you tend to not fall lower.",
