        "We get an update now from NPR's Wade Goodwyn about what is involved in preparing to take care of all those children.",
        "And Wade joins us now.",
        "Welcome back to Day to Day, Wade.",
        "Oh, it's my pleasure.",
        "Well, these children, they have had almost no knowledge of what life is like outside this compound they've been living in.",
        "This must be an extraordinary task.",
        "Well, the buses started rolling out again this morning.",
        "You know, there's still I think 300 children left in San Angelo, and they're being shipped to foster-care facilities around the state, all over Texas.",
        "And imagine, for a moment, imagine this from the foster-care provider's point of view.",
        "Let's say you run, for example, a Methodist facility near one of Texas' larger cities.",
        "You've got six bedrooms, you've got 25 beds, and most of the children you get have been taken from their hopelessly addicted mothers and fathers, it got so bad the state just had to say that's it.",
        "But now, you're about to get 14 children from the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.",
        "They're all siblings, they've never watched TV, they've never played a video game, never been on the internet, don't dance, never been to a public school.",
        "They wear pioneer outfits.",
        "They have iPods filled with lectures from their prophet, Warren Jeffs.",
        "And you get a - just a sense of how different this group is going to be, and the challenge you've got on your hands as a foster-care provider.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "You know you, mentioned Michael Steele, and there were other speeches in addition to Steele's last night.",
        "We heard from Mitt Romney, from Rudy Giuliani, Mike Huckabee, all of whom were former GOP presidential hopefuls.",
        "They went on the offensive, of course, against Obama.",
        "Talk a little bit about their appearances and what struck you and what struck the audience.",
        "Well you have a series of strong speakers.",
        "You know, Michael Steel was strong.",
        "Huckabee was strong on the social conservative issues.",
        "Mitt Romney - and actually Huckabee was also strong on economic issues, basically saying, in essence, that he grew up kind of on the lower-income side, and what he wanted to do was make sure that he could make money as a capitalist and not someone who relied on government.",
        "So that's a strong theme that he struck.",
        "But Mayor Rudy Giuliani really drove a lot of points home, and his was kind of an attack speech on Senator Obama, but also raised the question, what is it that America deserves to give a woman.",
        "And he said, how dare they question - now, they, the media, they, Democrats - if Governor Palin has enough time to be with her children, when did they ever ask a man that question?",
        "We're going to talk about that more later in the show, but I think the fact that Rudy Giuliani is bringing up the feminist/mother issue is fascinating.",
        "Let me give you a sports analogy.",
        "I know that you're not a big sports fan, but follow me on this, because it's baseball season.",
        "And in baseball, you normally have the first three batters come up to the plate to try to set it up for the fourth batter, who is known as the clean-up hitter.",
        "So last night you ended up having Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani, Mike Huckabee, ostensibly in the set-up position for Sarah Palin, coming in to, you know, knock it out of the park.",
        "Do you think that she did that?",
        "Again, I think it depends on who you are.",
        "One thing that I found interesting was that some Democrats or liberals said, oh my goodness, this is the first time that the McCain candidacy looks viable.",
        "That alone is a sign that people are taking her seriously.",
        "They may have been upset about it, you know, that she came off perhaps better than people thought, but I also think part of it is what former President Bush - not the sitting President Bush - called the tyranny of low expectations.",
        "After her family issues, a lot of people didn't know if Governor Palin could really bring it home, and she definitely did for the party."

        "You know, one of the things that was said about the speech, there were - some had low expectations, some perhaps had higher expectations.",
        "One question was whether or not she would have a hand, or to what extent she, Sarah Palin, would have a hand in the preparation of her own speech.",
        "And I read somewhere, I don't know if this is true or not, that the speech was intended to be 17 minutes but ended up being like 37 minutes or so.",
        "Do you know what happened?",
        "Well there's definitely the hand of the speechwriter, and also, we as journalists generally, right as a speech is starting, get notes of a transcription, but she definitely went off at certain points.",
        "Like the hockey mom/pit bull/lipstick thing was an ad lib that wasn't in the speech.",
        "So in general, the speakers have speech writers, as you well know when you've been covering, and whether or not they ad lib extends the time and changes the tone.",
        "I guess the other question is whether or not this is going to put pressure, if that's the right word, on the nominee himself to come out and deliver a speech that is probably not going to be as energizing as hers was - let's face it, John McCain is not the same level of speaker, but it puts pressure on him to deliver, doesn't it?",
        "The question I have is whether or not he can tell his own story.",
        "Not because he can't, but because so many people, almost everyone who came up, has already told the John McCain story.",

        "Do you get a sense that the inclusion of the family was - what sense did you get about the family, in terms of how they were shown and how they were made reference to in her remarks?",
        "They were really a subtext in her remarks.",
        "At the end, as with the Democratic convention, the presidential nominee, in this case McCain, sort of came out and did a cameo.",
        "And basically all he said was, you know, hey, wasn't she great and doesn't she have a great family.",

        "One thing that I think is interesting is that very few members of Congress - I'm not sure about the governors - have sons or daughters who are deployed in Iraq.",

        "Remember, this all came about because someone purporting to be a 16-year-old young woman called authorities three weeks ago, and said that there's sexual abuse going on here.",
        "Why haven't they been able to verify that if they've been on the ranch, on the compound, for three weeks?",

        "We're three weeks out, I mean this is a very big case.",

        "I can't say that for certain, but I think with the evidence they've got in the children, just the children, that puts many of the men, or at least some of the men, inside the ranch at jeopardy for charges of conspiracy to rape.",

        "And so they're all - every child that is 17 and under, is at risk - is a victim and all those people who had sex with that child are at risk for charges.",

        "That individual said they have 20 instances, 20 instances of individuals, young women underage girls, he said, who indeed have had these experiences.",

        "That doesn't even include the 17-year-olds.",

        "First of all, according to the intelligence officials I've spoken to, they are convinced there is no other explanation for this facility other than that it was a nuclear reactor.",

        "That would require a lot of additional facilities.",
