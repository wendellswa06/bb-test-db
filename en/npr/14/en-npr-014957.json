        "Hi, Neal.",
        "A little bit less logistical, versus that last caller, and a little more philosophical.",
        "On the question where occupiers go from here, I would put myself more in a Tea Party camp than I would in an Occupier camp, very conservative fiscally.",
        "But I think that there is some common ground.",
        "And there's a nerve that strikes, at least me, that's common with some of the Occupy movement.",
        "And that is that wealth has been consolidated and is being protected.",
        "And it's being the losses, as we've heard of – the refrain that the losses have been socialized, but the profits has been privatized.",
        "And I'm a real estate investor/syndicator, commercial real estate in Tulsa.",
        "And so I go out and I find real estate deals, and I put together pools of investors to essentially buy commercial property.",
        "And as the markets were set to correct, I kind of started licking my chops and began to realize that, because of policies that were put in place through D.C., that institutionals -banks, (unintelligible) et cetera were protecting our interest.",
        "And the resetting of bases, financial bases, that should have occurred in commercial real estate, didn't.",
        "And maybe there's a couple of points that you could talk about here, some observations of mine.",
        "Because that resetting is not happening, because it's being propped up...",
        "What you're essentially saying, it's still very difficult to borrow money.",
        "Well, it's - I'm actually talking less about borrowing money.",
        "I'm talking more about lowering bases.",
        "And so what I mean by that is the next generation - I'm 34.",
        "These younger folks, they're waiting for an opportunity to get into the game, into the economy.",
        "And because across the spectrum, from real estate to other industries, you see this very high barriers to entry where only the larger players can play and they protect the walls.",
        "They build the walls.",
        "When there's an event, like we had in '08, where things should have reset, and instead, props were brought in and (unintelligible)...",
        "Exactly.",
        "So those companies should all have been allowed to fail in '08, including the car companies.",
        "And here's the discussion.",
        "This is where the next generation, my generation and below, has to, I think, come face to face with this reality.",
        "If we want that resetting to happen, there's going to be carnage, and it's going to be difficult.",
        "But in my mind, history shows that that's where the opportunities come from.",
        "And an earlier conversation on Diane Rehm - there's a great comment from a panelist saying that the older generation protects their wealth.",
        "The younger generation has a harder and harder time to break in.",
        "I think it has to reset.",
        "In my opinion, it will be hard, but that's what we're made of.",
        "And I think that the - to get our trajectory back in the direction it needs to go, don't erode capitalism.",
        "Let it work in a true, free sense.",
        "All right, Ryan.",
        "Thanks for..."

        "(Unintelligible) the bases reset.",
        "Let's give somebody else a chance, but thank you very much for the call.",
        "This is from The Washington Post, Jennifer Rubin, who writes: OWS should not be rehabilitated.",
        "I wonder if the protesters' unbridled contempt for public order and wealth creation is really a desirable model for the left's discourse on income inequality.",
        "Frankly, if the left wants to appeal to middle-class Americans, it would be wise to repudiate a grab bag of sleazy characters who are disrupting the lives of working people and adding to the financial burden of cash-strapped cities.",
        "Now is no time to celebrate their \"\"contribution,\"\" quote, unquote, to American political dialogue.",

        "Hi there.",
        "That's an interesting to follow up on.",
        "Living in Berkeley, I have been to some of the demonstrations, and one of the things that I'm quite aware of is how much the movement has occupied the media dialogue and very quickly and very effectively.",
        "I feel like one of the things I've observed is that the very process of this organization is an important product.",
        "That it's based on small, decentralized groups working together that refuse to be categorized specifically.",
        "The fact that we are coming together to talk about topics that need to change, an inequity that needs to be settled.",
        "And that it's amorphous I feel like is a healthy thing, that these are not clearly delineated subject to say here's the problem, here's the solution.",
        "We're not there.",
        "Things are quite complex.",
        "And it's appealing to me that a decentralized process is stepping up to say we need to reclaim democracy itself.",
        "We need to reclaim that process.",
        "We need to take care of people.",
        "We need to speak for people who are hurting.",
        "The other piece of it that I've observed is that the homeless people I see are suffering even more than the homeless people I was seeing on the streets 10 years ago, five years ago.",
        "I just feel like the people who are hurt the worst are in even worse shape, and that the safety net has fallen apart to the degree that it's OK to say something has to be done.",
        "I don't know exactly what, but to bring that up and say this needs to be what we demand that our government discusses.",
        "So I'm appreciating that aspect.",
        "No, I understand that, Cory, and I think, particularly at the beginning when that message resonated, I think, the movement was far more effective in communicating a message.",
        "The last few weeks, the message seems to have been complicated by numbers of incidents of violence and gassings and friction with the police, indeed, a couple of unfortunate deaths and violence within the communities.",
        "Right.",
        "And there's important connections to bring up there.",
        "I think it really raises questions about the police role.",
        "Who are they protecting and serving?",
        "Why aren't they more integrated in with the demonstrations?",
        "Like, you know, San Francisco has had a very calm approach and has been very integrated with the protesters, in a way, to make it more effective for the whole city.",
        "And then you had situations like Oakland where the police - long history of friction there, and I understand that.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And then in Berkeley, there was a man who just died.",
        "And I'm appreciating, at this moment, that that doesn't have to become something that's directly connected to the Occupy movement because it's not necessary.",
        "It may not have had anything to do with the protesters.",
        "It remains to be seen, and I appreciate that we're not jumping to conclusions here.",
        "In Oakland, it's very entrenched and, you know, the mayor may lose her job over it.",
        "There's a lot of civic issues about how do we occupy space and who is considered the general public and who is not.",
        "And I feel like that's very much part of the debate here."

        "There was one lone protester holding an Occupy sign, standing in front of the police vehicle.",
        "And you can't let not having a tent somewhere in a park bend a movement that has been so resonating for my generation, for my children, for my parents.",
