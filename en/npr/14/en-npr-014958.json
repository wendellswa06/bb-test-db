        "Cohen is expected to be the first of what could be many high-profile hearings on Capitol Hill this year, as House Democrats and their new majority intend to have fairly aggressive oversight and investigations into questions of how this administration has conducted itself.",

        "We showed an increase in that population of 3.3 percent from 2004 to 2005.",
        "Now, if you want to break down that increase--which is about 1.3 million--about 800,000 of that 1.3 million was due to natural increase, which was just due to births minus deaths, and the remaining 500,000 was due to immigration.",
        "When you talk about minorities or populations of color, we're talking both about race and ethnicity, isn't that correct, because the census doesn't count Hispanic or Latino as a race.",
        "It's an ethnicity.",
        "Are Latinos or Hispanics expected to also put down a race, and what numbers are you getting on that?",
        "Yes, that's right.",

        "The median age for that population was 40.3.",

        "Yes.",
