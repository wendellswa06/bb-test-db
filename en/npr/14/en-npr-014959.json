        "In this case, the gravity of the testimony - it was very clear that this was another nail in his coffin, perhaps the most - the final nail in his coffin.",

        "This is - I don't know if I can come back from this.",
        "I mean, so obviously, El Chapo's responsible for a lot of the drug trade here in the U.S.",
