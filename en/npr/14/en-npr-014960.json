        "All right, so let me start with you, Mr. Frey.",
        "What's most striking to you about this report?",
        "Well, I think the most striking thing is that one out of every two new Americans each year is Hispanic.",
        "I think this is a huge marker for us, because it means that our future will be involved with Hispanics having a large segment of our population.",
        "And Mr. Suro, did you see this coming?",
        "You're here at the Pew Hispanic Center.",
        "Yes, because we've been seeing the share of growth of Hispanics increasing pretty steadily over the years, and it's been very close to that mark.",
        "And it's a combination of very high fertility and ongoing immigration, paired with relatively low net fertility.",
        "There are a lot of white babies being born, but there are a lot of white people who are dying, too.",
        "So the net natural increase is lower, and then lower rates of immigration for people who are not Hispanic.",
        "So you put those two things together--slow growth on one side and fast growth on the other--and a small share of the population is accounting for a big chunk of the growth.",
        "Yet compared to some other nations, some European nations and Japan, white Americans are actually very fertile.",
        "So it's just a matter of degrees, I suppose?",
        "That's right.",
        "Mr.",
        "Frey, what else should we be looking at besides the Hispanic or Latino community?",
        "What other numbers kind of leapt out at you?",
        "Well, an important part of the results here show that the younger part of our population is becoming much more diverse than the older part of the population.",
        "Two statistics - the median age for whites in the United States is now slightly over 40.",
        "The median age for Hispanics in the United States is 27.",
        "That's a 13 year difference just in the median age, and I think that tells us a lot about the nature of our older population versus our younger population.",
        "What potential challenges or problems could this present?",
        "You know, I think it means that in lots of communities, we already have majority/minority child populations--young people populating the school systems, often speaking a different language, Spanish or some Asian language--needing more resources, needing more services.",
        "We have an older population which has been in charge for a long time, and they're not as ready for this, I guess you could say.",
        "And in an area of budget tightening and fiscal issues, where we're trying to save our money, I think that accommodation needs to be made between the older and the younger population in order to understand that these people are America's future.",
        "We need to treat them right with respect to their education, their social services.",
        "So this kind of cultural generation gap, I think, needs to be bridged."

        "Mr.",
        "Suro, what about a generation gap within the Latino community?",
        "You have many different ethnicities of Latinos.",
        "You have many different generations, all the way from people whose families have been here for many different generations, to people who came here as immigrations and naturalized, kids who are both citizens and non-citizens.",
        "What kind of bridge building needs to take place within the Latino community in order to, for example, be more effective as a voting block?",
        "The very interesting dynamic in the Hispanic community is that over--or the Hispanic population is that really over the last 20, 25 years--in terms of current public policy--our focus has been all on immigration, and that has been the largest source of growth to this population.",
        "But in the last few years, the number of births has actually been larger than the number of immigrants coming in.",
        "And now, in these estimates, natural increase--the number of births over deaths--accounts for 60 percent of the growth in the Hispanic population.",
        "So while our attention has been on immigration, we are now moving into a different phase, where the big dynamic in the Hispanic population is this very large number of young people who are born here--are native born Americans, who are going to be products of U.S.",
        "schools, products of U.S.",
        "culture, and the big new demographic force on the scene.",
        "There was a lot of talk that, you know, by the year 2050, America would be majority minority.",
        "I don't know if that is going to be the magic date or not.",
        "But what will happen in this country?",
        "What will change in this country when what is already happened among young people, this demographic shift where so many of the young people of color happens to the nation at large?",
        "First Mr. Frey, then Mr. Suro.",
        "You know, I think we're going to become a more tolerant country.",
        "I certainly hope that we will.",
        "I mean, we have young people dating folks of other races, having friendship groups of other races, and the young people in the U.S.",
        "are not just Hispanics.",
        "There are large numbers of African-Americans, large numbers of Asians that are part of this younger group.",
        "As they grow up with this multicultural environment, we hope that they'll bring those attitudes into the labor force, into politics, and we won't have this kind of contentious back and forth that we sometimes see that rears its head even in this immigration debate that we're having.",
        "Mr. Suro?",
        "Gonzales-Gutierrez is a mother of three and worked in child welfare and juvenile justice.",
        "She says after that phone call, she spent about a year weighing her options.",
        "The more she learned, the more she thought she could make a real difference.",
        "But ultimately, she says she did it for her kids.",
        "I would tell people, you know, I'm thinking about running.",
        "And they would say, well, don't you have small children - as if to discourage me.",
        "That made me want to fight more.",
        "You know, underscoring what Bill just said, it's important when you look out to the future, that we're talking about a very different kind of population change than what we're used to.",
        "We're not talking about a sudden change, you know, new people moving into the neighborhood or a sudden wave of immigrants.",
        "We're talking about a change that's going to take place very gradually over many years so that young people today will grow up in that world.",
        "They'll be in schools where--if you look at the population under five years old now, whites are 55 percent of that population.",
        "So already, kids entering kindergarten now are going to be going to school from the first day with a population that's very mixed.",
        "And so, it'll be a different kind of change.",
        "It won't be sort of a shock to the system.",
        "People in 2050 will look around and won't say this all of a sudden happened.",
        "It will have been something that they were aware of from the time they were very young.",
        "And so I think it will produce very different sorts of results than when you get a sudden change."
