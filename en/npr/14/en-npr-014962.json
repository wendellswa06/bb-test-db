        "He was sometimes brutally honest and he kept saying I should try to be honest in the book.",
        "Except he wanted the cover for himself.",
        "Oh, he hated - when he saw the cover that we put in the catalog, he just hated it.",

        "He was right.",
        "It was one of those gimmicky kind of - it had him and an apple or something and it was in one of those catalogs about eight, nine months ago.",
        "And he called me up.",
        "I hadn't really felt the brunt of his fury, but I remember landing at San Francisco because I was going to go see him and he told me to just turn around, that the cover was so ugly.",
        "He used words other than ugly, but they had the same number of letters, that, you know, it showed that we had no taste, so after hearing him rant for maybe 10 minutes or so, he said the only way I'll cooperate is if you let me have some input into the cover.",
        "So I paused and I thought for maybe one, one and a half seconds and said, you know, this is the best designer of products in our time.",
        "I said...",

        "So Ravi Coltrane, is this why the album is called \"\"Both Directions At Once\"\"?",
        "Well, for us and for why that phrase seemed to make a very relevant title for this album is because of the period that the record was recorded at.",
        "1963, as Christian did point out - it's a very fertile period for John Coltrane and this band.",
        "But it's also a - kind of a midpoint between his earlier musical life which did consist of playing lots of blueses (ph), slow blueses (laughter) and bebop tunes to where he would eventually end up, you know, in his musical explorations - you know, much freer music.",
        "So for John Coltrane in 1963 - does feel like he has one foot in the past and one foot in the future, you know?",
