        "Thanks, Jen.",
        "You know, it reminds me of a Richard Feynman statement about looking at a flower.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And he says, you know, as an artist looks at a flower, you see the colors and, you know, the shape, but I know what's working inside the flower and I see more beauty than you do because I know the details.",
        "One day, when they have flat screens and they're trying to make the new iMac using a flat screen, Jony Ive, the world's greatest industrial designer, is working with Steve at Apple and he comes up with something in which there's the computer attached to the back of the flat screen.",
        "And Steve says he hates it, probably in the same words he used to tell me he hated the original cover of the book.",
        "And he says it doesn't have integrity.",
        "It's not true to the flat screen nature, which is supposed to float and feel free.",
        "So he just goes home - Jobs does - and sits in his backyard and then Jony comes over to see him and there's a profusion of sunflowers in the backyard and as they look at the sunflower, they figure out - oh, that's what computers will look like.",
        "They'll have that wonderful curved neck and that will be something that will hold the screen so it floats and feels as if it were at your disposal.",
        "And the curved neck of that new iMac, which you've seen, the Sunflower iMac...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...Steve Jobs has a patent, a design patent on it, in his own name from sitting in the backyard thinking that up.",

        "One of the things I've wondered about, and I've heard him quoted as saying this - why are his products made overseas?",
        "I would think that the only legacy - the only way he could have had a legacy better than the icon that he is now is to have created all these jobs for his products, jobs in this country.",
        "He used to talk about - I can't get a factory built here.",
        "It takes 40,000 steps to get a factory built here.",
        "I can do it all overseas.",
        "Did he ever talk about any of that?",
        "And it's true.",
        "Totally.",
        "He talked about it all the time, and he talked about it to President Obama.",
        "He had a couple of meetings with Obama, a dinner with Obama.",
        "Obama came to the Westin Hotel in San Francisco to see him, and that's what Steve talked about, which is two things.",
        "If you want to build a factory in China, you can do it in six months and in the first three months you can start moving people in as the, you know, the top floors are being built.",
        "Now, that's probably not the way we want to do it in the United States.",
        "On the other hand, you go to the other extreme.",
        "You want to build a factory in California, you know, you have six months just filling out the forms for the regulations and the environmental reviews or whatever it may be.",
        "I believe in all of those things, but I believe there's some happy medium so you can build a factory.",
        "Secondly, he said our country does not turn out enough trained engineers anymore to support factory workers.",
        "There are about 700,000 factory workers at Foxconn, which is the Chinese companies and Taiwanese-owned companies that build a lot of Apple products.",
        "To support 700,000 engineers, 700,000 factory workers, you need about 30,000 engineers.",
        "That's the ratio.",
        "We're not talking about engineers, you know, who went to Cal Tech, MIT or Harvard necessarily.",
        "We're talking about people like my dad, who went to LSU or Tulane or a community college and got great industrial engineering degrees and could help work and build things in this country.",
        "We no longer create the number of engineers, and if we train an engineer from another country, as soon as they get their engineering degree, instead of stapling a green card to their visa, we kick them out of the country.",
        "And he said, I'm not going to be able to build factories unless there are enough engineers and our school systems stink.",
        "He actually used a stronger word, but - yeah."

        "So he was aware that that was a shortcoming and that's something we should be working on and speaking to the president about it.",
        "The fact that your VCR has a remote control that is totally complicated and unconnected to the remote control with your TV that's hooked up to a cable box, all totally - you should be able to do what you do with your iPad: pull it out of a box, you know, boot it up, and it'll do what you want.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "He was very aware, very worried about the state of education in America.",
        "I think he would have been - look, when he built the original Mac, he built a beautiful state-of-the-art factory in Fremont, California.",
        "He made the walls totally painted white.",
        "He wanted it to be a showcase.",

        "I don't think Steve was ever driven by pure profits.",
        "He was driven by making insanely great products, and those aren't the same thing.",
        "Everything you do, he says, if your goal is to make a great product, is different than if your goal is to make a profit - the people you promote, the people you hire, the way you do things, the way you build the inside of the machine.",
        "I think that, obviously, with any company, they'd be insane not to try to figure out how to make a profit.",
        "On the other hand, I think he would have been happy to have factories in the United States if you could build great products.",
