        "We wanted to retool manufacturing, especially the car industry, the year they almost went bankrupt, why couldn't Steve been assigned to build to build an iCar, and come up with an idea like that?",
        "You know, he talked to me about that.",
        "He said, you know, if I really had another career and another life, I'd love to build a car.",

        "You don't have to go buy the software somewhere and the engine somewhere and the headlights somewhere and the chassis somewhere.",
        "It's all built together in an integrated fashion, and that's what Steve Jobs liked to do with his computers, unlike, say, Dell or Microsoft, where somebody makes the hardware, somebody makes the software.",
        "And at the end, I asked him: This end-to-end integration of product, who else does it well?",
        "I mean, who - I was seeing if there's any other technology company.",
        "He said no technology companies.",
        "The companies that do it well are the car companies.",
        "And then, he paused, and he said: Or, at least they used to.",
        "So he always told me if he had had another career, he would have loved to build the greatest car.",

        "Life should be simple.",
        "And it was Michelangelo who said it: Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.",
