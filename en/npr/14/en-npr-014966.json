        "Well, you know, when you get six or seven versions of a story, you always try to say exactly what was the truth, and I always aimed for the honesty.",
        "I think if you look at the book, he would feel, you would feel that I tried to be very honest, including about the fact that he was not the most nurturing, sweetest of all bosses.",
        "And I hear where you're coming from.",
        "I do think there are lots of tales in the book in which I try to be very honest, but I do try to show that he does, by doing it, inspire most people - obviously, not everybody - but most people into being part of a loyal team that tends not to leave him.",
        "And as far as workers in China being mistreated or that kind of criticism that was leveled against his company?",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, I can't sort of elevate him to sainthood there.",
        "He did not sit there as much and worry about the outsourcing to Foxconn, but they did.",
        "Apple, as a company, spent a lot of time trying to make sure conditions at Foxconn and in China were improved.",
        "And I think Steve spent a lot of time thinking about: How could we get more jobs back to America?",
        "And so you think his legacy is intact?",
        "I think his legacy will always be a mixed one of somebody who had a very artistic temperament - which could make him difficult to deal with - but as a result created awesomely, insanely, great, beautiful, emotionally connective products.",
        "But even more importantly, I think his legacy will be the creation of Apple.",
        "When I asked him: What's your best creation?",
        "I thought he'd say the iPad.",
        "He said Apple Computer, because it is a place - which we don't realize, you can't just do startups and products.",

        "Jony Ive is the best industrial designer of our era.",
        "Tim Cook is one of the best - probably the best manager, corporate manager of our era.",

        "But what it is essentially, in layman's terms, it's a gunshot detection hardware and software system.",
        "And what that means is if someone pulls a trigger in an open area where this technology has been deployed, this technology, which is made up of cue-stick mikes that are placed in strategic locations throughout a city, could actually pinpoint the location of that gunshot and actually even give a little bit more detail than that.",
        "It can actually give whether or not the gunshot was - taken while in movement, which direction the gunshot actually came from, and the speed of travel.",
        "So they could actually tell if someone was physically standing and shooting, or even if someone was doing a drive-by shooting.",
        "Well, you know, Newark, New Jersey, has installed a similar system called Community Eye.",
        "And one thing that comes to mind is this whole stop-snitching movement.",
        "And will this technology give police a way to track crime even if people don't want to testify?",

        "What do you think about that?",
        "That's a great question.",
        "I mean, we are living in a time when - you brought up stop snitching, famous for starting in Baltimore, a DVD was created about it, and it's actually being studied in universities across the country.",
        "And essentially, what it is, is witness intimidation.",

        "So maybe this type of technology doesn't even involve a concerned citizen because, like I mentioned, it can triangulate the sound of that type of activity.",
        "And in some cases, Farai, it's starting to show that it may even be better than the human ear.",
        "In other words, if a concerned citizen hears a gunshot in their neighborhood and they make a phone call, how well can they really say where that gunshot came from?",
        "And so you just don't - or how many shots actually took place.",
        "Did you hear an echo or what - was it two shots or really was it five shots?",
        "So this technology has proven to be, at least, very - it's much smarter than the average citizen could ever be because it can really pinpoint whether or not there's echoes, whether or not just false alarms.",
        "And maybe remove this whole idea of having to - I hope it doesn't remove the idea of calling the police in the first place.",

        "Some New York City taxi drivers are on strike this week and one of their beefs is that the city wants them to install Global Positioning Systems, or GPS, for passengers.",
        "Now, a lot of new cars have these, you know, pre-installed GPS.",
        "You can buy them to slot on in your car for anywhere from 300 to $10,000.",
        "And the whole idea is that if you get in a cab with GPS and somebody says, do you want to take the Triborough Bridge?",
        "You can like punch up a few things and say, well, actually the Triborough is bracked(ph) up so let's take such and so and so.",
        "But I don't know if that's going to work.",
        "And how well are these GPS systems working in general for people?",
        "Okay.",
        "So in general, for the average everyday consumer, GPS really works very well.",
        "The technology has really matured.",
        "And, as you mentioned, you're starting to see it pre-installed in cars.",
        "You're also starting to see more handheld portable devices that are coming under the $300-price tag, which is making it much more accessible and affordable to people.",
        "And you're starting to see people really benefit from the use of GPS, which in its basic terms is an ability to look at a screen that gives you a map or a satellite view, if you wish, of where you currently are and where you intend to go.",
        "You could have multiple destinations or reroute you around traffic.",
        "The other thing that really is popular about GPS is what's called point of interest.",
        "And these are things that maybe of interest to you along a path, maybe ATM machines or hospitals or parks or universities or restaurants.",
        "So they've become more than just get me to point A, to point B, something I can already do with maybe MapQuest or Google Maps, but it actually allows me as I'm driving or as I'm moving to change and alter my schedule and tell me how that may affect my arrival times and destinations.",
        "Now, does it account - do most of these devices account for weather conditions, traffic conditions, all these other things that actually really make how fast you get to some place really critical?",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I think that's part of why the New York City cab drivers, the association out there, has decided to do this two-day strike because, I think, part of them feels like, hey, wait a minute, this is just too much scrutiny on us.",

        "A big concern for many of these soldiers is finding work.",
        "Before they came home, the Guard asked members of the 182nd how many were unemployed or looking for work.",
        "The answer: about one in three.",

        "You know, what's important to note about USERRA is that it doesn't only protect the employment right, meaning the return to employment, but by law employers are not allowed to, for example, deny someone a deserved promotion as a consequence of being called to active duty or let military service be a factor in determining someone's salary increase or things like that.",

        "To be honest, our larger companies are in a much better position to absorb some of that burden, if you will.",
        "But if you think about a small to medium-sized company of 50 to 100 employees, if that Guard or Reserve member, for example, happens to be a key supervisor or a highly skilled technician, many of the small or medium-sized companies are not in the position where they have the resources to backfill that lost employee.",
