        "You're not going to find an employer who is going to say \"\"I am not going to hire a veteran.\"\" That is illegal.",
        "At the same time, you will hear employers talk about not necessarily targeting vets in their recruitment efforts because they're concerned what it might mean for their organization to bring someone into their workforce that may be lost to them for a year or more if they're called to active duty.",

        "That's more than three-quarters of a million Guard and Reserve members who've now returned to civilian life.",
        "So, if you look at those numbers, you would anticipate that the number of complaints, just by the duration and the numbers mobilized would go up.",
        "And Torrans says there's still a major disconnect between the military and the civilian population - between employers and their employees returning from war."
