        "The bill changes the legal definition of marriage to a civil contract between two people instead of between a man and a woman.",
        "The bill's sponsor, Mark Leno, says the change is not intended to have religious implications.",
        "Our bill specifically states that no minister, priest, rabbi or any religious institution which does not recognize nor wish to solemnize these marriages would be required to do so.",
        "I'm not quite sure what you mean by that, but it was the inspiration for the work.",
        "It was really the photograph - it was really the image that made me think that a project like this would be a great thing to do.",
        "I was in the middle of, you know, a pretty nasty year there, and I had - my children were a little frustrated with me not being around as much as I should have been, and I took them for a trip to Niagara Falls.",
        "And we stayed around our house in Upstate New York, and I was, you know, not in the best of moods, but they were skipping around, having a great time.",
        "And I saw them sort of wander over towards a point where they overlooked the falls.",
        "And they were standing there mesmerized - mesmerized.",
        "And I walked over to where they were, and I stood behind them, and I saw this extraordinary vista, this sort of sense of floating over the falls, not unlike a Frederic Church painting, from a bird's-eye point of view.",
        "I mean, you can walk up to this point.",
        "It's not like it's a difficult place to get to.",
        "And I took the picture, and it - again, this project was something that I had considered doing with Susan Sontag when she was still alive.",
        "And then after she died, it, of course, went away.",
        "And then I - of course, it would have been different places.",
        "But I sat down again and started thinking of places, and especially with the advent of the introduction of the new digital camera, I was discovering that digital rendered in a more realistic way and, you know, and you needed very little light.",
        "And so I was off.",
        "I was off.",
        "I made a crazy list, and, you know, just sort of went down a different path.",

        "Well, you know, I talked Doris into doing this because I was at a Norman Mailer gala, and Doris was, of course, very good friends with Norman Mailer.",
        "And she told us an extraordinary story about if you were a young writer and you could walk through, you know, Norman's house and see his books and see his desk and, you know, see how he lived and how he wrote, you know, how extraordinary.",

        "You can look at in a lot of different ways.",
        "But for me as an historian, nothing matters more than to be able to catapult oneself back into time, to the place where the person I'm writing about woke up in the morning and went to bed at night, you know, the paths they crossed, chairs they sat in, what they saw when they looked out the window.",
        "That's how you feel like you've recreated their daily life.",
        "And somehow, you know, what Annie's been able to do, from Eleanor Roosevelt's incredible house at Val-Kill, and then the sights in Concord, which is my hometown, of Emerson, Alcott and Thoreau, the studios, the workplaces, the libraries.",
        "It's a different way of looking at recreating life than the faces of the person, but she has such a different kind of - and she has a visual genius.",
        "She and I talked about this, and I think it's very different from what I have.",
        "I don't see things like that, so - but I see the people.",

        "What you realize is the visual stuff can tell you the same thing I'm looking for about the people's relationship through diaries and letters, because it recreates the place in which they were, and you can imagine them there, which is so exciting.",
        "Well, I think photographers have a very hard time retrieving words, and, you know, we go into this place where we see something.",
        "And I, you know, and I do think that what Doris does is, you know, she manages to - it's poetry to really describe something in words that, you know, I feel limited with words.",

        "And then, of course, I found - ended up finding this extraordinary workshop that he had inside of his barn, that if you get a chance to see the photograph, it's just filled with so many things, and every single spot is just - it looks like the inside of a mind.",

        "So - but I guess, you know, there was never that attempt to make a complete portrait, though.",

        "And it was sort of, again, like - it was as if you were inside, you know, a treasure house, but it was, like, sort of the end of the treasure.",
        "It was sort of dark and cavernous, and there was just a few pieces left, Noguchi props and - anyway.",
