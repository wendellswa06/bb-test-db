        "You - interestingly, there are a couple of photographers, and in some ways there's a lot of photography history in this book.",
        "One of them - again, in England - Julia Margaret Cameron, obviously Ansel Adams, but Julia Margaret Cameron, I was not so familiar with her work, and I thought that was fascinating.",
        "I was sort of always impressed - or I couldn't quite understand how Julia Margaret Cameron did all of her pictures, it seemed like almost in a dark place.",

        "And I just thought it was strange that she - we never saw the island in those pictures, but of course not, because she was totally into the people she was photographing.",
        "And she was apparently a terror to have take your picture because, you know, in those days, you had to stay still for about seven or eight minutes, and it was - her picture sessions have been described as very, very difficult.",
        "But the pictures were beautiful.",
        "They were extraordinary.",
        "They - you know, they were not necessarily, you know, in focus.",
        "She had a lens that only had a very small focal length.",
        "And her son, who became a photographer, sort of berated her for her work being sort of soft.",
        "His work was very sharp, very clear, very well-developed, and it was kind of boring, you know, actually.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "So mistakes are part of what's important.",
        "You also write and photograph about Ansel Adams.",
        "And one of the interesting things is you visit a lot of the places that he takes his pictures from and say it's interesting.",
        "You can go to those places and still take those pictures, and then you quote Ansel Adams as saying: People can go to those places and take those pictures, and they're disappointed they don't look like mine.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "I think Ansel Adams did say that because, you know, he had this idea that he pre-visualized his pictures.",
        "I had an idea for this series of pictures that I wanted to honor Ansel, because his view of Yosemite is what we think of when we think of Yosemite.",
        "And if we didn't have those pictures, we, you know, there's a good chance we might not have had Yosemite - of course along with John Muir, who was very, very important."

        "So, of course, you know, I was popping in and out of Yosemite, which isn't exactly easy to do, popping in and out, in between - you know, this is not my day job.",
        "And so I - she actually went on to say: And do you know that some photographers, you know, old landscape photographers would take clouds from other pictures and put them in pictures?",
        "And of course I cringed because I think of my day-to-day work, where we do, you know, we do a lot of retouching now, digitally.",
        "And so I was determined to take a picture that was correct, right and not touched.",
        "So I went back two or three times to take that picture.",
        "When I went to school, Ansel, you know, was not someone that I could say that - someone that I, you know, admired, you know.",
        "And as I have grown older, I've come around and realize the great importance of his work.",
        "And so that's the significance of him in this series of pictures now.",

        "Do you want to talk about what it is?",
        "Well, I can't say much.",
        "All that I did for the house - they had the first time this year a haunted attraction, a haunted maze, and myself and my fiancee and a team of make-up artists were in charge of making up the actors to scare the guests as they came through.",
        "Oh, so they would jump out from behind things or lurch down from the ceiling, that sort of thing?",

        "And it's a very bizarre house.",
        "Yeah, that was Sarah Winchester, and she did it because she felt that she had to appease the spirits of the people killed by the Winchester rifle.",
