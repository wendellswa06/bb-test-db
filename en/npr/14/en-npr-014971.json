        "So at the age of 50, she started a vegetable garden, and she started eating what she calls correctly.",
        "But just to see how she lived and how, you know, frugally she lived and how sparsely she lived and how extraordinary - how you need very little and, you know, her views and - it was just a wonderful time to go through those buildings in that land and those vistas.",
        "Jean Shea(ph) tweeted us: The Best Friends Animal Society in Kanab, Utah, its beautiful land and the work being done there is medicine for the mind and soul.",

        "So there was a little, you know, unorthodox hanky panky going on there.",
        "But I - no, I - it was incredible to sort of learn about the battlefield and the battle and, you know, Pickett's Charge.",
