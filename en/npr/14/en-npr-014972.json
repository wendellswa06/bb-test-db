        "Well, what I love about it is the interaction with Cordelia, his daughter, because, to me, it says so much about family and how we misunderstand each other.",
        "There isn't a scene in Shakespeare, however remote the time of the setting, you know, that doesn't reverberate down the time to us today.",
        "And the scene of the upset(ph) of King Lear where just as King Lear is about to give away his daughter's hand in marriage to one of her two suitors, he asks her and her sisters to have a little challenge and tell them how much they love him.",
        "I think that's probably the scene that is played in every limousine as every father takes his daughter to be married, and he says, do you still love me?",
        "And she says, yes, I do, but, you know, I'm now getting married, and there's another man in my life.",
        "And I think that's why the bride's father is often more tearful than the bride herself because he is losing a daughter in the sense, and that's what Lear cannot stand it.",
        "But that seems to me a terribly, terribly normal situation, or however extreme of King Lear because he's an extreme person who takes it.",
        "I cannot heave my heart into my mouth.",
        "I love your majesty according to my bond, no more, no less.",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, she's probably a bit stubborn and a bit too honest, you know.",
        "There are ways of putting these things and she gets it wrong, and she's aware of that.",
        "But he gets it even more wrong, of course.",
        "There's nothing in Shakespeare that isn't so cosset to the vast human nature that it doesn't apply to our own lives, and that's what keeps the plays ever modern and ever fresh, and which allow - and allows each new group of actors who tackle the play to make it their own even whilst they're trying to be true to Shakespeare.",
        "So what got you out on the road?",
        "I'm sure that it's not always pleasant.",
        "You're hopping, scotching hotel to hotel…",
        "You mustn't feel too sorry for me because I'm speaking from an apartment in China Town, which is in an old loft, and I'm looking out of a whole of Manhattan and I'm very, very lucky this week but - this month rather.",
        "But in Australia and New Zealand and Singapore, things weren't quite as comfortable.",
        "Now, it isn't easy being on the road, and long journeys take ages out of you, which you feel you ought to be presenting on stage.",
        "So you have to keep reminding yourselves we're not on holiday, you know, on vacation.",
        "This is work even though we're in strange and wonderful places.",
        "But the reason I got on the road is - because when I was a kid in the north of England, the great place that I saw were often done by actors who were touring.",
        "Now, a lot of Americans may know you from your movie roles, I'm thinking specifically of \"\"Lord of Rings\"\" Gandalf.",

        "When you see Hugh Grant, you want to see Hugh Grant, don't you?",
        "You don't see Hugh Grant pretending to be somebody else.",
        "But then there are other actors more pretty and who like to play a range of parts in a range of styles in a range of media, and I'm one of those.",
        "And if someone comes to see me as King Lear because they know Gandalf, that's absolutely fine.",
        "And there was a 7-year-old kid who came to Stratford-upon-Avon where this production began earlier in the year, and he came with his parents to see Gandalf.",
        "He was 7 years old and he was waiting for me at the stage, thereafter and told me that \"\"King Lear\"\" was his favorite play ever.",

        "And if so, why?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Well, once when I was in New York on Broadway, I think this was 1980, I was doing Peter Shaffer's play, \"\"Amadeus,\"\" for a year and Lena Horne was in town.",
        "I get just to see her in person and she has beautifully on song and with her whole range of sexiness and indignation and power was amazing.",
        "And what was special about that song was not that she's made it her own over the years, but she sang it surprisingly in the first half of the show.",
        "And normally, stars keep their signature tune and as an encore, but she sang it half way through the show, and I was very surprised."

        "And when I was subsequently in New York, I did meet her backstage.",

        "It's been really, some really good progress that in 2006, the Pope made his address at Regensburg and a number of Muslim scholars responded to that.",

        "And the Pope has met with Muslim religious leaders.",

        "So, it's been quite some positive sets there.",
        "Who was it?",
        "That troubled Muslims so much with what the Pope said two years ago when he quoted this 14th century Byzantine scholar?",
        "There were two things there.",
        "One was, you know, talking about the whole notion of what Muhammad brought was violence.",
        "And that - you know, you can understand where that comes from because of course the person that's writing this, the Byzantine emperor, is there when his own city is being attacked by Muslims.",
        "So, of course there's that kind of propaganda going on.",
        "The more problematic thing for many of us was the Pope seemed to neglect the role of reason, rationality in the Islamic world and talked about the faith and reason being important for Christians, particularly Catholic Christians, but not so much for Muslims.",
        "And of course that was a real problem because the medieval period was one in which, Christian philosophers really developed their notions from Muslims and Jewish ones.",
        "The Pope obviously is an international leader, and he did get off to a rocky start.",
        "Do you think that that affected his ability to lead worldwide?",
        "I don't know that it affect his ability lead worldwide because of course the Pope very clearly has an audience and that's not a Muslim body.",
        "So, he is the head of the Catholic Church and there are issues for him, in terms of evangelization in Europe, the declining numbers of Catholics.",
        "So, I think you know, he is speaking to that particular audience.",
        "How is the Pope's relationship with Islam in Europe different from his relationship with the broader Muslim world or with Muslims here in America?",
        "It's a huge difference because of course in Europe, you see a society that isn't just simply secular like American society is but very much anti-religious in some ways that you know, recent Pew study showed, Americans are much more religious than Europeans.",
        "So, the Pope on the one hand is dealing with the decline of religion in Europe.",
        "On the other hand, you've got very large Muslim populations there and there are interesting economic issues.",
        "You know, in America, American Muslims are successful, they're educated, they're wealthy.",
        "In Europe, European Muslims tend to be marginalized, lower class, it's a whole different issue in Europe as it is compared to here in the U.S.",
        "And what do you want to see from the Pope, during his visit here?",
        "I think we've already seen those kinds of things, but first of all a recognition and awareness of the interfaith reality that's here in America.",
        "And in that sense, America is quite different, particularly in Los Angeles were you've got the largest catholic Archdiocese, but the most religiously diverse city in the world and so to be a Catholic, you know, in Los Angeles is to be informed by people who are Hindu, and Buddhist, and Muslim, and atheist.",
        "The Pope, I think, has really taken those kinds of steps."

        "It fell four votes short when it came up in early June, and Mark Leno decided to try a different tack.",
        "He went to the Senate first; he put the language into a bill in sort of a parliamentary procedure and decided to go that way while he continued to lobby members.",
        "And he got a lot of help lobbying from some very powerful people here in the state of California, the United Farm Workers, the granddaughter of Cesar Chavez, people who are sort of noted for their civil rights work here in the state.",
        "And what I think was remarkable about the Senate passage last weekend and last night's in the Assembly was that the supporters of this really do believe they are on the cusp of a civil rights issue, that people will look back at this one day and look back at these votes as not dissimilar to when people stood up and said, you know, blacks should be equal to whites and women should be able to vote just like men do.",

        "The governor was confronted with same-sex marriage throughout the campaign.",
        "He always said that he favored the state's domestic partner laws which are currently in place, but he also said essentially that it was up to the voters or the courts to make a decision, and he would abide by that.",
        "Now of course the most recent voter decision approved five years ago Proposition 22, which does define marriage as between a man and a woman.",
        "That is being challenged in court.",
        "As you probably know, San Francisco went ahead and issued same-sex marriage licenses last year.",
        "That's in court.",

        "It's obviously a difficult one for him.",
        "He is fairly moderate or liberal on social issues compared to many Republicans, but right now Republicans are pretty much the only friends he's got in this state, so he needs to keep them happy.",
        "He's got a difficult special election coming up, he's planning on running for re-election next year, and it's unlikely that he's going to do something that would so completely infuriate his base.",
