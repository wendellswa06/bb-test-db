        "And I think there's a lot more - there are a lot more women writers who are doing amazing work than we do hear about, and I want those women writers to get as much press and get as much sort of blockbuster attention for their literary novels as, say, Jonathan Franzen and Jonathan Safran Foer - that category of the male literary blockbuster novel.",
        "But hasn't this argument been going on for a while between art and commerce, and is it really a different conversation for women?",
        "What's, you know, really what's different about this conversation on the women's side than it would be for, you know, male popular fiction, like the Tom Clancys, Scott Turows...",

        "That's nothing new.",
        "That's been with us for decades and decades and decades.",
        "I think the issue here for me was just that I just saw year after year after year so many books by women that are just stellar and gorgeous not getting as much attention as I'd hope.",
        "And this coincided with the sort of rise of the pink book cover at the front of the store.",
        "And I heard from so many friends who weren't necessarily writers but were big readers that they had stopped buying fiction because they were sick of reading the same book over and over, and they were having a hard time finding the kind of books that they could previously find easily.",
        "I need to ask you what you have against pink, but we'll take a caller.",
