        "Hello, thank you for taking my call.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "And I wanted to say I love TALK OF THE NATION, and I'm really excited about this topic because I love to read.",
        "And the reason I called in is I actually love chick lit, but I love it for a reason.",
        "I am a salesperson, and I spend my day doing a lot of writing, a lot of in-depth reading.",
        "I'm in banking, and so I'm dealing with a lot of numbers and stuff, and sometimes a chick lit book is just the thing that I need to relax my mind and relax from the whole day and sleep, you know, get to sleep or just kind of calm down from the discussions I'm having during the day.",
        "That's a very good point, Patricia.",
        "So, Elizabeth, what's so terrible?",
        "What's so terrible?",
        "Oh, absolutely nothing.",
        "I mean, I even say in the introduction, we all need our beach reading.",
        "We all need our light stuff, you know.",
        "And I think it's this issue of is there anything wrong with potato chips?",
        "No. There's nothing wrong with potato chips.",
        "Is there anything wrong with only eating potato chips?",
        "Yeah, that's maybe not, you know, what we want to do.",
        "So I think that's the lens I look at it through.",
        "There's certainly nothing wrong with light entertainment.",
        "Patricia, can I ask you, if you don't mind, do you ever buy more weighty tomes?",
        "Actually, I was just going to make that comment.",
        "One of the things that I do like to do when I go onto the bookstore - because my degree is actually in creative writing and English - is look for somebody who's kind of quirky, and sometimes I'll go out of my way to find an unusual writer.",
        "I'll look for somebody who's like really not mainstream.",
        "I'll look specifically for Hispanic or specifically for African-American so that I can take a look at, oh, here's the candy stuff, but now I can really spend my time and enjoy who this non-mainstream writer is.",
        "And I will say that the flipside of chick lit is when I then go to one of these what I'll call extreme-writer books, I enjoy the story.",
        "I enjoy the writing.",
        "I wish I could remember author names.",
        "I'm so bad at it.",

        "But if people take a look, and you look at some of the non-mainstream writers, the benefit I get from chick lit is then when I move to one of these other books, I will read it over and over and over and I spread it to everybody, and I tell them, you know, go ahead and read one of the chick lit books - and I can't even - the Shopaholic series, for instance - but then your next book needs to be this and this and this.",
        "Okay.",
        "And so I find for me that turns out to be a benefit.",

        "Hi.",
        "Well, I've thought a lot about this because I've been involved in political and environmental activism, and I just see such a huge emphasis across the spectrum - women's fashion magazines, TV shows, movies, you name it - and it puts such an emphasis on women focusing on beauty and trying to look like some supermodel.",
        "And I often think if only women would put a little bit more into finding out about current events and getting involved in their local communities and then finding their inner power, and I think we could change the world.",
        "I think the global warming crisis is so huge that - you know, fiction is fun, but, you know, the nonfiction is really where we should be putting our focus.",
        "And women have so much power, compassion and empathy, and if we could put that into their inner power rather than this kind of flighty thing that - especially young women.",
        "You know, I work with children and I see these young girls, and they're following right along with what the television tells them to do.",
        "And I think it's an untapped power, and I really wish there was less of these chick lit things.",
        "Okay, Pam, thank you so much.",
        "Thank you for calling.",
        "Elizabeth, do you agree?",
        "Is that part of your problem with chick lit, that it's a - if I could use this term, anti-feminist - that it emphasizes, you know, finding the guy and, you know, traditional women's jobs like, you know, publishing and, you know, buying shoes and things of that sort and, you know, looking cute and so forth.",
        "Is that part of what bothers you about it?",
        "I think that's a great question.",
        "I have two responses to that and to what the caller just said.",
        "First of all, I think beauty is very important, and for women to feel beautiful is important.",
        "However, it is also just one element of our lives.",
        "And as this caller said, there's a lot of things we should be thinking about right now that if we're on this loop that we certainly have seen in our pop culture lately of just this endless sort of makeover shows and plastic surgery shows and this sort of constant obsession with the surface that has just, you know, skyrocketed in the past 10 years - there's more than that.",
        "And I think that chick lit tends to sort of fall in line with that stuff and really solid fiction gets our imaginations beyond that.",
        "It lets us see ourselves as whole people with many more stories than just that one."

        "The premise of the story is that a disgraced publicist is hired to rehabilitate the reputation of a genocidal dictator in an unspecified country abroad.",
        "And she, out of desperation, is forced to take this job because she's a single mother raising a young daughter and she's out of money.",
        "And so she comes up with a plan to have him romantically linked to an American movie star, and she, her daughter, and the movie star head over to the country to meet the general and put this plan into action."

        "The thing that amazed me about it is that it had so many amazing details, like what happened to disgrace this public relations figure, and also the fact that, you know, she - I don't want to - well, I'm not going to spoil it for people because it's - that in itself is kind of delicious surprise.",
        "But there's so many kind of these wonderful details, but also that you don't shy away from the politics of the thing.",
        "You don't shy away at all from the reality of what this man did and the moral choice that this woman is making, so - and I know that you're journalist as well as a novelist, so I was wondering whether your work in journalism informed your imagining of this story.",
        "You know, I don't know that it did exactly because I haven't done that much journalism abroad.",
        "But, you know, I think if you're going to write a story about a publicist and a dictator, you'd better get political.",
        "I don't know how you would avoid it.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, you've heard our conversation with Elizabeth Merrick, so how do you weigh on in this question?",
        "And I'm curious how you feel about being part of an anthology that distances itself so strongly from the chick lit genre.",
        "Well, it's funny.",
        "You know, I made the decision to join this anthology somewhat instinctively and then spent the next few months trying to figure out exactly why I had agreed to do this, and that was instructive.",
        "You know, as a reader particularly - and also as a writer - I feel very alienated from the category of chick lit.",
        "And I think what I don't like about it is that unlike other genre fiction - you know, mystery, horror, things like that - this category seems to announce itself as being second-rate in some way, not serious.",
        "And so whereas many writers have risen from those genres like, you know, Elmore Leonard, Stephen King, into real literary - into a position of being taken seriously as literary writers, chick lit seems to announce itself as something that has very limited ambition and reach and also as something that is very female and sort of girly.",
        "And so to me, a category that presents itself as being trivial and female falls all too close to a prejudice we're still trying to overcome, that the female is trivial.",
        "And that bothers me.",
        "Well, couldn't we make the opposite argument, that why do we demean things just because they are female, if they are particularly, you know - if I may say, we did a program on this program a couple of months ago about spring fashion, and some people were not pleased.",
        "But I didn't find that they were annoyed when we do programs about baseball.",
        "Okay?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah.",
        "So, you know, fashion is some women's hobby just like baseball is some men's hobby.",
        "So I mean, isn't that partly a societal prejudice that something's associated with females and it's deemed to be lesser, so we need to run away from it?"

        "I agree, but that's why I question the way in which the chick lit category works, because the marketing of this category seems to suggest that it will be trivial in some way.",
        "In other words, you know, stories about women in their 20s trying to find husbands needn't necessarily be trivial on the face of it at all.",
        "I mean, what was Jane Austen writing about?",
        "She wrote some of the best novels written in the English language about the short period in a woman's life between the moment that she comes out into society and the moment when she chooses her husband.",
        "And she brings to bear on that, you know, all kinds of hierarchies of power, the position of women in society.",

        "But I think all of us would cringe together at the idea of calling these writers chick lit writers.",
        "And the reason for that is that we all share the assumption, I believe - or I shouldn't speak for you - but I have a strong association in my mind between the idea of chick lit and something inherently trivial.",
