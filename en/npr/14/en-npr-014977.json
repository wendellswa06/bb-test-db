        "Hi, I'm a 20-something male, and I was kind of interested because I frankly have, you know, read different genres of fiction.",
        "And I think that it's a little strange that women's literature is being focused on as just, you know, how can we sell this to women instead of, well, how can we provide a story that provides people's insight, you know, into other people who they couldn't have experienced themselves, you know, kind of a, you know, an intra-subjective experience or however you'd like to say it.",
        "But I mean, I've read anything from, you know, the kind of generic Harlequin fiction that I guess would be the chick lit of the '70s and '80s to, you know, I guess the, you know, high-modern literature.",
        "And it seems like what's unfortunate is that women have provided a, you know, a great deal of innovations to different genres, from science fiction to, you know, I guess kind of the generic commercial fiction, and it seems like there's so much more to the conversation than just, you know, how can we sell this to this audience.",
        "Steve, I'm not sure I understand what you're saying.",
        "Are you saying that you kind of resent the marketing, that it makes it that you've got to be a woman to like this, you've got to be a man to like that, that it should just be about the ideas?",
        "Or do you just find kind of the labeling bothersome?",
        "I mean, I think kind of both of those things.",
        "You know, people have different reasons for reading and, you know, I, frankly, I didn't really enjoy reading certain types of novels, but there're, you know, a number of novels written by women that have, you know, been really informative to me.",
        "And it does seem really - I mean, if people want to read a novel, you know, just kind of like the conversation earlier.",
        "If you need something on the beach just to kind of kick back and enjoy and it's something light and it makes you happy, that's one thing.",
        "But it just seems really unfortunate that there's such a shallow focus on just, you know - there's, you know, there's something essentially, you know, essentially feminist I guess that, you know, is just in this aspect of beauty or just in this aspect of providing care to people.",
        "I mean, you know, you could - a male or female writer could provide different aspects to that.",
        "But what really, you know - it would just be really nice if so many of the, you know, new women's writers or, you know, the new writers who really haven't broken through could, you know, get access to the market regardless of, you know...",
        "Okay.",
        "...I guess the commercial...",
        "Okay, Steve, you're breaking up a little, so I'm going to let you go, but thank you for calling.",
        "Thank you."

        "I think that...",
        "What do you think about that?",
        "I think there's something to that.",
        "I mean, one thing that I found really disturbing about this whole scandal involving plagiarism for that - the novel by the very young novelist Kaavya Viswanathan, How Opal Got Kissed, Got Wild and Got a Life.",
        "There was a lot of debate about whether she had really plagiarized, whether it was intentional or unintentional.",
        "But what I took away from that story more than anything was here's a really smart 17-year-old girl who wants to write a novel, and what does she do?",
        "She reads a lot of other novels that I think anyone would agree are pretty derivative.",
        "I mean, the material that she was plagiarizing did not - there was not a lot of originality there to begin with.",
        "She recycles all of this, either knowingly or unknowingly, and then with a book packager, packages this novel.",
        "That's not really my ideal of what a young, smart woman who wants to write a novel goes and does.",
        "And that that's what writing a book meant to her I find a little disappointing.",

        "Thank you.",
        "But about the issue at hand, I think it's particularly interesting the selling of a book that way, that I think young women - I'm a young woman myself, I'm 21 - that we're kind of in - our generation is kind of thinking that we are commodities in a way."

        "You know, a lot of what I see is a big problem is like commodifying ourselves, and I think the reading of chick lit definitely plays into that as what am I and what sells and how do I sell myself rather than - and it's hard because, you know, it's a thin line between segregating and uniting as a gender.",

        "She would tell us that she won't be able to die happy and, like, in peace if her daughters don't go to college and become something big and great.",
        "It is in a certain way talking about the problems of being a bourgeoisie, you know, wife.",
        "But then there are other characters in the book and in that sense it was still going about it as a - I don't know, social critique rather than embracing what is kind of a cultural problem in a way, the superficiality of it all.",
        "So, I don't know.",
        "I hope...",
        "Okay.",
