        "And it's fine to have entertaining reads, but, you know, in chick lit and in teenage literature that is the pre-cursor to chick lit, or young chick lit, there is now branding taking place.",
        "That bothers me.",
        "Okay, but Janice let me ask you and let me ask Ms. Henriquez both, what - isn't this - aren't these books bringing people into the bookstore and while they're there maybe they'll look at something else?",
