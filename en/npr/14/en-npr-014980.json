        "And I think there were people who did read the performances as unique, although, however, I think the problem with playing these roles was--is that you always had Hollywood's kind of overwhelming racism and the undercurrent running with these roles, and it was really often very hard to read the context that she wanted you to see the roles in.",

        "I mean, he was--Selznick was--he wanted the black performers to go because he was going to use them to promote the film within the African-American community, where it had been receiving criticism.",
        "But the city fathers enforced that, and then not only did that, but took it one step further and deleted her picture from the program.",
        "In the other parts of the country, her picture appeared in the program; in LA, she attended the premiere.",
        "But in the South, she was forbidden from coming.",
        "In the end, though, the Academy Award did not--was disappointing, because it didn't really lead her to the kinds of roles she hoped it would."
