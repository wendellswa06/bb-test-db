        "This was--the Academy Award was really a bittersweet victory.",
        "I mean, she saw herself as a pioneer and she saw herself as a trailblazer, and the first Academy Award for an African-American--she saw it as an individual accomplishment, as something that would portend better things in Hollywood and for the African-American people.",
        "But despite the fact that it was that kind of triumph, Hollywood still, you know, continued to reinforce these stereotypical roles.",
        "She had hoped for a breakthrough role and she told the press that she anticipated one coming, but it wasn't forthcoming at all.",
        "And then on top of it, it traps her kind of in between white Hollywood and then the African-American community.",
        "She's constantly kind of battling that, looking for a balance, to continue to serve the community but at the same time to serve her ambitions, which is to succeed in white Hollywood, and the cost is tremendous.",
        "It's a tremendous personal price she has to pay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And--but she was very proud of her success.",
        "I want to get on to that conflict that black actors faced, the sort of--but she was--really enjoyed her success, also, we should say at the same time.",
        "She--you write that she sort of had an intellectual salon and she was very happy about the fact that she could help other people as well.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "I think that's something, though, that goes way back in her history.",
        "You find her, even as a teen-ager, as a young woman--the performances she did then were often benefits for African-American organizations in her hometown.",
        "And, you know, even when she's struggling, she's out there and she'll get onstage and perform in a benefit.",
        "But once she's able to make it and make that breakthrough in Hollywood, she shares the success with others.",
        "She buys the home in South Harvard Street in the Adams district of Los Angeles, and she opens the doors of that home.",
        "She--like you said, she has this gathering of African-American artists where, within the walls of her home, they're able to perform the way they want to perform.",
        "And so she--you know, this is a--post-Academy Award for the first few years, I think she was quite hopeful, and she wanted to share that success with others.",
        "She supported family, friends.",
        "People talk about how people would just come to her and she'd give out the money she had, so she's quite generous in that way.",
        "Jill Watts is the author of \"\"Hattie McDaniel: Black Ambition, White Hollywood,\"\" and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Jill, let's talk about some of the problems that Hattie McDaniel and other black actors had to confront in Hollywood in terms of just--other black Americans began really rejecting them and turning against them because they did continue to play these stereotypical roles, and they kept arguing that they had to; they had no choice.",
        "Right.",
        "Right.",
        "I think you see during the 1930s the frustrations continually mounting within the African-American community, and I think the argument well-made that these roles continued to enforce the oppression of African-American people.",
        "And the black performers, they would argue, `Well, if we don't play these roles, we'll vanish from the screen, or they'll use white actors in blackface,' which Hollywood had done.",
        "And they also continued to argue that they were trailblazers, and just by hanging in the industry that was going to open these doors.",
        "And you have to admit, I mean, they faced considerable discrimination within the industry; however, you know, like I said, the argument was well-made that these stereotypes, which continually persisted, people became frustrated with and people in American society were educated by those stereotypes, and that's the attitudes that they walked away with towards the African-American people.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So that debate continues to heat up into the 1940s, once the war begins, then it really takes off, because the war opens up the doors for the potential for better images with the government supporting the idea that Hollywood should reform its images, and there was a sort of ulterior motive in that they hoped to recruit African-Americans into the American military.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's take a call now from Fernando in San Antonio.",
        "Fernando, go ahead."

        "Hi.",

        "A quick question: How old was Ms. McDaniel when she won the Academy Award?",
        "Oh, she won the Academy Award in 1940, and so she was born in 1893, so she was 47.",
        "OK.",
        "And now my question is: How much has Hollywood really changed when she won the Academy Award in 1940, and it took over 60 years before a black actor or actress won best actor?",
        "Halle Berry.",
        "Fry cautions this is one snapshot of a generation, and that picture may shift with time and changes in immigration patterns.",
        "What 21-year-old Yasmin Butt doesn't plan to shift is her determination to finish her schooling.",
        "She's set to graduate from Columbia University in May and has two younger sisters, one also in college and another applying to schools.",

        "I think that's a whole book in and of itself.",
        "I think that's a really, really important question.",
        "And I'm kind of hoping that if we go back to this earlier era and look at the discrimination that was faced by these performers, the foundation of racism within the movie industry, that we can better understand what the performers in these modern times are facing.",
        "So I think it's--Hattie McDaniel and that group of people, they faced segregation on the movie lots; they couldn't eat in the commissaries, or if they did--they were allowed to eat in the commissaries, they were forced to eat at the counter.",
        "They didn't make the same wages.",
        "They didn't have wardrobe assistants.",
        "They didn't have dressing rooms.",
        "They--it's a whole plethora of things that they faced.",
        "Now you can't deny that, to some degree, that's changed.",
        "However, I think what you're pointing up is that we have to talk about the images that we see, and I think Spike Lee has been very articulate in reminding us that this--images have become institutionalized in our culture, and we need to go back and look at those images and we need more dignified roles for African-American people."

        "You know, and you point out, sadly and ironically, I guess, that when Halle Berry accepted her Academy Award and she thanked a whole line of other African-American actress who had come before her, she didn't mention Hattie McDaniel.",
        "That's true, but I think what Halle Berry was doing is she was looking at the pioneers just before her, Diahann Carroll and the others who had preceded in the industry just before she came into the industry.",
        "So I think that Halle Berry was--kind of had her eye on that generation that had broken down the doors in the '60s and '70s.",
