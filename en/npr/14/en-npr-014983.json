        "What's the bias here?",
        "Many people are hesitant to give drivers a bad rating.",
        "So the driver might have been rude.",
        "The car might have been dirty.",
        "You might have nearly gotten into a crash.",
        "Objectively, the ride might deserve a rating of one star out of five.",

        "He told me what goes through many riders' minds as they decide what rating to give.",
        "There's quite a bit of evidence that people don't rate people harshly in these systems, even if they maybe had a bad experience or a not great experience just because they don't want to harm the other person.",

        "That's so interesting because we've just had, like, a personal experience with an Uber or Lyft driver, and because of that, we're less likely to give them a bad rating.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So people understand that drivers who get poor ratings might get kicked off the platform.",

        "They find that when the platform tells users that the feedback is going to be private and that it won't be used to punish providers, users start to provide much more critical feedback.",
        "As Horton crunched the data, he realized that he is tempted to do the very same thing himself with his students, give them higher grades than they deserve.",
        "I have to give grades as a professor.",
        "And, you know, no one in the history of teaching I think has ever come in to complain about an A.",
        "When you give low grades, that's when it sort of becomes personally costly to you, where people want to meet and talk.",
        "And so kind of giving the high grades is in some ways the easier thing to do in most cases.",

        "The western Ukrainian-speaking region, which is once part of Poland, feels much closer to Europe.",
        "And people in the west are more often opposed to President Yanukovych."

        "Yes, definitely, I mean, there was a moment on TV in November when there was the first crackdown on protesters in Kiev, and then there was a debate between the four presidents of Ukraine, and Yanukovych was smiling when he was talking about, you know, this crackdown.",
        "And I think that's still very much embedded in the memory of the people, and there has never been, you know, a direct apology in saying that I'm sorry for what has happened and I take the responsibility.",
