        "Saying, for example, it's okay to waterboard, but not okay to threaten to bury someone alive.",
        "Saying, among other things, that introducing pain or inducing pain that might be equivalent to the sensation of organ death or even to the pain that would be associated with dying - that that would be acceptable as long as it did not fit a very narrow, some would say, tortured definition of torture.",
        "And where is the president in all of this?",
        "Is this going on without his knowledge or is this going on and then the vice president presents this to the president and he just signs these orders?",
        "What happens?",
        "The essence of the vice president's role is that he acts not without the knowledge of the president, not in lieu of the president, but he acts ahead of the president.",
        "He puts together a policy.",
        "He puts together a way that policy might be executed and presents that to the president - not as a fait accompli, but as a way that the goals, the aims, that he and the president share can be achieved.",
        "But it's clear from the Washington Post series - and I think it was clear even before we saw it all pulled together in this series - that Dick Cheney was, if you will, the first among equals.",
        "His voice was always heard.",
        "And even if the president did not always go along with Dick Cheney, his batting average was far higher than anyone else's.",
        "Well, since then, Vice President Cheney's wings have clipped quite a bit by the Supreme Court, by Congress.",
        "So does he have as much power now as he did then?",
        "It's a little bit hard to make that judgment at this juncture.",
        "His wings may have been clipped in certain very specific respects, but I think the president of the United States needs Dick Cheney as much today as he ever has.",
        "He understands the way that Dick Cheney's mind works.",
        "And in the end, they seem to be simpatico in terms of the way they like to make decisions, and then the way they like to deal with the consequences.",
        "Dick Cheney takes the blows and continues on his path.",
        "He is the human personification of stay the course.",

        "Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell is in a tight race for governor of his state.",

        "Well, we're in very, very strong position.",
        "We came out of a very robust and competitive campaign.",
        "It was bitterly fought and we anticipated that we would probably be lagging by double digits and that we would be way behind in terms of money because we had to spend down the $5 million that we had raised in that primary contest.",
        "And Mr. Strickland had virtually no contest and we thought that he would be light years ahead of us, in terms of fundraising.",
        "But to be almost within the margin of error, which means that this race, right now, is about a dead heat and to be what we think is relatively close to him and cash on hand, we're sitting in a very competitive position; much better off than we had anticipated coming out of a toughly fought primary.",

        "Do tell.",
        "...When you give five stars to a bad driver who nearly gets you into a crash, you're exposing the next rider to a certain elevated risk.",
        "When you look at it this way, the people who give accurate ratings deal with the immediate backlash of the discomfort of giving a low rating to a bad driver.",
        "But they provide better information to the next rider or the next professor.",
        "It's easier to pass the bad apple along.",

        "The only reason the Library of Congress allowed him to use this recording was to take the earnings from this recording and make sure that it went to an heir to the Shipp family, which they actually did."
