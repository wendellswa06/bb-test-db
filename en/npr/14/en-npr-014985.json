        "So we look to maintain our share of the African-American vote.",
        "Are you bothered at all by the fact that there is going to be some support for you that is solely based on race versus politics?",
        "Well, I always said that no one should vote for me solely because of my skin color, just as no one should vote against me solely because of my skin color.",
        "I think that my share of the African-American vote has been based on those things that I advocate and a track record of success in building an ownership society within the African-American community.",
        "I thought it was noteworthy that Radio One endorsed my candidacy based on the fact that I have a track record with urban policy and I have a track record in breaking down barriers to access to capital for expanded home ownership and business ownership; and that I actually have been part of a business enterprise that hired black people and helped them to build their assets to create wealth.",
        "So my share of the African-American vote won't be on the basis of skin color, but on the basis of my track record of having advocated for the interests that are shared by a good number of African-American voters across the State of Ohio.",
        "We're going to get into that track record in just a moment.",
        "We should note that Radio One is a network of radio stations, a conglomerate owned by an African-American woman, Cathy Hughes.",
        "That being said, let me ask you, as relates to what we could see, and that's an unprecedented number of African-Americans winning statewide office.",
        "We have Lynn Swann in Pennsylvania, Michael Steele and Kweisi Mfume in Maryland, yourself in Ohio, but what does this say if all of you lose?",
        "How much pressure do you feel, if at all, that this will be a referendum, to a great degree, on the statewide ability for African-Americans to run, at least as relates to how the parties look at it?"

        "I just came out of a tough statewide primary where I ran against a formidable opponent, Jim Petro, the present attorney general.",
        "So I think, given that I was the first African-American to win a statewide office in 1994, given that the first African-American Representative was a Republican, given the fact that the first African-American to sit on the elected state Supreme Court was a Republican, I think that the statement has been made that in Ohio, history would prove that the Republican party has been the party of opportunity and the party of breakthrough effects in the political arena.",

        "My message of expanded economic growth and job creation speaks directly to blue collar Ohio and to African-Americans in particular.",
        "They want folks who will break down barriers to opportunities, to higher education, and my work with Wilberforce University as a trustee for ten years, my advocacy for Central State University.",
        "People will look at that track record and say, hey, here's a guy that understands something that Bobby Kennedy understood in the 1960s...",
        "But Ken, what of those who suggest that that's just being naïve?",
        "(Unintelligible) - Bobby Kennedy said, look, you can't win the war on poverty if you leave the tools of marketplace capitalism on the sideline.",
        "All right, what do you say to those who say that that's being naïve, that opportunity is not there on a whole for African-Americans to go get the loans to start their own businesses?",
        "Well, the fact is, I think they then look at my track record and Cincinnati as mayor and as chairman of the finance committee, I took on the financial community and basically said, I see African American taxpayers as being shareholders in the city enterprise, and unless you can show us what your track record was in home ownerships and in expanding opportunities for business development, we weren't going to let you hold our account."

        "He's running against a guy who was in Congress for a decade and had no African-American staffers, who voted against even Clinton, you know, welfare reform that was geared toward infusing some personal responsibility, so African-Americans could climb up the ladder of economic opportunity.",

        "How do you soften the blow that many African-Americans feel, in terms of Bush being negligent to our community and your steadfast support of him?",
        "Well, the fact is, is that in Ohio, Ed, George Bush got 17 percent of the African-American vote, which was a - and that's in 2004 - which doubled his share of the African-American vote in 2000.",
        "So, here in Ohio, African-Americans took a look at his record - took a look at his advocacy on issues that matter to him, and he doubled his share of the African-American vote.",
        "And so, at the end of the day, they're going to sort out what they like about George Bush, what they dislike about George Bush - what they like about Ken Blackwell, what they dislike about Ken Blackwell, and I'm going to get compared against Ted Strickland, who has no record.",
