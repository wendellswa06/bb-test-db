        "I understand as of Friday, last week, there was still a bit of negotiation going back and forth.",
        "Yes, basically, on I guess it was January 13th, we entered into a Consent Decree, at least the city did, with regard to notification of property owners concerning whether their homes were on a list prepared by the city, sort of a floating list, sometimes it was, some days it was 5,000 properties, some days it was less, we weren't really sure, but, a notification process of those, for those homeowners concerning whether their property was set to be demolished.",
        "What we had to do, and what we're still working on, is that list of homes that is slated to be demolished and which property owners need to be notified by the city.",
        "It broke down into a list of three categories, some homeowners are going to be given seven working days notice, some ten working days notice, and then any and everyone else that the city may designate will have 30 working day notice, prior to any scheduled demolition.",

        "But in the last 20 years, the country, the government, humanitarian organizations have invested, are involved in preparedness measure.",
        "And of course, when the storms were heading - the typhoons were heading to the Philippines, we already had more than half a million in our evacuation centers before the storm hit.",
