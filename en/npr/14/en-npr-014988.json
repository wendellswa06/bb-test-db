        "No, I don't.",
        "I think that there was plenty of mismanagement, but I don't think that this was the fundamental issue.",
        "How much do you believe the idea that many of the evacuees, because of their inability to move, because of their economics, is something that this country will, in fact, have to look at because we can see New Orleans quite frankly as a microcosm of many of the poor that reside within this country?",
        "Well, I think this was something that was projected as a problem in exercises done as recently as 2004.",
        "The fact is that Louisiana cities generally do not have terribly good public transportation systems.",
        "So even in a best-case scenario, it's difficult to move people, to evacuate people when natural disasters are looming on the horizon.",
        "William Rodgers, let me turn to you and ask you about the role of poverty as it relates to not only the evacuees but the ability of people to mobilize, to move not just logistically but to ascend the economic and social class ladder here in the United States.",
        "Is this country best equipped to do so, to allow these people to move?",
        "Before I answer that, if I could just give my quick thoughts on the first question.",
        "Sure.",

        "I beg to differ.",
        "I think race and class really, really do play a key role here.",
        "The historical legacies of segregation, going back even further to slavery, the facts that are very important, history matters, that when you don't provide education, fully fund education to a segment of your population, that manifests itself through generation and generation.",
        "And so, you know, it's no fact that prior to--it's no surprise that, you know, the folks who had the greatest difficulty getting out of harm's way are those who at low income.",
        "And here's an example where many of us now talk about what's called the disparate impacts or maybe--I would still maintain that, yeah, racism plays a role, but the fact that we have these disparate impacts, that a race-neutral storm, Katrina, as the president said, showed no racial boundaries.",
        "But the fact that blacks are disproportionately poor--like 34 percent of blacks in New Orleans are below the poverty line compared to 16 percent, that poverty means you probably don't have access to transportation, you don't have access to savings and other types of assets to be able to weather the storm, you don't have access to insurance.",
        "And so I think race albeit runs together.",
        "It directly affects and it's also indirectly showing its unfortunate impacts.",
        "Now pick up if you will the other part of the question and that's the idea of this country being equipped to move people to allow them to ascend the social and economic ladder.",
        "There are many who will contend that the real sin hit before Katrina and that is that we are allowing far too many people to live in abject poverty in a country that is the richest in the history of the world.",
        "Sure.",
        "Yeah, I mean, prior to the mid-1990s, we had seen basically two decades of what many economists and social scientists call rising wage and equality.",
        "And what that basically means is that in summary, the rich were getting richer, and the poorer were getting poorer; that through globalization, through our inability to fully fund education and invest in individuals, through particularly training opportunities to build skills with regards to the growth in the IT revolution and the new kind of skills that that was creating a demand for, that those who didn't have those means to make those investments or their communities weren't making those investments in them, they saw their wages not stay up with inflation, not stay up with the cost of living.",
        "JPMorgan Chase has acknowledged losing at least $2 billion over the last six weeks in an investment strategy that went awry.",
        "The losses are a big embarrassment to a bank that's usually seen as one of the best-managed on Wall Street.",
        "And the incident is already prompting new calls for tighter restrictions on bank trading.",
        "Over half the money Washington set aside to rebuild New Orleans is still sitting.",
        "That's according to a new report by the RFK Memorial Center for Human Rights and the Institute for Southern Studies.",
        "Most of the 116 billion federal dollars targeted for the Gulf Coast was targeted for emergency relief only.",
        "That means almost two years after Katrina the region is still picking up the pieces and having a hard time paying for it.",
        "For more, we've got Jeffrey Buchanan, co-author of the study.",

        "Welcome.",
        "Great to be here.",

        "Well, now, we're in the rebuilding phase in the region.",
        "Most of the emergency response has been completed.",
        "So I think it's - for a fair public dialogue, we really need to talk about how much money is there to rebuild these Gulf Coast communities, not how much have we spent in emergency relief but how much is available to really rebuild the schools, rebuild the homes, make sure that medical facilities are available, infrastructure for transportation.",

        "And we just hope that we can put these numbers out there and have a real honest discussion going forward.",
        "So your study says that the portion of the budget allocated for public infrastructure repair would only cover an eighth of the infrastructure in Louisiana alone.",
        "Why do you think this is the case?",
        "Well, when you look at how the money has been spent, the main program for rebuilding public infrastructure, FEMA's public assistance program, a big chunk of that money that has been allocated by Congress is actually money that needs to do things like, you know, clear roads, sandbag low-lying areas, these kinds of things, and not so much of the money that's been left over to actually rebuild hard infrastructure to date.",
        "We found that only $3.6 billion is available, you know, based on a GAO reports by the gentleman who's actually following me in this interview, Stan Czerwinski.",
        "Basically we found that there is just not been a realistic discussion of what needs to be invested in our public infrastructure going forward in the Gulf Coast region.",
        "So should the government try to rebuild the Gulf Coast to its former self or even make it better?",
        "We think that the federal government has an obligation under international human rights law to really help the region rebuild in a way that assures all of the people displaced by the storm and by the failure of the federal-constructed levee system have the ability to come home if they wanted to.",
        "That means we have to make an initial investment.",
        "A really - a renewed effort to rebuild the region, and to look at new possible ways to get money into the region and to do these rebuilding projects.",
        "To date, there's been a laissez faire kind of policy within the administration that they send the check out.",
        "They say they've sent the big check.",
        "Even though the numbers that they use is a little bit false in effect that it's not all for rebuilding.",
        "But they say they sent the big check and that it's the local and state problem at this point, to do the rebuilding.",
        "These are institutions - city and state governments that have been really wrecked by the storm.",
        "Their tax based has been eviscerated.",
        "They're not really able to do the logistics to carry out these projects quickly.",
        "That's been our finding.",
        "So we believe that there needs to be a renewed partnership with the federal government.",
        "You know, using some of its muscle to really push these programs forth if they want these to actually happen and rebuild the region.",
        "So you mentioned one specific case of tax breaks and a million-dollar deal to build luxury condos next to the University of Alabama football stadium, which is four hours from the Gulf Coast.",
        "Now, that's a very specific, targeted issue.",

        "Well, we think that, really, the biggest issue moving forward will be public infrastructure investment.",
        "And the reason really - there's a lot of areas that haven't able to recover but then there's a lot of working class areas, you know, like the Ninth Ward, like (unintelligible).",
        "There's a number of communities across the Mississippi Gulf Coast that still need significant investment in their public infrastructures - things like schools, like - we're talking about poor hospitals with health care about being such an issue degrading after the storms, public safety.",
        "Even things just like police stations and firehouses in the region really need that solid federal investment and a commitment from the federal government to rebuild.",

        "So finally and briefly, if you have to make one wish and wish it upon the recovery of the Gulf Coast, what would it be?",
        "I would say for a renewed public works program, really focused on the families and the survivors of the storm and their communities.",
        "Looking to bring back displaced people to do the work, to get trained in the jobs to rebuild the public infrastructure, and really a federal policy that is focused on helping these families to come back, rebuild their communities and rebuild their lives.",

        "Well Madeleine, the fallout is enormous, especially when you factor in all of the economic ripple effects.",
        "Over the past week the Federal Aviation Administration's wiring inspections have forced American Airlines to ground, as you were saying, more than 3,000 flights.",
        "That's likely to cost the airline somewhere in the high tens of millions of dollars, and it goes far beyond the lost flight revenue.",
        "There's the 500-dollar vouchers that some travelers are receiving, credits for airport hotel rooms, transportation to and from those hotels, the extra overtime for American's employees.",
        "And then of course there's the lost good will of many of the 250,000 passengers affected by this week's cancellations, not to mention their lost dollars.",
        "Some estimate the cost to passengers exceeds that of the airlines by a factor of three or four.",
        "Think of all the canceled vacations and business meetings.",
        "And American Airlines, so it sounds at least from a PR prospective, will be feeling this for some time.",

        "So, you throw in the timing of the FAA's inspections, which many say are political cover for the agencies lax oversight in the past, and you've got some pretty angry people.",
