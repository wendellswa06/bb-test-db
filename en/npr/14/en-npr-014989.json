        "But the other piece, too, is there's a potential for a new group of people who are in poverty, and these are what I might call the working poor or even some middle-income households where, you know, there's a chunk of people or a segment of the population that, you know, they're living from paycheck to paycheck, and, you know, by the government standards, they're not in poverty but they just need this one, you know, shock to their income or to their livelihood.",
