        "It's not clear the Volcker Rule would have applied in this case, but critics are already using the incident to press for tighter restrictions on banks.",
        "Democratic Senator Carl Levin of Michigan said the losses at Chase are just the latest evidence that what banks call hedges are often risky bets that big banks have no business making.",
        "Dimon conceded that Chase's troubles would give bank critics new ammunition.",

        "The Supreme Court ruled today in a civil rights case Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg described as perhaps the most important of the term, an opportunity for the court to either uphold or strike down one of the landmark laws of the civil rights era, the Voting Rights Act.",
        "But in a decision that explicitly declined to address bigger issues, the high court issued a narrow ruling saying that a key provision of the Voting Rights Act was applied too broadly and made it easier for local governments in 16 states, mostly in the South, to opt out if they can show no pattern of racial discrimination for the past 10 years.",

        "Yes, absolutely.",
        "The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is often seen as one of the most effective, most transforming laws of the 20th century because for 100 years after the Civil War, it was illegal and unconstitutional to discriminate against anyone based on race in voting.",
        "Nonetheless, throughout the South, most blacks were not registered and did not vote in a whole lot of communities.",
        "States had turned over voting to county registrars.",

        "In 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, made clear that it was illegal to discriminate against anyone because of race in voting, and also put the South sort of on a type of parole that said any city or state, if you make any changes in your voting rolls, your election districts, anything that affects voting, you've got to clear it with the Justice Department in Washington.",

        "Anyway, today they basically backed away and said municipalities that have had a clean record for 10 years, haven't had any problems, can apply to bail out of the law, and therefore, they won't have to go through this pre-clearance provision.",
        "That's a small decision, it narrows the law, but it's not a big deal.",

        "And let me also ask, the case that they decided this on seemed to be, well, perfect for the people who wanted to overturn the Voting Rights Act, and that was a case brought against a - brought by a municipality, well even a sub-municipality, that didn't exist when the law was passed, didn't exist even 10 years ago, and they'd never had any record of racial discrimination, and so this seemed like the perfect opportunity for the court to say, look like this is too broadly applied and its time has passed.",
        "Well, perfect in one sense, Neal, perfect in the sense that you could ask why does the law apply to this little water district?",
        "They don't even register voters.",
        "But I didn't think it was perfect for arguing the whole law is unconstitutional because what does that little water district have to do with Georgia and Alabama writ large?",

        "And so I had gotten this precinct, this printout in the old dot-matrix printout style that had the names of people, and it was a predominantly African-American precinct, and I couldn't believe that no matter what year these people were born, their date of registering to vote was 1968, which was the first presidential election after the passing of the Voting Rights Act.",
        "And so I, being a - I was 20-something when I had this, it opened my eyes that I had not really honestly thought about whether - why didn't these people, who were predominantly African-American, no matter - I mean, they were in their 40s and 50s by the time 1968 rolled around, and they were just getting around to registering to vote.",
        "And I really did have this moment of realizing that that had to have been the effect of the Voting Rights Act, that somehow something changed that made them feel more comfortable, maybe as obviously as made it legal.",
        "I don't know exactly, but there's obviously, in my experience, an incidence of seeing so many people of different ages, and the only commonality was that they were African-American, and they did not bother to register to vote until 1968.",
        "Or were unable, David, to register.",
        "As you say, an awful lot of tricks were employed to prevent African-Americans from registering to vote.",
        "Yes, literacy tests, poll taxes, changing the place of registration, limiting the hours.",
        "That's why this law had this pre-clearance provision, because they couldn't even say exactly what cities and counties were doing to prevent African-Americans from voting, because there were all kinds of schemes and devices, and that's what this law was about."
