        "And I assume you're pleased with this decision.",
        "We are.",
        "We are very pleased.",
        "This was the first thing that we asked for in this case, was simply to let the district take advantage of this bailout process, and we always said, you know, the court need not reach the constitutional issue if you will let our client out.",
        "And with this document in your hand, I assume you can go to federal court and say can we please opt out.",
        "That will be the next step.",
        "We go back to the lower court, which ruled against us the first time, and say the Supreme Court said you're wrong about that.",
        "Now please let us out.",
        "And that should be pretty pro forma.",
        "They'll say Justice Roberts says it's okay, it's okay.",
        "I wonder, though, are you concerned that the court did not go further to address the constitutional issue and overturn Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act?",
        "Well, I take a little quibble with what I think David said a minute ago that this is not a big deal, because there are literally thousands of jurisdictions similar to our district that are covered, even though they either have no history of discrimination or, if they had a history, it's more than 10 years in the past, and so this opens the way for these jurisdictions to go into court one by one and narrow the scope of Section 5."

        "So you do see this as an issue that will affect many areas across the country.",
        "We do, Neal, and this is what Congress envisioned in 1982 when it put this bailout provision in place.",
        "And Congress basically said we expect - Congress expected by now a majority of jurisdictions to just fall away from Section 5 because already by 1982, they were starting to think that the statute had sort of run its course.",
        "And now that can happen.",
        "And as Chief Justice Roberts said in his majority opinion, these instances of blatant discrimination are now rare.",
        "They are rare, and very importantly, any jurisdiction that gets bailout has to go to a court of law in Washington, D.C., and put on evidence that they have a clean record.",
        "So you know, anyone who gets bailed out, it's not just on their own say-so, it's a court judgment that they show they have a clean record, and they are not one of the rare instances of continued discrimination.",

        "You know, we at LDF, we were a party in the case and actually argued the case on behalf of interveners who entered on the side of the United States, and we viewed this case really as an attempt to tear out the heart of the Voting Rights Act, and the plaintiffs have failed in that effort, and as we speak, Section 5 is protecting minority voters in covered jurisdictions from racial discrimination.",
        "Mr.",
        "Ward and his colleagues sought with all of their might to strip minorities of that very essential protection of minority voting rights, and we are today recognizing the Supreme Court left intact the core of the Voting Rights Act, which is Section 5.",
