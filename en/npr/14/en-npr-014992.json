        "Section 5 applies to all voting changes in covered jurisdictions that range from moving a polling place to changing voter registration requirements to redistricting plans.",
        "So Section 5 would reach any change that was in effect before one sought to make a change, and it would have to be submitted to the Department of Justice for pre-clearance or to a federal court, three-judge federal court in Washington, D.C.",
        "But it would not cover Michigan or Ohio.",

        "I don't think so.",
        "There's a Help America Vote Act that had some provisions on that, but I sort of forget.",
        "I know that was a law that was intended to help the states get better voting machines, but I don't know that there's anywhere you can sue - Ryan may know - under that act, but if you have the problem in Michigan or Ohio, what do you do if there's a shortage of voting machines in a particular precinct?",
        "I have no clue, and it's very disturbing that the same tricks, the same types of tricks, at least with the same results, similar results, can occur on voting day or even in a count.",
        "You certainly could bring a suit under a part of the Voting Rights Act, if you could have some evidence that, for example, only in the minority precincts was there a shortage of - if you could say that the problem was due to, or appeared to be due to, racial discrimination, then you can bring a suit under the Voting Rights Act, but unfortunately, that's sort of after the fact.",

        "You know, one thing that occurred to me about the opinion today is that Justice Roberts talks at great length about some of the progress that's been made in the covered jurisdictions, and Congress recognized that as well, when it determined whether it should reauthorize the Voting Rights Act in 2006, and it did, as Justice Roberts noted, recognize the considerable progress that's been made in these covered jurisdictions.",
        "But at the same time, Congress recognized that we hadn't yet reached the place where we could say that we had reached racial equality, and I think part of the progress that's been made in these covered jurisdictions is attributable to the way that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act has worked and that it succeeded in some areas.",
        "And we see this where African-Americans, in some states, reached parity in terms of their political representation and political participation in terms of their registration.",
        "But I think Congress' intuition was right, and the record reveals, the record being almost 17,000 pages, that we've not yet reached a place where Section 5 has outlived its usefulness.",
        "And that's why today's ruling is so significant because the core provision of the Voting Rights Act, that is Section 5, stays in force."
