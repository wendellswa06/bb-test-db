        "Well, I literally walked out of a meeting on that very subject five minutes ago, and the discussions have started in a very serious and bipartisan way by some people of good faith to try to find a resolution.",

        "We're going to try very hard to find a resolution in the next three weeks.",

        "The tribal sheikhs have been regaining power in al-Anbar, some of them with the backing of the American military.",

        "KELLY: The tribes really self-level themselves very, very well.",
        "And, you know, if I have any concern at all, it will be that these kind of attacks will continue because the sheikhs themselves, part of what they do and part of what was hit the other day is how they stay in contact with each other and to prevent problems breaking out is to have the kind of engagements that they were doing the other day when the suicide bomber went off."
