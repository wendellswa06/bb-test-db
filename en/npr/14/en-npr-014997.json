        "I guess I should apologize now.",
        "But Kerian Thalis (ph), an executive at HBO, who I'd worked with on \"\"The Corner\"\" in adapting my own narrative journalism, came to me with the book.",
        "They had already purchased it.",
        "And he said, take a look at this, see if there's anyone you know that would want to try to produce it.",
        "I read it in one night.",
        "By the time I - it was a plane flight out to L.A., actually.",
        "By the time I had breakfast with him in the morning, I knew I just wanted to make that book, as it was.",
        "And Evan, what story - obviously you're telling the story of these men, and what you experienced, but is there a bigger story, do you think, there?",
        "Well, actually it starts with a smaller story.",
        "When I first pitched it to HBO - what I said is, this is a road-trip movie.",
        "It's about these guys in this Humvee, and it's the ultimate road-trip through combat to Baghdad.",
        "So, that was the small story, which is how I - I worked from there outward.",
        "And to me, it's just the story of Americans at war.",
        "And I don't think the story was actually told adequately through the type of media coverage that we had at the time, because there were a lot of television organizations that were using cameras, and the reporters with all that equipment.",
        "And I was simply embedded with this unit with no gear, just a notebook and some recorders.",
        "And I got to spend a lot of intimate time with them throughout the race to Baghdad.",
        "Without a lot of the accoutrements and...",
        "None.",
        "Crew that gets in the way.",
        "He also did something which a lot of reporters couldn't do or wouldn't do, which is he gave up his phone.",
        "He refuse - he said, well, I'm with a magazine.",
        "I'm not going to file for some duration.",
        "And that allows you a degree of intimacy, you know, that you get to know these guys before you ever wrote a word.",
        "They forgot I was a reporter.",

        "I can't imagine why you would.",
        "There's a great scene, you're riding in the jeep at one point, and the driver goes off on one of his rants.",
        "He has many of them.",
        "And the camera looks at you, your character in the film, and we just look at your mouth, and you say, wow.",
        "Yes, and that was - by the way, that was great work by the actor Lee Tergesen playing that role.",
        "But yeah, that's the reporter.",
        "I mean, I was in - I met these guys, and I knew right away it was great material.",
        "I didn't know there was going to be a shooting war, but I knew this was a great unit, and this platoon was like a little family, and I was going to be there.",
        "As David's twist on it was - it a car trip and the sergeant was the dad, and his assistant was the mom, and the Marine next to me, Trombley, was the son, and I was the weird uncle.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "That was David's take on it.",
        "Dad, are we there yet?",
        "Are we there yet?",
        "I have to say that, that moment that you decided with the mouthed wow from the reporter who's getting great stuff.",
        "HBO, looking at the dailies later said, you need to put something in his mouth, I think you need to loop the word, wow, in there.",
        "I was like, no, he would never say it out loud.",
        "That would ruin it.",

        "It's a great moment.",
        "It's a real reporters' moment.",
        "There're others reporters' moments too, when, for example, at the beginning the, war obviously a lot of people worried about chemical weapons attacks, and you're trying to put on your MOP suit, the suit that protects you, and there's a warning, and the actor does - it's an Emmett Kelly routine.",
        "It's a clown routine.",
        "Yes, and I should say it's a great reporter's moment, because I feel, at least in my experience as a reporter, I'm always out-of-step with what's going on.",
        "And unlike the television guys who always look smooth, and they have the terrific backdrops, I'm always stumbling around trying to catch up and figure out what's happening.",
        "At that moment, we actually did have a gas-attack alert, and I was dipping tobacco at the time, like the troops do.",
        "And I just put in this big plug of tobacco in my mouth, then I had to put on my gas mask.",
        "I forgot to spit out the tobacco.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And then I had to run across hundreds of meters of hot desert, and there was a strap that was stuck on my suit.",
        "The suit was too small for me, so, it was letting in air and it was kind of a disaster, and we re-did that scene in the script.",
        "It's quite a funny sequence.",
        "So basically, the reporter, David Simon, is a comic relief, at least at some points.",
        "Well, he's also the only opportunity for some limited amount of exposition, if you think about it.",
        "Because the Marines all know each other.",
        "They know all their backstories.",
        "They've said everything to each other a 100 times.",
        "So, the only chance to explain any terminology, any Marine ideology, any of their technocracy is through the reporter.",
        "Nevertheless, there's not a lot of it.",
        "You don't make it easy on the viewer.",
        "Well, you know, I've found on this project, and on \"\"The Wire,\"\" as well, and on \"\"The Corner,\"\" television generally is a passive medium, and it explains everything, and so people slump back in their chairs.",
        "And I think actually it's a better viewing experience when you get people leaning forward in their chairs, paying attention.",
        "And so, I've found that the less exposition, the more you presume upon your viewers' intelligence, the better an experience it is for people.",
        "We're talking with David Simon and Evan Wright about \"\"Generation Kill,\"\" the new series that begins on HBO on July 13th and runs for seven weeks.",
        "If you were in Iraq, what stories do you think need to be told?",
        "Give us a call, 800-989-8255.",
        "Email us, talk@npr.org.",
        "And that clip that we played, David, just a moment ago from the scene, the first encounter the Marines have with Iraqi civilians, and you can see - maybe with hindsight - but you can see foreshadowings of what's to come.",
        "That's the reason that I'm glad HBO did this project was - it would've been worth doing just as an intimate road trip, as Evan says, and as a portrait of these young men at war.",
        "But the other thing I found fascinating about those first weeks into Baghdad is all of what was to come, the insurgency, our oblivious, you know, the fact that we didn't have a sense of the sectarian issues, and the tribal issues in Iraq..."

        "And all of this stuff starts showing up, so that by the time we finish the assault on Baghdad, and we end up in a cigarette factory in Saddam City, it's effectively the Green Zone.",
        "It really was remarkable how much Evan captured in this book, which is the very early weeks of the war, everything that was to come.",
        "And I think that makes the series relevant, even though it is depicting the first weeks of the war.",
        "And I should point out that this isn't something that David or Ed or I added to the scripts, like, let's make it relevant to what happened today.",
        "We'll throw in these scenes that foreshadow.",
        "This is exactly - it follows the reporting in the book.",
        "This is what the Marines encountered.",
        "Right.",
        "And I always thought it was remarkable that to the average 19-, 20-year-old Marine that I was with, it was obvious to them what the problems were going to be in Iraq, and at the time, this wasn't really being reported.",
        "Let's get some callers in on the conversation.",

        "Hi, how you doing?",
        "Very well, Victor.",
        "I was over with the 1st Battalion 27th Infantry, midway between Kirkuk and Tikrit, and we went over in, I guess, about nine months into the campaign.",
        "So, you know, we went over to kind of weed out some of the remaining insurgents, and also build out the local government, and the infrastructure, and you know, before we went, as we were preparing, we fully expected to find all sorts of NGOs and the UN on the ground to help with the infrastructure part while we were there - going to be there in a security role.",
        "But what we really found was - there was little to no NGO support, and it fell on, you know, our officers and our soldiers to actually establish the government institutions in the local provinces.",
        "Not what you expected or, I guess, were prepared for.",
        "NGOs, of course, nongovernmental organizations, and would that speak to some degree about the political underpinnings of the war, where the UN and the NGOs didn't feel comfortable going in?"
