        "That's true, but the miniseries actually does follow the arc of the book and the arcs of the main characters that I followed in the reporting.",
        "So I was very happy with what we were able to do with those seven hours.",
        "And I have to wonder, you call them characters, obviously they are real people, too.",
        "They're...",
        "And I wonder, how did they feel about how they were portrayed in the book, and have you shown any of them the finished film?",
        "Yeah, certainly, and the use of the word \"\"character,\"\" there's a character playing me in the miniseries.",
        "In the scripts, I couldn't write my own name, I had - we had to use a nickname, Scribe.",
        "Once you turn real reporting into a drama, they become characters, but they remain real people.",
        "I circulated some of the scripts with some of the principle guys early on, when we'd first completed them, a couple of years ago.",
        "And since then David and Ed brought in Eric Kocher, who was a sergeant in the Marine Corps, as a technical advisor, who had a very important role during the shooting in Africa.",
        "He had been a character, a person written about - that I wrote about in my book, and we've also brought in some of the Marines from the unit during some of the post-production sessions, where they provided radio dialogue, and also they got to see the show.",
        "But the scariest moment for me in this whole process, almost scariest since the war, is when we had a small screening for several of the men in the unit, where they got to see a completed show.",
        "And you know, their reactions - it's a complicated thing for them, because this is - I was present for many of the, you know, intimate things in their live - their working lives, when they were in a war, shooting people and taking fire.",
        "But I think the reaction was pretty favorable.",
        "At least no one took a swing at me during that screening, so, to me, that was a win.",
        "Nobody threw anything, that's what we call a triumph on this show.",
        "And David kept pointing to me, saying if anybody wants to take a swing...",
        "If you don't like it, over there..."

        "As far as - I was in Afghanistan, I don't know anything about Iraq, but while in Afghanistan, I was in a parachute rigger, and we - what we did to kind of relax after we'd go out and do everything we had to do was we would hook a bunch of tack tables together with ratchet straps.",

        "I should point out that I think you'll probably enjoy the series, because one of the things I encountered in Iraq was a lot of humor, and that is maintained in the series, and I think the Marines really responded to that.",
        "A lot of it's dark, gallows humor.",
