        "We were still taking sporadic fire.",
        "It was actually the Motor T, the transport guys, that brought a truck into this and pulled our Humvee out, and that really changed the attitude of the Marines in my vehicle towards the transport guys.",
        "Yeah, there's a strict hierarchy of - everyone else is looked down upon, in a certain pecking order.",
        "And there's women in those transport units, and they're put into harm's way in combat, and people don't realize that.",
        "Legally, women aren't in combat units, but the transport units are in combat zones, and there's armed women on heavy weapons on a lot of those trucks going into harm's way.",
        "Told some of their stories last week in a - about a film called \"\"Team \"\" - about lioness - a group called Team Lioness that was in Iraq.",

        "There's just one interpreter, of course, and later, we find out he's not telling the entire truth.",
        "But nevertheless, interrogation, trying to find out stuff along the way, this is a really hard part of it.",
        "Well, it was especially hard during the invasion, because our translator that the Marine battalion depended on - the Marine battalion that was at the vanguard of the invasion, they had this one interpreter who was a 19-year-old Kuwaiti who we didn't - we never really understood what his qualifications were.",
        "He was an interesting character, and the actor portraying him in the series portrays him accurately.",
        "He was kind of sketchy.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "So it was very difficult to find out what was happening and what he was telling us.",

        "Now, this sounded good initially, but this - he continued to say this, you know, even after there were bleeding civilians nearby, their families had been decimated by, you know, a bad airstrike or whatever.",
        "And so, we began - doubts began to grow about him.",
        "And then in Baghdad in the meetings with the imams there to set up some sort of American control of the neighborhoods, we had no clue what was going on with him.",

        "And I think both David and Ed were very sensitive to the fact that we're dramatizing a story of real people in a time of real war when one-third of the guys in the platoon that I wrote about in the book, that are portrayed in the miniseries, are still serving in the Marine Corps, and many of them are over in Iraq now.",
        "So, it's a very sensitive issue, and we hope that this show will connect the American public in a new and different way to the experiences of these troops that are still over there fighting for them."
