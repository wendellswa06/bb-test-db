        "Well, I think it is a blow, in part because Tom DeLay was so effective.",
        "His nickname the \"\"Hammer\"\" is really about his ability to get people to vote with the president and to get the president's legislation through the House.",
        "Just last week it was Tom DeLay who was making the argument in the House that the Bush administration's plan for spending, etc., you know, is something that the House would have to support even as they've had a number of people who wanted to rebel against the White House increase in the deficit and increase in spending plans for New Orleans and the whole Gulf Coast region.",

        "So how is public support here for the war holding up and how is that affecting the president?",
        "Not well, Madeleine.",
        "I think what you see is that now it's consistent--over half the American people think it's time to bring the troops home, to pull out of Iraq, which is exactly the opposite of what the president's been saying; in fact, the opposite of what he said last weekend when you had anti-war protesters--Cindy Sheehan and the like--in Washington.",
        "So it's kind of a direct contradiction to the president, and I think it adds to the notion there's a build-up of public sentiment opposed to him.",
        "But not everyone thinks the changes brought by Prop 47 have been entirely positive.",
        "San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr says he does support clearing past felonies for people who have turned their lives around, but he says the new lower threshold for many property crimes could explain a spike in offenses since the measure passed.",

        "Tell us a little bit more about that.",
        "Their idea was that they would murder a law enforcement official, local police officer of some kind or other and that this kind of event would bring hundreds and hundreds of police officials from around the country to attend the funeral.",
        "They then allegedly intended to use improvised explosive devices and possibly missiles to attack either the funeral procession or the funeral itself.",
        "It's just an amazing thing to contemplate, because it might well have been that they actually physically attacked a funeral that was attended by hundreds and hundreds of armed men and women.",
        "It could've been a real battle of Armageddon.",
        "You had noted that this is but one of a large and fast growing number of similar groups around the country.",

        "Notably, the anti-immigration movement where we've seen the numbers of minutemen-type groups proliferate by about 80 percent.",
        "So, all told, we're looking at a really explosive growth in the radical right in general.",
        "Beyond immigration, what's driving this?",
        "What accounts for that?",
        "Well, I think there are a number of things.",
        "The changing demographics of the country are extremely important, the idea that whites will lose their majority in the year 2050.",
        "Additionally, I think the economy has been very important as it gets worse and worse, at least for those people who are unemployed.",
        "There is simply more anger and frustration out there in the country and people are looking for explanations and a certain portion of them settle on these kinds of explanations.",
        "The last thing I would say is that there has been really a, I think, kind of a vital role played by ostensibly mainstream politicians and certain commentators - in particular, commentators on cable news television shows.",
        "These people have in many instances helped to push into the mainstream absolutely groundless conspiracy theories and other ideas from the radical right.",
        "You know, these are ideas that I think are wholly outside of the mainstream, or certainly ought to be, simply because they have no basis in reality.",
        "But the net effect of all of this is that people are very frightened out there.",
        "There are a number of people that the broad population views as leaders who are telling them things that are not true but are very scary."
