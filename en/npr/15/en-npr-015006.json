        "But, says George Runner, before term limits, it used to happen as the result of an untimely tragedy.",
        "In the past, what would happen is a person would run, they'd get elected, and then often, you know, there might be a death of that spouse while they're in the office, and it would be very typical for the spouse then to run for that seat and get elected.",
        "We've got lots of examples of that.",
        "So, I guess in one sense, you get death by term limits, so it's really a natural extension of that.",

        "The creators of term limits were also supporters of family values, but this isn't necessarily the version of family values they were thinking of in the context of term limits.",
        "Pitney says the phenomenon of family succession was not part of the equation when California voters approved term limits in 1990.",
        "If you're really intent on injecting new blood into the system, it really runs counter to the spirit of term limits.",
        "I think people were looking to reach outside the legislative family, so to speak, but instead, it is a case where term limits are all in the family."
