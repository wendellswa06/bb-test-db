        "Wow.",
        "Now, some of that's because we have more older workers, and they are more likely to be on disability.",

        "We're hearing it in our mosques.",
        "I can tell you that in my mosque in West Virginia, I heard it every Friday from these sermons that would be spoken by PhD graduate students, by engineering professors, folks who were getting all of the advantages of our open society and yet, on Thursday night downloading from Saudi websites sermons that basically said, don't imitate the path, the disbelievers, meaning the West.",
        "And this is exactly that slippery slope that ends up with something like this Times Square bomb attack - attempt.",
        "And more about the wife here in just a moment, but you said that it's important that we provide, well, non-violent ways for them to - there are a million ways to express protest in this country.",
        "I know.",
        "And I - the other part of my piece also said that I felt like our inner side, our Muslim community, we are not educating and empowering our youth to take advantage of those non-violent ways.",
        "I honestly believe that if we turn the page back on history and look back at the Civil Rights Movement, you know, this was the same moment that African-American leaders faced when they to try to encourage their youths to civil rights protests that were peaceful, instead of protests for radicalization and the bombing of buildings.",
        "I mean, this is exactly where we're at in our Muslim communities.",
        "And what we do too often, I believe, is allow people like this Anwar al-Awlaki to roam freely through our mosques and go uncensored when he preaches things as he has done over a decade in America when he was here.",
        "And unfortunately, we are not also filtering, for our young kids, their messages as they're getting them through the Internet now.",
        "And it leads to what you described as a bifurcated life illustrated by this social networking site and what this young woman posted."
