        "He made a special point of talking about jihad and young Muslims going to America to fight jihad and, you know, being found fighting jihad some place else and all, and how that clearly goes against the Muslims who are living here in America, who believe in, you know, tolerance, and living with other religions and living peacefully.",
        "And so he was sort of warning and all that stuff, warning all the other Muslims who were congregated and all that stuff.",
        "And that is kind of the environment that my kids go to to the mosque, and all that stuff.",
        "And I think that, you know, if they were preaching otherwise, if they were saying that, you know, you should fight for your - for Islam or jihad and, you know, what is good and all that stuff, what you should be involved in, we wouldn't be taking our kids there.",
        "So there's maybe a choice that the parents make, also, and all that stuff, or we can probably make it now because my kids are younger.",
        "And, you know, if they were older, then I guess things would be more up in the air and all that stuff, and they'd have to make up their mind like this young boy did and all that stuff.",
        "So...",
        "Asra?",
        "I think that the point that Sabia is making is a really good one, which is, you know, just like we want to keep our kids from drugs, right?",

        "And what we have, unfortunately, is both covertly and overtly messaging inside the community that sanctions those kind of interpretations.",
        "There is, just like all religions, a possibility for peaceful interpretation of Islam, and that's what we need to have prevail inside of our mosques.",
