        "What was once a giant black T-shirt has been painted with a bleaching agent giving it various hues of purple and gray.",
        "It's been shaped into a dress, and in some areas the material has been shredded by hand, creating a webbed effect.",
        "It kind of accentuates the shoulder and you see some of the skin through the shredding.",
        "I think shoulders are very sexy.",
        "And the way that the shredding hangs I think is really unusual.",

        "Do you mind?",
        "Yeah.",
        "They're just so much like something you really want to touch, it's so - oh, it's soft, which is exactly what you think it would be and the webbing is just incredible.",
        "I mean, it really feels gauzy almost.",
        "How delicate are these pieces?",
        "I mean, I look at something like this and think I would love to wear this and I'd be terrified that within two seconds I would find a way, because I wear things hard, to completely destroy it.",
        "You know, I do live in the pieces so I just - I know how fragile they are.",
        "They get caught on things, the holes get bigger, but I appreciate that about the pieces.",
        "I think, you know, it's life's check(ph) texture in a way coming in to shift the piece and make it your own."

        "May I ask what these pieces retail for?",
        "This piece, I believe 650, certainly not an inexpensive T-shirt.",
        "But I think when you look at it and touch it and wear it, you know and you can feel the handwork that's gone into it.",
        "And I think that's something that's really missing in clothing, is that hand touch.",
        "You have a sense of the person that created it.",

        "I'm always kind of massaging the pieces and pulling on them, and they're always changing.",
        "You feel like they are these things that exist that are like art.",
        "I just want to play with them and touch them all the time.",
        "There's another dimension to her creations - their criminal history.",
        "Remember, these pieces started off as T-shirts worn by inmates at L.A.'s jails.",
        "Raquel Allegra says initially she wasn't quite sure about the karma of it all, using T-shirts that had been worn by people who had broken the law.",
        "But then, she had a change of heart.",
        "Spending hours and hours sorting through, you know, a thousand pounds at a time of T-shirts, it was really a meditative experience.",

        "Because during many of the most crucial early stages, embryos are inside a woman's womb.",
        "And scientists aren't supposed to study them in their labs.",
        "And so we came up with a model of human embryos that is developed outside of the womb and is not the product of sperm and eggs, but the product of human embryonic stem cells that self-organize into complicated structures.",
        "Brivanlou and his colleagues put human embryonic stem cells into dishes in their lab and use chemical signals to coax them into organizing themselves into three-dimensional hollow balls that resemble early embryos.",
        "And in the journal Nature Cell Biology, they report these embryoids then took a crucial next step.",
        "They did what's called breaking the symmetry of that sphere.",
        "This process of symmetry-breaking is a major Holy Grail of developmental biology.",
        "Because that's what starts the process of separating our heads from our bottoms, our right sides from our left, our fronts from our back to eventually create an entire human being.",
        "Life is a continuation of symmetry-breaking events.",
        "And Brivanlou says finally being able to recreate and now begin to study that first symmetry-breaking moment is both thrilling and humbling.",
        "I really feel like I'm looking at one of the most mysterious aspects of our own existence, which happens in the place called the womb, that otherwise would have never had access to it.",
        "And every day that I come to my lab and I look down at the microscope, I know that my eyes are going to see something that no other human beings have seen before."

        "He really believed that the United States could be governed with civility and with compassion.",
        "And he worked very hard to build consensus every day.",
        "He thought the policies would be more effective and last longer if they weren't enacted with 51 percent of the vote.",
        "And, you know, he worked very hard over a long period of time to, you know, to achieve those types of consensuses.",
        "Can I jump in here to say that I only was able to give a couple of examples in our introduction, but there are many.",
        "But in this current moment of deep partisanship and sort of deep polarization, I mean, you've just described how important it was to the senator to work toward policy solutions, towards solutions that everybody could buy into.",
        "Do you happen to know why he felt so strongly about this?",
        "I think, you know, he had seen many policies over the course of his life, you know, fall apart.",
        "And many of the things that he was focused on, you know, were international policies or difficult national policies that really - really required consensus.",
        "He did a lot of things that people didn't think were possible.",
        "And part of the reason he was able to do that was he was very good at building consensus.",

        "And sometimes in the day-to-day back and forth of politics, you know, we lose sight of that.",
        "But he really believes that the American people had unlimited capacity, you know, to do good in the world and to make this a great place.",
        "And he never lost that confidence."
