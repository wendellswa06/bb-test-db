        "The asteroid belt lies between Mars and Jupiter.",
        "For a long time, astronomers thought it was left over from the primordial cloud of dust and rock that went into making our planets.",
        "So, I think, originally, we thought of the asteroid belt as something that was there and formed in place, that the asteroids formed where we see them today.",
        "Francesca DeMeo is at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.",
        "That simple view of the belt was based on observations of just a few asteroids in the 1980s.",
        "Astronomers have seen a lot more asteroids since.",
        "There's been some really large surveys over the past decade or so that have, you know, expanded our understanding from a couple thousand asteroids to hundreds of thousands of asteroids.",
        "And when DeMeo and her coauthor Benoit Carry looked at all these new asteroids, they found something surprising.",
        "Many of the rocks looked like they'd come from somewhere outside the asteroid belt.",
        "What we see today in the asteroid belt is sort of this melting pot of asteroids that formed in all different locations throughout the solar system, and are now sitting in the asteroid belt today, sort of leaving us with the clues of what happened since that time."

        "But it also can cause destruction, where if you have too many asteroids raining when life has already formed, then, you know, then it's a destructive force.",
