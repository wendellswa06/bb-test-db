        "One of my pet peeves and characterized in the Manhattan real-estate market is this whole concept that's it an island and that it's, you know like Washington, D.C., insulated from reality, and that's simply not the case.",

        "Florida?",
        "That's true.",
        "The situation especially in Manhattan is still isn't anywhere near as bad as places that we're seeing a lot of speculation in the housing market.",
        "Next to Manhattan, some of the more stable markets have been places like Seattle, Philadelphia, and Charlotte, North Carolina.",
        "Those have been top performers in an otherwise weak marketplace.",
        "Jonathan Miller points out while those markets are showing some softening now, other places are suffering a lot more.",
        "In markets where you had rampant speculation - like south Florida, Southern California, Phoenix, Las Vegas - that's where you are seeing the hardest correction.",
        "Markets like the New York market - well, specifically Manhattan - probably won't see the volatility in price that you're seeing in other markets, but that doesn't mean that you won't see price declines.",
        "On the other hand, new construction apartments have continued to sell in New York at record high prices.",
        "So, Bob, any sign that the overall market will improve anytime soon?",
        "Not really.",
        "Miller thinks it could be another two or three years, maybe, before the credit market loosens up.",

        "He didn't go there.",
        "He was defending this move and insisting the United States is still committed to the counterterror effort even if the troops go away.",
