        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I hate to say it: There's a little something chalky about it.",
        "Yes, and I think everybody would say the same thing: The original Sweethearts were a bit chalky.",
        "Some people really like eating chalky, but the idea is that the new flavors and textures are much more candy-like, and you can enjoy them more because they taste a little better.",

        "So, it's much more of a two-way dialogue, and that really enables consumers to say, hey, here's what I want, and for companies to be really responsive in meeting those consumer needs.",
        "Of course, the real test is whether the new flavors hold up to today's discerning palates.",
        "Fourteen-year-old Anthony Lewis was disappointed when he heard Sweethearts changed their recipe, but then he tried a new one.",
        "These taste more flavorful than the other ones.",
        "They, like, have a distinct orange taste, 'cause this one is orange.",
        "You think it's a good idea?",

        "Do they support a cease-fire?",
        "I do believe they support a cease-fire.",
        "But I think they would want one but would also like a siege.",
        "Most Palestinians have been complaining about the blockade and the seize over Gaza for years now and it's very clear at the moment that the Egyptian ideas of an unconditional cease-fire are unacceptable."
