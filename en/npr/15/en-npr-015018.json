        "...on the I-10 headed out of the city.",
        "And that's just a sad sight to see.",
        "But the thing that I've been thinking about in terms of where the city stands, and where the hustle is, where the bustle is, and where the quiet is.",
        "I've come to one thought and it happened to me this morning.",
        "So it was in good time for the program.",
        "And that is that as New Orleanians, I think that people here have to learn not to be afraid of the dark.",
        "And when you drive the streets at night, particularly on the highway because the I-10 just cuts right through New Orleans, going east to west or west to east, whichever you like.",
        "And it can be a very emotionally draining experience when you look to your right and you see lit areas, lit neighborhoods.",
        "You see streetlights and you see cars.",
        "And then you look over these vast swaths of land where people use to be, all your neighbors use to be and your friends.",
        "And it's absolutely dark.",
        "And that is a shocking feeling when you first experience it.",
        "And it is something that haunts you in many ways.",
        "But I think that over the months, what we're learning is how not to be afraid of this darkness.",
        "And how to feel optimistic that there will be light again in these areas, and our neighbors will be back.",
        "We're asking Gwen to help us out in my ignorance of local affairs, by asking some questions during the program.",
        "Oh, thank you all for coming down.",
        "Medical infrastructure in New Orleans after Katrina hit was pretty slim.",

        "I think one of the big lessons we've learned is that healthcare is a team sport.",
        "And the team is not just - certainly the patient and the physician, but it's also public-private partnerships.",
        "And it also includes social services agencies.",
        "And I think last year we didn't pay enough attention to that.",
        "And we were thinking about evacuating and then restoring services afterwards.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "We've come together in a network now, through necessity, frankly, after the storm to help each other and prop each other up.",
        "And those relationships, I think, will carry us far, hopefully, without the need for another hurricane, but in other ways, because we have created a new framework for healthcare in the city, as a result of that tragedy.",
        "And that will help us in the coming year, as we think about how to get people out of the city, who maybe don't have access to their own transportation.",
        "And how we set up services if there is some sort of event immediately afterwards.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "You say it's a team sport.",
        "It is also a competitive sport.",
        "All the members of the team are not always on the same team.",
        "Well, that's been a big trick, no doubt.",
        "And, I think, historically we've thought about competing on venues that maybe aren't really the most productive for patients.",
        "Competing for things like service and quality, and patient centeredness.",
        "And that's really what we're going after now.",
        "And not everybody wants the same thing from a health system; we're learning that as well.",

        "May I ask a quick question, actually?",

        "We've started in October with - or in September, sorry, with sort of tents and card tables, and ice chests for vaccines.",
        "We've evolved into having buildings.",
        "Now we have hospitals actually open in Orleans Parish and also in the ring of suburbs around.",
        "So there is care available for trauma and for chronic care and for acute care.",
        "It's very backlogged.",
        "And the reason that that system, that you read quite often, is backlogged in the hospital setting and the emergency room is really kind of multiple things.",
        "0ne is that we don't have a very strong primary care infrastructure yet.",
        "We've lost what was our mostly hospital-based systems.",
        "They were wiped out.",
        "And we've been recreating that in neighborhoods to be more patient-centric.",
        "But that's still not there.",
        "So people are - if you have heart failure, you might land in the emergency room instead of your doctor's office to get treated.",
        "That's one problem.",
        "We have had a big surge in mental health issues in the state, in the city in particular.",
        "And so we have people who are having now post-traumatic stress disorder depression, exacerbations of chronic psychiatric diseases and behavioral health problems, like drinking, et cetera.",
        "So that's clogging the system.",
        "And then, you know, we lost nursing homes and aftercare places.",
        "So once you get in the hospital, finding a place for you to get discharged has been challenging.",
        "I mean, many of these people are homeless.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Do you have any advice for people, for instance, in the upcoming hurricane season of what to do with your medical history; what to do with your materials; what to do with your prescriptions?",

        "So, one of the key pieces we've been working in the city in particular, since the storm, is having electronic health records.",
        "For folks who have evacuated and needed to know their banking records, most of them just went online and got them.",
        "It wasn't this big challenge.",
        "Unfortunately, we didn't have that great of a structure for that, as in most places in the country.",
        "What - we have evolved, even in the last few months, is that there's been a system set up by the city to get patients to put their medical record information, their chronic diseases or meds, on a little thumb drive.",
        "And so some folks have that.",
        "Other health systems have been very aggressive about backing up their servers, so there are some big systems that already have electronic records.",
        "And then the safety net clinics that have cropped up in the neighborhoods, as part of that federated network, we have all agreed that we're using electronic health records.",
        "We're rolling them out as fast as we can.",
        "We hope to have, in those neighborhood clinics, electronic health records by July.",
        "So anyone receiving care there will have that as a backup mechanism for people.",
        "We didn't know whether there was enough stuff in the universe to slow it to the point that it would come to a halt and perhaps someday collapse.",
        "Let's see if we can get a caller on the line.",

        "And the hurricane came and went and the aftermath was terrific, it was horrible.",
        "And after three or four years, it seems as if we went back to the same routine, of waiting until the storm threatened or until after to try to get the supplies.",
        "I wonder if any of the panelists can speak to what the plans are in the Gulf area, to keep that awareness up so that, you know, the citizens don't lapse back into that pattern of waiting until the last minute.",
        "You know, keeping hurricane preparedness in mind before it becomes an issue.",
        "Gwen, it seems, at least this year in New Orleans, that may not be so much of a problem.",
        "A lot of people I talk to say, first cloudy day in June, I'm out of here.",
        "You're absolutely right…",

        "I think the caller's question is absolutely on target in the sense that it is very easy for - you know, it's very easy for people to be lulled back into a sense of complacency.",
        "But I think that this event has changed New Orleans to such a degree and has displaced so many people, and even if your house was saved through some miracle, even if you're still living in the same place where you lived in July of last year, you know, it will be some time before you will be able to fall back into a sense of complacency simply because when you walk out your door, it surrounds you.",
        "This rebuilding process will take years upon years upon years to complete.",

        "We have pre-Katrina, post-Katrina, we have a whole new lexicon.",
        "That's part of it, but truly, that will probably wane.",
        "From the health systems standpoint, we know certainly that what we have to do is change regulations and policies to ensure that people are safe.",
        "And we've been working on that very aggressively for the last nine months at the state and federal and local level, to ensure that we have proper backup mechanisms, generators, et cetera, proper policies in place.",
        "And not just one policy, but multiple backups, that's certainly where you get into trouble in situations, so that the plan, ultimately, is going to be able to fall in place."
