        "In the meantime, we decided that we wanted to return to New Orleans to be a part of the recovery.",
        "And so to do that meant looking for residential facilities as well as classroom facilities.",
        "We finally settled on the Hilton Hotel because it had enough living space for faculty, staff, students and administration.",
        "I actually live in the Hilton Hotel with them.",
        "And it provided the classroom spaces that we need for everything except for science labs, libraries, some services like healthcare.",

        "Well, that's true.",
        "When it comes to fundraising and student enrollment, we compete.",
        "We know that.",
        "We're friends, we roll up our sleeves and we say that each of us will raise funds.",

        "And the same is true by our faculty as well.",
        "So, we're trying to find ways to retain our students and our faculty, so that they are not plucked off because of the competitive offers that they have by some other universities.",

        "One thing that I wanted to mention and hope that you might be able to mention as well, Dr. Hughes, is - let's talk about the campus itself, the Dillard University campus, which is one of the most beautiful in the region.",
        "It is - well, in its heyday, which was August 28th of last year…",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "…it was just one of the most beautiful universities.",
        "This beautiful, green campus with - you know, with what appeared to be more than a dozen white mansions…",
        "Yes, yes.",
        "…I mean, just beautifully placed and positioned, just like Easter eggs on a beautiful lawn.",
        "Tell us a little bit more about it.",
        "That is so very, just instructive about what that campus is like.",
        "I was actually in California, as university president, as you may know, until June 30th, almost, of last year.",
        "And I had been here to interview.",
        "One of the attractions was the beauty of the campus.",
        "The other, of course, was the quality of the student body and the quality of the faculty and staff, as well.",
        "But the beautiful, pristine white buildings and the lovely, expansive greenery, along with those old, old oak trees…",
        "Yes, the live oaks.",
        "Yes, the live oaks, describe what Dillard was.",
        "And when I returned and saw the level of the water and everything on the ground was brown, I could hardly believe it.",
        "However, I did make a decision and a promise to our students - who, as you know, were scattered across the country for the first semester -that if they returned to New Orleans, knowing that they could not go back to the site until probably fall, that we would make a point of preparing the campus so that they could return to march through the Avenue of the Oaks for commencement.",
        "And so the very first time, when they return to the campus will be on June 30th.",
        "That will be the date for baccalaureate.",
        "And the massive celebration will be on July 1st, when all of those seniors and their many, many friends and parents converge on the campus to watch the seniors march through the oaks.",
        "And I get chills when I think about it because it is such a beautiful bonding experience that is so meaningful for that student body.",
        "And so they will have all of the green sod that you're accustomed to.",
        "I think we're rolling it out as we speak.",
        "The exterior of the buildings has been painted.",
        "So the white, pristine buildings are returning back on the outside.",
        "The inside, of course, is under reconstruction or recovery.",
        "We do intend to begin classes later this year than usual, hoping to escape the hurricane season.",
        "So we have delayed our opening until September 25th.",
        "And with the right luck, I will not have to re-evacuate the third time."

        "And that was for Dennis.",
        "Little did I realize that it was a practice for Katrina.",
        "But each time, we were very, very successful in getting all of our students off campus and serving notice to faculty, staff and administrators, that they too must leave - and take with them their personal research and belongings - and that we would close down.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So we closed down each time.",
        "We actually closed on the 27th, more than 48 hours ahead.",
        "We placed students on buses that we had commissioned and I waved goodbye to every one of them and closed the campus down at about six o'clock.",

        "I was actually chairman of the Department of Pediatrics here and my background is in looking after kids with cancer.",
        "And I can't tell you - and, Dr. Desalvo - how impressed I was by the fact that all the medical systems got together, in Baton Rouge, to help kids in very difficult situations, life-threatening situations.",
        "Every time someone asks a question about the system, I ask this question: Is it different than the current system?",
        "In other words, are you asking about a problem that doesn't exist now?",
        "And you know, Baton Rouge pulled up and helped.",
        "And all of the competition that we go through, as you well know, was put aside.",
        "And I thought that was absolutely fantastic.",
        "And the city is slowly coming back now, providing the very best care we can, for our kids.",
