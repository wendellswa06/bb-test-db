        "No, no, that's fine.",
        "It was that the government couldn't ensure that we had continuity of care.",
        "So the sickest of the sickest kids during this whole sort of event - and - but I just wanted to emphasize the fact that once politics were put aside, economics were put aside, the patient was the number one person to be looked after; and I thought that was fantastic.",
        "Dr. Desalvo?",
        "Thanks for highlighting some of the positive stuff that happened, because it is true and it really does continue, that idea of putting patients first.",
        "We actually had a little - a coalition of business community, hospital association, commercial insurers and physicians, that had a little group for a while called Patients First.",
        "And it was a suggestion, actually, of the hospital association - that's what we call it - and I almost fell off my chair.",
        "But it was so nice because that's exactly what you say.",
        "They've been putting patients first in a way that we haven't thought to do before.",
        "As far as being able to ensure continuity, it's been a huge challenge and that, again, goes back to why we want to make sure that we're using technology as a solution for that.",
        "Because the technology's available to allow for that care to be seamless, if patients have their medical records like that.",
        "Let me ask you both, Dr. Desalvo and also Marvalene Hughes.",
        "It's interesting what Lynn said, the failures of government - after the failures of government a year ago, are you depending on them this time around or are you going to be self-sufficient?",
        "Marvalene Hughes.",
        "Well, we have a level of self-sufficiency for our campus, in that I can determine when the evacuation occurs; I don't have to wait for the orders from the government to do that.",
        "And I will continue to make decisions that will probably cause me to be very cautious, because I value life too much to take any of those risks.",
        "So once I have been able to secure the safety of our students, faculty, and staff, then the dependency that I have on the city and the government relate to utilities, for example, because we are in one of those dark communities still -that Lynn is talking about - and we expect that the city will have prepared for our return in September.",
        "We also are dependent on that area for business and entertainment, and we are hoping that very soon entertainment and business will return to the community.",
        "I view us as being the anchor tenants in that area, and it's important that we are returning, that's where the life is, and others will be attracted as soon as we return there.",
        "Dr.",
        "Desalvo, you going to depend on government?",
        "Well, you know, honestly we have to be able to depend on the government for certain areas.",
        "One of the lessons we learned last year was how valuable the military, for example, is in a healthcare environment like that."

        "They were helpful in a number of ways.",
        "For example, they'd bring with them entire hospitals, if you are able to ask and know what to ask for.",
        "And so they sort of open a suitcase and out pops anything from a dental chair to, you know, sort of Band Aids, which was really critical for us.",
        "We were able to get simple supplies, but not really able to have the equipment and the refrigeration and all those other pieces we needed.",
        "They were also really critical in partnering with the local healthcare community to help with the evacuation.",
        "So in those early weeks, especially in September, when we didn't have strong medical control or 911 services or even ways to transport folks, they were able to mobilize their efforts.",

        "We appreciate it.",

        "Marvalene Hughes, I'm sorry.",
        "I probably should add that our governmental dependency began after we returned and started our reconstruction.",
        "As you were talking, I was thinking about the challenges that we have, for example, in getting the products that we need for reconstruction and the challenges that we have in working with FEMA.",
        "FEMA is going to ultimately become very, very important in the final outcome for our preparedness, because after the insurance policies and our resources are depleted, then that's when FEMA is supposed to kick in.",
        "And I think all of us know that there have been some major, major challenges there.",

        "And before Katrina, Pampy's was one of those.",
