        "The reason I'm going is not so much that I'm sure the Ninth Ward should be rebuilt, but because I just love the culture and love the people I worked with when I was there on Spring Break.",
        "I was wondering what you - what all of you -what your opinion is on whether or not the Ninth Ward should be rebuilt.",
        "Because, on the one hand, people lived there, and if it's not rebuilt they won't have a place to live; but on the other hand, if it's not rebuilt - or, excuse me, if it is rebuilt, when another hurricane comes through it could happen all over again.",
        "It's also going -- looks like New Orleans is going to be a smaller city than it used to be.",
        "But none of you people are in positions of policy.",
        "It's not your decision as to whether it gets rebuilt or not, but I'm interested.",

        "I haven't gone, because I had enough to confront myself.",
        "But, at the same time, I really empathize with the perspective that these are homes for people.",
        "And when I talk with people who have been displaced, they love New Orleans, they want to come back, they want to get their homes restored.",
        "Many of my faculty lost their homes, and many of the students did, as well.",
        "So it's very difficult.",
        "I mean, I think people who want to come back should be given the opportunity to come back, whether it's in the Ninth Ward or wherever it is.",
        "Dr.",
        "Desalvo, what do you think?",
        "Well, clearly New Orleans needs to exist; we're part of the economic viability of the country.",
        "There's no doubt about that.",
        "The size of the city and the footprint are something that engineers and policy makers and urban planners need to decide.",
        "The infrastructure needed to support those people from the healthcare standpoint is the challenge for us in the community - healthcare community.",
        "So the ways that we've tried to deal with this sort of fluctuating population base is not to have anchored clinics, but then to use mobile units to reach out to those neighborhoods that pop up overnight.",
        "So when they turn on the water in the Ninth Ward and all of a sudden a couple of thousand people come to live in a trailer, there's no health system there for them.",
        "So we're trying to be creative about how we reach out to them."

        "We need some things to be proud of in our city, and we need to be reminded to laugh and to experience the joy of our childhood.",
        "And the experiences that we offer at the zoo and aquarium, we believe they provide a refuge for our residents, and you can lose yourself in nature and spend quality-time with your friends and family.",
        "And also, for our tourism industry, 35 percent of our city's revenue comes from tourism in New Orleans.",
        "We know that we need to diversify our economy, but the rebuilding of tourism and the 80,000 jobs that it provided is critical to the future of our city, now and in the future.",
        "So opening this anchor attraction, the zoo opened on Thanksgiving weekend; probably not a good business decision for the Audubon Nature Institute, but it was the right thing for the community.",
        "We're going to open this aquarium tomorrow, and we believe that people from throughout Louisiana, the rest of the country, and New Orleans, will come and support New Orleans and the aquarium.",

        "There are some efforts that are already underway, which is to do some loan relief to allow for some loan repayment, et cetera.",
        "But really, those pieces are a bit stuck with the policymakers right now, quite frankly; and so we have a wish list from the healthcare community, but we need some action on that.",
        "I'd say also, that two or three years from now, what our dream is in rebuilding the health sector, is that we're going to have a place that they're going to be beating down the door to get in, frankly.",
