        "Well, from a tourism perspective, housing is a critical issue for us.",
        "I mean, my friends in the restaurant building business are bringing in workers from other countries, so we really need to focus - our government needs to focus on housing, providing affordable housing; because in order to rebuild our tourism industry, we need to have a place for people to live.",
        "Let's see if we can get another caller on the line.",
        "This is Al(ph); Al's calling from San Antonio.",
        "Yes, the entire country has sympathy and empathy for the victims of Katrina.",
        "So what I'm going to say may sound harsh, but I'd like to know how you rationalize the fact that many people live in disaster areas - well-known disaster areas, whether it's earthquake in California, or the hurricane-ridden areas of the coast, and they live there voluntarily.",
        "And when these events occur, they immediately begin criticizing the government.",
        "How do they rationalize that?",
        "How do you rationalize that?",
        "Gwen Thompkins, I'm going to throw that to you.",
        "Well, that's something - that's a point of view that we've heard over the past several months more than once.",
        "And I guess my response to that is, you know, no one wants to go and set up a tent on a highway to live.",
        "We take measured risks.",
        "There is no place in this country that is risk-free.",
        "Nature is always going to be more powerful than man.",
        "But we are, as mankind, people-kind, humankind, our job is to create a way where there is no way, or there appears to be no way.",
        "And the people of New Orleans, and the people of the Gulf Coast, we are continuing an experiment, if you want to call it, or a mission that was begun by two brothers named Iberville and Bienville almost 400 years ago.",
        "And there has been a New Orleans for almost 400 years.",
        "Diabetes that is really just out of control, with their glucoses very, very high - sometimes so high that you can't even record the number on the glucometer.",
        "So the idea that Katrina can come and change the minds of the people who live here is not necessarily an idea that we entertain very easily.",
        "Because there will be Katrinas, there will be Betsys, there will be Camilles, but this is a beautiful place to live and it is a welcoming place; and it welcomes the entire world, it welcomes kings and popes and presidents, people who want to be here.",
        "And for the people who live in New Orleans, this is home plate.",
        "This is - we all - we leave periodically, but our intention is always to come home.",
        "And when you come to New Orleans, whether you're from here, whether you're born here, whether you're from someplace else and you want to come spend some time with us, the people of New Orleans weave you in.",

        "Karen Desalvo, I'm going to give you the last word.",
        "Well, I agree with what Gwen said, and I hear what the man is -the caller is saying.",
        "One of the problems in this country is that people think about New Orleans as their mistress in some way, if you will, or the country's and the world's place to go to have fun.",
        "But they haven't taken us quite seriously enough.",
        "And I think the economic information bears out that we're a major port city and that we have - we're bringing oil and gas and seafood into this country.",
        "And the way that we should approach rebuilding this place is that it's vital to the country.",
        "The piece about government is just simply that, I think we all want to rebuild this place ourselves, but there's an expectation the government's going to support the infrastructure; and the levees were part of that promise that they made and it needs to be fixed.",
        "All right.",

        "And Trump has not stopped at accusing the media.",
        "He's been suggesting the actual voting will be rigged against him.",
        "That, like much else in this extraordinary candidacy of Donald Trump, has split the Republican Party with many joining Democrats in rejecting that possibility.",

        "He's an expert on election law and history at Ohio State University.",
        "Welcome to the program.",
        "Thanks.",
        "It's great to be here.",
        "In a broad sense, what constitutes a rigged election?",
        "Well, I like to define rigging an election as the systematic manipulation of the voting process or the counting of ballots.",
        "It's intended to distort the outcome of the election, and it's a systematic effort to do that.",
        "So historically, tampering with or stuffing ballot boxes, buying votes, any number of things.",
        "Exactly right.",
        "It's trying to get a different count at the end of the election from what the voters actually wanted.",
        "And I think ballot-box stuffing is the historic example.",
        "So getting back to this election, what do you see as the possibility of it being rigged?",
        "I think it's extraordinarily unlikely that we're going to have a rigged election because the fact that our system is so decentralized.",
        "The states run elections compared to the federal government.",
        "So if you were to try to rig the presidential election, you'd have to try to rig it in multiple swing states targeted ahead of time for rigging, and the attempt to rig it would've had to go undetected.",
        "I mean, that's a lot to happen sort of systematically and under the radar screen.",
        "Now, the new phenomenon is the risk of a cyberattack.",
        "And again, I think the risk of that is very low as long as the voting machines are not hooked up to the internet.",
        "And most states, as I understand it, do not hook up their vote-tabulating equipment to the internet.",
        "Well, certainly, these things have happened across the landscape of American political history.",
        "I mean, talk about ballot-box stuffing, jokes are made about it where dead people vote.",
        "What are examples of actual rigged elections in American history?"

        "In terms of the 20th century, perhaps the most well-known and consequential example comes from 1948, Lyndon Johnson's run for the U.S.",
        "Senate.",
        "It was a very close election.",
        "It was decided by 87 votes.",
        "And it's pretty clear on the historical record that there were 200 fake votes added to the so-called infamous Ballot Box 13 in south Texas.",
        "And that's an example where a statewide race, a consequential one, can be affected by this kind of problem.",
        "The word rigged is being thrown around somewhat loosely in this election.",
        "The Trump campaign is saying outright that this presidential election is rigged, and there's been talk of the race for the Democratic nomination back in the spring and early summer as being rigged at the expense of Bernie Sanders and especially after emails surfaced that the head of the Democratic National Committee clearly favored Hillary Clinton over Sanders.",
        "Is that part of your definition of rigging an election or an election being rigged?",
        "And a third big savings will come from a system that reimburses providers based on health outcomes, instead of the current system, where they reimbursed for the number of services that they put you through.",

        "He did that by seeking out distant supernovas, exploding stars, to see what the universe was doing billions of years ago.",
        "And finally, after 10 years of searching, Perlmutter came up with an answer so bizarre he wasn't at first sure whether to believe it.",
        "We thought we were finding out how much the universe was slowing down, and whether it was slowing down enough to come to a halt.",
        "And, of course, the answer was that it's not slowing down enough to come to a halt.",
        "In fact, it's not slowing down at all.",
        "It's speeding up.",
        "Speeding up - how could that be?",
        "Matter in the universe was supposed to be coasting since the Big Bang, but not so.",
        "Somehow or other it was picking up speed, accelerating.",
        "And this was, of course, a big shock.",
        "Borderline unbelievable, but as luck would have it, Perlmutter and his colleagues weren't the only team probing this question.",
        "A second team was also on the case, including Adam Riess, now at Johns Hopkins University, and Brian Schmidt, an American, now working in Australia."

        "He would need to write new software to pick through telescope images and identify those rare supernovas.",

        "Something weird is at work here driving that acceleration.",
        "Exactly what this is nobody can say, but they call it dark energy.",
        "And Kirschner says it seemingly makes up 75 percent of the universe.",
        "The simplest kind of dark energy would be everywhere.",
        "And so that means it would be present here on the earth.",
        "If we could figure out a smart way to detect its presence in a physics laboratory, that would be fantastic."
