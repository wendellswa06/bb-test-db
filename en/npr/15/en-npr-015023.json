        "I'm Guy Raz.",
        "Vermont is about to go where no state has gone before, to a single-payer health care system.",
        "Single-payer was the dream of many liberals when Congress began debating a health care overhaul a few years back, but the idea was quickly abandoned here in Washington.",
        "Not so, though, in Montpelier, where this week Governor Peter Shumlin says he'll sign a law that will ultimately give every Vermonter a state-issued Green Mountain Care insurance card.",
        "Basically what our system will do is treat health care as a right and not a privilege.",
        "We want to design a system where health care will follow the individual and not be a requirement of the employer, which we think will be a huge jobs creator.",
        "And most importantly, a publicly financed system.",
        "We all pay - where we use our health care dollars to make us healthier, not to enrich insurance companies' inefficiency, waste and the current fee-for-service system, which bills providers based on how much service they do as opposed to an incentive to keep us healthy.",
        "So essentially you will have a single-payer system but not on May 27th.",
        "I mean, people don't wake up the next day and all of a sudden have universal health care in Vermont.",
        "That's correct.",
        "We're using the federal bill as a bridge to the system.",
        "When the federal bill goes into effect in 2014, our system will go into effect on that same date.",
        "Now, some critics of this plan say the big problem is does not address the issue of financing."

        "Well, that's not really true.",
        "We've been very clear it's going to be a public-financed system, and obviously, there's only so many options that one can use.",
        "But I keep saying is the problem with health care reform across America so far has been that no one has gotten cost containment right.",
        "What I find alarming is that so many of us are willing to pretend that everything's going to be okay if we stick with the current system.",
        "So we're taking the bull by the horns up here in Vermont.",
        "We think we can get it right.",
        "And if we do, we think it's a huge jobs creator.",
        "Okay, explain how this will work for the average Vermonter who does not work for the state, somebody who works for a company.",
        "What happens?",
        "We're going to design a system that spends less.",
        "Now how are we going to do that?",
        "When you come out of your provider's office, our single-payer entity will say, when you hit the desk, check, cash or credit card?",
        "You'll adjudicate the bill right there for your portion.",
        "That saves eight to nine cents on the dollar.",
        "So that's low-hanging fruit.",
        "In a Vermont system, our people estimate that's about $500 million a year, big money.",
        "Second, that card will be a pipeline to your medical records so that you can see everything that happened medically to you, the provider, throughout your lifetime and manage your care based upon that information.",
        "Now, right now, about 30 percent of Vermont tests are duplicative because the next provider doesn't know what the last provider did to you.",
        "The list goes on and on.",
        "So that's a tool for better management of health.",
        "Is the boutique becoming popular.",
        "Oh, Quebec.",
        "Quebec is correct.",

        "No, absolutely not.",
        "I do think the rhetoric has been irresponsible, some of it, and overheated.",
        "And so I do confine the concept of rigging to this manipulation of the voting process itself and the counting of votes.",

        "I don't want to say that the risk of this is zero, but I do think the risk is very, very small.",
        "That doesn't mean it's perfect, but we should go into this election very confident that it'll be a fair and free election, or if something went wrong, we have the institutional capacity to correct it through recounts and the courts and the like.",

        "In-fighting between former and current members of East Timor's security forces, coupled with gang violence in the streets of the capital, left 30 people dead and tens of thousands internally displaced.",

        "East Timor teetering on the brink, auditioning for the role of the world's latest failed state, one the United Nations not long ago touted as an example of successful nation building.",
        "But East Timor remains desperately poor, with a largely untrained workforce and too many vying for what few resources there are.",
        "In the past few days though, the arrival of the Australian-led peacekeepers has helped quell the violence.",
        "They have separated and in some cases disarmed the rival factions and forced the gangs into hiding.",
        "The emergency room at Dili's main hospital was relatively quiet today, only a few patients, says Dr. Santina Gomez[ph], victims of the violence.",
        "(Foreign Language Spoken)",
        "We have one patient who was shot in the back of the head and another hit with a brick.",
        "Other than that, she says, most of the cases have been fairly routine, fever, diarrhea and the like.",
        "She is grateful for the respite, but worries what might happen if conditions in the temporary camps worsen.",
        "The longer the people stay in the camps, the greater the risk of disease.",
        "The hospital is well protected by Australian peacekeepers.",
        "Several dozen backed up by armored personnel carriers discourage would-be troublemakers.",
        "That peacekeeping force now totals more than 2,000, with recent additions from New Zealand, Malaysia and soon from Portugal.",
        "Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander Downer in Dili today made it clear his country does not want that military presence to be open-ended, intimating that the United Nations should quickly assume responsibility for security here.",
        "Clearly there will be quite a need for an international police presence here and probably for quite some time, and I think it would be appropriate for the international police presence to offer aid under the hospices of the United Nations and hopefully, the United Nations will be able to draw in a broader police presence in time and in that context our military will be able to downsize.",
        "The United Nations was due to end its seven-year-long experiment in nation-building here next month.",
        "Some analysts suggest the U.N.",
        "was too quick to leave without proper democratic institutions or a functioning economy in place, an explanation that might help explain the recent violence.",
        "Divisions reinforced by Foreign Minister Downer's meetings in Dili today with East Timor's leadership.",
        "Separate meetings with the prime minister, then the president, the two men at odds with how to deal with the crisis.",
        "And while the violence is ebbing, it has not ended.",
        "Even as the foreign minister spoke, a thick plume of black smoke floated lazily into the clouds not half a mile away, a Chinese restaurant torched by unknown assailants not a hundred yards from an Australian checkpoint and armored personnel carriers."
