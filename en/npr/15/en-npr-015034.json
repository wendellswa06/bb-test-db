        "Finally, somebody is creating jobs - and people in Congress are furious because of where the jobs are.",
        "Lawmakers say federal stimulus dollars and trade policies are creating jobs overseas.",
        "That has led to calls for stronger buy- American provisions as well as the repeal of the North American Free Trade Agreement.",

        "This week, four Senate Democrats, led by New York's Charles Schumer, held a news conference at the Capitol.",
        "We're here today to discuss something so outrageous, it just makes your blood boil.",
        "The outrage, Schumer said, was that the Department of Energy was about to send a grant of nearly half a billion dollars in economic stimulus funds to a west Texas wind-farm project.",
        "He asserted the project would create a few hundred jobs in the U.S.",
        "- and 3,000 jobs in China.",
        "The stimulus is a golden opportunity, because it's dollars to buy those things and to say they have to be made here.",
        "China doesn't import our stuff when it's using its government's money.",
        "Why do we have to do that?",
        "Why are we sometimes, it seems, Uncle Sap, not Uncle Sam?",
        "Schumer said the problem was that Democrats forgot to include a buy- America clause for private firms receiving economic stimulus money.",
        "He called on the Obama administration to stop issuing grants until that loophole is closed.",
        "But administration officials dispute Schumer's allegations.",
        "At a Senate hearing yesterday, Energy Secretary Steven Chu was asked about the west Texas wind-farm project.",
        "Although that has gotten a lot of press coverage, we have not gotten an application for a wind farm made with China parts in Texas."

        "Well, there has been a really remarkable wave of prosecutions for former political leaders who, in days of yore, would have enjoyed a comfortable retirement and not faced any threat of prosecution.",
        "And against that history, in Latin America in particular, many former leaders and other senior officials have faced trial in the last 20 years or so.",
        "And it's been a notable phenomenon, and has provided inspiration for countries in other regions of the world, as well.",
        "But Guatemala was the really striking holdout from this pattern.",
        "And so while one after another country was able to confront its past, not only through historical confrontations, through truth commissions and other means, but also in court.",
        "While that was happening in the region broadly, Guatemala was really almost a poster case for enduring impunity.",
        "And there were numerous efforts made over many, many years, led by Guatemalans themselves, but with a lot of support from the international community in many different ways.",
        "And despite all these efforts, Guatemala was unable, until recently, to bring past leaders to justice.",
        "And so it seemed to be really impervious to this kind of judicial reckoning.",
        "And the fact that it's happened is, of course, all the more remarkable, because of the obstacles that had to be overcome to reach this day.",
        "It's interesting: The current president of Guatemala served under General Rios Montt all those years ago, and he says he accepts this verdict, and will carry out the measures ordered by the tribunal in terms of apologies, but he also said there was no genocide."

        "It is a very powerful verdict.",
        "It's - genocide has been described repeatedly as the crime of crimes, and it's very difficult to prove in a court of law.",
        "And that's one of the other reasons why this verdict was widely seen as a landmark.",
        "So, you know, his reticence is notable.",
        "I hope that he continues to maintain the position that he will respect the rule of law in this case, as the proceedings go forward.",
        "Is it significant that this wasn't, in a sense, a victor's justice that General Rios Montt was not tried by - after the other side had taken over power?",
        "The right wing is still in power in Guatemala.",
        "So you know, it's a great question.",
        "I think, for me, one of the powerful images that the trial proceedings evoke is that victims who were - survivors of massacres who were children and witnessed terrible, unspeakable crimes being committed as young children, now are adults and faced Rios Montt in court.",
        "And so it's almost the opposite image of victor's justice.",
        "You have people who are young, innocent children, decades after this brutality, being able to meet the person they hold most responsible in court.",
        "So yes, that is absolutely a striking aspect of this.",
        "There was a long civil war there in Guatemala.",
        "This was just one chapter.",
        "What made it - what made his rule, genocide, was - if the rest of the civil war wasn't?",
        "So it was a very protracted civil war, but during the 17-month period that Rios Montt was the leader of the country, the scorched earth campaign that he presided over was the, by far, the most violent period in this protracted civil war.",
        "The United Nations, it was instrumental in establishing a truth commission for the country in the late 1960s after the civil war ended.",
        "And it was chaired by a German - a law professor.",
        "And it found that there were acts of genocide against the Ixil Mayans during this period that the trial covered.",
        "And so its findings confirmed after extensive research that, again, as you said, there was a very protracted civil war, but this period was, by far, the period of most staggering violence.",
        "And that commission, I believe, found that of the 200,000 people who were killed over the course of the whole civil war, I believe they found that 83 percent were Mayans.",
        "And that was the foundation for their finding that acts of genocide were committed.",
        "And as I understand it, in the cities of Guatemala (unintelligible) there were many individuals who were targeted, identified as labor leaders or insurgents, one way or another, and murdered or disappeared.",
        "In the countryside it was indiscriminate.",
        "Everybody was a target."

        "Well, part of the basis for the prosecution was that, again, specifically, with regards to the Mayans who were targeted, it was - there were statements by the government, I believe by Rios Montt himself, to the effect that all of the Mayans were considered supporters of insurgents and by definition therefore, quote, \"\"legitimate targets.",
        "What's the significance that this trial was in Guatemala rather than at The Hague in front of the International Criminal Court?",
        "You know, I just think it's such a triumph for Guatemalans.",
        "I mentioned earlier that there have been concerted efforts to bring this trial about.",
        "And Guatemalans had been assisted by myriad efforts internationally.",
        "The United Nations was involved in an innovative program to bolster domestic prosecutors in Guatemala.",
        "There's an - it's a real innovation.",
        "And it was an effort to place international expertise within the judicial system of Guatemalans, but helped that Guatemalan prosecutor take the lead in efforts to tackle the hardest cases.",
        "At one point, in the - in Guatemalans' own struggle to obtain justice, Guatemalans brought a case in Spanish courts under that country's very expansive jurisdiction.",
        "And the case included Rios Montt led - that proceeding led to the issue, and so then arrest warrant by Spanish judges against Rios Montt.",
        "Ultimately the Guatemalan courts quashed the indictment and decided they weren't going to send him to Spain for a prosecution.",
        "Those are just a couple of examples of really concerted efforts that have been undertaken over a long period, some by the international community, but really driven by Guatemalans.",
        "It was Guatemalans who brought the proceedings in Spanish courts.",
        "They've persevered against incredibly long odds and just deserve enormous credit for their belief in justice in the face of extraordinary impunity.",
        "And as you said, this case could not end up in an international court.",
        "And there are times when international courts have played, I believe, an indispensable role in bringing to justice perpetrators who would not otherwise be prosecuted.",
        "But I think they're always most successful - international courts, that is - when they provided space for a country to come to terms with its own past.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes, it is.",
        "Well, as the name commission implies, truth and reconciliation commissions are not empowered to convict anyone of a crime.",
        "They are - the mandate's there, but their main task is to try to discover the truth.",
        "It's typically a much broader truth than the trial truth - that is, a court focuses on the guilt or innocence of the defendants in the dock, and these commissions often have a much broader writ.",
        "This particular commission - so to correct myself, it issued its final report in 1999, which, again, gives us some sense of long this process or reckoning has been taking.",
        "It was headed by a non-Guatemalan, in part to provide the kind of sense of security to Guatemalans who would face enormous risk and independence.",
        "The other two members of the commission were, however, Guatemalans.",
        "And it established a much broader historical record.",

        "That's not a really great prospect.",
