        "Now, mathematically, you just gave us a sense of what Senator Clinton would need to win the nomination.",

        "Is there a chance that these votes will be added to the tally?",
        "I mean, the Clinton spokespeople have been really saying she's won the popular vote.",
        "Is that accurate?",
        "She has won the popular vote only if you include some states, and you exclude some others states.",
        "And it probably won't surprise you to hear that the states you would include would be ones she has won, and the states you would exclude would be ones Obama has won.",
        "That's how they can get to that construct of saying that they have won more popular votes.",
        "And they are very close in popular votes, no matter how you counted.",
        "This has been a remarkably close contest between these two historic candidates, first woman to get this close to the nomination, first African-American.",
        "And this has been a very close contest throughout.",
        "But in order to get Hillary Clinton out in the lead on popular votes, and she did close the gap further last night because she had a bigger win in Kentucky than Obama had in Oregon, to get her over the top you have to include Michigan and not give him credit for any votes in Michigan at all.",
        "His name was not on the ballot, but the people who wanted to vote for him voted for uncommitted.",
        "You'd have to give him no credit for those at all.",
        "And then down in Florida, you'd have to count all the votes fully, even though that's probably not what' s going to eventually happen.",
        "And then in addition to that, you'd have to exclude those caucus states that reported only delegate totals and not the raw vote totals of the actual people who were there voting.",
        "Had they been counted, of course, that would add greatly to Obama's numbers.",
        "Do we have any sense of how the Democratic National Committee and Chairman Dean are going to play their cards?",
        "I mean, is this going to be a situation where you anticipate they're going to start saying what's going to happen in Florida and Michigan when there's a Rules Committee meeting at the end of the month?",
        "There is, indeed, on May 31st.",
        "That's Saturday, a meeting of the Rules and Bylaws Committee, and they are going to, one would think, decide the issue of what's going to happen with Michigan and Florida.",
        "Now, the Michigan situation might be close to resolution because some of the leaders of the Democratic Party there, the same people who insisted on moving their primary into January in cooperation with the Republican Party there, those same people have devised a plan which would give Hillary Clinton about ten more delegates, 69 to Barack Obama's 59.",
        "So she would pick up a net of 10 delegates out of that Michigan compromise.",
        "That's not enough to make much difference.",
        "So the Clinton people are holding out for a better deal than that, and the Obama people are holding off to see what exactly it takes to get a compromise.",
        "But that's what's been proposed by the Michigan Democratic Party itself, and I think that that compromise would be acceptable to the national committee.",
        "Florida is a little tougher.",
        "Florida's a lot more delegates, yet.",
        "We're talking about 185 delegates out of Florida.",
        "That's a huge cash.",
        "And at this point, that's really the big kahuna.",
        "So any compromise out of Florida is going to have to be very carefully vetted by the committee.",
        "And one that I've looked at would give her 55 percent of the vote, give Obama 45 percent of the vote, and that would pick up almost 20 delegates for her.",
        "There is almost no sector in Greece that's gone untouched by that country's roiling financial crisis.",
        "One of the hardest hit is the country's hospitals, where budgets have been slashed by more than half since 2007.",
        "The facilities lack basic supplies, like surgical gloves, something the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention says will contribute to high infection rates.",
        "And nearly all doctors have seen their pay cut, delayed or frozen.",
