        "You're welcome.",
        "For a closer look at the pastors' letter and debt relief plan from the Bush administration, we're joined in our NPR Washington studios by the letter's author, Bishop Charles Blake, pastor of the West Angeles Church of God in Christ in Los Angeles, and Reverend Dr. O'Neal Dozier, pastor of The Worldwide Christian Center in Pompano Beach, Florida, joins us.",
        "Like Bishop Blake, Reverend Dozier has also been working closely with the Bush administration but he did not sign the letter.",
        "Gentlemen, thanks for joining us.",
        "Greatly appreciate it.",
        "Bishop Blake, let me start with you.",
        "Why did you feel the need to send this letter?",
        "Well, it was not the first time that we had communicated with the president.",
        "Our communication with the president started in the year 2000 when he was still President-elect Bush.",
        "We traveled to Austin.",
        "We met with him.",
        "We presented to him at that time a letter requesting a $10 billion investment annually along with other G8 nations in the continent of Africa, and since that time, we have communicated again and again.",
        "My interest in Africa goes back to the 1980s when I frequently traveled to the nation of Africa and more recently I have started an organization called Save Africa's Children.",
        "That is designed to meet the needs of the orphans on the continent of Africa, more than 14 million of them now, and there'll be over 50 million of them by the year 2026 and more than 80 million people are going to die possibly by the year 2026.",
        "And so my interest in Africa and in its well-being is what has motivated my frequent communication with the administration.",
        "Reverend Dozier, you chose not to sign this letter, not to participate in this form.",
        "Why?",
        "Reverend O'NEAL DOZIER (The Worldwide Christian Center): Well, first of all, I have not seen the letter.",
        "If I would have seen the letter, I would not have signed the letter.",
        "And why is that?",
        "Well, because of a number of reasons.",
        "Number one, the present Bush administration has either paid or allocated over $22 billion for aid to Africa over the next three to five years, and also because of the fact that Bush is very, very passionate about Africa.",
        "He has focused more upon Africa than most other US presidents in the past.",
        "And not only because of that, also because I think to do such a thing would be an unfair indictment against our president."

        "I had the opportunity to meet him up there in Washington, DC, but I believe that this is an unfair indictment of Bush.",

        "The president is being put under pressure by many, many constituencies.",
        "He gave $140 billion tax cut to corporations.",
        "$81 billion is proposed to aid Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "We spent $28 billion giving it to Turkey just for the privilege of flying over their territory on our way to bomb Iraq, and $22 billion over the next five years for Africa is a sum that really will not have significant impact.",
        "One authority has indicated that as much as $200 billion will be needed to fight the AIDS pandemic.",
        "Eighty million people dying.",
        "That's almost half the entire population of the United States.",
        "There's no way that we can stand by giving small, measly amounts to the continent of Africa that has given the world so much: its people through the slave trade, its resources and its minerals, corporate colonialism and...",
        "Sure.",
        "...and national colonialism have all literally raped Africa and disorganized Africa to a degree that Africa can hardly survive without our help.",
        "Reverend Dozier...",
        "So between that and the Michigan compromise, she would pick up a net of 30 delegates.",
        "And those two states could have their delegations fully seated with full voting rights, as though they had never violated the rules, and they would all be welcomed back into the party.",
        "And then, I presume, there would be some sort of ritual singing of Kumbaya."

        "I want to ask you a question about race.",
        "And when we see these election results play out, do we see any trends in terms of how white voters vote in states that are more heavily African-American versus ones that have very few African-Americans?",
        "It varies.",
        "Let's take, for example, last night's results, and really, there is no easy answer to this question.",
        "If you look at these two states, Kentucky and Oregon, they are almost equally white in terms of the overall state population and in terms of the amount of the vote or the proportion of the vote in the Democratic primary that's cast by African-Americans.",
        "So you would think that this issue of race would play out at least somewhat similarly in these two states.",
        "And yet, in Kentucky, Barack Obama gets 30 percent of the vote, and in Oregon, he gets almost 60 percent of the vote, almost twice as large a proportion.",
        "So white people are voting for Barack Obama with no trouble at all in Oregon, but they're having a great deal of trouble doing it in Kentucky.",
        "They're having a great deal of trouble doing it in West Virginia and in certain portions of Pennsylvania, that is the non-metro portions, not in the Pittsburgh area, not in the Philadelphia area, and also in some portions of Ohio.",
        "And, if you look at all of these states, which sound like four very disparate states, the operative part of these states that we're really looking at is quite conjunct, really.",
        "It begins in central Pennsylvania, goes south into West Virginia, west through Kentucky, and up into southern Ohio.",
        "And this is an area of the country long dominated by the coal industry.",
        "The coal industry is still very important there.",
        "It's largely rural.",
        "It's largely blue-collar, and the people who live there have largely traditional associations, very deep roots in their communities, very strong feelings about many social issues.",
        "And this is a community that has been historically somewhat resistant to change, political change, social change, cultural change.",
        "So in those kinds of situations, you're probably going to see more people more reluctant to vote either really for the first woman president or for the first African-American president.",
        "Now, when you have a faceoff between - a choice between a woman and a black man, in this particular case, the woman has been winning.",
        "Now, whether or not she would prevail in these particular places against John McCain in November, or Barack Obama could contest these areas against John McCain, that's not nearly as clear.",
        "Now, when you think about Senator Clinton's recent allegations that she is the victim of sexism, which we are going to talk about more after our break with a couple of our other political experts, how do you get the sense that - I mean, can we measure, can pollsters, for example, measure the impact of racism and sexism or bias and separate them out from other reasons that people might have for voting or not voting for a candidate?",
        "Tough call, very difficult problem for pollsters because, when you have a human voice on the telephone asking you questions, you give what pollsters call socially acceptable answers.",
        "You don't want to say, no, I'd never vote for a woman to be president.",
        "And you don't want to say something similar about race.",
        "Some few people do.",
        "But how many really are willing to express their feelings fully to a stranger but a human voice on the phone, when they don't really know who they are talking about, and when they know that there is some social disapproval for their forms of prejudice.",
        "So that's been a tough one for pollsters."
