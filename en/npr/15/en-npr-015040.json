        "We have also suffered from this, as have our Japanese colleagues, and we've been discussing with the administration for some time the need for joint action.",
        "So we were somewhat surprised that when this issue of tariffs came - on steel came forward that somehow it was the European Union and Canada and Mexico and other countries who are not part of the problem who seemed particularly targeted.",

        "And I imagine further surprised when President Trump yesterday announced that Canada and Mexico would be exempted but did not say the same about the EU.",
        "O'SULLIVAN: Well, I think that was because Canada and Mexico are engaged in negotiations with the United States through NAFTA.",

        "If the U.S.",
        "were to impose these tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum from the European Union, what would the impact on European countries be?",
        "O'SULLIVAN: Well, we are actually the largest exporter of steel to the United States in value terms, the second largest after Canada in volume terms.",
        "This would affect exports worth about $8 billion.",

        "In the book, you say that by the end of 1976, you were moving 50 kilos of coke or more a month.",
