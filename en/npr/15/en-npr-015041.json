        "I mean, you bought helicopters and found sites to land airplanes carrying cocaine on federal land.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We did that in the beginning, but that was just until we ended up getting up by Tampa a 450-acre farm, and we put two runways in there and we put hangars in for the planes to go in, and we stopped landing on the federal preserve and we were landing there.",
        "But Mickey's operation here, you have to understand, was like only 500 kilos.",
        "I was working with a man by the name of Barry Seal.",
        "And Barry was bringing 1,000 to 1,200 kilos at a time back for me.",
        "Evan Wright, when you think about your role as a journalist, I wonder whether you have concerns.",
        "I mean, the subject of your book, Jon Roberts, is somebody with a very checkered past.",
        "He's served time in prison.",
        "He's been charged with battery and grand theft.",
        "And, of course, there's murder in his background.",
        "Did you ever worry - or do you ever worry that you might be glorifying some of that?",
        "I, you know, as a journalist, I don't worry so much about glory.",
        "I worry more about the facts.",
        "And what I did in this book, which is kind of unusual, is I extensively footnoted it with my own research, which at times even challenges Jon's account.",
        "As far as the glory, you know, we live in a culture where the top entertainment is \"\"The Sopranos\"\" and, before that, movies like \"\"Goodfellas.\"\" So I thought Jon had an important story to tell.",
        "And near the end, I explored Jon's relationship with his son and his attempts to be a good father.",
        "Jon, what do you want your son - he's now 11 or 12 years old?",
        "Eleven.",
        "Eleven.",
        "What do you want him to take away from this book when he eventually reads it?",
        "I want him to realize that I went about doing things in the wrong way.",
        "That's not to say to you that if I had my life to live over again that I would have changed it, but that what I did was wrong, which he already knows.",
        "I've talked to him.",
        "I don't know if you know it or not, but I'm dying.",
        "I have four stage terminal cancer.",
        "So I've talked to my son.",
        "And, you know, I don't know if I'm going to live a month, a week, or what I'm going to live, but I wanted him to take away from this that he's got to go a different path than I went in life.",
        "That's Jon Roberts.",
        "He is the subject of a book he co-wrote with journalist Evan Wright.",
        "It's called \"\"American Desperado: My Life-from Mafia Soldier to Cocaine Cowboy to Secret Government Asset."

        "(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"\"MEET THE PRESS\"\")",
        "The credit rating agencies around the world have said if Congress doesn't act by the 2nd, they will downgrade our credit, first time in history.",
        "And if that happens, you're going to see catastrophic damage across the American economy and across the global economy.",
        "It's not something we - failure is not an option.",

        "Congressional Republicans and the White House are now trying to hammer out a less ambitious plan.",
        "So it goes, another phrase from Vonnegut.",
        "As you were getting older, this did start to manifest more and more, through high school.",
        "But, you know, it was hard to tell sometimes, reading your book, the difference between an unhappy, lonely, forgive me, kind of geeky kid and somebody with a mental disorder.",
        "Yeah, I think a lot of the loneliness and the unhappiness was caused as a result of the mental disorder.",
        "Again, the fundamental mechanism of OCD is an intolerance of uncertainty and then the repetition of certain thoughts or behaviors to try to let go of that uncertainty."

        "So not only the intrusive thoughts but also low self-esteem, social isolation, trying to come up with different ways to protect myself that ultimately wound up backfiring and hurting me more than taking very simple social risks, the way most people do in high school.",
        "And it is that reaction to fear, protecting yourself - that's what the mechanism seems to be.",
        "Yes.",
        "Again, one of the most stereotyped forms of OCD is contamination.",
        "So I like to use that because people tend to understand it.",
        "The fear is that I might die of a bacterial infection.",
        "So the response to that is to wash hands, and then because of the disorder's predilection for repetition and its inability to tolerate uncertainty, the sufferer will continue to wash his hands over and over and over again until it consumes his life.",
        "So if washing your hands once is good, washing your hands 20 times is better.",
        "Yeah, precisely.",
        "And the same thing with the intrusive thoughts.",
        "The cycles, as this goes through your head over and over again, and these are not cycles of, gee, I need to touch these things or wash my hands, these were horrible, horrible thoughts.",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "I think everyone experiences these kind of things.",
        "Your mind will just sort of settle on something really distressing and upsetting, and you know, most people are able to shake it off.",
        "Unfortunately, with obsessive-compulsive disorder, the thoughts take on kind of a life of your own, and you begin to wonder what do these mean, how can I make them go away.",
        "And again, the context of these is often deeply personal and deeply upsetting.",
        "People can be consumed by images of terrible violence, of religious blasphemy, of sexual perversion, bestiality, pedophilia.",
        "And again, because of the OCD and because of the repetitious nature of it, the more you try to make these thoughts go away, the worse and worse they become.",
        "And you also encountered, even after you'd had a psychotic breakdown, mental health professionals who were skeptical that what you had was OCD.",
        "Yeah, I was really disappointed, in retrospect.",
        "I'd had a number of therapists growing up.",
        "I eventually had a breakdown and was brought to McLean Hospital, and up to the point of that hospitalization people misunderstood, misdiagnosed.",
        "They would try to reassure me, oh no, that could never happen, or no, no, those thoughts don't mean anything, which ironically is the worst thing you can do for someone with OCD because trying to reassure them and tell them that they are safe, it doesn't help with the fundamental issue of uncertainty and just sort of serves as another ritual, another metaphorical hand-washing that can't really give them the absolute certainty they would desire."
