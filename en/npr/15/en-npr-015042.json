        "Fletcher Wortmann, you were saying at one point when he was talking, that reaction of thinking everybody is being critical of you.",
        "We don't necessarily associate that with OCD.",
        "Absolutely, yeah, and I think that's one of the problems with our understanding of the disorder.",
        "We conceptualize it primarily as cleaning, counting, hand-washing.",
        "Really what defines it is this mechanism of I'm not sure about something so I'm going to try to do something to fix it, and I'm going to do that fixing behavior over and over again, as often as I need to, until I feel certain that things are better for me.",

        "He describes the end-of-the-world anxieties, the obsessions and the many rituals that might, just maybe, hold off the looming apocalypse.",

        "You also affirmed him on that.",
        "Given what he said, and given what you said, how difficult was it to write this book?",
        "Oh, goodness.",
        "It's funny, procrastination can be a symptom of OCD in the sense that because you know a project will require so much of your effort, and you're so frightened of screwing up, it's easy to just keep putting it off and putting it off and putting it off.",
        "That wasn't a problem for me.",
        "I was really excited about writing \"\"Triggered.\"\" I think my primary issue was in editing and revising it and trying to make the text absolutely perfect.",
        "And of course there are any number of changes that have to be made as part of the publication process.",
        "So you know, they'd come to me, and they'd say oh, you can't use those song lyrics for legal reasons.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",

        "And boy, staring at a blank screen, that can - that can trigger some postponement problems.",
        "Absolutely, and in a funny way I think that my treatment has helped me tremendously with my writing and particularly in dealing with writer's block.",
        "For me, writer's block always came from this idea that, OK, I need to write something, and I need to write it perfectly.",
        "I need to just create beauty on this screen.",
        "What I do now is I just putting words, you know, start typing and trust that eventually something worthwhile will show up.",

        "I could not let my mother take a nap because I was very frightened that the house would burn down.",
        "And I had fears - they would change.",
        "It wasn't always the house burning down, but growing up - and then when I was actually being treated for post-partum depression after my sixth pregnancy, for the first time in my life I was able to clear my thoughts.",

        "And when you had those fears of the house burning down, I wonder, how did it start, do you think?",
        "Well, I think probably just the basic safety lessons that parents teach their kids, you know, don't play with the stove or the house is going to burn down, things that you wouldn't - it's not like I had any terrible experiences with fire or anything like that, but just the thought that something like that terrible could happen, I really, I just couldn't...",
        "And the threat was to your mother more than it was to you.",
        "Well, I just felt like if she was awake, if she was around, we were safe.",

        "You know, I had repeated these rituals and this obsessive thinking over and over and over again, and then finally something clicked, and it all went away.",
        "And the OCD was able to say to me then, ah, see, see, you know, I did that for you.",
        "That was me.",

        "Yeah, it's funny.",
        "There's an almost - there's an almost schizophrenic aspect to it sometimes.",

        "There's a very adversarial aspect to it.",
