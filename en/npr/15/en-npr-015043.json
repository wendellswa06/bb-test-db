        "Steve, I don't know if you've gotten any kind of treatment yet, and I don't know if what's been helpful for me will necessarily apply to your situation, but what really helped me get over my OCD was something called exposure response therapy.",
        "So we've talked extensively about how OCD comes from fear and anxiety and fear of a specific something.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Yeah.",
        "What I had to do in McLean Hospital at the OCDI was sit down and face directly whatever it was I was afraid of without performing the ritual to try to protect myself.",
        "So mine was tricky and kind of weird to describe because of the purely obsessional thoughts, but you know, I had friends who had contamination issues who would have to sit there with their hands in a toilet for two hours without washing or with their hands in a bucket of biohazard junk.",
        "And it's a terrible, challenging, traumatizing process.",
        "It's really tough.",
        "But I found through ERP I was able to really confront the things I was frightened of without obsession and eventually managed my disorder much better.",
        "I don't know if you've attempted anything like that yet, but it may be worth looking into.",
        "No, no, not at all, but I'm open to anything.",
        "Well, you should - it sounds like you should try to talk to somebody and get some help."

        "And it's interesting, that caller - it's not easy to talk about these things, and in fact even as you are being diagnosed in your book, you write how difficult it was for you to try to tell these successive batteries of doctors and therapists what your symptoms were.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It stuns me how much this disorder is misunderstood.",
        "I originally received my diagnosis not after months and months of speaking to a therapist at Swarthmore College, where I was studying, but by Googling it myself, saying, OK, it seems like I'm obsessed about something.",
        "And yet, you know, it is - it's - again, because of the cruel, specific nature of it, it becomes very difficult to talk about, you know?",
