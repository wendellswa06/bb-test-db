        "Your know, from the very beginning of this debate, taxes were a sticking point for Republicans.",
        "But last week, it looked like there was room for some sort of a deal, you would close loopholes, rework the tax code, increase revenue in a way that Republicans could argue was not an actual tax increase per se.",
        "But in the last 24 hours, that has dissolved, and there's been a lot of finger-pointing since.",
        "Speaker Boehner called the president at Camp David last night and said this just wasn't going to happen.",
        "At the end of the day, apparently, Speaker Boehner could not get the Republican rank-and-file lawmakers to vote for a package that would include what they saw as those kinds of tax increases.",
        "That is their redline.",
        "They say they will not back an agreement if there are any tax increases.",
        "So what's on the table now?",
        "Well, the president plans to keep pushing for a $4 trillion package, but it's hard to see how that gets accomplished.",
        "Instead, it looks like they're going to be talking about something closer to what Vice President Biden had been negotiating weeks ago with congressional leaders.",
        "That's somewhere between two and $3 trillion.",
        "That means some of this historic change that was potentially in the big package is off the table.",
        "But it doesn't mean that the deal is any easier.",
        "You know, there's going to be political pain for both sides.",
        "And in some ways, that political pain is more palatable when you can say to voters, look, we accomplished these tremendous once-in-a-decade things.",
        "When you take those once-in-a-decade things off the table, the political pain is a bit less easy to stomach.",
        "They're saying that they can accomplish these $2 trillion cuts without any tax increases?",
        "It depends on how you define a tax increase.",
        "If you eliminate loopholes, eliminate subsidies, change some details in the tax code, you can get more tax revenue.",
        "Potentially, Republicans would not consider that a tax increase, but that's what's being worked out behind closed doors in these meetings.",
        "So, Ari, what's likely to happen in the coming days and weeks now?",
        "Well, more of closed-door meetings with the leaders and with staff and more pressure, because the U.S.",
        "runs out of borrowing authority on August 2nd.",
        "And after that, the country could go into default on its financial obligations.",
        "There's got to be some kind of a deal, and nobody really seems to want to do a short-term thing that would just kick the can down the road.",
        "But that seems more and more likely with each passing day.",
        "That's NPR's White House correspondent Ari Shapiro.",
        "Ari, thank you so much."

        "So, it came as a complete shock to me that this would happen now.",
        "How did you discover that it was missing?",
        "Well, we've been required to keep the cross covered and we've had a wooden box over it during all these years of litigation.",
        "And on Saturday, one of our employees noticed that the box had been removed.",
        "And so, on Monday morning, another one of our employees went out to recover it and that's when he found out that the cross was removed.",
        "Can you give us just a little bit of background.",
        "We explained that this has been at the middle of this litigation that lasted more than nine years and went to the Supreme Court.",
        "What's the core issue there?",
        "Basically, there is a cross that was put up by private citizens in land that is now Mojave National Preserve.",

        "How did the people who removed this remove it?",
        "You know, the cross is basically two pipes welded together.",
        "At the bottom of the cross was a metal plate and that metal plate was bolted directly onto the rock.",

        "It cannot be disregarded.",
        "There is unfortunately a history of painful relations between the two countries.",
        "But having said that, I think there's also the potential of some shared interest.",
        "Not just between us and Iran, but even between the Iran and Israel.",
        "I was impressed by the fact that more than a decade ago, shortly before he was assassinated, Prime Minister Rabin of Israel, said that Israel and Iran are natural allies in the region.",
        "So if we are smart about it, if we are willing to negotiate seriously, if we are willing to reinforce the negotiations with the potential of sanctions when they fail, if we as true threats, military threats which implied under negotiations aren't being conducted under duress and therefore it makes it more difficult for the Iranians to negotiate seriously, then I think that there is at least a chance that things might move forward.",
        "You mentioned that Prime Minister Rabin in Israel, it's been quite a while since then and of course since then, Iran has become the principal sponsor of Hezbollah, which fought Israel in a war just a little while ago.",
