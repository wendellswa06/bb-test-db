        "Well, let me ask you, Zbigniew Brzezinski.",
        "Of course, Iran is a Shia country.",
        "At the moment, its religious base is in the holy city of Qom, a place where it's believed among many other students is Muqtada al-Sadr, the fiery anti-American cleric from Baghdad.",
        "Yes.",
        "But you know, in the Iraqi government, for example, there are Shias with whom we're working very well.",
        "So, let's again not generalize from a single factor into some sort of a universal principle.",
        "Not all Shi'ites are crazy fanatics.",
        "Not all of them are virulently anti-American.",
        "And in the case - specifically, the Iranian society, a good part of that society, according to all reports and especially younger people, are rather tired of this kind of Orthodox fundamentalist, religious veneer that has been imposed upon them, and they would like the country to change.",
        "But it will not change if we maintain disposition that Iran is part of an Axis of Evil, that if we may bomb it someday unless it accommodates us.",
        "That simply unifies the Iranian's true nationalism against the outsiders and specifically, us.",
        "Ted?",
        "I think most Americans, Neal, would be astonished to discover, as I did when I was in Iran, how many Iranians are genuinely pro-American.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Genuinely love the United States and would like nothing better than to see the two governments reestablish diplomatic relations.",
        "Dr. Brzezinski was referring a moment or two ago to the young people over there.",
        "The fact of the matter is - I expect maybe you know the percentage.",
        "It's a huge percentage of Iranians who are actually under the age of 30.",
        "I think a vast majority of Iranians, indeed, are under the age of 30.",
        "That's right, and you're absolutely right about their outlook.",
        "You know, I have dealt with the Iranians in the most unpleasant phase of American-Iranian relations, and I know they're can be tough, they can be difficult, they can be devious.",
        "I'm not arguing from the standpoint of some sort of unrequited love affair with Iran.",
        "But I do think that we have the potential for geopolitically transforming the relationship if we're clever about it.",
        "I think over the last eight years, we have not only missed opportunities, we have made things worse by threatening, by belligerently accusing them.",
        "Perhaps even according to some reports, engaging in some covert activities, which to some extent match their activities against us.",
        "And it hasn't all been covert either, Neal.",
        "I mean, if you go back to the 1980s when Iran and Iraq were in their devastating war, I think about 800,000 young men were killed on both sides.",
        "During that period, the United States was in some cases, surreptitiously, in some cases, quite openly supporting the regime of Saddam Hussein against the Iranians.",
        "And just...",
        "And to make things even more ironic at that time, Israel was supporting the Iranian regime, even though it's headed by Khomeini."

        "Their nuclear ambition and support for Hezbollah and Hamas, interference in Iraq.",

        "I've been a fans of them for quite some time and I'm hoping that Dr. Brzezinski will play a formal or informal consultation role under President Obama's administration.",
        "But to the point in hand, the Iranians are very serious people and a very rational people.",
        "It's in their interest to maintain this kind of seeking posture of nuclear weapons, but it's not in their interest to actually have them.",
        "For one thing, it would subject them to - and subject their facilities to an attack on Israel, but not only that.",
        "Their Arab rivals would also want to nuclearize, and they would expect us to help them.",

        "Thanks for the comment, Mike.",
        "And Zbigniew Brzezinski, do you believe that the Iranians are serious about pursuing nuclear weapons?",
        "Or are they, as Mike suggested, just interested in seeking nuclear options?",
        "Well, I'm not sure there's really that much difference between the two except in terms of timing.",
        "I suspect, but I have no way of proving this.",
        "This is - I emphasize - a suspicion.",
        "They are interested in having the capability to produce nuclear weapons if they felt the need arose for such weapons, and they would like to be more or less, not too distant from that capability.",
        "A little bit like - contemporary Japan.",
        "You know, Japan has respected the NPT, but it is in a pro-talk nuclear posture, that is to say, if it chose to go nuclear, it would probably go nuclear - weapons nuclear in about half a year or so.",
        "My guess would be and this again, I emphasize, purely a guess - that it is something along these lines that the Iranians would like to achieve.",
        "Let me ask you question that a lot of people ask us during programs like this one.",
        "What would be so wrong about Iran acquiring nuclear weapons?",
        "I think if they acquired nuclear weapons and actually went nuclear, it would create a greater anxiety in the Middle East.",
        "It would prompt perhaps some of the Arab countries in the neighborhood to try to seek nuclear weapons.",
        "There could be some sort of a collision, perhaps an abortive preemptive collision between Israel and Iran.",
        "So in that sense, it is certainly not something to be welcomed.",
        "But, but I will also add that in fact, deterrence in the past has worked.",
        "We deterred the Soviets from using nuclear weapons.",
        "Incidentally, they also deterred us from using nuclear weapons.",
        "We deterred the Chinese from using nuclear weapons and again, vice versa.",
        "Last but not the least, both the Pakistanis and the Indians have become more cautious ever since they respectively obtained nuclear weapons.",
        "So I don't think it is such an unmitigated disaster that it makes it worthwhile even to go to war with Iran to prevent it.",
        "I think if the Iranians unfortunately go too far, we'll have to ostracize them, we'll have to extend the nuclear umbrella over the neighborhood, and we'll have to make them pay very, very heavy economic and financial price for years to come.",
        "And...",
        "One other brief point, Neal.",
        "And that is you have to take a look at the object lesson that North Korea presents.",
        "You know the Iranians are looking at North Korea and saying, wait a second, now they got nuclear weapons.",
        "And all of a sudden, United States, which had refused to negotiate with North Korea, gets back into the negotiating game.",
        "You know, life is better if you're negotiating from the position of strength.",
        "So, I can understand why they're coming at it from that point of view, but I agree both with the caller and with Dr. Brzezinski.",
        "It would make life very awkward.",
        "Let's get Memet(ph) on the line.",
        "He's calling from Alexandria in Virginia.",
        "Hello.",
        "Gentlemen, I just wanted to put one point - two points across, if I may, and get your comments on them.",
        "First of all, we know that everybody who we brought into power in Iraq, lived in Iran, were allowed to go there and joined the Iranian secret police and don't - according to Frontline, don't drink a glass of water without getting their permission.",
        "We know that when we decided to set up, according to CNN, a secret police organization for the Iraqis, the Iraqi government immediately went to Iran and asked the Iranians to set up a parallel one.",
        "Now, the question is which one is going to take over?",
        "At the same time, we know that the Iranian government is a one-party government.",
        "The name of the party is Hezbollah, and no other party and no other opinions are allowed in Iran.",
        "So all this talk about, you know, elections, you know, makes it sound like they're - they have more than one party and the party is something other than Hezbollah.",
        "Hezbollah is what rules Iran.",
        "The other thing is comparing Iran with Japan.",
        "You know, Iran is the global headquarters for terrorism.",
        "And according to Putin, you know, Iranians don't put return addresses on their bombs.",
        "They subcontract everything.",
        "According to Putin, the danger is the big Iranian contact in South America with the drug dealers is that they would give nuclear weapons to drug dealers in order to effectively neutralize us and they go to Russia and they call us, the world arrogance and they say what are we doing all over the place with them and..."

        "But nevertheless, there is enormous Iranian influence in Iraq.",

        "Iran is not stupid.",
        "Iran is not going to give its first or even its second or even its fifth atomic bomb to some terrorist group when we have nuclear forensics, and we could trace the origin of the weapon, and therefore, we would know who originated some lethal attack.",
        "And Iran would then be the victim of a massive retaliatory strike.",
        "The Iranians are calculating, deliberate, tough, but they're there.",
        "They're part of the geopolitical picture, and we have a choice of either getting into a stupid conflict with them, which I take it the caller would like, or we can try to change the relationship with them thereby benefiting geopolitically and incidentally, even economically.",
