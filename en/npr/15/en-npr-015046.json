        "Here's an email question now from Jim in St. Louise, I was wondering about the necessity for Iran now that Iraq is no longer a threat to it, to have an enemy in order to focus the Iranian's public attention away from internal problems.",
        "Well, I mean, that's always the case, isn't it?",
        "Whenever an autocratic government needs to distract attention from domestic problems or internal or economic problems, you point to an external enemy, that's not unknown, even the governments like our own.",
        "We're talking with NPR news analyst, Ted Koppel, of course, the long-time anchor of ABC News, \"\"Nightline,\"\" a program which got its origins as he noted just a moment ago in the Iranian hostage crisis some 30 years ago.",
        "We're talking about the challenges that Iran represents to the United States in general and to the incoming Obama administration in particular, its nuclear ambitions, its support for groups like Hezbollah and Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.",
        "If you'd like to join the conversation our phone number is 800-989-8255, email us talk@npr.org.",
        "And you're listening to Talk of the Nation coming to you from NPR News.",
        "And let's talk with Sayid(ph), Sayid with us from Green bay in Wisconsin.",
        "Yes, good morning.",
        "Prominent Iranian dissidents like Mr. Botevi(ph), Mr. Ganji, the leaders of the one million signature movement, the leaders of the Iranians Tehran City bus driver's trade union would all disagree with Mr. Brzezinski about the status of democracy in Iran.",
        "The principal political contention in Iran is not between the various factions of the Islamic Republic.",
        "But it is between those who believe in the (unintelligible) and those who are trying to displace this government and bring democracy to the Iranian people.",
        "We are at inflection point in U.S.-Iranian relations.",
        "There are a certain elements of the U.S.",
        "foreign policy elite of which Mr. Brzezinski is one, which I would classify as the grand bargainers.",
        "These people are lobbying for a broad-based detente with the Iranian Ayatollahs.",
        "It would be well - America would be well-advised to remember the history of U.S.-Iranian relations, and how and at all times in the United States sides with tyrants against the people of Iran, the outcome is never good.",
        "The basis of our commonality between Iranians and Americans is in that - the deep desire of Iranians to be free, a desire which has eluded them since the 1906 constitutional revolution.",
        "So, you would argue, Sayid, that the popularity of the United States in Iran is precisely because it opposes the Iranian government?",
        "Mr.",
        "SA'ID: Exactly, not because it opposes Iranian government per se, but because America is one example of democracy and the desire of Iranian to be free is profound.",
        "It is a - they recently - a joint expert statement on Iran that came out of this, the folks that are arguing for detente acclaims that, the current Iranian regime is stable.",
        "This could not be further from the truth.",
        "The Iranian regime is a government of a minority over an unwilling majority.",
        "I was and I absolutely agree with Sayid's contention that there is a great yearning for democracy in Iran.",
        "Having conceded that point, however, let me first of all parenthetically - he doesn't need me to defend him, but I think Zbigniew Brzezinski was saying, is simply that there are countries that give even less opportunity for genuine democracy and to my surprise he said Russia, only - I'm surprised not because I been there lately and know anything he doesn't know, quite the contrary.",
        "But that he would say something like that is actually quite provocative and says something about the bad state of affairs in Russia today.",
        "But the notion that negotiation, if I understand Sayid correctly, should be off the table.",
        "A military action against Iran is off the table.",
        "I'm not quite sure what lies in the middle, what is it you're suggesting, Sayid?",
        "What I'm suggesting is, for example, there are several states in the Unites States that have passed legislations for divesting investment and companies that do business in Iran.",
        "This is a movement in the right direction.",
        "I am talking about efforts to support human rights in Iran.",
        "There are brave Iranians who are standing up to this tyranny, who are going to prison, who are getting tortured, who are getting killed and their stories are never told.",
        "No one in the world knows what's going on in Iran.",
        "Even the well-informed people like Mr. Brzezinski - of what is it - how can it be a democracy when a panel appointed by the Supreme Ayatollah disqualifies 6,000 applicants for the presidency?",
        "No, no, no. You're quite right.",
        "He did that.",
        "But I don't think Dr. Brzezinski described or defined Iran as being a democracy.",
        "I think he was simply making the point that there is more than one political party in Iraq."

        "Your guest mentions that women are over half the college students and the vice president is a women, yet he doesn't say anything about the brutality Iranian women endure.",
        "This is entirely misleading making Iran sound egalitarian, to poor listeners who don't know any better.",
        "And I think those presentations were made in the context of Iranians are sometimes presented as crazies.",
        "And nevertheless, there is - there are other developments which are considerably saner looking in Iran.",
        "But Ted, she's right.",
        "Iranian women are still subjected to laws and practices that we would find unacceptable in this country.",
        "Absolutely, look, I think one of the points we have to make Neal, is that everything you have heard during this program has an element of truth to it.",
        "It is still an enormously brutal country.",
        "Political enemies of the regime, those who are perceived as not supporting the national goals are imprisoned and treated brutally in the prisons.",
        "At the same time, it's also true to say that I have rarely been in a country that some see as being a pure dictatorship where people are more eager to talk to a foreign visitor and tell nasty jokes about the president.",

        "You have to be careful.",
        "None of these is a truth in and of itself.",
        "All of these things seen together begin to present a picture of Iran today.",
        "And if I may, Neal, I would just sort of suggest that we go back to the initial question that you been posed at the top of the program.",
        "And that is this question of whether or not the president-elect can afford to engage in negotiations or consultations with the Iranians, and whether that will lead anywhere.",
        "And I'd like to say again, I think it will.",
        "I think we have shown for the past 29, almost 30 years now, how pointless it is to have a relationship in which there is no diplomatic contact.",
        "We haven't made any progress in the Persian Gulf with regard to the Iranians.",
        "They haven't made any progress.",

        "Dr. Brzezinski was National Security adviser to the president of the United States at the time of the hostage crisis back in 1979, 1980 and up until '81 when President Carter was replaced by President Reagan.",
        "He understands how difficult it can be to deal with the Iranians.",
        "He also understands I know the difference between a theocracy and a democracy.",
        "He was simply making the point that in terms of some democratic standards perhaps he'd rather live in Iran than in Russia.",
        "I think it would be a tough choice.",
        "I'm not sure which one I would pick.",
        "I agree with you.",
        "I think Mr. Brzezinski would have noticed several cranes, you know, erected in the middle of the city with Iranian youth hanging from them.",
        "He would have noticed the stoning, he would have noticed that even the choice of color for clothing is not possible and then he would have probably bought a ticket to go to Moscow.",
        "But that's beside the point.",
        "I really appreciate your comment.",
        "I really appreciate the report that you made in Iran.",

        "Well, I'm not sure that they're necessarily going to find many in common if both sides in the systems starting on nuclear issue.",
        "But when it comes to the issue of trade remember now the reason that we have invested so much blood and treasure in the Persian Gulf, in Iraq in particular right now, but previously in Iran - is precisely because of oil and natural gas.",
        "It continues to be the world's largest supplier.",
        "I'm talking about the whole Persian Gulf region - Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, the Emirates.",
        "And establishing some kind of political balance, some kind of tranquility in the Persian Gulf, is ought to be the one area in American foreign policy on which there really should be bipartisanship.",

        "An Iranian chartered tanker was among the vessels seized by Somali pirates off the horn of Africa and they were - well you can only say very angry statements from Tehran about this which they might find a very welcome audience in other parts of the world, where their ships have been taken to and cooperation on this issue of piracy on the high seas which affects of course any country doing commerce in that part of the world.",
