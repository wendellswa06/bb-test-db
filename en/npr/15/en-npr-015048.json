        "He long ago earned a reputation in the Arab world as one of the influential novelists of his time.",

        "He was very much concerned about giving his readers, both in the original Arabic and in translation, as accurate a picture as he could of the life of the people of Cairo - particularly the middle classes and the lower classes - but also of trying to convey some of the major issues which were confronting the Egyptian nation throughout his career.",
