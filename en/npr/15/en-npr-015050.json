        "It's just a matter of a couple more film projects coming through that really refine the technologies.",
        "But the genie's out of the bottle.",
        "Yes.",
        "This is one of his particular characteristics and virtues.",
        "Many of younger-generation writers - but also some more radical leftist writers - were very keen on trying to introduce the actual colloquial dialect into the written form of the language, but that encounters several cultural attitudes.",
        "And his great genius was his ability to write in the standard written language - which is the highest level, culturally speaking - but at the same time to make it sound as though it was an authentic piece of conversation, and to introduce very particular local dialect words into that process as well.",
        "And I wonder, is that easy to translate?",
        "It doesn't really affect the translation process, although - I mean, by which I mean as a translator, it's not a question of being able to understand what the original text means, but reproducing it in the target language - English in our case - that's what's really difficult.",
        "It's just to try and maintain a literary level, but at the same time manage to convey the fact that in the original Arabic there is this colloquial, everyday kind of speech going on which you want to try to convey to the English reader.",
        "That's the tough part.",
        "There is no one that looks at a writer's words more carefully than a translator - probably not even his editor.",
        "As you looked so carefully at Mahfouz' words, what was he like as a writer?",
        "Was he felicitous?",
        "Was he clunky?",
        "Was he good?",
        "Well, I think one of the first things to say about Naguib Mahfouz was that he was a civil servant and a very organized person who - in my several meetings with me - told me that because he had an eye problem throughout his life, and believe it not living in Cairo he was intolerant of bright light, you know, which is not a feature of Cairo life.",
        "So he used to write very methodically but late in the afternoon.",
        "So he was a very methodical writer, is I think the way to put it.",
        "He would plan everything down to the last detail.",
        "He even said at one point in his great Cairo trilogy, he made notes and made a file about each character.",
        "So his style is very methodical.",
        "It's very clear.",
        "And as compared with some other novelists - particularly of contemporary novelists now who try to produce the elaborate periods of a James Joyce or a Salman Rushdie, say - that wasn't Mahfouz at all.",
        "He was very anxious to write a kind of language which would be immediately accessible to the people who read him.",
        "He'll be missed.",
        "Roger Allen, thanks very much.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Roger Allen is a professor of Arabic and Comparative Literature, Chairmen of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilization at the University of Pennsylvania.",
        "He joined us from his office in Philadelphia.",
