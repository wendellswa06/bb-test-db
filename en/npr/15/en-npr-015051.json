        "Topol himself didn't examine the article until a few months later, in February 2001.",
        "That's when a panel of the Food and Drug Administration met to consider the COX-2 painkillers and the FDA made the full VIGOR data publicly available for the first time.",

        "Topol and two colleagues at the Cleveland Clinic used the additional numbers from the FDA and different statistical methods to reanalyze the VIGOR data.",
        "They concluded that Vioxx doubled a patient's risk for cardiovascular problems.",
        "They published their findings in NEJM's rival, the Journal of the American Medical Association, in August 2001, along with their recommendation that doctors be cautious in prescribing Vioxx and the other COX-2 painkiller, Celebrex.",
