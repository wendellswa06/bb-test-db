        "They see women want to be a part of it, and they're making more and better equipment tailored to them.",
        "And I think a lot of women have realized that hunters are very welcoming, and, you know, people worry - Lily could speak to this better than I could, but I know in my interactions with women hunters in camp, maybe they've been worried about oh, I'm going to be with all these guys, and they're going to be intimidating and make me feel like I don't know anything.",
        "And I haven't come across that.",
        "I mean, sure, once in a while you'll have somebody who's trying to maybe impress someone and show how much they know, but for the most part, hunters want more people in their sports.",

        "So I try to buy - I buy meat that's been raised locally, on a small farm, and been treated well, basically had what I consider a good, humane life and death.",
        "It's more expensive, but I just eat meat a couple times a week now.",

        "Sometimes, yeah.",

        "A lot of urban people who maybe don't know any hunters personally, their image of hunting - and I say this as somebody who used to fit that bill, so I didn't know any hunters, and my image of hunters came mainly from, you know, popular culture, movies like \"\"Bambi\"\" and things like that, which are really inaccurate portrayals of hunters and hunting."
