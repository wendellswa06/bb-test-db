        "Well, that must concentrate the mind wonderfully.",
        "How old is your son?",
        "Right now he's 17.",
        "He encountered a bear at 13.",
        "He's never taken a bear, but he encountered a bear, and I was just - I've always been proud of the fact that he was happy to get up out of his blind on the ground and slowly creep toward the bear, knowing what to do, and although the bear did run off.",
        "We were not successful in that hunt.",
        "What we were successful at was his focus, concentration and frankly bravery for a 13-year-old to approach a bear because the bear was out of ethical range.",
        "He was about 50 yards away, maybe 45, and we just might have killed him that way, but - with a bow, but it's not an ethical shot.",
        "So we needed to get within about 30 yards.",
        "And just one last question: What is bear season there in North Carolina, from when to when?",
        "For some reason they split it into two pieces.",
        "It has - let's see it's the 17th of November it ends, and then it begins again in December for one more roughly two-week period.",
        "And they're very, very different bears in the east versus the west of the state.",
        "In the east of the state, many people aren't aware that there is huge wilderness and huge tracts.",
        "It's because of the swamplands.",
        "A lot of those bears out there have never seen a human.",
        "They're not afraid of humans.",
        "And they're very irritable towards the winter because they are unable to hibernate, it's not cold enough, but they feel this urge to hibernate, and, you know, they just keep eating through the winter.",
        "And they're pretty dangerous.",
        "All right, well, thank you Dan.",
        "Let's get some more calls.",
        "And Anthony, are you getting a lot of bear hunters, and Lily, are you eager to pursue one?",
        "You know, there's certainly a number of bear hunters out there, but I think the caller Dan touched on something broader, and that thrill and adventure and excitement.",
        "And that's not something that we should shy away from when we talk about hunting.",
        "Now not everybody will take it to Dan's extreme, you know, stalking a black bear on the ground with a bow.",
        "But the fact is, one of the things that attracts people to hunting is it takes you out into the wilderness, into wild places to not only connect with these animals and these landscapes and read the land the way Lily talked about, but there's a real sense of adventure.",
        "And even if that adventure is as small as your hiking to your deer stand, you know, before the sunrise, in the dark, on the mountain and maybe you're not even a mile from the road.",
        "But still, how many of us in our day-to-day lives are out there hiking to the woods in the dark, climbing a mountain?",
        "And it's that visceral connection with wild animals and wild places that gives a real thrill and that is, without a doubt, one of the things that attracts me to hunting, and that I get from it that I don't get from other activities."

        "You know, I'd like to ask either of you, do you see a distinction between - and anybody out there - hunting for the thrill of it, something that you're not going to eat, like a sandhill crane, for example, or a wolf, as opposed to an animal that you can put on the table?",
        "Lily.",
        "You're very, very welcome, Lily.",

        "I do see a distinction.",
        "I'm personally only comfortable hunting something that I'm going to eat.",
        "I'd like to add really quickly, though, that that last caller, Dan, also touched on something that even if - I've never had a hunting experience anywhere near as scary as what he was talking about.",
        "But all of my hunts have really worked - there's a mental skill involved in hunting that is really, I think, kind of an - maybe a lost art, but also just unusual in modern life, to really focus on using all of your senses to stay really alert for long periods of time.",
        "There's this sweet spot between being so hyper-alert that you just get exhausted after, you know, 15 minutes and kind of shutting down and not paying enough attention that you might miss, you know, a clue that an animal is in the vicinity.",
        "So it's a real mental skill going out hunting.",
        "That's an important point, I think, that Lily makes.",
        "It's true, and I think that is another thing that draws people to it.",
        "Look, we're all wired and connected and busy and multitasking all the time, looking at our phones.",
        "And to be forced in the wild away from that stuff and have to sit still for a long time or stalk slowly or notice any little change in the forest is not a skill we use very much.",
        "And it's very exciting to tap into that.",
        "Let's just get another call in here quickly if we can.",
        "Greg is calling from Pocatello, Idaho.",

        "You're welcome.",
        "Thanks for being here.",
        "I'm so excited that you guys are talking about hunting.",
        "I just wanted to make the point that we're so fortunate here in the United States - North America to have the opportunities that we do.",
        "Not everywhere in the world can people hunt.",
        "And, you know, two important things we have; the idea that game animals are owned by the citizens and not by the government, which allows us to hunt them; and we also have this incredible system of public lands, which gives us an opportunity, even if you're not rich to be able to hunt.",
        "And because of those two things, we have conserved a really incredible, intact ecosystem.",
        "I think you can't talk about one without talking about the other."

        "I have to say I grew in a hunting family with a professional hunting guide of a grandfather.",
        "He ate everything he hunted, and I think many - some of them were legal and some of them were not and some of them people wouldn't necessarily want to eat, like a mud hen or a muskrat.",
