        "In the aftermath, the state passed a law to remove the Confederate battle flag from the state capitol grounds, and that began a national conversation about racial reconciliation.",
        "Starting on Friday, some three dozen lawmakers from both political parties will visit a number of historical civil rights sites - including Emanuel AME Church, known as Mother Emanuel - to honor those who lost their lives, but also to initiate broader conversations about race.",

        "There's been more conversations in the last several months than I can remember in the last several years, specifically in pointed conversations about race and racial progress.",

        "This is too much.",
        "That was a big, big change.",

        "This is an environment in which, you know, protesters have been pummeled.",
        "I have to wonder if that makes you feel that you're fighting something you didn't perhaps realize was there.",
        "I'm an optimist, but I have an anchor in reality.",
        "So the truth of the matter is the thing we jumped at earlier is very important, that if you don't figure out how to get something to the surface, it toxic nature will infect the rest of the body.",
        "So the truth of the matter is what we're seeing bubbling to the surface now may or may not have racial components to it, and I think there's some racial element to it because people are frustrated without any question.",
        "Black folk are frustrated, white folk are frustrated.",
        "I'm sure Hispanics and Asians are, too.",
        "Most people, so far, continue to harness that frustration and expect that the political process will produce the type of results that will help our country grow and become healthy.",

        "Today, everything is instantaneous.",
        "In 1957, the Civil Rights Act - when Strom Thurmond from out of state filibustered, Strom Thurmond grabbed Ralph Yarborough from Texas and wrestled him to the floor of the house, had to be separated by a sergeant of arms.",
        "So we've always had this kind of acrimony in our political process.",
