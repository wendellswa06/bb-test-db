        "That sounds like that would be popular, but where does the money come from?",

        "The president will propose raising taxes for investment income, capital gains, where the top rate would go from about 24 percent to 28 percent on the very highest incomes.",
        "And he'd also go after what we call trust funds, where assets can appreciate tax-free until they're distributed.",
        "And, of course, that's been a great benefit for families of means, passing large amounts of money between generations.",
        "And then there's a fee on the largest investment banks, as well, that's supposed to bring in billions over 10 years.",
        "Yes, that's right, continuing the theme.",
        "And overall, the president's plan is supposed to be revenue positive for the Treasury.",
        "But, Ron, how can this president get that plan?",
        "You know, things like raising taxes on investments approved by a Republican Congress.",
        "Isn't that just dead on arrival?",
        "It's surely not going to get passed by this Congress in anything like the form that the president is proposing, but it isn't necessarily dead on arrival as a topic of discussion.",
        "The Republicans want to do something for working families, too.",
        "They're just going to disagree about what.",
        "And this makes the issue of, if you will, income inequality and the distribution of the benefits of the improving economy front and center as the new Congress sits down to business.",

        "And President Yanukovych, he got $50 million in a probably quite expensive loan, which means that he can keep going for 15 months more, until he has presidential elections in Ukraine.",
        "I'm curious as to why Ukraine seems to be teetering.",
        "Because when the USSR split up, a lot of people said this is going to be a country with a lot going for it - almost 50 million people; it was considered the breadbasket of the old Soviet Union; coal, steel.",
        "What's happened?",
        "Well, I was there at the time and I didn't think that Ukraine would take off at all.",
        "The first problem was that there were no good economic thinkers at all in Ukraine.",
        "All the thinking was really done in Moscow.",
        "And the other part was political, that Ukraine came together through a coalition of Ukrainian nationalists in the West who wanted to have an independent state and the old corrupt nomenklatura who wanted to stay in power, and in effect they did."
