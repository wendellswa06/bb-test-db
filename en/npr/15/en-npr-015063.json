        "And it was Rick Perry who was bitterly criticized for his lackluster performances in the previous debates, and last night, maybe he didn't win it but showed a pulse.",
        "Well, he did show a pulse, and basically the polls showed that he needed to show a pulse given the fact that Herman Cain became suddenly the new alternative to Mitt Romney.",
        "In the latest polls, Herman Cain is either leading or in a close second place in nearly every poll.",
        "And of course I think that's why all the candidates went after the 9-9-9 tax and economic plan last night in the beginning of the debate.",

        "And we're going to hear more numbers I think Tuesday, when it is Governor Perry's chance to present his economic plan.",
        "He's apparently going to call for a flat tax of his own, not the 9-9-9, no it's going to be completely different, but we'll hear the numbers next Tuesday."
