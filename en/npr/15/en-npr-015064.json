        "Well, I'm going down to the debate Methadone clinic today, as a fellow junkie, to kind of separate from the debate game, which is important, but it's not the voter game yet.",
        "I think it's - and I've been predicting this for a while - it wants to be a two-person race between Romney and Perry, with Herman Cain as kind of the third place some voters are going now.",
        "We don't know if they're going to stick there.",
        "But we're really going to move into the voter contact period now.",

        "And in some ways, I think the primary electorate we have this year is interested in Rick Perry.",
        "In other ways, I think Romney has the performance skills, experience, and establishment backing that makes him very formidable and historically probably the frontrunner.",

        "Those things, and organizational strength, and those things are going to play to Perry's strengths.",
        "Yeah, they look at the presidential primaries like big-state, statewide guys, which makes sense.",
        "That's what they have done in Texas.",
        "They've been good at it.",
        "They beat Kay Bailey Hutchison in the primary for the governor's race in 2010 from behind.",

        "He's got his $15 million war chest now.",
        "It's probably really about $12 million because every campaign plays a little accounting game with cash versus bills they keep in a desk drawer.",
        "The question is can he keep raising money if, in these debates, he looks like he can't hold his own with Barack Obama in the general election.",
        "Donor elites like candidates who perform well in debates because they look like winners, do well on their feet.",
        "So one of the questions for Perry is how much money can he raise going forward.",
        "I think Romney has some advantages there.",
        "But Perry is a good - has a good kind of tone ear for the Republican primary.",
        "He's got some trained advantages on the calendar, which is very important, I think, an item that's being missed a little.",

        "But of course, if you have paid media, and you have paid attack ads, nobody's a more ferocious campaigner than Rick Perry.",
        "Right, and the paid ads can define the press coverage for a while.",
        "Whatever fight you pick with your television ads, the media kid of parrots that and goes off and asks the candidate about oh, you had that debate for a while.",
        "But I have to say the one that struck me about these debates is, Perry's the only candidate I've seen who's gotten worse.",
        "You know, normally they start bad and get better.",
        "He got worse and worse and worse, and I think improved a little bit last night, though his tone became something that might be an issue, as well.",
        "So he just - he struggles with the unscripted, non-advertising part of the campaign, but again, you can always get better, and the media is quick to forgive and realign the race if they sense improvement.",
        "And even if George W.",
        "Bush was not that effective against John McCain in 2000, at least Bush had the party establishment, whatever that means, behind him.",
        "Perry certainly doesn't have that this time.",
        "Right, he had a little of it at the beginning, but then I think he - his problem is with the party establishment, as opposed to the primary voters, really care about is winning and losing.",
        "And Perry does not look like a general election winner.",
        "Now, if he wins the Iowa caucus, if Romney does not engage him there, he'll start to rebuild his image, and he'll get a momentum factor, which I think could be very dangerous for Romney.",
        "I think the biggest strategic call now that we're in the voter contact part of the campaign is does Mitt Romney jump into Iowa and try to stop him there, or does he hold up in fortress New Hampshire and run the risk of letting Perry get some real momentum.",
        "And that, as you say, is risky.",
        "If he does invest in Iowa and does not do as well as he'd hoped, then, well, he stands to lose a lot.",
        "Yeah, you go to Iowa, and you get beat bad, you lose.",
        "You get beat close, I think it makes your New Hampshire win, which is a primary, better terrain for Romney, the composition of it, worth something.",
        "So although it's tough to go engage in Iowa, what's really tough is to have a guy like Perry come out of Iowa with momentum.",
        "So I'm not sure what Plan B for the Romney campaign is.",
        "And I think people quickly forget one bit of the math last time.",
        "They all remember Romney lost.",
        "I know Romney remembers Romney lost.",
        "Romney got about 31,000 votes in the caucus out of 120,000.",
        "Huckabee got about 41,000, but McCain got 15,000, and Fred Thompson got 16,000.",
