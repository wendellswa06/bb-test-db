        "So there's 30,000 to 35,000 kind of regular Republican votes out there, not all of them, but a big hunk of them, which is why a lot of people around Terry Brandstad, the governor of Iowa, think Romney could actually prevail in the caucus.",
        "So I'm not - it's a tough chore, but, you know, getting nominated is a tough chore, and I'm not sure what Plan B would be for Romney.",
        "I'm kind of curious what other route they could take, other than a risky move into Iowa that could play huge rewards.",
        "And we did see John McCain lose in Iowa both in 2000 and 2008 only to go on and win New Hampshire both times, as well.",
        "Right, right.",
        "I just - I think Romney might have special South Carolina problems that McCain didn't have after New Hampshire.",
        "And Romney has, you know, the benefit of a lot of strength in New Hampshire.",
        "That's the burden of high expectations.",
        "I think if Perry wins Iowa without a Romney contest, goes into New Hampshire and gets beat by six points, the headlines might be Texan does better than expected in New Hampshire.",
        "And then you go on to South Carolina, which you're really, if you're Romney, you don't want that to be the tiebreaker.",
        "Well, we're talking about that schedule as if it's the actual schedule.",
        "Ken, at last word, New Hampshire is still threatening to hold their ballot as soon as early December.",
        "Well, here's the thing.",
        "Iowa, first of all, the news of the week is Iowa announced that they will have their caucuses on January 3rd.",
        "Earlier, or last week, Nevada announced they will have their caucuses on January 14th.",
        "That puts New Hampshire in an awkward position because they have to have theirs a full week before the next succeeding contest.",
        "So anyway, there's a contest.",
        "So right now, New Hampshire is threatening to have their primary in December, but the Nevada Republican Party is meeting, they have a meeting this Saturday, and my guess is they're going knuckle under the pressure.",
        "They're talking about - all the candidates are talking about boycotting their caucuses.",
        "I suspect that Nevada will move their date to at least - back to at least January 17th, if not even further back, allowing New Hampshire to come in January 8th and everybody - January 10th, and everybody will be happy.",
        "Yeah, I couldn't agree more.",
        "Ken's always right about these process things, as a true wizard at this part of it.",
        "And I agree because what you've got going on now with these three states is like a naval battle between the British Navy in the '40s, the American Navy and the Belgian Navy.",
        "And Nevada's Belgium.",
        "And they're going to get shoved because they just don't have the heavyweight power to compete with New Hampshire and Iowa."

        "That is why Jon Huntsman, by the way, was not in Nevada last night.",

        "Yeah, that process game in New Hampshire is important, but it's not vital.",
        "Back in my old days with Lamar Alexander, we got into that about Delaware, which was the Nevada of the '96 cycle.",
        "And, you know, you can score a little bit of easy heat and everything.",
        "But Huntsman's problem is somehow they've spent $4 million with a guy who looks good on paper, at least in New Hampshire, but they've never been able to run a TV spot to make him famous enough.",
        "So now the question is do they have money to really compete.",
        "If he does find some money in a superPAC or somehow, I think he could get a little traction in New Hampshire.",

        "Yeah, I had a question about a lot of the - what we're hearing, recently, is about the budget and the deficit and all that.",
        "And I've heard a lot of, you know, about the 9-9-9 plan, the numbers not matching up and how we're not sure about some other plans.",
        "But I haven't heard any opinions on Ron Paul's plan that he mentioned the other day.",
        "And I'd like to get Ken's view on that, specifically.",
        "I mean, is that possible?",
        "Are his numbers adding up?",
        "Well, it's cut a trillion dollars from the federal budget immediately, eliminate five government departments and a lot of other things, which is one of the things that makes it difficult for Ron Paul to get more than a small fraction - well not necessarily a small fraction - but a fraction of the Republican primary vote.",
        "And I wanted to ask you - Ken is not noted as an economist, a process master, yes, but Mike Murphy, what is it that somebody like a Ron Paul or a Michele Bachmann, or for that matter, Herman Cain, who's currently leading the polls, what can they do to sustain that or break into the top tier?",
        "Well, I think, you know, Paul is a niche candidate with an intense niche of supporters, which means he's a catalyst in the early state to other people, particularly in Iowa, where I think he could do 10 percent of the caucus vote, maybe even a little more.",
        "But as - for the realism of his plan, he basically has to make a deal with space aliens to come down and elect 400 Ron Pauls to Congress to get anything like that done.",
        "Cain is a little different, and Bachmann, again, is another catalyst in Iowa.",
        "I think she may have a little bit of a comeback if Romney starts beating the hell out of Perry with negative ads.",
        "There's going to be a room for some movement, conservatives who don't like Romney to go anywhere, and they're going to be looking at Bachmann again, and I think at Cain.",
        "Cain, I give a little more credit to on policy.",
        "The 999 plan is, at first glance, popular because it's simplistic.",
        "But the idea behind it is actually fairly sophisticated, which is to widen the tax base into some sort of national sales tax, which a lot of other Western democracies do.",
        "So I think - although I doubt Cain will get nominated.",
        "I think he peaked at that debate, and it's now a downhill slope for him.",
        "I'm guessing.",
        "The voters get to decide.",
        "I do think the idea, as a country in the fiscal crisis we look at, looks at tough spending cuts and potentially revenue going forward.",
        "The idea of widening the tax base into some other kind of tax vehicle like that and the lower corporate - and taxes on capital gains is going to be an interesting idea that'll be part of the tax debate in 2012.",
        "So Cain may have some legacy here."

        "Or does it matter to them?",
        "You know, I don't think his - I think some of his new voters are listening, and I think that's why we're going to see him start to decline in national polls now.",
        "These national polls are so overrated early.",
        "They're kind of noise meters, in some way, so what's going on in the political discussion rather than voter intent.",
        "But Cain's got kind of a base of support, but it's not enough to win the caucus, and it's not enough to win the New Hampshire primary.",
        "And the question is: Can he take all the attention he's getting and take it to the next step?",
        "And what I saw last night was he was kind of dug in and defensive and not briefed up to some issues.",
        "So he's going to squander his opportunity, is my guess.",
        "Again, we'll see.",
        "He'll hang on (unintelligible) vote on charisma, though, no doubt about it.",
        "So it'll be, you know, it'll be Perry and Romney on the A-list, and I think on the B-list, you're going to have a combination of Santorum, who's running a pretty pure campaign of social conservatives.",
        "There's some votes there.",
        "Cain on charisma.",

        "And the difference this year, of course, is that in the early primaries and caucuses, they're - proportionally, it's not winner-take-all.",
        "It's proportional.",
        "So Ron Paul and all the others you just mentioned can survive, at least for a couple of months.",
        "Yeah, for some reason, the Republicans all got high and decided to ape the Democratic system, where we give you delegates for 11th place.",
        "We used to be the mean social Darwinists, it's all, winner-take-all.",
        "Though, you know, as you know, a lot of the early - it's pre-April, a lot of those are winner by congressional district.",
        "So it's kind of like partially proportional.",
        "Some are more than others.",
        "So I don't think it would have quite the effect the Dems do, but it will, to the extent as an impact, it could lengthen the process, absolutely, which is a very un-Republican way, historically, to do it.",
        "We tend to do the winner-take-all, and we change that to be a bit more proportional.",

        "I think those sneaky guys over at the Obama campaign, when Perry and Romney start running paid negative ads, and Perry has already started calling TV stations for pricing in Florida, they may slip in a little superPAC money into that negative ad mix to work on Romney for the general election.",
        "They'd be happy, I think, with Perry.",

        "So I think whoever wins kind of has momentum coming out of the early primaries will have some advantage in Florida, combined with who has the most money, because unlike the other primaries, Florida is so large, money's even more important there, because it costs so much to advertise.",
        "That's where, if Mitt Romney's going to write a $5 million check out of his piggybank, I bet it'll be in Florida to try to jump to a money advantage over Perry after they both spend all their early money.",
