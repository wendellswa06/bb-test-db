        "Would that be wrapping up...",
        "Well, that's what we did in 2007.",
        "This time, we started with the digital code from reading the genome in the computer, four bottles of chemicals and chemically made the over one million base pairs of the genome.",
        "It was finally assembled in the eukaryotic cell, Saccharomyces, which is the brewer's yeast.",
        "We then isolated the bacterial chromosome from the yeast cell and transplanted into a bacterial recipient cell.",
        "After it was transplanted, it took over the cell and transformed that cell into an entirely new species dictated by the synthetic chromosome.",
        "Did you have to take out the chromosomes from that cell first?",
        "No we didn't.",
        "Years ago, we thought we might have to do that.",
        "We think there's one of two possibilities.",

        "We think they recognize the chromosome already in the cell as foreign material and chew it up.",
        "So we have the cell of one species and the chromosome of another, and as that new synthetic chromosome gets read, it starts making all the new proteins coded for by that chromosome, and then that cell turns into the new species coded for by the chromosome.",
        "So basically you created the same cell that already had existed.",
        "So we absolutely, we copied, in this case, heavily from the Mycoplasma mycoides genome, the one that we'd been working out all these transplant experiments with over the last several years because if you can imagine, 99 out of 100 of our experiments haven't worked, and this has been almost a decade of complex problem solving to get to the point.",
        "So we wanted to start the experiments with something that we at least knew would be compatible with life.",
        "And how do you react to some of the criticism that I read at the beginning, that this is a little bit too dangerous at this point?",
        "Well, we expected - even though we've been raising issues and discussions on this since the 1990s.",
        "In fact, the first bioethical review was published in 1999 before we did the first experiments, and that's a review that we had asked for.",
        "We were concerned that despite all the discussion there's over 100,000 blogs on the Internet before this publication that still this would be the first time the majority of people heard about this research.",
        "And we figured there would be some of the usual shock and responses to it.",
        "So it's not anything new to the molecular biology community and people trying to understand something new and complex and having knee-jerk responses.",
        "But the fortunate thing, it's less than one percent of all the responses that have been out there.",
        "In fact, some of the more well-known members of the molecular biology community, I'm just going to quote one of them, David Baltimore, who is a Nobel Prize-winning geneticist at Cal Tech, is quoted in the New York Times today as saying: To my mind, Craig has somewhat overplayed the importance of this.",
        "It's a technical tour de force, a matter of scale rather than a scientific breakthrough.",
        "Well, David's entitled to his opinion, but we haven't played up the importance of this at all.",
        "We've described what we've done.",
        "It's other scientists and people around the world that are attributing what the importance of this breakthrough is."
