        "Well, how many Americans would be affected by this higher tax?",
        "Well, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has estimated around 25 million tax returns could be affected, and those taxpayers would pay on average an additional $2,000 in federal income tax if Congress doesn't change that.",

        "So they've voted to increase taxes in other areas to do that.",

        "Elliot Richardson was the attorney general during Richard Nixon's day who when asked to fire the special prosecutor resigned instead and herald in the Saturday Night Massacre, which really was part of the key ending of the Nixon administration.",

        "Yeah, I guess to me, the crucial area of the White House is not the attorney general, but it's the White House counsel's office.",

        "They see the Mueller report coming out.",

        "And the reason for that is when you look at what's been capable from existing molecular biology techniques and anything that we know about that's out there, including all the GMO crops that Monsanto and others have, less than a dozen genes have been changed in any commercial product to date.",

        "If biological knowledge was sufficient to do it on first principles, yes, but we're not there yet.",
        "So there will be definitely a lot of empiricism with this, which is why it's important to get to a minimal cell, understanding what are the components that are absolutely necessary for life, and then can we add back components specifically that we want, for example in the case of trying to make fuels from carbon dioxide, to increase the efficiency of CO2 conversation into hydrocarbons that could go into refineries, as an example.",
