        "We had hair samples sent to the University of Kentucky that verified that this was a parent and offspring, and then we also had blood work sent to University of California at Davis, which also verified that it was a mule and her offspring.",
        "Well, it's not supposed to happen from whatever at the number of chromosomes that a mule comes away with from its parents, a horse and a donkey, should not permit fertilization - successful fertilization.",

        "I'm waiting for an explanation.",
        "Yes, you're right.",
        "Mules are hybrid animals.",

        "I think that further genetic testing will give us more certainty as to how this happened.",
        "But, I guess, there are a couple distant theories, and it would depend on what genetic information the mother passed on.",
        "This baby could perhaps be a mule.",
        "It could be a 63-chromosome animal.",

        "But there are White House officials who think if he is going to draw a big, clear contrast with the Republicans, who - some of them, are talking about impeachment if he does this or at least shutting down the government, he might as well do this before he loses the Senate and has no political capital.",
        "Now on a practical level, if the president does offer temporary deportation relief to certain groups of illegal immigrants, why would any of them come out of the shadows if the relief would only last as long as Obama is the president?",
        "You are right.",
        "The next president can reverse President Obama's executive orders.",
        "And it would be a risk for people to come out of the shadows and qualify for President Obama's temporary deportation relief and then be subject to deportation as soon as he left office.",
        "However, immigration advocates say it would be very hard politically for the next president, if he were a Republican, to turn around and deport people who came out of the shadows.",
        "And those executive orders that the president might issue could create a lot of very politically powerful facts on the ground.",
