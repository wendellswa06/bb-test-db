        "I mean, if Frasier was really a psychologist, I mean, this guy would have lost his license on the first day.",
        "So when you add in characters then who are black, you know, it gets a little dicey because some people will go, `Oh, you know, it's a stereotype' or `You're just making buffoons out of these characters,' but the television landscape, in terms of sitcoms, you know, everybody does things that are outlandish, because if they just did regular normal things on a daily basis, it would be kind of boring.",
