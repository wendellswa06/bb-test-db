        "Have you thought about that at all?",
        "I have, but, you know, I find that we're really in an interesting time in television, because it used to be when I started in television, the black shows that were on, I personally don't feel like they aspired to be much more than, you know, placeholders.",

        "And that's why I would say it's very similar to the American Western, because what has interested people all over the world since the invention of the Western film was that on the one hand, these people could be in this little town, then they get on horseback and when they - the further away from town they get, the closer they get to a primitive, almost primeval kind of a situation where, you know, with these wild Indians, who can also be very majestic Indians, they can be benign and they can also be extraordinarily savage.",
        "So in Africa, you have this combination of extraordinary brutality, extraordinary backwardness, inspiring vitality in terms of the morale that the people have about living and the enormous potential that any situation, when you encounter human beings, is, you know, that you can be elevated by the quality - by, you know, by - just by the human quality the people have.",

        "That's clearly a fear for us because - and I don't know on what basis such a possibility would exist while we have forgotten Afghanistan for some years after the Cold War and we have seen the results and the consequences by the incidents or tragic incidents as 9/11 and the following attacks in other countries.",
        "So why on earth, again, we are leaving that country on its own and saying let's move away because this is an unwinnable war?",
