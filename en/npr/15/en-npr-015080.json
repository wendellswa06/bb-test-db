        "It's positive PR that money can't buy.",
        "So there's two opinions, both on the phone and an email, Mr. Crouch, sort of saying very similar things about the depiction.",
        "Well, you know, I've been thinking recently that, you know, for all of this understandable attention that Michelle Obama is getting, this woman, who's the president of Liberia, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, right, she's extraordinary, because unlike Mugabe and these other incompetent, brutal clowns that run African countries, she's, like, cleaned up this place after a 14-year civil war.",
        "She's put a woman in charge of the police force.",
        "And she's done the things that the people actually need.",
        "And so all I'm just saying is that as the African who wrote in the email was saying, see, there's a whole other thing that's happening in Africa.",
        "See, the thing that is remarkable about Africa is that Africans have this - they have a very deep understanding of something, as I say in the piece, that everybody in the world actually knows, which is that life does - life is not self-destructive.",
        "In other words, life is on its own side.",
        "It's not against itself.",
        "So what I mean is the Africans, they understand, yes, there's going to be famine, yes, there's going to be disease, yes, there might be tribal wars, yes, people might kidnap people, they might kill other people, they might do terrible things, but in the long run, the sheer power of life itself is greater than almost - than all of its oppositions.",

        "UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS #2: (As characters, singing) Let's begin.",
        "And I was just wondering two things about the series, one is - one thing that struck me about the books is the formality that they deal with one another, that Mma Ramotswe refers to her husband as Mr. JLB Matekoni and likewise, and the formality especially of the main characters of that."

        "And the other question is how the series deals with the question and the impact of AIDS on Africa that books make reference to that and deal with it in quite an interesting way that the orphanage is central to the story of I know later, Mma Ramotswe and JLB Matekoni adopts two children from that orphanage.",
        "And could you speak just a little bit about how the question of AIDS and the impact is handled in the books and on the series.",

        "I think, Stanley, I don't know.",
        "Is that something you can respond to?",
        "Well, no, because I haven't read the books, as I said, and also I'm not aware of exactly how they're going to address it in the series.",
        "But we can be pretty sure that it will be addressed because it's a hard fact of African life on a day-to-day basis.",
        "And you can't - it's just like tribalism.",
        "If you're going to deal with Africa, you got to deal with what actually is there.",
        "And AIDS is a serious problem, but, you know, of - in Botswana itself, the AIDS deaths have been going down because they actually have a program that involves the passing out of condoms.",
        "And it's had a strong effect.",

        "But clearly there is a lot more information that they either chose not to put in there or couldn't put in there because of classification.",
