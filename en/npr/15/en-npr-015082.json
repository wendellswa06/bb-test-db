        "The debate around surveillance cameras often breaks down into simple terms: privacy versus safety.",
        "It shouldn't be a choice between privacy and safety.",
        "It doesn't have to be a choice between privacy and safety.",
        "Sharon Bradford Franklin is senior counsel of the Constitution Project.",
        "It has developed guidelines to help communities that are considering the use of surveillance cameras.",
        "Franklin says the public should be involved in the process and there needs to be assurances that the cameras will not infringe on civil rights.",
        "We agree that if a camera is trained on actual criminal conduct and that is a tool for the police and they want to use that evidence, that's fully appropriate.",
        "What we want to make sure is that the camera systems are designed in a way that they're going to be focused on that law enforcement objective, that they're going to be most likely to be actually picking up the criminal conduct and not just cutting such a broad swath and then having this ability to engage in fishing expeditions or to really be overly intrusive of people's privacy rights, chilling their first amendment rights and so forth.",
        "So, what would you say to those who really are concerned about civil liberties who might want to see these cameras done away with altogether?",
        "Are you sort of saying that's not going to happen?",
        "That's not the future?",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, the reality is that I think that ship has sailed.",
        "I think cameras are already in place in many communities and more are going to turn to them.",
        "So we think the much more practical and productive avenue is to try to make communities try and think through these issues and institute protection for privacy rights and civil liberties along with the camera systems from the get-go.",
        "What are some of the civil liberties that we are talking about?",
        "Is it simply a right to privacy, and do you have a right to privacy in a public space?",
        "Two very important questions.",
        "Right to privacy is certainly a big one here.",
        "And the common doctrine that most people know is that you don't have a reasonable expectation to privacy in a public place.",
        "Well, the reality, though, is that this is an area in which the law has really lagged behind the developments in technology.",
        "And if you look at what is really just around the corner, we could easily have in the near future a system of fully networked digital cameras where you can create a digital database, tag given images with identifiable information and search that database for a given individual and create a digital dossier of that individual's movements throughout the community.",
        "And if people think about, is that what I view when I say \"\"no reasonable expectation of privacy in a public place,\"\" that's a very different image."

        "Do you think people really are thinking about this that hard at this point though?",

        "A lot of people say, well, I have nothing to hide.",
