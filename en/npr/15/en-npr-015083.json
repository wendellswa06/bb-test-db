        "A lot of the drugs made for humans are tested first on mice or other lab animals, although one of the big problems is that most drugs that work in mice don't work in people, leading to major disappointments and increasing the cost of developing new drugs.",
        "Scientists know that animals are unreliable stand-ins for humans, but they use them anyway.",
        "Today in Your Health, NPR's Richard Harris looks at efforts to avoid this particular pitfall.",
        "When scientists first started using animals in research over a century ago, the animals were not seen simply as little, furry people.",
        "Todd Preuss at Emory University says people studying rats were trying to learn about rats, at least at the start.",
        "As this process went on, people stopped seeing them as specialized animals and started seeing them more and more as prototypical mammals.",

        "The people who were selling these things - it wasn't strictly a financial interest.",
        "They really believed that you could do almost anything that you could learn about almost any feature of human organization - that you could cure almost any human disease by studying these animals.",
        "That was a dangerous assumption.",
        "Rodents have been on their own evolutionary trajectory distinct from ours for perhaps a hundred million years, so it should come as no surprise that a drug that works in a mouse won't necessarily work in a person.",
        "Even so, Preuss says, there's tremendous momentum to keep using animals as human substitutes.",
        "Entire scientific communities are built up around rats, mice and other animals.",
        "Once these communities exist, then you have an infrastructure of knowledge - how to raise the animals, how to keep them healthy.",
        "You have companies that spring up to provide you with specialized equipment to study these animals.",
        "Chances are, people studying the same disease you are used the same animal models.",
        "Journals and funding agencies actually expect it.",
        "So there's a whole institution that develops."
