        "I haven't heard any mention of them.",
        "I know they've got a straight-out electric car that can do 250 miles on a charge.",
        "Has there been any discussion on that one?",
        ": Bill Moore?",
        "Yeah, Tesla is actually - the latest story I heard is that Tesla's kind of leaked a little bit more information on their next car.",
        "They've taken 250 orders on the current, the Roadster model, which is, you know, a $100,000 vehicle, and I think that they're still in the middle of various certifications.",
        "Before they actually begin to sell that car to consumers, they want to make sure that it's met all the various crash-test certifications, so I think that's what they're in the middle of at this point.",
        "But they're also, I gather, beginning to start thinking about and doing some preliminary work on their follow-on car, which is going to be a sedan, a multi-passenger, I assume probably five-passenger sedan, again all electric, based on this same general concept.",
        ": Hopefully cheaper in price.",
        "Well, one would hope.",
        "You know, I mean with anything, you know, if you look at the cost of building a one-off vehicle, it's in the millions.",
        "You know, these custom concept cars that they roll out at these auto shows are, you know, multi-million dollar vehicles.",
        "So the more they build, obviously, the cheaper it ultimately becomes, and that's certainly what we're all hoping for.",

        "They had the perfect car 10 years ago, and they probably - they certainly have the plans in their computers and they've probably got the tool and die sets in their factories.",

        "They've very skeptical.",
        "You know, they've seen programs like this kind of announced, you hear comments from people saying well, it was really great for General Motors' stock price to not only announce the Volt but to also get selected as the car of the year and the truck of the year at the Detroit auto show this week.",
        "It's good for that, you know, it's good for PR, but there's no serious intention on their part.",
        "So you see this kind of ecstatic kind of interest and excitement that General Motors is able to create at these auto shows much like it did with its sequel, you know, its skateboard concept the previous years.",
        "But everybody sort of says, OK, well, General Motors is really good at building concept cars, but why don't we ever see those cars hit the road.",
        "And I think that's what everybody's waiting for.",
        "They really want to see the company actually have a program where I can go and I can buy that car.",
