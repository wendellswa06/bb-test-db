        "Dick Armey?",
        "Well, you know, that is a problem, because the fact of the matter is small-government conservatism is a system of values that is available to a lot of demographic groups, Hispanics as well.",
        "I think the fact is that you should understand - I mean, for example, if we insist that it is the prerogative of the federal government to define marriage in such a way as to preclude homosexual union, then why wouldn't we accept that another party, another majority might find it the prerogative of the federal government to define marriage in quite a different way?",
        "Perhaps the correct answer is it is not the prerogative of the federal government to define marriage.",
        "It's not the prerogative of the federal government to impose a standard of righteousness on people.",
        "And maybe the better thing to have done would have been to stay away from issues like that that were alienating a lot of people who might otherwise share a lot of our values and, in fact, resulted in no change of the law at all.",
        "It seemed to be nothing but a political exercise designed to embarrass the Democrats at the expense of the homosexual community.",

        "I think if you look at this in the long train of American history, while it was disappointing, it is not surprising that a two-term wartime president would experience this kind of setback."

        "Is Dick Armey right, though, that perhaps the party pandered too much to what he calls extreme social conservatives?",

        "I think if you - if you look at, actually, the way that the other party conducted themselves, they apparently didn't think that those issues were a liability.",
        "They deliberately went out and recruited more socially conservative pro-life candidates like Bob Casey in Pennsylvania after losing that seat in the two last elections with pro-choice candidates.",
        "Yet people like Heath Shuler, who was pro-life, pro-gun, socially conservative, win a tough race in North Carolina.",
        "I think what the Republicans have to recognize is that social - look, a political party is not a church.",
        "It's a political institution.",
        "And so you shouldn't let any one constituency dominate to the exclusion of others.",
        "But you want to hang a welcome side outside your party and let voters of faith and conservative values know that they're welcome, that you want them to participate and that you view them as an asset and not a liability.",

        "Well, that's exactly right.",
        "It's the big ten philosophy.",
        "But the fact of the matter is, if you look at election losses by Republicans during the last 20 years, George Herbert Walker Bush lost his reelection for president because the economic conservators were disillusioned with him.",
        "I believe the economic conservators were largely disillusioned with our people in parties now overspending excesses, earmarked excesses and so forth."

        "By contrast, when we try to mandate liberty in the Middle East with the use of force, we alienate thousands of people - whole cultures, religious sects and nationalities of people - and they, frankly, reject freedom as a better alternative and reject the United States and England.",

        "If you look at most of the public opinion polling, you know, somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 to 75 percent - depending on what state you're looking at - are going to vote to define marriage as between a man and a woman."

        "The fact of the matter is there was no effort among social conservatives to pass marriage amendments at the state level until after the Massachusetts Supreme Court decision - you know, basically imposing their view on the people of Massachusetts.",
