        "It shouldn't be - what matters is that these principles we can disagree with, but it's the use of the federal government with all its power to intervene in intimate relationships and intimate life and family life that we saw in the Terry Schiavo case, we see in the attacks upon gay people, we see in other areas that I think small government conservatives are very uncomfortable with and finally said, enough.",
        "We want our conservatism back from these people who have destroyed it and turned it into what it used to be against, which is the use of government to control freedom.",
        "If I could respond to that - I know there's been a lot of discussion about the Terry Schiavo case.",
        "I think there's a little bit of revisionist history about what happened there.",

        "That's all they did.",
        "They guaranteed them no outcome.",
        "They did not keep her alive.",
        "They did not order that she be kept alive.",
        "They asked the federal courts to review the situation, which they did.",
        "They denied the parents their appeal, her feeding tube was removed, and she died.",
        "All they said was because there's a disagreement, there should be federal appellate court - of the matter.",
        "If there is a disagreement within a family, the federal government should get involved.",

        "But since then, in the last three to four years, I've been not so excited about the Republican Party because they've moved away from small government, personal responsibility and fiscal responsibility, and those are the reasons that I'm a Republican.",
        "It's interesting you brought up the Terry Schiavo case, because that was the first case in which I started looking at the Democratic Party.",
        "And this last month I worked very hard for the Democrats this year, out here in Denver.",
        "And I have to say that hearing Dick Armey speak gets me very excited about the possibility of the Republican Party moving back towards leaving power at the state and local government level and away from the national government, and I think there are a lot of us out there that feel that way.",
        "The only thing that's a deal breaker for me going over to the Democrats right now would be if they moved toward socialized medicine.",

        "There was ideological mindset, a fundamentalist mindset at the heart of this administration which refused to look empirically at the matter on the ground.",
        "And that to me is also a conservative value, looking empirically at the facts just as it is.",
        "No visionaries, no utopias, just dealing with reality and enlarging liberty.",

        "Is this your natural home?",
        "Well, I think that it is the natural home, because I think that if you look at the formula for success for Republicans when they've done well since 1980, roughly over the last quarter century, it's been a limited government, lower taxes, economic growth, strong national defense, stronger families, safe neighborhoods, conservative values agenda.",
        "And essentially there have been three key constituencies, a strong national defense, patriotic constituency, previously anti-communist, now in favor of a forward strategy of victory over terrorism; a limited government, lower taxes, economic growth constituency; and then the third is the social and pro-family conservatives.",
        "And that's been a winning formula.",
        "It was in the '80s with Reagan, gave us our first majority in Congress in four years under Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey, and then of course we won three of the last four elections with that formula under Bush.",
        "So I think that, you know, as we've discussed earlier, the key is to not allow any one constituency dominate to the exclusion of others but have an inclusive strategy that says, look, here's where we are on the issues.",
        "If you disagree on a few issues, you're still welcome as long as you believe in freedom, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.",
        "I agree with Ralph, by the way, on that.",
        "The future is the - once again, the reaffirmation of a homogenized big tent, this constituency of liberty-lovers in different degrees and different issues.",
        "But to understand restraint of big government in the final analysis serves us all the best.",
        "But Andrew Sullivan, big tent implies people who are tolerant of each other's positions and don't demonize each other necessarily."
