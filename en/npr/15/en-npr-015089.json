        "Just chanting tax cuts, tax cuts is not enough to attract us anymore.",

        "Well, first of all, I'd say, you know, supply-side economics, Reaganomics, it was quite innovative in 1980, '82.",
        "Shouldn't have been.",
        "President Kennedy taught me that lesson as an undergraduate in 1962, the same lesson, cut taxes, do so smartly to encourage investment; the economy grows, revenue increases.",

        "Yeah.",

        "And that, of course, obviously is a whole host of officeholders, mostly in the Democratic Party, but their friends in the press and so forth and so on.",
        "The fact of the matter is consistently throughout the history of America, the rich have gotten richer and the poor have gotten richer.",
        "And we've all gotten more prosperous together.",
        "But there is nothing that raises the productivity, and hence the incomes of a laboring man or woman in this country more quickly and certainly than the innovation of science and engineering that's embodied in the capital that comes from the investment of those who saved and made the capital expansion in the first place.",
        "This is as old as The Wealth of Nations, first lesson...",
        "I agree with Dick Armey on almost all that, except I would say the one key element of 1994 was the Balanced Budget Amendment and the commitment of the Republicans to balancing budgets.",
        "That used to be a critical part of the reform movement.",
        "And they have not balanced budgets and they have increased the unfunded liabilities for the next generation from 20 trillion to 43 trillion in four years.",
        "That's not good conservative economics.",
        "Well, let me go back.",
        "Because, you know, when you make errant decisions it's oftentimes because you have an errant choice criteria.",
        "Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, the Contract with America, Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey for about the first five years for this majority, all of our decisions were governed by policy considerations about the future and respect of the past and the heritage of this country.",
        "Where the Republicans started going wrong in office is when they started letting their decisions be governed by an anxious devotion to political criteria.",
        "Politics is a morally and intellectually inferior occupation to economics or public policy of any stripe.",
        "And when you're making political decisions, they're about yourself, they're going to lead you to a bad place, and they did."

        "They were voted out because they were not listening to the people, and I believe that our nation has gotten to a point where they have lost so much - so much of our resources have gone to the war, there are so many unmet needs, that you're simply go to - no matter what party it is, you're going to have to listen to what the population is saying or people have now learned that we can just vote out incumbents who want to go for their own things.",
