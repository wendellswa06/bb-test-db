        "All of that would have been prevented with one brace, costing $20 maximum, but it wasn't put there.",
        "A lateral brace, like the one missing from this house, is typically required in coastal building codes.",
        "But in this rural area, just outside the city, there is no code, and Owens says there were plenty of homes that were damaged because of shoddy construction, like poorly installed shingles, unstable rafters or unsupported walls.",
        "Much of what I have seen could have been prevented if the homes had been built according to national building codes.",
        "Indeed, while much of the attention after the hurricanes focused on flooded houses in New Orleans, more than quarter-million Louisiana homes were damaged not by floodwater but by high winds.",
        "A Louisiana State University study blamed poor construction for almost 80 percent of Katrina's wind damage and the director of the University Hurricane Center, Mark Levitan, says that's why Louisiana needs a building code.",
        "You wouldn't buy a $3 lamp from Wal-Mart if it didn't have some sticker that said `Underwriters Laboratories, UL,' or something that says, `When I plug it in, I'm not going to get electrocuted; it's not going to short out.",
