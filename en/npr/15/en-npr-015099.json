        "There's a recognition on Xi Jinping's part that the Great Revival of the Chinese Nation, or the China Dream, is a lot more resonant with the public than the scientific concept of development.",
        "What's interesting about Xi Jinping is, in the United States context they would say he's a very skilled retail politician.",
        "China's new leader may have populist flair.",
        "But he could find himself hobbled by his own party.",

        "It's - for all of the big, national planning that goes on, this really is the work of thousands and thousands of officials of small towns, like Ocean City.",

        "That became audibly clear as the anti-Mubarak chants were suddenly drowned out by rallying cries of blood and sacrifice for Islam.",
        "(Soundbite of rally)",
        "To those who didn't get a clear picture of the scene - several hundred protesters hemmed in by a small army of Egyptian security forces - it may have sounded like the first stirrings of a dangerous Islamist uprising, which is something the Mubarak government has been warning the West about for years."

        "The difference between other political parties and the Muslim Brotherhood was the difference between building a house only with bricks, and the Muslim Brotherhood's house built with bricks cemented together using cement.",
        "By most accounts, the difference between the Muslim Brotherhood and the many other small Islamist societies in Egypt in the 1920s was Hassan al-Banna himself.",
        "He was a persuasive speaker and a stellar grassroots organizer.",
        "Within a decade, the brotherhood was established in every province in Egypt and well on its way toward recruiting as many as a half million members by the end of the 1940s.",

        "Al-Banna's youngest brother, 85-year-old liberal reformer Gamal al-Banna believes it was the torture the Muslim Brothers endured in Nasser's dungeons that drove many of them toward the extremist ideology of one of their fellow prisoners, Sayyid Qutb.",
