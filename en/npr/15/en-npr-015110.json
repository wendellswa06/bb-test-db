        "Yeah, we're pretty sure that the players and the owners will be splitting revenue somewhere near 50-50, and this marks big comedown from the players, who were under the last deal making 57 percent.",
        "But that's what this whole negotiation was about - that the owners looked at their books and expressed dismay that so many teams were losing money - they said 22 out of 30.",
        "And even though players disputed that particular amount, everyone knew that the economics of the NBA, the players had been getting paid so much that the league wasn't working out.",
        "Now, that it took so long to figure out what the new split would be, you know, shows you the acrimony involved, shows you the distrust involved.",

        "Yeah, I think this was a major - you know, within players there was a faction.",
        "Obviously, within any labor group, guys who just got in the league are going to have different wants and needs than guys who'd been there for a while.",
        "But among the owners, we knew that the small-market teams, which sometimes is a misnomer, but at least the teams who aren't worth as much, were really, really dead-set on getting as much as they could out of the players.",
        "There was a lot of cohesion among owners.",
        "We saw examples, like Mark Cuban, who's the owner of the Mavericks, which are a big-market team that makes a lot of money and would have done just fine if the players hadn't taken as much of a haircut.",
        "He was with the smaller-market teams.",
        "So, I think that and David Stern's, you know, tough negotiation tactics were one of the things that made the players come down so much in salary."
