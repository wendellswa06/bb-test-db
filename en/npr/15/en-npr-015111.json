        "I think the Change to Win Coalition has been very vocal about their issues, been very vocal about their efforts, and so I think for maybe the national labor leaders, it's sort of the talk of the town.",
        "For the central labor council leaders such as myself, we're anxious to head back to our cities and dig in.",
        "I think in LA, as I've said now for the last month consistently, is that we will keep the labor movement alive in Los Angeles.",

        "Steve Lerner, a lot being talked about.",
        "One of the things is that we're hearing from folks, `This does not come as a surprise.",
        "Some would say if that's the case, that perhaps unions in general in this country have been sleeping and allowing things to get to this point.",
        "Is that valid?",

        "Workers have been losing pensions.",
        "Wages are down.",
        "And it's because unions haven't organized, they haven't built a broad movement to lift workers out of poverty to make lives better.",
        "So we think far from this being a bad thing, that it's a wonderful moment to rebuild the house of labor around organizing, bringing people into the union who aren't in, and in places like our Los Angeles, where there are vibrant local labor movements, we're committed to being part of it and help them build it stronger.",
        "Yet much of this country has been built on a national labor front, if you will, the AFL-CIO.",
        "It would be hard to believe 20, 25 years ago if you fast forwarded to today to look at such a powerful union losing muscle, Martin Ludlow.",
        "What can happen to make sure and assure these workers that their clout, whether it be political, social or just working clout, will not be lost in all of this?",

        "I think the labor movement's muscle has been at the ground level.",

        "If you look, especially as your last guest was just talking about, the rising wages for African-American men, by and large, that's come from large-scale organizing in public sector arenas, and that's city by city, by county by county, by state by state.",
        "That hasn't been a national program, per se, and then, obviously, organizing in small-town America, or some of the large cities relative to the blue-collar industries, but the key point here is that the economy has shifted to a service sector economy.",
        "There's a globalization that's taking place.",
        "Companies are shutting down, leaving people behind, opening up the next day on the other side of the street under a different name, and, I think, as many people are talking about, now is we've got to figure out how to rise to that occasion.",
        "Steve Lerner, can you do that?",
        "We heard from Mr. Stern yesterday that he sees this economy now moving, shifting from a General Motors economy, union-heavy, to what he characterized as a Wal-Mart economy.",
        "Well, one of the reasons that SEIU is so excited and feels such urgency is we've added 900,000 new members through organizing.",
        "And, in Los Angeles, one of the things we're doing, with Martin Ludlow, is organizing the thousands of African-American security officers who don't have health care, who don't have decent wages, and we now have a national campaign organizing security officers.",
        "And if they win the union and get the same thing that janitors have in the same building, it will add literally billions of dollars into the poorest inner-city neighborhoods in the country.",
        "So we think this is a time of incredible opportunity, workers are unhappy, and that when we work on the grass roots--I agree with Martin--and build the labor movement there, combined with the national strategy and international strategy, that we can rebuild middle-class jobs and change this from a Wal-Mart economy to a good economy."
