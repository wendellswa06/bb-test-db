        "Martin Ludlow, I would agree with you in terms of the power of individual unions, particularly at local levels, depending, obviously, on what city you live, but I'll go back to my point of the national clout of a union, like the AFL-CIO, has had over the course of the years.",
        "Can we now perhaps see this movement from bottom up, and, perhaps, secure a more powerful union on all fronts on a national level?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "And I couldn't agree with Steve more.",
        "We have an opportunity right now.",
        "There's a reinvigorated debate about how we deal with the changing in the economy.",
        "I don't think there's any disagreement on the two different camps in terms of the necessity to organize the unorganized, the huge number of those working families that have fallen below the poverty line that are falling out of the middle class.",
        "The question is: How do we get there?",
        "And I think we all leave Chicago heading back to our cities and our counties and our states trying to figure out how we respond to that.",
        "And I think that nothing but good can come from that.",
        "Obviously, as a central labor council leader, I'd love to be going back with all of our membership intact and all of our unions intact, but I think right now we've got to dig in.",
        "We've got a lot of work to do, and I just think there's an energy about this country right now asking for labor to step up, take charge and return this country back to the working class people that really built it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Now, the way it docked with the space station, the robot arm had to go out and grab it, right?",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "Steve Lerner, before we let you both go and we appreciate your time, I'm an hourly worker working in Toledo, Ohio.",
        "I'm reading the headlines coming out of Chicago.",
        "I'm looking at the economy.",
        "I'm looking at what the United States has seen over the course of the last decade in terms of dwindling work force.",
        "Tell me something that I should feel good about my future.",
        "You should feel good about a group of unions and their members have said, `We're going to take our money, we're going to take our time, we're going to take our resources, our power, and we're going to organize.",
        "We're going to welcome you in no matter what country you are, no matter what race you are, and we're going to build and rebuild a movement that helps you take on the largest employers of the world, win health-care pensions and a decent life.",
        "You should feel good that there's a new commitment among a group of unions to building this movement so all workers are welcome and we have the power to really change this country and the world.",
        "All right.",
        "Steve Lerner, from the Service Employees International Union, and Martin Ludlow, of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, we thank you both.",
        "Greatly appreciate the update.",

        "NPR's Ruth Sherlock has been covering this attack.",
        "She's on the line now.",
        "Ruth, we just heard from this medical worker talking about what he saw in terms of this attack.",
        "But there are still a lot of questions about what exactly happened, how many people have died.",
        "Can you talk us through what you've learned?",
        "Well one of the problems with this is it's very hard to get independent confirmation because it's so difficult to get access to this area.",
        "The death tolls have varied a lot.",
        "Pro-opposition groups and rescue workers in the area say that 43 people died from chemical agent symptoms, but the number of fatalities is still very uncertain.",
        "And one of the reasons for that is that a lot of people are said to have died in their homes or in this building that were allegedly hit.",
        "And so they never made it to hospital, so doctors haven't been able to independently verify this.",
        "And then the other difficulty here is about exactly what the agent was in this alleged chemical attack.",
        "Some experts are saying it is possible that what happened was that chlorine gas cylinders hit a building directly where there were a lot of people, and those people were exposed to high dosages.",
        "They had a high exposure to this chlorine gas, which caused a much higher than usual death toll for this attack.",
        "And then the other option, which some experts are saying, is that it could be that there is a mixture here of different - of chlorine but also of something else, possibly a nerve agent.",
        "What are you hearing about the situation in Douma now in the aftermath of this?",
        "So in Douma today, there's just chaos.",
        "The big news there is that Jaish al-Islam, which is the last rebel group that controls an area in Eastern Ghouta, the suburbs near Damascus, has agreed to this sort of surrender deal that would see a lot of them evacuate on buses to another rebel-held part of Syria in the north of the country.",
        "So you've got this situation where people are still trying to establish the facts of what happened in this alleged chemical attack.",
        "And don't forget there's also been heavy, heavy bombardment of regular artillery and airstrikes on this area.",
        "And now people are sort of scrambling to collect their possessions and leave this area as the Syrian government moves in.",
        "In the meantime, what is the state of play in terms of the wider civil war?",
        "Well, the Syrian government has the upper hand in this war, and it's consolidating its control of central Syria, along with the help of its allies Russia and Iran and their militias on the ground.",
        "But there's still a long and complicated battle ahead for control of the whole country.",
        "You have territory around the border areas that are all embroiled in separate battles, many of them involving militias that are backed by different foreign countries.",
        "In the northeast, the U.S.",
        "is backing mainly Kurdish militias.",
        "You have Turkey supporting rebel groups in another northern province of Idlib.",
        "And whilst the Syrian regime has managed to use - to win territory using force to consolidate its control of these central areas, up in these border areas, it's also a political game.",
        "They also have to deal with the complex politics of dealing with all these different international actors.",
        "So they do have the upper hand in this war, but it's not over yet.",
        "That's NPR's Ruth Sherlock speaking to us from Beirut.",
        "Ruth, thank you.",
        "Thank you."

        "So even though Qualcomm kept saying it did not want to be bought, Broadcom has been pushing for the acquisition.",
        "But an important pivot here - the size of the deal was not actually the main reason why President Trump ordered to stop the buyout.",
        "Right.",
        "So walk us through that.",
        "Why did President Trump get involved in stopping this deal?",
        "So the history here is interesting.",
        "As you mentioned, Broadcom is based in Singapore.",
        "And only about four months ago - around the time that Republicans were writing the tax bill - President Trump welcomed the CEO of Broadcom to the Oval Office and praised his plan to relocate the company's legal address to the U.S.",

        "That's what SpaceX is planning for next, and they hope to have seats ready for travelers by 2015.",
        "So you can mark that in your calendar.",
        "How do you make this thing safe for astronauts?",
        "And could this private shuttle service to the Space Station, could that free up NASA to work on bolder ideas like, hey, like going to Mars and beyond?",

        "You know, there was a smooth abort.",

        "Well, they use it for that purpose.",
        "You know, on purpose they put trash in there that they need to get rid of, so it is kind of useful to have some spacecraft that are designed to be destroyed.",
        "But they have a lot of science experiments that they want to analyze back on the ground or hardware that went wrong that they need to look at, so this is providing a really necessary capability to do that.",

        "We never think that there is science going on up there, and you'd want to bring the results back.",
