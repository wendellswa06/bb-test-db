        "And Elon talks about going to Mars, right?",
        "That's right, that's right.",
        "And, you know, he seems like the kind of guy to do it.",
        "The hardware is already being worked on.",
        "You know, the heavy-lift rocket is just an upgrade of the Falcon 9 that took this capsule off to space that would be able to go a little bit further, to Mars.",
        "Why was the - there was that little glitch on the first day of launch where the rockets ignited and shut down.",
        "Why was the turnaround time so short?",
        "You know, we - sometimes when NASA does something, it takes days and days to turn it around.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "It was kind of amazing.",
        "I mean, it turned out to be that a valve inside one of the rocket engines was broken and, basically, that that very day, they sent in technicians to look up what was the problem.",
        "They found it.",
        "They replaced it.",
        "They tested it out, and they were good to go three days later.",
        "And I think that - I mean, it has to do the flexibility of having that smaller team, maybe, and it has to do with the simplicity of the design of the rocket compared to a space shuttle, which is just so much more complex and harder to reach the insides of it.",
        "Is that the normal way you would always dock?",
        "Or would you just be able to go right up there?",
        "Once it has people onboard, those people will probably do the docking by hand themselves.",
        "But this was kind of easier.",
        "They could install a totally autonomous docking system, but it's complicated and would require a lot more, sort of, safety precautions to make sure nothing went wrong.",
        "And it's just a lot easier to have astronauts reach it and grab it.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "We're talking with Clara Moskowitz, and she's talking to us about the SpaceX Dragon.",

        "We're now putting people on top of a rocket instead of on the bottom, like the shuttle was built.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And there's - the only rocket ever built for humans that did not have an escape system at the top was the space shuttle.",

        "So there's going to be an escape system - rocket escape system on the top of this rocket, also?",

        "Back to the future.",
        "But the space shuttle was a great vehicle.",
        "It did a lot of things.",
        "But it wasn't as safe as we wanted it to be.",
        "And it's so much safer to have the astronauts on the top of the stack of rocket, so that if something goes wrong below them, they can just kind of hop off in this launch escape system.",

        "But Atlas and Delta have been out there forever and are very reliable space vehicles.",
        "I'm just curious as to why NASA is going whole hog on SpaceX when I know that the others have the capabilities, but - and are also commercial, and are just sort of being, as near as I can tell, left out of this.",
        "Well, there's actually a lot of other commercial companies that are building capsules that they plan to fly on top of the Delta.",
        "So it's not that those are being completely left out.",
        "SpaceX decided to do everything in-house, from top to bottom.",
        "But almost - most of the other commercial companies, in fact, are just building the spacecraft and not the rocket, and those companies are still in the running to be the one that NASA goes with.",
        "There has been a lot of fanfare about Dragon being the first private craft to make it to the space station.",
        "But in the history of space flight, aren't - doesn't NASA farm out all the rocket ships and things like that, anyhow?",
        "What makes this so different?",
        "I mean, you know, I'm thinking of Lockheed, Martin Marietta - all of these companies back in history of space travel.",
        "They were there.",

        "The distinction is a lot more subtle than a lot of people make it out to be.",
        "Basically, in the past, NASA would buy a rocket or a spacecraft from a company like Northrop Grumman.",
        "Right.",
        "Now, they buy services.",
        "The company retains ownership of the vehicle.",
        "So it's just almost the technicality, but it does have different repercussions for how much control NASA has.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And give us an idea of the price point, as they say, price differential between NASA doing - let's say if NASA were going to take seven people up in a space shuttle and - and this Dragon, how much - that's got room for seven.",
        "It's like an SUV, you know.",
        "What's the cost difference in that?",
        "They haven't said the exact cost per launch for the crewed vehicle, but to give you an idea, SpaceX already has a contract for $1.6 billion for 12 flights of unmanned cargo delivery services.",
        "So that's - I mean, that's going to break down to be much, much cheaper than the space shuttle's services, or even Russia's Soyuz, which is how we're sending astronauts now.",
        "Those are about $60 million a seat, and SpaceX has promised to beat that, for sure.",
        "Well, if you do the little numbers quickly on the back of the envelope, like - it's sort of like 30 million, something...",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's - but those are for the unmanned flights, so the crewed flights could be more.",

        "Hi.",
        "I got a simple question that just occurred to me as I listen to what you're saying: Why can't they simply shut - slow down the speed of re-entry so the heat shields aren't a concern to begin with?",
        "Well, they do slow down the speed of re-entry with parachutes and stuff as much as they can, but, I mean, there's only so much you can do when you have to go from orbital speed to nothing in a short period of time.",
        "You're just talking about plowing through so much atmosphere and dissipating so much kinetic energy that there's going to be this huge heat problem.",

        "He's the only one who's saying publicly that he has plans to do this.",
        "A lot of people like BlueOrigin are so secretive.",
        "They keep everything so close to the cuff, and they're not really letting on what their plans are.",
        "So there are people we don't hear much about, space competitors.",

        "And their first launch is expected this fall, but that'll just be their very first test flight to orbit.",
        "So they are significantly behind SpaceX, but they're competing to do basically the same thing that Dragon is doing.",
        "And then you have a lot of - a whole bunch of companies, actually, competing for crew.",

        "So it doesn't make full orbit around the Earth, and it sounds like, oh, it's almost as good.",
        "But it's so much easier.",
        "It's such a completely different process.",
        "So they're - the Virgin Galactic ship that Burt Rutan is building, that could never, ever go to orbit, and it could never come back.",
        "It's just not built for that.",
        "So they basically - they can take tourists up and they can take brief science projects up, because they have about five minutes of weightlessness.",
        "And believe it or not, you can do some good research in five minutes if you have everything all set to go.",
        "But it's a totally different ballgame than orbital.",

        "Yeah.",
        "The Orion is basically a version of what NASA's working on to go beyond low Earth orbit.",
        "So they want to go to asteroids and the moon and Mars, and this is also the way that suborbital-to-orbital is a huge step up.",
        "Orbital to beyond low Earth orbit is another big step up.",
        "So NASA basically says: We can't work on a trip to an asteroid if we are also working on sending astronauts to the space station.",
        "We just can't do it all.",
        "We need to outsource this to the private sector, and meanwhile we'll go build ourselves a big rocket to go to asteroids.",

        "Because it's almost like been there, done that.",
