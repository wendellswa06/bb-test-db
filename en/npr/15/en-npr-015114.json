        "But whether it's a payload or whether it's passengers, astronauts, if an accident happens, you know, is this a liability for the private company and their insurance, or how does that work?",
        "It's actually a thorny issue.",
        "They're still trying to work out just what the laws are going to be because, basically, the private companies are saying: We can't do this if we don't have a liability shield.",
        "You know, that you just can't put that kind of liability on a private company.",
