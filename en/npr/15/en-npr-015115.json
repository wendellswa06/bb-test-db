        "They see one last chance to get billions of federal dollars for their states and cover hundreds of thousands of low-income people.",
        "But as NPR's Alison Kodjak reports, that effort faces some of the same political and ideological fights that played out in Washington.",
        "Kansas is overwhelmingly Republican and undeniably conservative.",
        "So it was a bit of a surprise last week when both houses of the state's legislature voted by wide margins to expand its Medicaid program.",

        "That's Kansas senator Barbara Bollier.",

        "The expansion is allowed under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.",
        "Thirty-one states plus Washington, D.C., have expanded their Medicaid programs.",
        "But after November's election, that momentum slowed because Republicans in Congress promised to repeal key parts of Obamacare, including Medicaid expansion.",
        "Now that the repeal effort appears to be dead in Washington, Bollier says it's time for Kansas to move on.",
        "We are not taking away the Affordable Care Act.",
        "It is the law of the land.",
        "We need to live in it and move forward.",
        "She says expanding Medicaid could cover 150,000 people who aren't now eligible.",
        "But many Republican lawmakers remain opposed to anything related to Obamacare, like Kansas Senator Ty Masterson, who compared the bill to a broken amusement park ride during last week's debate.",

        "I have had more excuses out of my Republican general assembly, none of them correct.",
        "The most recent argument was - is that this was going to be repealed.",
        "Well, now it's not.",
        "McAuliffe says about 400,000 Virginians could be eligible for the expanded Medicaid, and the federal government would send about $2.4 billion a year to the state to cover the cost.",
        "But he says lawmakers fear the political fallout of embracing anything related to Obamacare.",
        "But the problem is my legislature is terrified of the Tea Party.",
        "That's the only reason they're not voting for it - because they're afraid they'll get taken out in the primary, plain and simple.",
        "But Virginia lawmakers say they just don't trust the federal government will keep paying the Medicaid tab for the long term.",
        "So in Virginia, expanding Medicaid is still a long Shot.",

        "So this raised a possibility that was very concerning to U.S.",
        "officials that if Broadcom bought Qualcomm, the American company would get less research money to move ahead on 5G.",
        "And that, in turn, could give Chinese companies a big advantage.",
        "So is it unusual that the president intervened in an international deal?",
