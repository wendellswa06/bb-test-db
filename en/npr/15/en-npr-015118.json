        "I fooled around a little bit with it yesterday.",

        "Their own apps, you know, the web bro - the applications that they make that you use in the clouds, so to speak.",
        "Mm-hm.",
        "And that is indeed their intent here.",
        "If you are looking for a sort of a Google tie-in, it's simply that Google is making a big business out of providing applications that run off the web, rather than running off, you know, software you've installed on your computer.",
        "And they really want to make sure that you have a good experience in that.",
        "And as you can imagine, a lot of the testing that they would have done with this would have been using their own apps and tweaking it and tuning it.",
        "It should work fine for a lot of other web apps that are out there as well, if you go with what Google is saying.",
        "Mm-hm.",
        "But for people who are making a lot of intensive usage of websites, and a lot interactivity, this is definitely something you want to take to look at.",
        "Mm-hm.",
        "Is this an open-source browser?",
        "It is and it isn't.",
        "So, when Google put it out, they said this is open-source, and I think a lot of people had a real feel-good thing off of that.",
        "Look, it's - Google's not tying it to themselves.",
        "But they actually have released two sort of things.",
        "Google Chrome itself is Google's browser, and it'll get changed, and altered, and fixed in whatever way Google decides it wants to do, and then people use it.",
        "And we don't - as you pointed out - have a version for the Mac or for Linux yet.",
        "They've promised both of those, but there's no timeline for when they'll come.",
        "Apple's having some big announcement on Tuesday or something like that.",
        "Maybe they'll have part of that in there.",
        "They also released the code for anybody else to use the code and incorporate.",
        "So potentially Microsoft could say, hey, Internet Explorer 9, we're we're just going to use all the Google Chrome code, and build it up that way.",
        "So it's open source in that regard that anybody can make use of it, but it's not exactly open in that not everybody is going to suddenly change the distribution that Google puts out."

        "Thanks.",
        "Thanks.",
        "They quickly took that out, and also said that they would resend it for anybody who used it.",
