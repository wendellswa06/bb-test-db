        "Well, Madeleine, the attorney for one of the gentleman, attorney Kirk Osborne.",
        "He's sort of zoomed out of the courtroom as soon as the proceeding took place.",
        "And the only thing that he said is, you know, these are honorable kids; and they are absolutely innocent.",
        "And that's what the attorneys for the lacrosse players have been saying for weeks now.",
        "And they've been saying that because there has been no DNA evidence linking them to the crime?",
        "That's what they say.",
        "Of course--of course not too long ago, actually a couple of days ago, the district attorney for Durham County, he made note that all of the DNA evidence still isn't in yet.",
        "And so there may just be some DNA evidence that may come out later.",
        "But as of today, the evidence that came from our state bureau of investigation in Raleigh shows no link.",
        "There have been near-daily protests there in Durham; what's been the reaction today to these arrests?",
        "Well, also right after the proceedings in court, the NAACP held a news conference literally a block away.",
        "And in a way they're repeating what they've said from the beginning, as well.",
        "You know, they say the truth will, I guess, set us all free when we find out what happens.",
        "And to also let the justice system do what it has to do to make sure this is a fair and open process.",
        "But they also said they've assembled a group of attorneys.",
        "And the national NAACP is supposed to be assisting the state in, I guess, whatever needs to be done.",

        "Everybody's being pretty cautious.",
        "So the protests haven't been, I guess, as you would think, lively.",
        "They've been very, very calm and everybody wants calm in a city that's almost 50-50 black-white.",
        "And what's been the reaction there at Duke to these arrests, to the indictments?",
        "Pretty calm as well.",
        "In the very beginning we had--there were a few protests.",
        "But, actually, today, I'm hearing there's some signs around campus that read, you know, we support our lacrosse team.",
        "And so, in a city that is as diverse as Durham, in a way we've expected that.",
        "I mean, this case has really, in a way, divided a city that--blacks on one side, whites on the other.",
        "But the city, the president of Duke and the mayor of the city, and also the chancellor of North Carolina Central University, where the alleged victim is a student, they've all always presented this as a situation where, you know, Durham is a place where everyone has a forum; they can speak out, but, again, they're also calling for calm in the city."
