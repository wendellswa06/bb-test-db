        "A series you've been presenting over the last month on infrastructure, by the way, I think has painted a very clear picture of what's gone wrong with our national infrastructure system.",
        "We need a national vision and an integrated strategy, but this really has to be informed by the regional differences and a kind of bottom-up process of planning.",
        "Mega-regions are big systems of metropolitan areas like the Northeast Corridor that stretches from Boston to Washington.",
        "And they are the right scale for major infrastructure decision-making.",
        "For example, for big systems like high-speed rail, which Europe and Asia are literally thousands of miles ahead of us in developing.",
        "And so that would help us if we look to Asia and Europe and how they're dealing with their so-called mega-regions.",

        "But there's been at least a 50-year gap in national planning for comprehensive infrastructure across water systems, energy systems and transportation.",
        "You know, I would imagine that the founding fathers didn't really think about climate change as they were planning infrastructure.",

        "That and higher energy prices, which we've been reacting to around the country in recent months, represent new realities.",
