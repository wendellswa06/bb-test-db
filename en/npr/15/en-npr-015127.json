        "The Senate was constructed by our founding fathers, and then the subsequent evolution of the filibuster rule has turned the Senate into an institution that really can only operate on a bipartisan basis.",

        "It's an important city particularly because it's right on the major highway, which goes from Kabul and then heads south down to Kandahar, the major southern city.",

        "Last, night, I watched a number of, you know, very dramatic videos that had been - I guess gotten out by social media and other ways - showing, you know, buildings on fire, showing markets collapsing, showing people running, showing hospital corridors full of what may either have been, you know, bodies or wounded victims - very much an overwhelmed and intimidated scene.",
        "As best you can determine because it's hard to get there, in what way are the Taliban attacking the city?",
        "Have they gone in with a consolidated force?",
        "Are there just terrorists running around, doing things?",
        "What exactly is happening?",

        "We know that they've sent people from a variety of provinces, not just the immediately surrounding area.",
        "So this is a very serious attack."
