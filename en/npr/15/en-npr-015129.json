        "Associate director Olivia Ross says they negotiate rates 20 to 30 percent below what the companies used to pay.",
        "We're seeing even savings at the front end.",
        "Because Lowe's pays less for the surgery and because the hospital is responsible for all that care, Ross says there's incentive to be thorough.",
        "Then huge savings on the backend from things like reduced readmissions, reduced return to OR, lower rates of blood clots.",
        "Those are hugely expensive, preventable complications."
