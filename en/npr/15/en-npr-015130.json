        "Why in a world is Homeland Security or any government agency giving money, taxpayer money, to somebody for advertising?",
        "I guess it's a question for Homeland Security.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think so and, you know, let's face it, it would be great if NPR could be totally funded by listeners and then this would not even be an issue, and it would truly be run by the public.",
        "But it is still a corporation that well, it's a non-profit corporation, it still has people who work here in a budget and salaries, and so it is necessary that they take corporate underwriting.",
        "And there is more corporate underwriting than there is foundation underwriting.",
        "Let's get Patrick on the line, Patrick from Beloit, Wisconsin.",
        "Yes.",

        "But is there not a taxpayer money as well that goes to it otherwise, and I will take my other comments off the air.",
        "OK, Patrick.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Thanks, Patrick.",
        "It is fascinating.",
        "I think people believe that NPR personally gets a lot of money from the federal government.",
        "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting gives out money to the individual public radio stations around the country.",
        "And NPR gets about one or two percent of its budget from grants from - but, the money actually goes to the public radio stations, who use it to upgrade equipment, to improve distribution systems, or to purchase NPR programming.",
        "Let's see if we can get Jack, Jack is on the line from Hood River in Oregon.",
        "Hi, following on the last comment.",
        "I don't think the public is aware of all this moralism aside, how much federal funding has dropped for public radio stations and by inference, NPR.",
        "I associate with a local public station that does jazz, a non-profit.",
        "And part of the problem here, I think, is that the public doesn't realize that under this administration and particularly the policies that FCC has put forth, there has been a tremendous drop in the amount of public funding that's available to people like NPR and public television.",
        "And I just don't think the public is aware of the tremendous need in the time of economic need.",
        "Individuals aren't going be able to give, the government is, but they are not.",
        "So, I'll take the answer off the air.",
        "OK, Jack.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Well, I would - I don't really have a specific answer except that I'm sure all the public radio stations out there are happy to have you say that, Jack."

        "I - although I have a particular concern about guns and weapons of mass destruction, and companies who make them much the same passion as this fellow who spoke about alcohol, I was wondering if in general NPR does have or could this policy in which those of us who do contribute to public radio, in some form, could at least indicate our general moral ethics around which you could respond to, so that there is non-discrimination further that takes the listeners' views into account.",
        "Well, you donate - when you donate money, you do not donate directly to National Public Radio, you do it through your local station.",

        "Have there been examples where NPR pulled funding credits?",

        "That was what they equated with tyranny.",
        "So, what they do is manage and limit the power of government by separating and dividing it and keeping it close.",
        "Given that Americans' trust in its government has gone, you know, up and down probably more times than the stock market, is there a general way perhaps to say what effects there could be both long and short term of the public's lack of trust in government today?"
