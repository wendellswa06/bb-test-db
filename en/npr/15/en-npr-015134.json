        "And John McCain, I think, you pretty fairly, well, summed it up in the introduction.",
        "He is a man who came to Washington in the 1980s as a foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution to use his phrase.",
        "But over the years, he has been a maverick, you know, a backbencher at times, a contrarian within his own party.",
        "On immigration, voting against both Bush tax cuts, opposing the federal marriage amendment, McCain fined gold which many conservatives believe was an unconstitutional infringement on first amendment political speech.",
        "And I think that these issue differences combined with, you know, his personality, which has caused him at times to, you know, to sort of engage into some prickly exchanges with his foes within the party, are going to present some challenges should he be the nominee.",
        "I don't think they're in super bowl challenges, but they're going to be challenges.",
        "What are the main challenges for social conservatist?",
        "What needs to happen for social conservatist to get behind McCain?",
        "Well, I think that - you know, it's very interesting because we're really on unchartered waters.",
        "We - assuming that McCain emerges as the nominee, and I think it's premature to say that that would be the case, but clearly he's emerged as the front runner.",
        "But should he be the nominee, it will be the first time we've had a presidential nominee of the party who won the nomination while losing the votes of conservative and evangelical voters in the primary process.",
        "That may change, by the way, on Super Tuesday.",
        "We'll have to see.",
        "But the most recent exit polling data we have is from Florida and in Florida - which was a close primary, not open to independents - he carried only one in every five votes of very conservative voters, and about one in every four votes of self identified evangelicals.",
        "Does that mean then that the power of the evangelical wing of the Republican Party is seriously diminished?",
        "Is that essentially what that means?",
        "I don't know that I would use the term diminish, but I would certainly say it was fractured.",
        "Romney was getting about a third of that vote, meaning the self identified evangelical vote.",
        "Huckabee was getting about a third of it.",
        "Had I tall been able to coagulate behind a single candidate, it probably would have been enough to propel somebody to victory, say in Florida or South Caroline, but was divided.",
        "For example, if you look at the exit polls from - and even the precinct by precinct returns in upstate South Carolina, particularly, say Greenville Country or Spartanburg County.",
        "You know, Thompson was getting 20-25 percent of those votes.",
        "So he and Huckabee were splitting that vote and allowing McCain to break off right tackle.",
        "The truth is - the dirty little secret of Republican Party politics is that has really always been the case.",
        "In 2000, for example, George W.",
        "Bush got about 37 percent of the evangelical vote in Iowa, and the rest was divided among Alan Keys and Gary Bauer and Steve Forbes.",
        "So the front runner has always gotten his fair share, and then the others have split the rest, making it difficult for, say, the insurgent candidate to gain critical mass.",
        "The question is what will happen should McCain become the nominee having done so poorly among the grassroots conservatives of the Party?",
        "And I think…",
        "Well how do you explain that McCain is in the position that he's in right now?",
        "Does it mean that the party itself, not just the evangelical vote but the party itself is very badly fractured and is that the explanation for it?",
        "If this candidate that so many people are unhappy with is - seems to be rising to the top?",
        "Well I think there are probably two main explanations.",
        "The first is it is the first election since 1952 when you have not had an incumbent president or vice president seeking the nomination of his party.",
        "In the case of the Republican Party, of course, that means there was no clear front runner.",
        "There was no obvious place to go and the result was that everybody scattered.",
        "I mean it was like watching a bunch of 10 year olds all trying to kick the soccer ball at once.",
        "You had everybody running to Thompson for a while, and then everybody running to Romney for a while and people couldn't really figure out, you know, who is the bona fide conservative in this race."

        "And I think the second reason for it, beyond the obvious appeal of McCain as a candidate, and he's a very appealing candidate with his biography and his status as a former POW, you know, straight talk and all the other attributes they bring in to the race, is the fact that all the other candidates, in one way, shape, or form, had some flaws that made it hard for them to really set the base on fire.",
        "So in the case of Romney for example, he had been pro-choice, and then became pro-life.",
        "Certainly they welcomed his conversion, but it meant that there were questions about why hadn't he been there earlier.",
        "In the case Rudy Giuliani, he was openly pro-choice and had been as mayor of New York City.",
        "In the case of Fred Thompson, he got in and for a while looked like he might be the flavor of the month, but then he said that he oppose the Human Life Amendment and oppose the Federal Marriage Amendment.",
        "So nobody, in the way, say Reagan did in '80, or George W.",
        "Bush did in 2000, was really able to solidify and unify all those grass roots conservatives.",
        "We're talking about…",
        "And McCain was clearly the beneficiary of that.",
        "We're talking with Ralph Reed about what it means to be a Republican this election year.",
        "If you'd like to join our discussion, the number is 989-8255.",
        "If you are a Republican, which candidate are you looking at and are you thinking you might have to settle on a candidate this year.",
        "I'd like to get another guest in this discussion.",
        "Now Ross Douthat is senior editor at The Atlantic and a blogger at theatlantic.com, and he joins us here at in Studio 3A.",
        "Good to have you with us.",
        "Great to be here.",
        "You've been listening to Ralph Reed.",
        "I wonder if you agree with his analysis of what's going on internally within the Republican Party right now and - as we're seeing it reflected in this - what has been kind of a confusing up until now sort of a nomination process, and now seems to be solidifying, it looks like, around McCain.",
        "We need to look at - we need to look at the constitution and what that authorizes.",
        "And then look at what the government currently does.",
        "It has far exceeded that and it's time for that to stop.",
        "And I really feel strongly about that.",
        "I can tell."

        "(Unintelligible) Ron Paul if I have to.",
        "Sure.",
        "I actually agree with a lot of what Ralph said.",
        "I do think that there's something else going on here too, though, which is that the Republican brand in a certain way is weaker than it's been, maybe, in a generation.",
        "If you look at polls, not only of President Bush's job approval rating but other indicators like party identification nationally is going against the Republicans to a greater degree than in decades; fund raising for the Democrats is off the charts, for the Republicans it's stagnant or falling.",
        "And so it make sense that a party in a time of transition when it's possibly weaker than it's been in a while would become fractured as the various - not just the various candidates but the various interest groups within the party.",
        "As Ralph said, they're all trying to kick the ball but part of why that's happening is that they all see an opportunity to reinvent the Republican Party in various directions.",
        "So for instance, early in the race, you saw a lot of hawkish, socially liberal Republicans rallying around Rudy Giuliani.",
        "Seeing in, you know, the current Republican moment a chance to reshape the party at that direction.",
        "And similarly, the rise of Mike Huckabee in Iowa in particular can partially be attributed to a lot of social conservatives saying, you know, look, we've sat on the sidelines long enough.",
        "This is our chance to have one of our own win the nomination and so forth.",
        "So in a way, I mean, the worse case scenario for the Republicans is that they're at a position a kin to where the Democrats were, say in 1972, coming at the end of a long period of dominance where, you know, that dominance is ending.",
        "It's not clear where the party goes next and so everyone's jocking for control.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I want to get into this.",
        "We're going to have to take a break shortly but the Republicans, you know, during that period when they were in their heyday like to think of themselves as the party with the ideas.",
        "Is that time over or is the party bereft of ideas at the moment?",
        "Is that part of the problem?",
        "Well I do think that if you look particularly on the domestic front, at some of the issue that the Republican majority was built on; crime, taxes and so fort, the Reagan revolution, for instance, happened at a period of high crime and high taxes.",
        "Now taxes are low, crime is low, so the Republicans at least need some new issues with the risk to pursue voters.",
        "All right.",
        "We're going to continue talking about that when we return.",
