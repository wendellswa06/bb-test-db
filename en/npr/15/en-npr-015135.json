        "On the other hand, if Sen.",
        "McCain wins the nomination and can't unite his party and can't bring conservatives on board in a very competitive race - and I think this will be very competitive - you know, that can be a liability.",
        "So the challenge for Sen.",
        "McCain should he become the nominee is how does he unite his party and bring conservatives into his campaign in larger numbers without losing what is clearly his best asset which is that maverick, straight talker who will call it like he sees it without respect to party orthodoxy, it's going to be very hard, I think, to pull off and in fact, last year, when he went to Liberty University and spoke at the commencement of Jerry Falwell University and when he reversed himself on taxes, he had voted against the Bush tax cuts and then announced that he wanted to make them permanent, they were many in the commentary than in the media who said, hey, whatever happened to Mr. Straight Talk?",
        "So - I'm not saying he can't pull it off, but it'll be interesting to watch.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks so much for joining us today, Ralph.",
        "You bet, Lynn.",

        "I'd like to continue with what we just heard Ralph Reed talking about and that is the challenges for John McCain.",
        "This person who's kind of seen as a straight talker, a maverick who can deal with the other side of the aisle if need be.",
        "And you know, at the same time, he has to appeal to that Republican conservative base.",
        "Can he do it?",
        "How can he do it?",
        "Well in my opinion, there are two different critiques of McCain happening now in the right.",
        "And the first one is programmatical.",
        "It's people who disagree with him on campaign finance reform, or immigration reform, or climate change, or any one of the several issues in which McCain differs from conservative orthodoxy.",
        "And then, though, there's the - what you might call a characterological critique of John McCain.",
        "This is what you've mainly find a lot if you listen closely to the talk show host, the conservative radio talk show host and some bloggers.",
        "They dislike him personally.",
        "And it's not really political, actually.",
        "It's his temperament; it's their view that he can't be trusted.",
        "It's their view that he's - his reputation for heroism, he wears it on his sleeve or the - he caters to media taste.",
        "This critique isn't about politics at all.",
        "And why is that dislike so deep?",
        "I have to admit that I haven't completely understood that.",
        "That really a most vitriolic dislike for John McCain that you hear coming from some conservative circles.",
        "Ross?",
        "Well, I think part of it is just the impression that he likes attacking his fellow Republicans more than he likes attacking Democrats.",
        "And that's…",
        "What's an example of that?",
        "Well, I mean, if you - some of it is just the tone.",
        "The sort of - the sense that he - and you saw it on the 2000 campaign where it was - John McCain never seemed happier than he was likening the Bush campaign that he was running against to Darth Vader and himself, to Luke Skywalker.",
        "And never seemed more in his element than - when he was going after Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson as agents of intolerance.",
        "And then if you look at the way he talks about Hillary Clinton say, or Barack Obama, either of whom are - could be his opponents in the fall.",
        "He's always very respectful.",
        "He, you know, he treats them as friends in a way he doesn't treat his fellow Republicans as friends.",
        "Although, I would disagree with Matt a little bit.",
        "I think that the characterological and the political critiques overlap.",
        "I think that a lot of the anti-McCain voices see the fact that for instance he loves to carry favor with the media and both a character flaw and something that will, you know, lead to him perusing more liberal policies if he's in the White House.",
        "You know it's kind of stunning to hear someone like Ann Coulter.",
        "We had a piece of tape with Ann Coulter on Fox saying, well, you know, if it's going to be McCain, we'll have to work for Hillary Clinton because you've also been hearing, well, the one thing that's going to unite Republicans in the end, perhaps, is if Hillary Clinton is the nominee that, you know, there is a such dislike for the Clintons that that would, in one way, unite.",
        "So to hear someone like Ann Coulter, tongue-in-cheek, who knows if she really means it.",
        "But just to even hear her say something like that…"

        "No, but it's like - it's like one of those little signals of how (unintelligible), I think, maybe.",
        "No.",
        "But what's strange though is it didn't really come out until the last week and a half when it suddenly became clear that John McCain was going to become the front runner, and then there was this outpouring of anti-McCain sentiment that you really hadn't heard through out the campaign.",
        "And it often seemed like a lot of the movement conservatives spent more time worrying about Mike Huckabee earlier in the race and attacking him as not a real conservative.",
        "And then - and yet now you hear Ralph Reed saying, well, Huckabee is a real conservative, Romney is a real conservative, McCain isn't.",
        "But this has come very late in the game and I'm not sure why that is.",
        "Coulter's statement just speaks to how much it isn't political, though.",
        "For her - for Ann Coulter who's a thorough bred conservative, there is no issue on which she is not at the farthest right on.",
        "Right.",
        "For her to say that she would support Hillary Clinton over John McCain just goes to show that it's totally based on his personality, a deep dislike of him personally.",
        "Because there's - but, I mean, yes he's a centrist on some issues, but if you look at the totality of both candidates clearly, as a conservative, you would go with the more right leaning one and that would be John McCain in this case.",
        "My comment is, is that one thing to look at is electability.",
        "McCain is widely know for being a critic in the Republican Party, and with the Republicans, well, not being very popular, he has electability issues.",
        "Another example is his credibility as far as they like the war is concern.",
        "All the Republican candidates strongly support the war but John McCain is the only one who actually has credibility of all that.",
        "With his experience in Vietnam, military background and being head of the arm services committees.",
        "As such…",
        "So you think that John McCain is the most electable candidate.",

        "Versus, say, it more like Hillary Clinton?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "You choose from the other candidates, sure that means more conservatives and may be more Republican appealing, but realistically, we have to deal with independence and widely unpopular views of the Republican Party.",

        "Thanks fro your call, Roger.",
        "Matt Continetti, what do you think about that?",
        "I mean is that why Republicans are beginning to sort of move in McCain's direction as they think maybe he is the one that's electable?",
        "It's just like McCain's mom said a few weeks ago.",
        "That sooner or later the Republicans wouldn't like it but they'd have to hold their noses and vote for her son John McCain.",
        "And the electability argument, I think, is a strong one there in terms of McCain's appeal to independence.",
        "However, McCain is, by no - in my opinion, by no means a sure deal to win the general election if he is the Republican nominee, and his electability can change.",
        "Things change over time and this is a long campaign.",
        "For one thing, the critiques of his character that you now hear coming from the right will soon come from the left.",
        "And for another thing, McCain has moved rightward over the course of the campaign, whether it's on immigration or on taxes.",
        "And so an opponent, whether it's Hillary Clinton or whether it's Barack Obama, would be able to say that perhaps this person, McCain, is not as straight talk as he makes himself out to be.",

        "I'm a 54-year-old white lifelong conservative Republican, but this year, for the first time in my life, I have contributed to a political campaign.",
        "Barack Obama represents to me the change we so desperately need.",
        "My children's generation are angry, as they should be, at the mess my generation has made of our country's affairs.",
        "What we need is someone to inspire us to the cause, the changes - to change.",
        "One person, even the president cannot change everything, but one person can inspire all of us to see the change is finally made.",
        "That is a very interesting e-mail from a Republican saying that she's going to support Barack Obama.",
        "And before I ask you two to respond to it, I do want to remind our listeners that you are listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And, Ross, what's your reaction to that?",
        "I have - this is not the first time that I've hear Republicans say they might be able to support Barack Obama.",
        "I mean, I think it suggest two things.",
        "First, that voters care a little bit less about issues and more about more intangible issues of personal appeal than, say, people in Washington do.",
        "Because by almost any measure, I think Barack Obama is to the left of Hillary Clinton on the issues.",
        "And if you look at their voting records in the Senate, that's (unintelligible) out.",
        "But -and yet, Hillary Clinton inspires this visceral, almost revolution among many Republican voters in a way that Barack Obama simply doesn't.",
        "And that segues into my second reason for the sentiments the e-mailer expresses, which is that Obama has mastered the ability of disarming Republicans without agreeing with them.",
        "And you see this particularly in his recent book, \"\"The Odasity of Hope.\"\" Merely by summarizing conservative arguments on issues ranging from taxes to abortion to judicial appointments, and being respectful about conservative opinions, he make conservatives like him even though he isn't actually taking any conservative positions.",
        "He's just saying, you know, here's what conservatives believe.",
