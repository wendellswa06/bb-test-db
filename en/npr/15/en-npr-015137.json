        "California for many years has been the epicenter of ballot measures.",
        "Amy Standen is a science reporter for member station KQED.",
        "She's been reporting on Proposition 37 there, that's a ballot initiative that would require labels on raw or processed foods that contain genetically modified ingredients, among other things.",
        "She joins us now from their studios in San Francisco.",
        "Nice to have you on the program with us.",
        "Hi, Neal, good to be here.",
        "And Prop 37, exactly what would it require?",
        "Prop 37 would require that every food item sold in a grocery store that contains genetically engineered ingredients would have to have a label on it, a little label on the back that would say made with GMO.",
        "And basically that would amount, unless food manufacturers start changing the ingredients pretty quickly, it would be almost everything kind of in that middle of the supermarket, so.... Crackers, cereals, cookies, candy, sodas, that kind of thing.",
        "And who's in favor, who's opposed?",
        "Well, the people who have sponsored this proposition, the Yes on 37 crew, say that consumers basically have a right to know.",
        "It's a right to know issue for them.",
        "They say that the science on these products is still uncertain, that we don't completely know that they're safe.",
        "And they point to Europe, where this kind of labeling has been happening for almost a decade.",
        "And they say why shouldn't we also, here in the States, have access to this information.",
        "And those opposed, are they food manufacturers who are worried that people are not going to buy their products?",
        "Exactly, I mean the fear there is that GMO basically has become sort of a scarlet letter and that if you start putting these made with GMO labels on products that consumers aren't going to buy them.",
        "And one of the reasons this is generating so much heat and so much money, really, is that California is a huge market.",
        "So if we start seeing those labels in our stores here in California, it's very likely that's going to become sort of a national label, as well.",
        "It's just not really worth it for food manufacturers to make two sets of packages."

        "And how is this playing out on the ground?",
        "There's not going to be much advertising for the presidential campaign there in California, solidly blue state, but is this all over TV and radio?",
        "It certainly is.",
        "I mean, what we're seeing is the sort of expenditure of a very, very expensive and well-funded campaign on the no side.",
        "So the no people, the anti-labeling group, has outspent - I'm sorry, outraised the yes camp by a factor of about five to one.",
        "They've raised about - almost $40 million.",
        "And that's been a barrage of TV ads.",
        "And, you know, I can tell you as a reporter that any story that we do on this generates more email instantly than any other topic that we've been covering.",
        "It's become a really, really heated debate.",
        "And I also understand at least according to opinion polls, despite that disparity in fundraising, Prop 37 looks set to pass.",
        "It just might.",
        "It's interesting to see that the money is not necessarily going to carry the day here.",
        "Recent polls - until really recently, when the ads started ramping up - we were seeing about 60 to 70 percent of Californians in support of the law, so supporting labeling.",
        "There was a recent poll that suggests that might be slipping a little bit, but it's sort of unclear how the question was framed on that poll.",
        "It still looks pretty likely to pass.",
        "Would this proposition affect other labeling issues?",
        "As you know, there's all kinds of vague and impossible-to-define claims on all kinds of food labels, made with natural products, for example, you know.",
        "Well, the word natural, which has until now been an unregulated term, would now take on a new meaning, which is does not include genetically engineered ingredients.",
        "So a food maker could not put that word natural on, you know, a box of cereal or granola or whatever if it had a GMO product in it.",
        "Made with whole grains?",
        "Yes, you know, I'm not really sure.",
        "I don't think the language there has really been spelled out, and that's really one of the criticisms of this law, is that it is vague, that the organic label already includes - you know, if you want to sell something as organic, it already can't have GMOs in it.",
        "And so the labeling, you know, it sort of remains to be seen how it would play out."

        "And Canada has actually decided to pay the entirety of the bridge because of the need for the additional capacity crossing for trade purposes.",

        "You know, I haven't checked on the polling, but yeah, he's right in summarizing this issue.",
        "From what I understand, Detroit and Windsor have already come to an agreement to build a publicly funded and supported bridge, and this initiative's passage would essentially stop that in its tracks.",
        "And, you know, this is an instance of something that happens frequently in the initiative process, where a proponent, a business or a corporation or even an individual can qualify something for the ballot that with passage would ultimately support their own financial interests.",
        "It's something that is illegal in the legislative process; you can't bribe a legislature to make what you want to happen policy-wise, and it's really why the initiative process came about in the first place, was to stop this from happening in state legislatures.",
        "So it's particularly ironic to see it happening so frequently in the initiative process.",
        "Sonny, thanks very much for the phone call."
