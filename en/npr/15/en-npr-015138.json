        "And it's no secret that California's fiscal situation has been dire for a number of years, and I think it's accurate to say that the cost of prison is a significant chunk of the state budget.",
        "So in addition to Proposition 34 that would repeal the death penalty, they also have Proposition 35 that would increase penalties for human trafficking and certain sex offenders, and Proposition 36, which would amend the three-strikes law.",
        "And remember, this is something that was passed by initiative originally a couple decades ago, and it says when you're convicted of a third felony, you go to prison for life.",
        "And what this measure would do is revise that so that you only go to prison for life if your third felony is serious or violent.",
        "You know, there's that story out there that maybe is an urban legend, I don't know, about the guy who stole a pizza and ended up going to prison for life.",
        "So it's aimed at cases like that, whether that one is really true or not, only putting the serious and violent felons in prison for life, which presumably would be a significant cost savings in the California budget.",
        "And as you mentioned in passing, the governor's measure that would raise I think the sales tax and allow him to increase taxes on the wealthiest Californians or, he would argue, institute draconian budget buts.",
        "Yeah, and, you know, there are actually two measures on that topic in California this year.",
        "There's Proposition 30, which Governor Brown was the chief sponsor of.",
        "It temporarily raises the sales tax and income taxes for income in excess of $250,000 and gives the money mostly to K-through-12 education and community colleges but also fills budget gaps.",
        "But there is a competing measure, it's Proposition 38.",
        "It was sponsored by an attorney in Pasadena, and it would increase the - just the income tax, not the sales tax, for all but the lowest earners in the state, and it's on a sliding scale so that if you earn more, you pay more.",
        "And that would give the money to pre-K through 12.",
        "And historically, seeing two initiatives on the ballot in a single election that are in competition with each other, they both address the same subject, has been the kiss of death for both.",
        "Voters sort of say, you know, I don't know exactly what the difference between these two is, and I can't suss out the details, but I know what the law is now so I'm going to go ahead and vote no against both, sort of the status quo is the safe choice.",
        "We'll have to wait and see if Governor Brown's involvement in Proposition 30 might be enough credibility added to that measure to, you know, to change the history on that sort of supposition.",
        "Andrew Yeager is a reporter with member station WBHM in Birmingham, Alabama.",
        "He's been following a local measure there, Amendment 4, which would change the Alabama state constitution to remove Jim Crow-era language about racial segregation in schools, and he joins us from a studio there.",
        "Nice to have you with us today.",
        "Good to be with you, Neal."

        "And what language are we talking about?",
        "This is language that deals with poll taxes, that deals with segregation of schools, language that, you know, really doesn't apply in practice anymore because the courts have overturned these practices.",
        "But this particular language is still in Alabama's constitution, kind of a lingering legacy of Alabama's Jim Crow past.",
        "And yet as I understand it, some African-American groups are saying wait a minute, we don't want this change.",
        "Exactly, yeah.",
        "We've had several prominent African-American lawmakers who have spoken out against it.",
        "In fact just today, there was an open letter that a prominent black legislator released calling it a wolf in sheep's clothing.",
        "And the issue is that they say that it undoes language or it doesn't adequately guarantee the right to an education, and so while that Jim Crow language may be bad, the education issues are important enough that they don't want it removed.",
        "Because the constitution as it stands requires the state to provide education for everybody, and they're worried that this new language might not.",
        "Exactly, exactly, in fact this same letter from this lawmaker says that, you know, people may have different interpretations of this language.",
        "They may see this provision differently, but it's better to be safe than sorry, as he put it.",
        "We have a caller from Alabama on the line.",

        "Hi Neal, I did have my eye on this amendment.",
        "It's kind of unfortunate that, you know, it's still an issue.",
        "It should obviously have been gotten rid of long ago.",
        "But actually I also had my eye on an amendment that's going to just precede it on the ballot in November that's not quite as high-profile, but I think it kind of speaks to why maybe Alabama has, you know, so many of these outdated - so much outdated language and provisions that, you know, are kind of, you know, cropping up a long time after they've really been an issue.",
        "It's Amendment Three, that it would - it's kind of boring, but it would define - yeah, it would define a landmark district in the town of Stockton.",
        "And I think, if I understand the language right, it would prevent it from being incorporated into the town or something along those lines.",
        "But I think it's a good example of the problems that the constitution, as a whole, has because unlike most other states, there are - most issues in other states would be decided by local laws, local statutes, tax issues, especially."

        "In Alabama, they have to go to a statewide vote as a constitutional amendment.",

        "It's longer than the U.S.",

        "Well, Elizabeth, I do have the skinny on this, you know?",
        "It's one of the ongoing issues with the Alabama Constitution.",
        "I don't know the exact number of amendments, but you're definitely in the ballpark there.",
        "And that's one of the things that I think is frustrating for voters and lawmakers, public officials in Alabama, is that there are so many things written into Alabama's Constitution that really are local issues that just affect this town or this county.",
        "But the way the system's set up, those things have to go to a statewide vote.",
        "So for us here in Birmingham, we see things in our ballot that only pertain to people down in Mobile, on the coast, hundreds of miles away.",
        "And...",
        "And I think - I just want to say real quick, I think it's kind of ironic in a state where so many people prize, you know, state rights and local control that actually things would be so centralized, especially when it comes to things like taxes, that, you know, people in one town see their destiny as being controlled by everyone else in the state.",
        "You really, you know, don't really know or care about, you know, the local issues that are going to be on the ballot.",
        "And is there any move, Andrew Yeager, toward having a constitutional convention to rewrite this and correct it?",
        "There have been ongoing moves off and on.",

        "That group continues to meet, continues to advocate.",
        "And actually, another couple of amendments that'll be on the Alabama ballot deal with rewriting two specific sections of the Alabama Constitution; one dealing with banking, one dealing with corporations.",
        "And so that seems to be the strategy right now for advocates of constitutional reform, is to rewrite the constitution section by section.",
        "But, of course, that takes quite a while, and it doesn't have quite the pizzazz of a constitutional convention.",

        "People are weary of hearing Big Tobacco's excuses, and the tax revenue is dedicated for schools, much like the casino revenues.",
        "And, well, taxes not just in Missouri, but it's a perennial ballot measure.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, you know, the Missouri Proposal B has two things going in favor of it when you look back at this historical data.",
        "One, is that it raises cigarette taxes, and the other is that the money primarily benefits education.",
        "And when you look at the data on voter behavior over the last two decades on tax increase proposal from the ballot, they tend to reject them in large numbers.",
        "About 32 percent of all of the proposed tax increases over the last two decades have been approved, just 32 percent.",
        "But tobacco tax increases are approved at a much higher rate as are tax increases that would benefit education.",
        "About 40-some percent of those have been approved by voters.",
        "So this question in Missouri this year has both of those historical trends working in its favor."
