        "She was considered the early front-runner.",
        "But lately, her poll numbers have been slipping.",
        "And that may have a lot to do with the deal Quinn struck to overturn the city's term-limits law, allowing Mayor Michael Bloomberg to win a third term.",
        "The third term is hanging around her neck.",
        "Christina Greer teaches political science at Fordham University.",
        "She's essentially been branded with the mantle of, you are Bloomberg's mini-me, and you made the third term happen.",
        "I don't think that that's necessarily 100 percent of the story.",
        "But that is the narrative that's attached to her that she just can't shake.",
        "Quinn's slide in the polls has coincided with the rise of another big personality: Anthony Weiner, the former congressman who resigned after tweeting lewd pictures of himself to women who are not his wife and then lying about it.",
        "Weiner has gotten a lot of attention since he jumped into the race in May, though he acknowledges that some voters will never trust him again.",
        "Well, what I suggested is they can't be the same sort of news organization in the future as they are today.",
        "The Seattle PI had a staff of about 160 people.",
        "They now have a budget for 20 people.",
        "So they will not be able to go to all the meetings, cover all the beats, be at the police station 24/7 to watch what's going on in town.",
        "Rather, they're going to have to stylize their coverage.",
        "They're going to have to pick their shots, and they're going to have to use content from other sources.",
        "And in fact, they've announced this morning that they're going to be getting content from many of the magazines published by their parent, Hearst Corporation, as well as linking to what they say is going to be 150 local bloggers.",
        "So, they will be aggregating content, organizing content, stylizing content, and then they'll have some of their own signature coverage from their own people.",
        "I think that's going to be the future, certainly for online coverage for newspapers.",
        "It will be different than the type of coverage that newspapers have done in the past because in the past, newspapers have tried to put their own touch on every story and to provide deep and authoritative coverage across a broad range of matters in a community.",
        "So, it's going to be different going forward into the future.",
        "Well, here is one of the concerns I know that I have - and a lot of fellow journalists have - is, OK, it all sounds well and good to get a bunch of free content from bloggers, but how do journalists, quality journalists survive if we're not getting paid for a work?",
        "A journalist - a good journalist is certainly worth as much as a good neurologist, as far as I'm concerned.",
        "Quality journalism, where people are deeply and objectively reporting, providing a balanced analysis of what they find and presenting it in a compelling way - I think those things are awfully important, now more than ever, because in this world, anybody anywhere can create content, anybody can put up a video, put up a blog.",
        "Anybody can jump into Wikipedia and change facts.",
        "Now more than ever, we need people who are operating from a professional standpoint in front of the professional values that journalists have.",
        "And when a newspaper goes away, these other types of media - blogs, newspaper, even NPR - don't quite fill the gap that's left when a newspaper and its large staff goes out of business.",
        "Allan, one last, quick question.",
        "There's a picture on your blog of those very distinctive, bright-orange delivery boxes for the Seattle PI.",
        "Where do you think all those will go?"

        "Now, Facebook say they don't sell data, but they certainly make money out of it.",
        "And I think one of the things that concerned us was whether some of the developers that work with Facebook get preferential access to data depending on how valuable that relationship is.",
        "I think there was something else, which is potentially an antitrust issue, which is the dominant position Facebook has I think allows it to pick winners on its platform.",
        "There are big questions about the way in which they use their power.",
        "The final thing I think which is I think particularly significant is are users giving informed consent when they give data to Facebook?",
        "Mr.",
        "Collins, why should anyone be worried about that?",
        "Is it just what you would expect a business to do, maximize the information it has and reward the most promising relationships?",
        "I think we all understand with these sorts of social media tools they're free to use, but in some ways, you're giving your data to the company.",
        "The company makes money out of that by selling advertising.",
        "But the question is are we giving up far more data than we realize?",
        "And then what happens to that data when the company has it?",

        "I think with things like disinformation where people are spreading lies maliciously and with the intent of trying to influence maybe how people vote in an election, I think we need to take responsibility there, too, particularly as deepfake technology will soon make it easily available for people to create fake films of politicians giving speeches they've never given that could be released during an election campaign.",

        "And then after it's gifted, well, then the individual who receives it can do whatever they want with it.",

        "It contains thousands of items and - thousands of small items, I should stress, because it fits onto a tiny little duffle bag that sits in a locker, never to be touched by the astronauts during the flight that flies on every mission to be able to give something back to the people that support NASA and the astronauts' mission."
