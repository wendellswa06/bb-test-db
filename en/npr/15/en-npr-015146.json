        "Well, we've had quite a number that were closed right prior to the hurricane, Neal, but this is--we have never experienced a hurricane like this before because normally after a hurricane comes through, at least the peripheral areas are opened within just a few days.",
        "This situation in New Orleans is just continuing to exacerbate.",
        "And what's happening as we speak, they're continuing to evacuate people from New Orleans to the Astrodome in Houston.",
        "They have already evacuated thousands to the Cajun Dome in Lafayette, which is about 150 miles west of New Orleans.",
        "And so we still have about five districts, five parishes around the metropolitan area that are still shut down.",
        "Others beyond that that did not sustain considerable damage are now able to continue to open their school system.",
        "Are school facilities in some places being used for--well, to house refugees or...",
        "Absolutely.",
        "There are some.",
        "And what we're trying to do in the capital city of Baton Rouge here, which is only about 65 miles from New Orleans, we're now trying to get businesses and other public buildings to help relieve some of the schools that in fact were used as refugee centers before and during the hurricane.",
        "So we still have--we do still have some of the school systems that are being used as shelters.",
        "What would you say your top priority is now?",
        "It looks like it's going to be months before things begin to get back in order.",
        "Well, our top priority of course in New Orleans is still search and rescue, evacuate, because we're very concerned about disease.",
        "We try to get everybody other than essential personnel out of the city.",
        "Beyond that, what I am doing as state superintendent of education, I'm going to have a press conference in about an hour and I am encouraging not only Louisiana but other states where some of our citizens, like Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas, have gone to to flee the storm, to enroll our students immediately, not to worry about immunizations, not to worry about records, not--and the second thing we're asking is for our displaced teachers who want to teach, please hire them if you need them.",
        "We're going to worry about pay and certification at a later date.",
        "So we want our students, our top priority, to be in school.",
        "We want our teachers who are available to be employed.",
        "We think that as far as the New Orleans, St. Bernard, Plaquemines area, it's going to be probably into 2006 before they're even thinking of opening schools.",
        "And a lot of those facilities themselves will have been damaged and all of the textbooks and supplies and everything inside.",
        "We have reports--we have no way of knowing, but just from the information I'm getting, there are several schools in New Orleans that have been absolutely blown away.",
        "Blown away.",
        "As you say, it's going to be next year before you can project things getting back to normal.",
        "Absolutely, Neal, 'cause what we're talking about now is between 20 and 25 percent of the state's population has been displaced, student population.",
        "Our student population is about 701,000.",
        "We have probably 135 to 140,000 students that have been displaced.",
        "Cecil Picard, thank you.",
        "We know you're busy; you're about to have that news conference.",

        "And all of a sudden the thought popped into my head that it would be a swell idea to put all of those displaced people on cruise ships.",
        "Apparently great minds think alike.",
        "I have seen stories today that authorities have approached the Carnival Cruise Line--they run a couple of dozen cruise ships--and they are considering--they haven't worked out a plan yet--but they are considering the idea of moving some of those cruise ships to the Gulf Coast area to take up some people.",
        "And depending on the size of the ship, I guess they could take between, I don't know, 12, 1,500, maybe 2,000 people apiece.",
        "Wonderful news.",
        "Thank you so much.",
