        "This time, 62 percent of the students get the question right.",
        "Next, Mazur leads a discussion about the reasoning behind the answer, and then the process begins again with a new question.",
        "This is a method Mazur calls peer instruction.",
        "He now teaches all of his classes this way.",
        "And what we found over now close to 20 years of using this approach is that the learning gains at the end of the semester nearly triple.",
        "One value of this approach is that it can be done with hundreds of students.",
        "You don't need small classes to get students active and engaged.",
        "Mazur says the key is to get them to do the assigned reading - what he calls the information-gathering part of education - before they come to class.",
        "And in class, we work on trying to make sense of the information.",
        "Because if you stop to think about it, that second part is actually the hardest part.",
        "And the information transfer, especially now that we live in an information age, is the easiest part.",

        "But he adapted and says he learned more in Mazur's class than he did in his other physics course at Harvard.",
        "The University of Maryland's Joe Redish says when he lays out the case against lecturing, colleagues often nod their heads but insist their lectures work just fine.",

        "He said the state's 12,260 licensed fishermen are lynchpins for the regional economy.",
        "And the reality is that we know these thousands of licenses support other industries like our grocery businesses, our restaurants, our ice houses, our trucking industries, our marinas, our ports and many other related industries as well."

        "The critical first step in that is ensuring that the water is clear enough for the fish to be taken from before it's tested.",
