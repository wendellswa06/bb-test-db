        "Yeah.",
        "You know, the title of the piece is \"\"Mistakes Were Made,\"\" and I acknowledged that you can reasonably second-guess a lot of the decisions that Obama made, although I don't think there's any single decision he's made that's completely indefensible, but many which can be questioned.",
        "What I argue, though, is that the scale and the scope of the criticism he's getting from the left is just completely out of proportion to the mistakes that you can reasonably say he made, and a lot of it really is a kind of magical thinking, wishing away of real world constraints.",
        "Right.",

        "What you had was the looming expiration of the entire Bush tax cuts.",
        "You also had the looming expiration of some fairly progressive tax cuts that were part of the stimulus, and of increased unemployment benefits.",
        "And I think it stems from a genuine kind of fantasy that when Obama was elected and came into office that he alone could sort of solve all of the problems and do everything he wanted to do and that any failures must stem from a failure of his own will power or his own decision, his own rhetoric, his own tactics, as opposed to simply the fact that it is very hard to do much of anything.",
        "And given that, he's actually done a great deal.",
        "Well, he did come into office with a large majority in the House of Representatives and 60 votes filibuster-proof in the United States Senate.",
        "No.",
        "Well, that's only true for about four months.",
        "He only had four months, and that four months was mostly overtaken with health care.",
        "And one of the arguments I make in the piece is that you're getting the second guessing now from the left that says he should have focused on the economy instead.",
        "And one of the things I point out is that the people were saying that at the time, those people were all on the right, or at least, you know, to the right of Obama.",
        "It was the center right and the conservative critique saying you should ignore this health care thing and focus on the economy.",
        "I don't think that would have been the right decision.",

        "That's right.",

        "That's right.",
        "There's a habit in our political culture that you find among people, among even very sophisticated political reporters, to attribute all outcomes to the president, that this is a test for the president, this reflects on the president, as if the president were a monarch.",
        "But in fact, Congress is a co-equal branch of government, so all decisions represent just as much decisions of Congress as they do of the president.",
        "And that's a reality that people have a hard time internalizing, even if they intellectually understand it.",
        "Here's an email we have from John(ph) in South Lake Tahoe in California: I was a national Obama delegate in 2008 and am a progressive.",
        "President Obama will have my vote, but not my volunteer time or donations so long as the wars are not wound down in Afghanistan and Pakistan, capitulations continue on climate change, environmental protection, budget debates, etc. I'm still waiting for change I can believe in.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, he's bringing in some things that are sort of outside of the scope of the argument that I was making in the piece.",
        "My piece was mostly about the second guessing on the stimulus and the economy.",
        "You have a whole other argument about foreign policy that is in part an argument about first principles where, frankly, I would just disagree with a lot of people on the left as to what I want, although I do agree that, you know, objectively, Obama has kind of moved to the right and is taking a more centrist position or even a more conservative hawkish position than they expected.",
        "And so, you know, I disagree about ends, but I would agree with some of those critics that they have, you know, legitimate reason to be upset.",
        "It's on the stimulus where I think where I think their argument doesn't even make sense so much on its own terms.",
        "Again, at the time, I was pointing out, people were arguing the people who were arguing that he should focus on the economy over the long term budgetary and other kinds of reforms were the people on the right.",
        "They were the right wing critics.",
        "And then, subsequently, when Obama came to make the decisions where he had to decide between long term priorities versus short term stimulus, he chose stimulus.",
        "He chose exactly the priorities that the liberal critics now want him to have done and in so doing he's had to make compromises that (unintelligible) infuriated them.",
        "So they almost want, I think, at times two contradictory things.",
        "They want results and they want standing up to the Republicans, and doing both those things at the same time is not always easy or even possible."

        "People could not believe that it was so big, and of course then the results of it were largely in this sort of palliative category of maybe not as many jobs were lost as would have been, the sort of thing that's very hard to ring up in any dramatic scoreboard fashion to make the policy look that effective.",
        "So in this particular instance, it was an enormous struggle, an enormous struggle to get Arlen Specter, to get one or two votes out of the state of Maine in the United States Senate, and finally, painstakingly creep up to 60 votes.",
        "The Democrats, at that particular junction, did not have 60 votes of their own.",
        "They still had to ask Republicans for them, and of course each of those Republicans who came over was severely punished within that party.",
