        "You had this fight over - not over that moment on the tax cuts, but over the deficit, where Obama said we need a balanced deficit solution and it can't all be spending.",
        "It has to be revenue in addition to spending cuts and we need to do something to make the richest Americans pay some share of this fiscal adjustment.",
        "The public was overwhelmingly on their side.",
        "The Republicans simply didn't care.",
        "They were sticking to their priorities and they were willing to suffer in public opinion to do it.",
        "So this mechanism where the president rallies the people and the people force the Republicans to act - well, sometimes the first part works, though less often than people think.",
        "But the second part of that just - that just didn't happen at all, so there's no reason to think it would have happened in December of 2010 either.",
        "And Ron Elving, willing to take a hit - the president's numbers or at historic lows, but so are the numbers for Republicans in Congress.",
        "That's right.",
        "But it matters more to President Obama.",
        "He's down to 44 percent average in the RealClearPolitics.",
        "That's all the polls taken together.",
        "Some polls, including a Gallup, have actually shown him slipping under 40 percent, at least temporarily.",
        "And to him, that is the difference between having a pretty good shot at being re-elected to a second term and not being re-elected.",
        "At the same time, the Republicans' numbers are something like 20 points lower.",
        "That is whether you talk about the Republican leadership or whether you talk about the direction of Congress, the more specific you get about fixing it to the Republicans, the further down they go.",
        "But to them, that doesn't matter in the same way because they still see their electoral path clear to being renominated, a big fear among Republicans who fear Tea Party challenges.",
        "And number two, they see their way clear to winning their districts and winning behind a Republican candidate for president.",
        "If they can get a Republican president in 2012, they're absolutely confident they will hold the House and hold the Senate.",
        "And we don't see very many threatened Senate seats, for example.",
        "It looks like most all of the action in 2012 will be on Senate - on Democratic Senate seats.",
        "And so the Republicans feel quite confident despite their numbers in the polls that they're going to be fine next year if they can just figure out some way to get a presidential candidate to defeat Barack Obama.",
        "And, Jonathan Chait, I suspect you saw a little piece by Richard Cohen in The Washington Post op-ed page today where he concluded after his visit that Obama has lost the Hamptons.",
        "Of course, he points out that is before those people, former activists and supporters of Barack Obama, have a choice between him and somebody else, they may - he may get their votes, he concludes but won't have that level of enthusiasm.",
        "I think that's right.",
        "It's also - I think that's absolutely right.",
        "It's a real phenomenon, but it's also a recurrent phenomenon.",
        "You know, Clinton lost the left through a huge part of his entire presidency.",
        "And the Nader candidacy in 2000 represented a leftwing backlash against the Clinton administration, which compromised with the right much more than Obama has.",
        "And I think that's sort of been forgotten a little bit in light of history.",
        "And, of course, the Democratic president that you can go back to before Clinton, Carter, completely lost the left.",
        "And there was a very nearly successful challenge to that president by Ted Kennedy in 1980.",
        "And, of course, if you go to the Democratic president before Carter, that was Lyndon Johnson, who was forced to not even run for re-election in 1968.",
        "And then if you go to the Democratic president before that, that would be Harry Truman.",
        "He also had a leftwing challenger in the presidential election.",
        "He faced huge massive disillusionment.",
        "So, you know, one interpretation could be that the Democrats keep finding presidents who sell out liberals and make peace with their enemies for no good reason.",
        "Perhaps a better interpretation is liberals are just a little bit difficult to please or uncomfortable with the compromises involved in power.",
        "Jonathan Chait, senior editor at The New Republic, wrote \"\"What the Left Doesn't Understand About Barack Obama\"\" in Sunday's New York Times Magazine.",
        "Also with us, guest political junkie Ron Elving.",

        "They're not going to play ball so forget it.",

        "You know, I think the way to look at Obama's political tactics and messaging strategy is to say given the state of the economy, is he more or less popular than he should be given normal levels of political competence?",
        "I would argue that he's actually pretty popular given the state of the economy.",
        "He's not very popular.",
        "But, again, he's almost as popular as Bill Clinton was at this point.",
        "He's just a couple of points lower in the Gallup Poll when Clinton was presiding at this point over a pretty strong recovery.",
        "He's almost as popular as Ronald Reagan was when Reagan was also presiding over a roaring recovery.",
        "So, you know, I actually think he's doing reasonably well, which doesn't mean that he hasn't made mistakes.",
        "He's certainly has.",
        "All presidents make mistakes.",
        "The question is: Are Obama's mistakes out of character with the normal level of mistakes that you see?",
        "And I don't see the case that they are.",
        "I don't see that reflected in the results of his polling support given the circumstances he's in.",
