        "Soap operas are on daily, so what happens to them when there's a strike?",
        "Here with some insight is Sally Sussman Morina.",
        "She's written for the soaps for more than 20 years, including as head writer for \"\"Days of Our Lives\"\" and, most recently, for \"\"The Young and the Restless.\"\" Welcome, Sally.",
        "Well, soap opera shoot at 250 original episodes every year and traditionally, what has happened during the strike is the networks continue to show original episodes.",
        "Those original episodes are written by scab writers who come in and write the shows under anonymous names and keep the shows going for the networks.",
        "That's been the tradition in prior strikes.",
        "So these non-Guild members who decide to write during the strike for the soaps, did they pretty much kill their shot of becoming a Guild writer from then on out?",
        "No, well, traditionally in the past in prior strikes, a number of writers who wrote during the strike, who were not Guild members at the time, subsequently became Guild members and have had quite flourishing careers along the way.",
        "This time, the Guild hopes to be able to find out who these people are and ultimately to prevent them from joining the Guild.",
        "There are a number of current Guild members who did get their starts in prior strikes and who are currently working.",
        "And, you know, everybody knows who they are and we don't really begrudge them so much, but it does undermine the writers who are on strike.",
        "How easily are these writers able to jump in?",
        "I mean, some of these shows have been on forever and there are so many twists and turns of plotlines.",
        "Can someone just come in and start writing for a show that…",
        "Well, they don't just come in from the cold.",
        "It's not like they go out on the street and they say, are you a soap opera fan?",
        "Usually, these are people who are connected to the show in some way, either via the network, either via the crew or the production staff."

        "So is this like this secretary at the front desk?",

        "Absolutely.",
        "Now these are people that we're talking about who are approached, you know, to make a little bit more money and to write some of these shows and to take a shot at writing.",
        "Sally, the last big strike was in 1988.",
        "What was the effect then, and what do you see as a potential effect of the writers' strike on soap operas now?",
        "Right.",
        "1988 was a long strike.",
        "It was a five-month strike.",
        "It took a significant hit on the daytime ratings.",
        "What happens is, obviously, when you have scab writers writing a show, the quality suffers substantially and the audience knows that and they start to tune out.",
        "Daytime has never recovered from the effects of the '88 strike.",
        "But now here we are 20 years later.",
        "So now we have daytime in a much more precarious position, rating-wise, than it has ever been in, which puts the daytime writers in a very, very difficult situation, because the soap opera business, as it is right now, cannot really survive and be healthy with a long strike.",
        "Especially if viewers defect and don't come back.",
        "That's what happened in '88, but it's a much more devastating impact this go-round.",
        "And I think that the reason that daytime writers are so nervous and reason that daytime writers, even though we are totally behind the Writers Guild in this go-round, feel nervous because we don't know if we'll have a business when this is all over.",
        "And what are the issues that are specific to you as a daytime drama writer?",
        "I mean, some of these issues that we've been hearing about, about new media and things like that, do you have the same issues as the rest of the Writers Guild?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "This is the first time, in my memory, this is my fourth strike, that the differences between what screenwriters, primetime writers, daytime writers all stand to gain or potentially lose from this strike - were all in this one together.",
        "This is the first time - the issues here, new media potentially has an upside for soap opera writers because the ability to write quickly, the ability to write cheaply, the ability to write the type of storylines that might be successful on the Internet - so the daytime writers have a potential new market for their services.",
        "In other words, we're in this with the Guild now.",
        "There is potential upside for the writers with new media and there is hopefully future work.",
        "The current issue is really though if this goes along time, what will the state of the soap opera business be at the end of it.",
        "Sally Sussman Morina, thank you so much.",
        "Thank you.",
        "This is NEWS AND NOTES.",
        "I'm Ed Gordon.",
