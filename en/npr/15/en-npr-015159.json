        "Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick filed a federal lawsuit last week against Ward Connerly.",
        "We should note that we had Ward Connerly on with us, I believe a week ago, talking about affirmative action, the continued fight.",
        "The mayor, and we should note that he filed this as a private citizen, suggested that the California businessman and former regent for the University of California, I believe, engaged in a widespread voter fraud to get the proposal of affirmative action, banning it on the Michigan ballot of 2006, which is upcoming.",
        "Laura Washington, we should note that Kwame Kilpatrick said a few months ago at an NAACP dinner, bring it on.",
        "I'm going to fight this fight.",
        "And now we see what his intentions are.",
        "He is suggesting that over 125,000 black and Latino voters were falsely told what the petition was in terms of signing it.",
        "They thought it was to support affirmative action, according to Mr. Kilpatrick and others.",
        "Bring it on is correct.",
        "A lot of people had counted Kwame Kilpatrick out, you know, that didn't - he wouldn't even be able to be reelected.",
        "He came back strong, and at that time, I think a lot of people said that they saw him now being able to develop the real potential to become a national player in politics.",
        "And this may be an early volley, you know, a positive volley, in terms of taking on Ward Connerly.",
        "I think it's interesting that Connerly's effort, as far as I can tell, and I don't have all the details yet, he's been focused on, you know, getting blacks and Latinos to sign this petition.",
        "Now, whether or not he misrepresented it, we have - that remains to be seen.",
        "But it's interesting that he would focus on blacks and Latinos, and it makes me wonder, you know, why did he have to do that?",
        "Could he not find enough people who agreed with him in, you know, in Michigan that he had to take that route?",
        "It's just - it raises a really interesting question.",
        "Well, actually, it's - it's actually kind of the - you're sort of damned if you, damned if you don't...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...if you're Ward Connerly, because if you focus on just on white voters, it's going to make him seem like, well, you know, he's just getting all the white racists there to get rid of this.",
        "I think he felt that if he goes out - if he focuses on Hispanic and black voters, you'll - he can't be accused of this being a - of a racist bit of legislation.",

        "I think what happens here in the context of Kilpatrick's lawsuit really is -it's this definition of what affirmation action is - means, I mean, the literal definition of it.",
        "Connerly's argument is that affirmative action has evolved or devolved, however you want to phrase it, into racial preferences, and he wants to eliminate the context of racial preferences.",
        "And if you put that language even in front of black and Hispanic voters, if they hear it that way, they'll go to say, oh, well, I don't like the idea of racial preferences, and they'll sign it.",
        "And so, I think, Kilpatrick is saying that that's unfair or it's a fraud or whatever, but it's really is how you define affirmative action, how it was supposed to be and it is made today.",
        "Here's the interesting part.",
        "The lawsuit also names Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land to it, and other state officials, as defendants, suggesting that their overall responsibility is to make sure that Michigan elections are forthright, and that they didn't look into this enough, Marcelo.",
        "And we should note that the - what is called the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative, that's what will be on the ballot.",
        "And even that language is interesting.",
        "It would ban the use of racial and gender preferences in college admissions and public hiring for contracting, effective immediately.",

        "SUÁREZ-OROZCO: Yes, this is, of course, another round of what we saw earlier in Michigan, involving, of course, the case that went all the way to the Supreme Court.",
        "Both cases.",
        "Prof.",
        "SUÁREZ-OROZCO: At the University of Michigan, both cases, the case at the law school and the case at the college.",
        "But there is this use of language that Robert mentioned that some have said is somewhat Orwellian.",
        "So the Michigan Civil Rights Commission, you know, would end some forms of affirmative action as we've come to understand it over the last generation.",
        "So there are interesting questions and it will be important to see moving forward how this case unfolds, because this also repeats an earlier cycle in California, also involving the former regent.",
        "So stay tuned.",
        "Yes.",
        "Stay tuned indeed.",
        "And Laura, as I mentioned, the idea of just calling it the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative is interesting, and that's how it will be placed on the ballot.",
        "We should note that representatives of the initiative have suggested that the complaint is totally frivolous and they believe it will be thrown out.",
        "And if Corrine Conley's people did do the right thing and did represent this initiative correctly, I think what it may represent is there is a growing backlash among people of color against affirmative action.",
        "There is some growing discomfort with the way it has been used to imply - I know I see this on - I teach at DePaul University and I see this on campus all the time, black and Latino students are very uncomfortable with being perceived as being there because of their race and not because of their merit.",
        "Exactly."

        "So maybe that's…",
        "Yeah, but here's a reality.",
        "Even when I was going to school, that is the thought of many, unfortunately, professors as well as fellow students, that when they see minorities there they just, quite frankly, assume, well, the only reason you're here is because of affirmative action, whether or not you're there off of merit and oft times perhaps even brighter than the one who is judging you.",

        "But she, but even in that, even in that decision, she was hoping it basically would sunset in, you know, 20 years or however, 20 or 30 years, and…",
        "Right.",
        "…and so she was in a sense seeing, hoping to see an end to the practice, and so…",
        "Well, that's the interesting note, because when you initially talked about affirmative action there were questions of grandfathering some of this, so to put that against the sunset is an interesting note in terms of how people view it.",
        "It really depends on which side of the fence you sit.",

        "Let's turn our attention to what we're seeing really raise in intensity, in terms of conversation, over this past weekend, and that is bipartisan support opposing insurgent amnesty, which was put forth as a possibility by Iraq's Prime Minister, the plan for providing insurgents amnesty.",
        "We saw senators across the board come out and suggest that this is not the way to go.",
        "One, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, saying granting immunity to people who have killed Americans is not acceptable, and I don't - and here's the interesting language here, and this comes from Mr. McConnell after hearing from the Prime Minister of Iraq.",

        "We stand with this government, and so forth.",

        "Here's another interesting quote from McConnell, which happened on this week with George Stephanopoulos.",
        "He suggested that the Iraqi war, in talking about the support for it, what we've seen here is quote a miniscule number of casualties compared to any war in American history.",
        "End quote.",

        "The question is really in terms of the Iraqi proposal, and why it is somewhat unorthodox, is that in general, amnesties tend to come to the table in the context of a peace settlement.",
        "So if you look at, for example, the insurgencies that we saw in Central America recently - El Salvador, Guatemala, what we've seen in Columbia.",
        "In general, the insurgents and the governments make a kind of a peace treaty, and then it's when the notion of offering, granting, some degree of amnesty comes to the table.",
        "What we see in Iraq here is really kind of an asymmetrical amnesty, which I really think goes into the symbolic issues that are at stake here as the Iraqis continue to struggle for some form of legitimacy and authority in what is a very, very complicated situation unfolding in the field.",
