        "Cricket fans in Pakistan and around the world are in a state of shock over the apparent murder of Pakistan's coach, Bob Woolmer.",
        "Woolmer, who was 58, was found unconscious in his blood-splattered hotel room in Jamaica on Sunday.",
        "A day earlier, his favored Pakistani team had suffered a humiliating defeat to Ireland - newcomers to World Cup Cricket.",
        "Najam Sethi, editor of The Friday Times national weekly newspaper, published in Lahore, Pakistan, joins us on the line.",
        "Mr. Sethi, first of all, who was Bob Woolmer and how was he viewed in the cricket world and in Pakistan?",
        "Oh, Bob Woolmer was a former England cricketer who would become a coach, and had coached various international cricket teams until he became Pakistan's coach as well, about three years ago I think.",
        "And his contract for this is going to end at the end of this tour, and there are some doubt whether it might be renewed or not.",
        "And Bob had been close to the team, and was pretty well loved by his teammates.",
        "In recent times, there'd been some controversies.",
        "Some former captains of the Pakistan cricket team are following Pakistani cricket team's defeat in various international matches had questioned his the ability and his competence as a coach.",
        "And who do the police suspect is behind the murder?",
        "The suspicion is that it could have been either people who won a lot of money after Pakistan lost that match, i.e. match-fixing, and we're afraid that Woolmer had found out who they were.",
        "He might disclose their identity.",
        "And…",
        "You're saying people who had won a lot of money.",
        "Was - are you suggesting that they might have fixed the match in some way?",
        "That's right.",
        "There have been allegations of match fixing.",
        "In international cricket, almost every team has been accused of it.",
        "It's not entirely clear, whether it was the Pakistani players who were involved, or whether it was some outside elements, or whether there were some connection between bookies and Pakistani players.",
        "So that's obviously one line of thinking.",
        "The other, of course, line of thinking is that following the defeat, there were many Pakistanis who were very, very angry as effigies of Mr. Woolmer and the Pakistani captain were burnt the day the Pakistanis lost this particular match because it basically meant that they were chucked out of the reckoning as far as the World Cup was concerned.",
        "So it might have been a deranged individual who got so mad that he thought that he would exact revenge and ended up doing this to Mr. Woolmer."

        "I presume, though, that once a folks in Pakistan founded Woolmer had been murdered, the sentiment probably shifted quite quickly.",
        "Indeed.",
        "The sentiments shifted the day after the Pakistan team lost the match because it was first assumed that Woolmer had died of a heart attack, and all across Pakistan, people are saying that Woolmer was a true Pakistani patriot because he'd been so stricken by the grief that he'd succumbed to tension, whereas the rest of the Pakistani cricket team that should've really been held accountable was going on as though nothing had happened.",

        "Now, younger workers, you imagine, might be able to adapt more easily, but what about the people who, you know, expected to be taken care of, that they're already done working?",
        "How will they adapt to this?",
        "That's the big argument.",
        "You know, pensions have always been sacrosanct.",
        "And many states have constitutional provisions that say you cannot change the pension amounts that people have already earned.",
        "And that's what the Detroit bankruptcy judge said the city could do.",
        "It said what was in effect a contract with pensioners was no more sacred than any other contract, or maybe only a little more sacred.",
        "So that's going to be the big legal argument going ahead.",
        "Can they change the rules for people who not only expect it, but earned that money and say don't have time to readjust their financial plans or their lives?",
        "Private pensions, they've all but disappeared.",
        "Is this just the case of the public sector catching up with the realities of today's world economically?",
        "Well, I'd say people who are in government and thinking about cutting pensions, that's the argument they make.",
        "What is maybe most pressing here is not the economic reality, but the political reality.",
        "When people who are working the private sector don't have pensions, they don't have a lot of sympathy for people in government who almost all do have pensions.",
        "So what do you think happens next?",
        "Are things just going to continue in this direction?"

        "Yeah, definitely the trend has been toward cutting pensions, cutting benefits.",
        "A great number of governments have cut the amounts people could expect.",
        "Certainly, like I said, for new hires, more and more employees are being put not into traditional pensions, which pay you a set amount per month once you retire, but rather 401(k)-style plans where you save money, and then whatever is accrued when you retire, that's all you get.",
