        "And your point I think is that research on a rare disease doesn't just benefit the small population who suffer from that disease.",
        "That's right because often what happens with rare diseases is that there's some sort of mutation to a gene involved.",
        "And it may surprise people to learn that scientists often don't quite know exactly what all the genes in our genome actually do.",
        "And so these rare diseases can often be kind of a natural experiment that shows you some clues about what that gene does.",
        "And they can use that knowledge to treat much more common diseases.",
        "Give us an example.",
        "Well, there's a very rare disease called Tangier Disease, which was first discovered because some people had orange tonsils.",
        "And so some doctors said, well, that's weird.",
        "And when they investigated it, it turned out that these people had a mutation in a gene that was involved in how they process cholesterol.",
        "And so actually their tonsils were building up huge amounts of cholesterol, and they were turning orange.",
        "This is incredibly rare.",
        "Maybe a few hundred people in the world have it.",
        "And yet by studying that gene that gets mutated, scientists are actually stating to develop some potential treatments for heart disease, which affects many millions of people.",
        "So that is the link between - that's really the answer to someone who says wait a minute, there's millions of people dying from heart disease, we need more research to that, or malaria or AIDS or whatever.",
        "Yeah, I mean, I think we just hope that people will just go after these very common diseases and somehow magically find a cure.",
        "Unfortunately our biology is just really complex, and sometimes treatments for these common diseases come from very unexpected places.",
        "And so rare diseases can sometimes be useful in that way.",
        "Of course this is all beside the point for a person who actually has a rare disease and is really hoping for a cure, and so there's obviously a huge benefit to actually prompting scientists, incentivizing scientists to study these rare diseases just for those people.",
        "Well, let's talk with one of them now.",
        "Jeannie Peeper has a rare skeletal disorder known as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP.",
        "She's the founder and president of the International FOP Association, now celebrating its 25th year, and joins us now from member station UCF in Orlando.",

        "At this point that's still - they're still working on that until there as has been a certain point at which clinical trials will begin.",
        "But we are all very hopeful that that will be in the very near future.",
        "OK.",
        "You are now 54 years old.",
        "As we suggested in the introductions, doctors did not think you would live past your teens.",

        "My left wrist had locked in a backward position.",
        "And I went in and asked my mom, you know, what was wrong, I couldn't move my wrist.",
        "And from there we started, you know, seeing more physicians, and they did a biopsy.",
        "And so that was when I first knew that there was something that was different.",
        "And how has it - I'm not sure, forgive me even for asking this question - how has it changed your life?",
        "Well, it has changed my life because at certain points during my life the progression of the disease gets worse.",
        "And so, you know, there was a point in time where I was able to dress myself and drive, and I'm no longer able to do those things.",
        "So you adjust and adapt differently on how to do different things in your daily life."

        "And so even before the Internet, Jeannie set up a newsletter and actually got in touch with people and started sharing information and immediately got the idea that they could raise funds to support research.",
        "Only later in the 1990s did they set up a website and set up a Facebook page, and that really accelerated the process of bringing people together and then allowing them to share ideas about how to take care of their condition, and then also to support research and even participate in research.",
        "And so the Internet has had this crucial role in accelerating what people like Jeannie Peeper actually began.",
        "And that is crucial.",
        "You think a disease, one in two million, how do people with this condition generate money for research?",
        "Well, I mean, Jeannie would probably be the good person to talk about the specific example of FOP, but certainly, you know, rare disease communities find all sorts of different ways to do it.",
        "They may do bake sales, they may have fish fries, or there might be a philanthropist who perhaps has a family member who has this disorder.",
        "It - the money comes from all sorts of places.",
        "But, you know, very much it's a case of people with the disease and their families raising that money because the whole funding system for disease research ends up neglecting rare diseases not because anyone has an indifference to people with this condition, but, you know, GOP is 100,000 times rarer than diabetes.",
