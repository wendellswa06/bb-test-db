        "In Philadelphia, there's a museum called the Mutter Museum.",
        "It's a medical museum, and it has a number of specimens there.",
        "And a number of years ago, when I went there, I walked over to a corner glass case and was totally captivated by a skeleton.",
        "It was the skeleton of a man named Harry Eastlack, who died in the 1970s.",
        "And on the legends, I read about his condition.",
        "He had this disease I'd never heard of called FOP, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, and he had wanted his body to go to science to help, perhaps, to find a cure for this condition.",
        "And the legend explained that no one really knew what caused it.",
        "And I actually went back there to the museum.",
        "I happened to be in town, and it's a wonderful museum.",
        "So I went back there, and there I saw it again.",
        "And I said, you know, I want to find out about this, because it's - looking at the skeleton, it's quite an emotional experience, I mean, because you see these bones that are totally new bones that are forming around someone's skeleton.",
        "What is it like to have that condition, to be just a handful of people in the world to have it?",
        "And how could this possibly happen?",
        "You have to remember that, you know, we develop bones as embryos, and then afterwards, the bones keep growing, but you don't make a new bone, or you don't grow another skull or another arm bone.",
        "But these people grow new bones.",
        "And so that sort of set me off on this journey, on which I met Jeannie Peeper, I met the scientists who were trying to help, and it's been an amazing experience.",
        "There are conditions, though, that other people have where you might want to generate some new bones.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Actually, very common conditions, like osteoporosis.",
        "Millions of people in the United States suffer from massive bone loss.",
        "And so you might want to look at what's going on with people who have FOP.",
        "How does this little mutation switch on bone growth in this dramatic way?",
        "Could you possibly harness that power to help people with osteoporosis?",
        "So that's actually one of the possibilities that scientists at the University of Pennsylvania and elsewhere are looking into as they better understand what causes FOP."

        "And Jeannie Peeper, I wanted to ask you, there were a couple of researchers who spent years working on this, and as Carl Zimmer suggests, they did uncover a gene that is believed to be responsible here.",
        "I wonder: Once you understood for the first time, how did you find out about that?",
        "I actually got a call from Dr. Kaplan from the University of Pennsylvania that said he wanted me to come to Pennsylvania for the press release, that the FOP gene had been discovered.",
        "And that was in April of 2006.",
        "And it was truly the greatest gift I've ever received, to know that the gene has been discovered in my lifetime.",
        "And with the gene discovery, it lays out the landscape for many other researchers that are now onboard throughout the world to develop a treatment and a cure for FOP.",

        "On one side of my family, we've been afflicted with genetic Lou Gehrig's, and on the other side, oddly enough, we have had sporadic Lou Gehrig's.",
        "In my lifetime, three members of my family have passed from it.",
        "But before that, many other members passed, as well.",
        "The first in my lifetime was my grandmother, who passed away about 14 years ago.",

        "There was nothing, you know, Lou Gehrig's at this point in time is, you know, it's a sentence to death.",
        "And although they have somewhat recently found the gene, as well, there still really isn't that research being done in order to help, or any awareness of what it does, what it can do and the harms that only people that suffer it, but their family members go through.",
        "I'm sorry to hear the situation with your family, and that must be awful and awful to live with, and wonder when or if you're going to come down with Lou Gehrig's disease."

        "Carl Zimmer, I think most of us - I guess partly because of Lou Gehrig - have heard of Lou Gehrig's disease.",
        "What qualifies as a rare disease?",
        "Well, the National Institutes of Health defines a rare disease as affecting less than 200,000 Americans.",
        "As I mentioned, FOP affects perhaps a couple hundred Americans.",
        "But, you know, the fact is that there are a whole lot of diseases that qualify under that definition, and so there are over 7,000 rare diseases that have been identified.",
        "And they actually, if you add them all up, they affect 30 million people.",
        "So rare diseases in aggregate actually are a very common disease, and they're actually becoming all the more common the more that scientists study them, because now you can - it's much easier now to identify genes that have mutations in them, and so you can start to discover entirely new rare diseases.",
        "In some cases, you might have a mutation that affects one person, and it's never been seen before.",
        "So the world of rare diseases is just getting bigger and bigger.",
        "Let's go next to Robin, and Robin's on the line with us from Phoenix.",
        "Yeah, hi.",
        "I actually worked for a company here in Phoenix called TGen, the Translational Genomics Research Institute.",
        "And so what we're actually doing is using the whole genome sequence and actually looking at an entire DNA blueprint to try to find what's causing the rare disorder.",
        "And so for one such case, we have a new center for rare childhood disorders.",
        "And we had a little girl named Shelby.",
        "So for 10 years, she was on kind of a similar diagnostic odyssey to - like what many of your callers are talking about.",
        "So she couldn't walk.",
        "She couldn't talk.",
        "Her parents took her everywhere.",
        "And we were actually able to sequence her entire genome, so looking at all three billion letters, and figured out what the change was that was causing that.",
        "And that would mean confronting Somalia's lawlessness, lack of governance, and economic instability."

        "We're a nonprofit organization, so about one-third of our funding comes from philanthropy, so generous donors that are interested in the type of research that we're doing.",

        "The NIH is setting up something called Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases, which is helping to encourage the basic research by scientists into this.",
        "And then they're finding ways to encourage pharmaceutical companies to get involved and carry the ball forward.",
        "One of the big challenges with these kinds of drugs is that when you got a rare disease, by definition, there aren't a lot of people to study.",
        "And yet clinical trials typically need lots of people in them in order to be sure that the medicine is working effectively and safely.",
        "So the FDA and others are coming up with ways of tailoring trials for these small groups of people.",
        "And the fact is that, ironically, pharmaceutical companies can do pretty well with medicines for rare diseases.",
        "Some of these rare disease drugs are - they cost a lot of money, but, you know, insurance companies in some cases are willing to cover for them because the cost of just medical care for people as they're declining is so much more expensive.",
        "So things are looking a bit brighter than in the past on the drug discovery end of things.",

        "Even now, it is still fatal, often debilitating, for many people.",
