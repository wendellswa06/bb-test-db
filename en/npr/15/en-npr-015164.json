        "It sounds like, you know, a writer has to let go when something goes to the screen in that way, and it sounds like that was pretty painful for you to do.",

        "Have you begun to feel that there's possibility that you'll be an influence for a long time to come?",
        "It would be vanity to answer that question.",
        "I think if you have anything that's read 20 years after your death, you've accomplished something considerable.",

        "And since then I haven't been able to find an affordable plan as a single person who works three different jobs.",

        "As far as it costing extra money for us, or impacting our budget, it wasn't a whole lot more because I think in general people your age are healthy.",

        "What are the main risk factors for COPD?",
        "To some extent the risk profile depends on which country you're talking about.",
        "In First World countries, such as, you know, the United States, we're largely talking about people who have exposure to chronic cigarette smoke.",
        "And the vast majority of patients I see have very significant histories of cigarette smoke exposure, and we're talking maybe 20, 30, 40 years.",
        "However in the Third World we're talking about exposures to what we call biomass, and those are particulates that are generated when people use wood-burning stoves inside.",
        "And so the global spectrum of COPD is very much dependent on the country of origin and also on kind of the economics of that particular country."

        "And while relatively few of us are familiar with that term, COPD - emphysema, bronchitis, chronic bronchitis, those are lumped together with - as part of COPD?",
        "Yeah, sometimes it's a little confusing because the terms are used interchangeably.",
        "But I think the most convenient way of looking at it is to see COPD as encompassing aspects of both chronic bronchitis and emphysema.",
        "Now, what those terms really refer to are different compartments of the lungs.",
        "So the goal and the ultimate strategy of the lung is to deliver oxygen to the bloodstream so that you can oxygenate your tissues.",
        "And the structures that actually do this are either tubes, or the conducting structures or the highways of the lung, and these little sacular structures which are the sites where oxygen kind of moves from the lung into the bloodstream.",
        "And the unfortunate aspect of COPD is that both of these kind of compartments are compromised, and so you have two reasons to have compromised delivery of oxygen.",
        "And as a corollary to that, what happens is that you have a problem getting rid of air from which oxygen has already been extracted, and therefore you're breathing at very, very high lung volumes, and that causes your respiratory muscles to fatigue.",
        "And you enter into what Grace was describing as the cycle of disability, where you become more short of breath, you become more deconditioned, you become more short of breath and more deconditioned.",
        "And that's why the aggressive efforts for pulmonary rehabilitation have been so effective.",
        "So the disease, I guess in this country if it's attributable to cigarette smoke largely, it's preventable.",
        "The treatment, though, as she describes it, is a treatment, not a cure.",
        "Exactly, and those of us who do research on this disease are actively trying to find interventions that can restore normal lung function in patients who are very compromised by the disease.",
        "But a point that I want to make is that the treatments are effective.",
        "And so there should be no patients who have the diagnosis who aren't being placed on an armamentarium of interventions that have proven to be quite successful.",
        "And obviously Grace has had a very, you know, auspicious response, but that's not unusual, actually, and so we would want to call patients to arms so that they can talk to their physicians and come up with a treatment plan that's likely to make them kind of much more comfortable and much less short of breath.",
        "Grace Anne Dorney Koppel, as you talk with others who have this disease, what is the most difficult thing to overcome?",
        "Is there a sense of hopelessness because of that lost of breath?",
        "Yes, many can feel that, and as the disease progresses, people tend to become more and more isolated and more tied to their own homes, to the oxygen tubing that your caller described.",
        "But we do live in a time when there are portable oxygen concentrators, perhaps not as available to all as they should be, and it is very possible to lead a more or less normal life if you have a portable oxygen concentrator."
