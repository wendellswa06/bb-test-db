        "Some persons have worked in factories or worked in industries where they're exposed to a lot of toxic substances.",
        "Alternatively, people can have genetic risk factors, and that's something we haven't talked about.",
        "And one of those that's the most kind of prominent and associated with cigarette smoke exposure is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.",
        "But I also see patients, actually, who develop COPD and emphysema because they have underlying what we call matrix disorder, and therefore the structure of their lungs are altered.",
        "And so there are other possible causes, and I would advise anyone who carries a diagnosis, who's a nonsmoker, to be evaluated at a tertiary care institution, where they're able to do this kind of very incisive analysis of what the possible risk factors are, and come up with a likely scenario of what's going on.",
        "Barbara in Keokuk, Iowa, emailed us: My husband has alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.",
        "That's the genetic form of COPD.",
        "She writes: It's an often misdiagnosed cause for COPD that occurs in younger patients, and can also involve the liver.",
        "It's diagnosed with a simple blood test.",
        "I give my husband a weekly IV to replace the protein in his liver, which does not release to counteract an enzyme that cleans the lung.",
        "It's imperative that any person that has a diagnosis of COPD be checked for alpha-1.",
        "Bill, have you been checked for that?",
        "I'm sorry.",

        "And we're trying to find ways to make the test even more simple, so that general practitioners will just routinely do this in their offices.",
        "But it is the sad fact that most of us who are finally diagnosed have lost 50 percent, if not more, of our lung function.",
        "And you mentioned earlier that it is women who are most often misdiagnosed.",
        "Why do you think that is?",
        "Well, there is a gender bias, because it was for years thought of as an elderly man's disease.",

        "We also are more aware of things like secondhand smoke, third hand smoke, air pollution.",
        "It's interesting that in the Centers for Disease Control's first analysis of behavioral risk factors - and it focused on questions on COPD - that almost 25 percent of those who responded that they had COPD had never smoked.",
        "So more and more, we need to explore and are exploring in the COPD gene study, for example, the genetic factors that make us more susceptible.",
        "And we do know women are more susceptible, but we don't know the other factors.",
        "Once this massive study is completed, I hope we'll know more.",
        "Some of the researchers like Dr. Sonia Buist say that COPD starts in the womb.",
        "We're born with certain factors, and then we engage in certain risky behaviors ourselves, and some of us end up with the third-leading killer of Americans as our disease.",

        "This is NPR News.",

        "Why don't the symptoms become more evident?",
        "Well, the problem is the lag phase, and that's something that Grace mentioned.",
        "And the fact is that when you start smoking, it's going - you're going to have maybe a 20, 30, 40-year lag phase before you start developing symptoms.",
        "And so we're largely looking at people who are over the age of 50, 60, 70 years of age.",
        "And unfortunately not just patients, but often physicians think that one's exercise capacity should fall with age.",
        "And so when patients complain or report that they're a little more short of breath, they're unable to do activities that they had done before, sometimes that's just attributed to getting older.",
        "And so a problem is on the level of the patients not really telling the doctor, you know, I think I should be able to do this but I'm not, but also on the level of the physician who may not kind of pursue this particular symptom as aggressively as he should.",
        "I should also say that the general recommendation is that any person with a significant smoking history, and that's usually quantified by what we call pack years, and that's the number of years you smoke, and the number of packs per day on the average that you smoke.",
        "And if you have a greater than 20 pack year exposure history and you have any symptoms, you should undergo spirometry."
