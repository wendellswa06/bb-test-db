        "He often does diplomatic advance work abroad before the president travels, and just this week he delivered the White House message to Israel, that it must embrace a two-state solution with the Palestinians.",
        "You're not going to like my saying this, but not build more settlements, dismantle existing outposts, and allow the Palestinians freedom of movement based on their first action.",

        "I think people are less concerned about what kind of buddy-buddy relationship exists between the president and vice president, and more concerned about the fact whether or not they're working together to tackle the hardest problems our country has.",
        "And the two of them do enjoy working together.",
        "They do have their weekly lunch together.",
        "And this week they had their lunch in a new location, a burger joint in Arlington, Virginia, instead of the fancy White House dining room.",

        "So I go down, he said, Lets go get a burger.",
        "I hear from staff that the best burger place is just across the river.",
        "We rode in the limo, talked to each other, and actually got ten minutes or so to talk about the business we had in mind at lunch, although it was not quite as commodious and easy as when we eat alone.",
        "But it was good.",
        "It may not be buddy-buddy, but so far it seems to be working, for both President Obama and Vice President Biden."

        "Well, first of all, I think it's not very likely to happen.",
        "What's significant in the current situation is they've actually said that they would be willing to give up nuclear weapons, you know, if their security is assured, and they're not threatened.",
        "However, to think that's going to happen in the short term is just not realistic because to build a nuclear weapons program, it's an enormous number of facilities.",
        "It's a large number of people.",
