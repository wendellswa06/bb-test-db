        "Randall says the problem is that even though every nation has the right to arrest and try pirates, very few modern nations want the cost and controversy of doing it.",
        "For that reason, he says, the world community should find some collective legal way to deal with piracy.",
        "There are efforts to try captured pirates in various courts.",
        "The U.S.",
        "is trying the lone survivor of last month's hostage drama off the Somali coast, and the government of Kenya has agreed to try other captured suspects.",
        "Randall says there's ample precedent for a United Nations special tribunal to prosecute pirates, and says that would make more sense than dealing with them on an ad-hoc basis.",
        "Captain Muku Mukundan keeps an eye on piracy as the director of the International Chamber of Commerce's commercial crimes division in London.",
        "He says that no matter how or where pirates are prosecuted, the international enforcement effort against them must be tough.",
        "What the United States did is exactly, in our view, what a flag state should be doing.",
        "And if all the flag states took a similarly robust action when their vessels were taken, they would not see the problems of piracy in Somalia at the levels they are today.",
        "All the experts say merchant ships need to do more to protect themselves, and some even say that merchant ships should carry weapons.",
        "Robert Ritchie says that's not the way things worked historically, and it's unlikely that they'll work that way now.",
        "The reason, he says, is simple economics: Ship owners don't want the headaches and the insurance costs, and sailors have no incentive to be fighters.",
        "When you're dealing with men with big machine guns and RPGs, you're being paid to do a job.",
        "And if you're going to have to fight, you want a whole lot more money.",
        "If you really wanted to fight, you would've joined the Navy.",
        "Most authorities agree that the ultimate solution in Somalia will take more than enforcement by foreign militaries.",
        "It will require mending the failed Somali state, helping to restore stability, and a government strong enough to enforce its own laws and police its own coastline.",
        "Until then, Historian Marcus Rediker says, the pirates are likely to find support along the lawless coast.",
        "What I worry about when it comes to the weapons is - one is capability.",
        "Second is motivation.",
        "And capability - for many years, I was able to say, look.",
        "You know, they have the bomb, but they don't have much.",
        "They don't have a nuclear arsenal.",
        "Then comes the motivation part.",
        "And would they be motivated to go ahead and attack the United States, Japan or South Korea basically out of the blue?",
        "I say absolutely not.",
        "They want those weapons to make sure to protect them.",
        "Perhaps they want the weapons so that they actually have sort of sufficient maneuvering room, you know, on the Korean Peninsula.",
        "What I've worried about is not so much that they're motivated to attack us but rather that we're going to stumble into a nuclear war.",
        "Sig Hecker is a former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, now at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University.",
        "Thank you very much."

        "Valencia, is that a good idea for her and for the Democratic Party?",

        "She has every right to.",
        "I have a blog post that some may deem a little controversial this morning entitled \"\"The Obama Campaign: The Ultimate Metaphor for Being Black in America,\"\" because I think that she did use a kitchen sink strategy.",
        "And the way she won, basically, is tantamount to the old style of politics.",

        "What do you mean by that?",
        "What do you mean by her strategy",
        "The kitchen sink strategy?",
        "Well, the strategy in which says, you know, we're not getting any traction as we stay and stick with the issues at hand, and so, since that's the case, we're going to capitalize upon all these other controversies that kind of put a question, big question mark over the likes of a Barack Obama, who seems to just have this incredible appeal that just shows no way of letting up with regards to momentum.",
        "And so when you are desperate, you do desperate things.",
        "And I think her win is in response to that.",
        "In addition, Independents were not allowed to vote in yesterday's Pennsylvania primary, which also shows an indication that yesterday's primary was not like many of the others, that I think Barack would have done better in if Independents were allowed to vote.",
