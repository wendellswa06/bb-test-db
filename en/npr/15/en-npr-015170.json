        "In theory, human embryonic stem cells can turn into any cell type in the body.",
        "And since embryonic stem cells can grow indefinitely in the laboratory, they've become a potentially inexhaustible supply of skin or nerve or heart cells that could be used to replace cells damaged or destroyed by disease.",
        "In practice, getting embryonic stem cells to turn into the cell you want is tricky.",
        "Now, Gordon Keller and his colleagues at the McEwen Center for Regenerative Medicine in Toronto appear to have cracked the problem - at least when it comes to making heart cells.",
        "As Keller reports in the journal Nature, the trick is adding the right growth factors at just the right time.",
        "Timing is absolutely essential in getting it right.",
        "If you miss that window, you basically fail.",
        "Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.",
        "Well, what we've found is that that particular question really came from an interview that had been played, you know, a couple of weeks earlier.",
        "So the - I believe that the moderators wanted to hedge the issue, so they went out and found someone else to bring the question so that they wouldn't have to do it.",
        "So I don't think that that was a question that was on the mind of Pennsylvania voters.",
        "It was something that they wanted to talk about, and as part of the gutter politics, and - you know, the New York Times called it the \"\"low road to victory\"\" that Hillary Clinton took.",
        "It seems like everyone's trying to go down every road except the road of, how will we make the country better?",
        "And you know, I...",
        "So you think the question was essentially manipulative on the behalf of - on the part of the network?",
        "Yeah, I definitely believe that the network wanted to bring the issue in and felt that it would be easier for them to do so if they used a video clip of someone else bridging the question instead of George Stephanopoulos doing it.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, I want to move on to a topic that is near and dear to many folks on our panel.",
        "It is about black radio during the elections.",
        "So a lot of bloggers are writing that Barack Obama's campaign has put black radio back into a spotlight, particularly with new listeners who may not have listened before.",
        "You've got personalities like Tom Joyner, Michael Baisden, Bev Smith reaching new audiences.",
        "You're seeing a lot more black faces on CNN, MSNBC and Fox.",
        "And then you also have this phenomenon of internet radio.",
        "Kevin first, and then Valencia, you guys both have shows on BlogTalk Radio.",
        "What exactly is it, and what kinds of audiences are you trying to reach?",
        "Oh my God.",
        "I actually have to give kudos to Valencia, because I blog over at Three Brothers and a Sister, well Valencia is the sister of Three Brothers and a Sister.",
        "And she started saying, you know what?",
        "I'm going to try this social networking site BlogTalk Radio.",
        "And because I used to do talk radio here in Los Angeles on another - an AM talk station, I said, well I've already done it, I already know what it's like, and so you do it.",
        "I became her co-host.",
        "And then after a while, I found myself going, I'm going to give this a try, and it is amazing.",

        "And so when you have African-Americans who are blogging, who are talking about these issues, they are now saying, you know what?",
        "I don't need to wait for a Rush Limbaugh or a Bill O'Reilly or a Sean Hannity, or Larry Elders.",
        "I can have my own interaction and spin it my way.",
        "And what's amazing about that is, we are now creating a community of folks who either are doing their own shows or they themselves just want to be able to have a different perspective other than what they're seeing in traditional media.",
        "Do you feel like you have more control over the content, Valencia, in this form?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",

        "I mean, and so after the whole Reagan era came along and Rush Limbaugh came on the scene, there became this whole issue of angry white men radio.",
        "And so, while I have no problems with that perspective, that voice, there was clearly an imbalance of another perspective.",
        "And so while you've got the Michael Baisdens and the Tom Joyners coming on board, Blogtalk Radio allows for other perspectives, so people have more control to what they listen to, and really weigh in and have a voice in the broader discussion as it relates to the issues that concern us as Americans overall.",

        "So welcome back, guys.",
        "And Shawn, I'm going to jump back into this whole conversation over black radio, really by going back to the more traditional black radio, people like Tom Joyner recently.",
        "You know, there's a lot of discussion of Tavis pulling away from his role at the Tom Joyner Show.",
        "But do you think that the momentum that black radio has built up over the course of this election will be sustained, particularly with people who, you know, have not been the traditional base, people who might be, for example, non-black listeners who are tuning in because they want this perspective at this time, when a black man is one of the candidates for president?",
        "Farai, I really think that this will be sustained, because we have already seen it sustain itself.",
        "I think the black radio movement started the same time as the black blogger movement.",
        "When a 14 year old in Paris, Texas, got seven years in prison and radio station personalities like Ricky Smiley in Dallas went out and protested.",
        "And from that, you move to Michael Baisden, who was awarded by Al Sharpton for his participation in the Jenna Six movement.",
        "And so when we moved to the election, it was really an extension of a movement through black radio and black blogs that had already been progressing.",
        "And so, really, there was already an infrastructure in place for this black radio movement.",
        "So I think it will sustain itself, because we've seen it for well over a year now, the same parties holding it together.",
        "Look, Farai, if I can just jump in, though.",
        "Here's the problem.",
        "Black radio's dying.",
        "And when you look at the number of radio stations that typically do R&B, and then they may have some social commentary either in the morning or maybe on a Saturday, you're seeing fewer and fewer of those media outlets.",
        "You know, I actually saw the article that Shawn wrote, it was featured in the Philadelphia Tribune when it talked about \"\"Blogger Nation.\"\" And it was speaking on the passion, I think you were talking about Shequanda Cotton (ph), Shawn.",

        "And now they're playing Bruce Springsteen, and I like Bruce Springsteen.",
        "But at the same time, you don't necessarily have in all the different cities across the country black outlets that are really focused on the issues.",
        "And so I think between what's going on with black publications, because traditional media in terms of newspapers and magazines, that circulation is dwindling as well.",
        "So people like Shawn out in Dallas and Valencia who's doing her thing, and what we're doing over at Three Brothers and a Sister, that is going to be the media for African-Americans globally to be more interactive and really get their perspectives out there.",

        "For a while, but you can not deny the momentum that the internet is bringing right now.",
        "It was the internet, along with black radio, that brought to attention the whole Jenna Six thing.",
        "And major media tried to ignore it as long as they could, and then they could not deny it.",

        "Mainly - you know, because you have black networks that now have, you know, majority white viewers.",
