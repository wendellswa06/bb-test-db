        "It was built to no engineered standards we recognize today.",
        "It was basically a muck levee.",
        "It was built from material dredged from the inside of the lake and deposited primarily with dredges.",
        "So it was piled up, essentially.",
        "There was no engineered core to it.",
        "There was no compacted embankment or foundation design that essentially went into it, but it's extremely massive.",
        "And that's where its strength lies.",
        "At its base, the dike is 300 feet wide.",
        "Elevation in some sections is 45 feet high, several orders of magnitude larger than the levees that surround New Orleans.",
        "But like New Orleans's levees, Okeechobee's dike has a big problem.",
        "It leaks.",
        "Engineers say while some seepage is normal, Okeechobee's leaks sometimes begin washing material out of the dike.",
        "South Florida water manager Bob Howard says if those leaks aren't found and plugged, the results can be catastrophic.",
        "As that erodes into the levee taking material with it, the path along which seepage occurs becomes shorter.",
        "The shorter it is, the faster it flows, and you find this condition that actually accelerates, and it can lead to a rather rapid failure.",
        "Although water managers, engineers, elected officials and increasingly the public are aware of the problem with the Okeechobee levee, fixing it will be neither quick nor easy.",
        "Repairs will cost some $300 million and at the current rate at which their work is approved by Congress, Corps officials say it could take at least 20 years.",
        "In the meantime, the Army Corps of Engineers has inspectors combing the levee looking for leaks and just as important, managers are keeping water levels in the lake as low as possible.",
        "Bob Howard of the South Florida Water Management District says experience shows that's not always possible.",
        "In 2004 he recalls how a series of hurricanes quickly raised the lake by several feet.",
        "And then Hurricane Ivan came through, just narrowly missing Okeechobee and its feeder lakes.",
        "That's a scenario Howard fears could be repeated."
