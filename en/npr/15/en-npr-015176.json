        "It's pretty wide open - except I have been talking to royal superfans who've been out here for four days, sleeping right at certain corners so they can get a view of the carriage.",
        "Wow.",
        "And so there are people who are - just absolutely love the royal family, and they come out for this.",
        "In terms of how the rest of Britain feels, I think it's pretty mixed.",
        "We're not having as many block parties as we had for William's marriage back in 2011.",
        "And of course, you know, Harry is not going to be king.",
        "So it's not as big a deal.",
        "Also, there are some people, of course, who are critics.",
        "This is going to cost tens of millions of dollars, probably mostly for security.",
        "And some people still question whether the United Kingdom taxpayers should be spending so much on these sorts of events.",
        "Isn't there a sign of change in this royal wedding, Frank, because of whom Prince Harry is marrying?",
        "Yeah, it's a really different choice.",
        "And I think this is a more interesting story.",
        "She's an actress.",
        "She's from LA.",
        "She's biracial and divorced.",

        "So yeah, there's definitely a sense - and I think that's one of the key points of interest.",
        "Well, let's just underline that for a moment because I mentioned Brexit before.",
        "That was seen in some way as a reaction against immigrants, against too much diversity.",
        "Isn't Britain already a fairly diverse place?",
        "It's actually - it's actually not.",
        "It's fascinating.",
        "It's, I think, close to 87 percent white.",
        "So it's very different than the United States.",
        "London is much more like Manhattan.",
        "It's incredibly global.",

        "Hey.",
        "Good morning.",
        "How big a deal is this?",
        "It definitely is concerning because now we have what public health officials are calling urban Ebola, this potential for transmission to be happening in a really crowded city.",
        "And the idea is that that transmission could be exponential instead of sort of the slow, plodding linear transmission that you usually get in these rural areas in the Congo that have always been contained quite easily in the past.",
        "But still, we need to say, it's still just one confirmed case in this river port city.",
        "Although you are reminding me of 2014 when there was an outbreak of Ebola in West Africa.",
        "And I suppose we should mention - when you get into a city - most of the cities in the world are connected, and people start worrying about where a disease might go next."

        "Well, there was a recent survey out that found that people who use credit cards to pay medical bills have greater credit card debt than those who don't.",
        "Why is that?",
        "Well, first of all, because medical expenses are so high.",
        "So when they do charge, they're charging more than the average person who's just going to a retail store.",
        "It really comes down to who has insurance.",
        "Those who don't have insurance are more likely to use credit because obviously they want medical care.",
        "Well, what are these special health care credit cards, Michelle, and how do they work?",
        "Well, you know, many health care providers realized that there are lot of folks who don't have insurance.",
        "So they created these credit cards that you can only charge for medical expenses.",
        "Like the expenses you have when you go to the doctors or when you have to go the hospital for, say, an elective surgery, and you charge just like you would anything else for the expenses that you're going to incur for your medical care.",
        "Do they have the same interest rates?",
        "They're much higher than the average credit card rate right now, as much as 20, 29, maybe even 30 percent, so quite high.",
        "So why would - I mean these are very - if the interest rates are so much higher, why not just use a regular card?",
        "Why would you use this card rather than a regular credit card?",
        "That's a good question.",
        "Oftentimes they may not qualify for a regular credit card.",
        "Because these are specialized cards and they're going to their medical provider, they may qualify more quickly than they would for a regular card.",
        "But that's a good point that the interest rates are so high.",
        "And remember this.",
        "This is a key point.",
        "Oftentimes when you have a bill with a hospital or doctor, there's no interest rate charged with it if you were - got a payment plan as opposed to these cards which have these high interest rates.",
        "So Michelle, just to be clear.",
        "These are for medical expenses that are not emergencies.",
        "Because if you don't have insurance and you have an emergency, you can still get treated by walking into an emergency room.",
        "That's correct, that's correct.",
        "Say you're going to the dentist to get some dental work or elective surgery.",
        "In this country, if you need emergency treatment, the hospitals have to treat you."
