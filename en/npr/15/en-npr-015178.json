        "It's called \"\"Hazel Scott: The Pioneering Journey of a Jazz Pianist from Cafe Society to Hollywood to the House Un-American Activities Committee.\"\" Karen Chilton is the author, and we're also joined now by Hazel Scott's son, Adam Clayton Powell III.",

        "Let me talk to you first about why you did it and how long - I've understood it took a little while to get it done.",
        "Well, initially, when I set out, I was interested in writing a book on black women artist expatriots.",
        "And that's what I was researching at the time.",
        "And I actually stumbled across Hazel Scott.",
        "I didn't know much about her.",
        "And growing up on the south side of Chicago, I was sort of raised in jazz and blues, so I considered myself, you know, an expert on jazz.",
        "And I was actually very frustrated by the fact that I had never heard of Hazel Scott.",
        "I stumbled across her photo in a book in the New York Public Library.",
        "I thought, well, who is she?",
        "Then, I found another obscure out-of-print book, I think it was from the '60s, and it was a book about expatriots and it was sort of a Q&A style book.",
        "And I started reading Hazel's essays, you know, or the answers to the questions that were posed to her.",
        "And I was really compelled to dig a little deeper.",
        "And before I knew it, I had shelved the other project and I was just fully, you know, engulfed in the Hazel Scott world.",
        "And I thought, well, surely there's a book on her.",
        "Went to the bookstore and there was nothing.",
        "And the more I learned about her, I found it really hard to believe that there had been nothing written on such a fascinating artist."

        "Let me ask you, Adam, why that is - why is that the case?",
        "I think that it may be because her - the peak of her fame as a musician, as an entertainer was in the '40s and '50s, and between having her career cut off in Hollywood in the mid-'40s and then being blacklisted in the early '50s, the blacklists did work.",

        "He came.",
        "He sat with us, very quietly, but as soon as he started talking about his mom he really became animated.",
        "But one of the things that I did learn doing that piece is a little something about our engineer, Sherene.",
        "I had to go in, and she had to help mix the piece and I was playing some music from the - from the Hazel Scott CD, and she was like that's Rachmaninoff, and like she got really animated about it.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah.",
        "And also, I didn't know that you were kind of, you know, classically-trained pianist and she was like, yes and so you know, you don't only - only learn something about the people you're doing piece about but also you're colleagues as well.",
