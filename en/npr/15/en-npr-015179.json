        "You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY on NPR News.",
        "You know, when you talk to people about building electric cars, they almost always mention one stumbling block, and of course that is the batteries they need.",
        "When you ask a computer manufacturer about why they can't have a powerful, light laptop that will run unplugged for a full day, the answer again is the same.",
        "We need those batteries.",
        "Well, this week a team of researchers at MIT reported in the journal Nature that they've created a material that could, in theory, help in providing the kinds of high-performance batteries needed for portable electronics and electric cars, though the researchers say there is still a considerable amount of engineering involved, a lot of work that needs to be done.",
        "Well, joining me now is Gerd Ceder.",
        "He's professor of material science and engineering at MIT and one of the authors of that paper in Nature.",
        "Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "Mr.",
        "GERD CEDER Professor of Material Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology): Hi, Ira, how are you?",
        "How are you?",
        "Tell us about this research.",
        "What problem does it solve?",
        "Well, the problem it solves is that, you know, that batteries are thought of as things that are slow, that take a long time to charge, and what we worked on was finding material that would allow for batteries that could be charged extremely rapidly.",
        "So at least you solve one of the problems.",
        "You mean in a matter of seconds?",
        "Yeah, the rates we show are like 10, 20 seconds kind of thing.",
        "Again, it's only one material, one material that can soak up lithium, essentially, this fast, and there's a lot left to be done, but we've shown that it works in the lab.",
        "Tell us what that material is and how you made it."

        "Well, it's actually - it turned out it was a known material.",
        "It was a lithium iron phosphate which was discovered at the University of Texas over 10 years ago but which was only moderately fast, hadn't really any special properties.",
        "And about five years ago, we did a lot of computer modeling and theory on it and found that this thing should be really amazingly fast.",
        "So what we really did is look at what made it slow, and it turned out that what it is, is it's really that when lithium moves from one electrode to the other, which is how you actually charge a battery, it has to sort of jump out of the electrolyte and get soaked into that particles and that step of getting into the particles was actually the slow one.",
        "So we fixed that, and my God, we had a very high-rate material.",
        "But in…",
        "Go ahead.",
        "It's something that was enabling something that was intrinsically there by doing some modification on the material.",
        "So you modified the material to allow the electricity to move super fast through the battery.",
        "Yes, correct.",

        "Well, you say that, you said Scott Brown said he will not run in the Massachusetts special Senate election, that's the one being given up by - that was given up by John Kerry.",
        "Now had he run and had he won, he would've served alongside Elizabeth Warren, who unseated him last year.",
