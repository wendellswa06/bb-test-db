        "Well, the problem of course is this ad could scare Ashley Judd out of the race, and then Mitch McConnell could face a real opponent.",
        "This is devastating.",
        "And of course, Ashley Judd's candidacy really didn't make that much sense in a state that's so completely rejected President Obama in 2012 and 2008.",
        "But it is funny, it is caustic, and it cost them - speaking of cost, it cost them $10,000 to make this.",
        "All you've seen it is online, and yet more and more media outlets are picking it up.",
        "But it's kind of an indication of what she faces should she run against Mitch McConnell, whose numbers are not that great in Kentucky.",
        "In the meantime, back to deja vu all over again, the sequester deadline is looming, those across-the-board cuts automatically go into effect I think on March 1 unless Congress does something.",
