        "Well, he ran brilliantly as the secretary of state in New York.",

        "And I covered that campaign for NPR, and you would go to these obscure little places outside of Jamestown, and people would come up and shake hands.",
        "And I remember when you were here four years ago, Mario Cuomo, and it was just extraordinary.",
        "And by 1982, he was already lieutenant governor.",
        "So the state knew him.",
        "And at the same time, folks in New York City didn't want Koch to leave, didn't want him to be governor.",
        "And so his numbers in New York City were not that good anyway.",
        "So Koch was expecting, you know, an...",
        "Unopposed.",
        "Well basically a clear path to Albany, and he just never got there.",
        "Well, he was heavily favored to defeat Mario Cuomo, who really ran just a tremendous campaign.",
        "There was this great moment when, as you mentioned, Hugh Carey had been - was the sitting governor, had been, what, three-term governor of the state of New York, two-term governor of the state of New York, correction there from Ken very quietly.",
        "Anyway, there had been this big controversy over PCBs in the water in Buffalo, and Hugh Carey had volunteered to drink the water, and then he nominated - then he supported Ed Koch in the primary and asked for his reaction, Mario Cuomo said I told Hugh not to drink those PCBs.",
        "Well, and so - and then again after 1985 in Koch's fourth term, again there was a lot of racial problems in New York City, and he would - and African-Americans, the way he would talk to them, it just was - maybe he was charming in 1977, and it was brutally honest.",
        "By 1989, it almost got angry and caustic and bullying, a lot of people felt, and he lost to David Dinkins, who in 1989 became the first and only African-American mayor of New York City.",
        "And a gentlemanly campaigner himself.",
        "Absolutely, of course he was turned down after one term by Rudy Giuliani.",
        "But, you know, but Koch's career, his recognition didn't disappear after 1989.",
        "He was a movie critic.",

        "Another opening in - two more openings in - actually a nomination and one more opening in the president's Cabinet.",

        "Anybody on the Republican side even thinking or talking about running for president in 2016 I've said needs to get their head examined.",

        "Whether they're establishment, so-called establishment candidates or Tea Party candidates, we need folks who will do better in general elections.",

        "You know, American Crossroads ran a lot of television advertisements.",
        "But over the course of the campaign, Mitt Romney - I believe that Obama had more than twice as many television ads run than Mitt Romney.",
        "So, you know, on the one hand we did lose, but we do believe that our efforts did make the election considerably closer than it would have been otherwise.",
        "But yeah, there is a lot of work to do, and one of the conclusions that we came to after assessing all the activity from 2012, we said we need better candidates across the board in order to win these elections.",

        "I mean American Crossroads (unintelligible) are generally focused on your kind of more economic, fiscal-type issues.",
        "But it's illustrative of the fact that a candidate who has nothing to do with some other candidate can impact his race.",
        "What I mean by that is Todd Akin, you know, answering a theological question about rape and abortion ended up taking a lot of other candidates out there.",
