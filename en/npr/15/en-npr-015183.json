        "The most conservative candidate can win in a lot of, for example, Northeastern states where Republicans are hard to find these days, at least elected Republicans.",

        "What is it about this position that attracts women or that make presidents want to appoint women to it.",
        "You can think of this in two ways.",
        "You can think of it as, you know, in the insulting way, that it's like a PR position.",
        "You know, it's a position in which you want somebody who can sort of present and make a good face, and it's a sort of symbolic position more than it is an actual position.",
        "Now, that's not actually true.",
        "So I'm not going to stop there for all you people who are sort of getting their guard up listening to that.",
        "But that is one way in which it tends to seem natural that a woman would be in that position.",

        "You know, you have to be intelligent, but you have to sort of appear in a lot of meetings and deal with delicate situations.",

        "I think it's just happenstance that we're now, you know, at an end of two and possibly of three with Hillary Clinton.",
        "You know, I have to say, the most interesting thing that I read about this today was Thomas Freedman's column, talking about what is the sort of delicate balance of being the secretary of state, and it kind of gives the substantive view of why we're all obsessed with a Barack Obama-Hillary Clinton relationship.",
        "And what that is, is that the secretary of state has to kind of channel the president but has to have their own power.",
        "It's this thing where they can't be just a sort of microphone with the president speaking through them.",
        "They have to have their own kind of vision and world view, but they also have to be channeling the president.",
        "So, it's like not too weak, not too strong, and so he was - you know, he didn't sort of come down on whether he thought the Clinton/Obama relationship met those standards, but it's - I thought it was a useful paradigm for thinking about this."

        "So it would be hard to make a car with them that drives for very long.",
        "The other thing is that charging.",

        "Oh yeah.",

        "Is it an exotic material or something that can be easily made?",
        "Oh yeah.",
