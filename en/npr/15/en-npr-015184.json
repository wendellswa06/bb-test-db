        "You mean, you would take the old lithium material and put this new lithium in it?",
        "Yeah, you could.",
        "That's the way you could do it, and then you'd have to make sure that, like, all the cabling and all the other stuff can do the high rate, and then you'd have a high-rate battery.",
        "We have a question from Twitter here, and you can Twitter us at SciFri, @SciFri.",
        "Do batteries have like a Moore's Law to them?",
        "You know, like there's a limit or how fast they double in size, things like that?",
        "No, you know, unfortunately they don't have a Moore's Law to them, and part of the problem is that it's not like transistors in electronics.",
        "In the end, to store charge, you know, you store in on stuff, really.",
        "We store it on atoms, and to store more charge in the end, you always need more atoms.",
        "So you know, we may make batteries in the end that are, in energy density, like a factor two, maybe four better, but they're never going to be 1,000 times better than what we have today.",
        "Are you getting of this energy - stimulus money to work on…?",
        "We're working on it.",

        "Well, they all contain lithium, but it's all these compounds connecting lithium with other elements.",
        "They're like, you know, lithium iron phosphate or lithium manganese oxide; it's the other elements that determine how much of the lithium you can store in the electrode, so that's how we optimize these compounds.",

        "Hi.",

        "Yeah.",
        "No, yeah.",
        "No, that's a really good question because it's a concern with lithium ion batteries.",
        "And the good thing is that we started from a material that's quite a lot safer.",
        "It's a material, like I said, that some companies are now considering for power tools and cars because it's safer.",
        "The material is a lot safer than the stuff they put in your cell phone and laptop battery.",
        "So the risk of blowing up is a lot less.",

        "Now, if you put it all together in a battery - remember, we just developed the material, there's all kinds of things that can go wrong, so it's a little hard to predict.",
        "But traditionally, the batteries with this material have shown very, very long lifespan, which is actually another reason they're considered for automotive where you need, you know, thousands or maybe tens of thousands of cycles, which is a lot more than a cell phone battery gets.",
        "And the other thing about harmful products - actually, lithium ion is better in that regard.",

        "Right.",
        "Sure.",

        "A lot of the same questions.",
        "I'll just sum them up for you.",
        "One, could you make it lighter?",
        "Could the same battery - let's say you're a bicycle rider and you have a little light on your, you know, your bicycle and it's on your legs or whatever and you're peddling with it - can you make a lighter battery out of this?",
        "Well, you can, but unfortunately that's not the problem we solved - we did not solve the problem of energy density.",
        "So all we did was solve the problem of, you know, faster charging and discharging rates.",
        "But that's another problem we're actually working on in my lab, though, to make a higher energy-density battery, so then you could make them lighter.",
        "Tell us what that is.",
        "What do you mean by higher-energy density?",
        "Well, like I said, you know, the way you store charge battery - in the end you'll store it on stuff - you know, electrons, you know, atoms, and you can only put so many of them on atoms.",
        "Right."

        "So if you want to have like more electrons and lithium charge, you sort of need to put more on a single atom; that's really what we're working on.",
        "Can we find mass and crystal structures and materials that can hold a lot more lithium and electrons for the same amount of weight?",
        "So…",
        "It's a hard problem.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So for one atom, can you put more electrons - lithium in there?",
        "Basically, yeah.",
        "You don't need more atoms, you just have the same material.",
        "Yeah.",
        "What happens with all the materials if you move a lot more charge on them, they just become unstable.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "So we can make in the lab already materials with double or triple the energy density, but they're just not good enough.",
        "They're not stable for long enough to be put in a battery.",
