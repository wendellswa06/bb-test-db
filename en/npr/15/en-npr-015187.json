        "Some of his posts reflect relatively conventional far-right-wing ideas - for example, that the American currency is worthless because it's not backed by gold and silver.",
        "Loughner especially seems to believe that NASA is in the business of perpetuating frauds - that the space station is really empty, and that the Mars Rover program is a fake.",
        "Loughner also wrote about the government trying to use grammar to enslave citizens through mind control - a theory he may have borrowed from patriot conspiracy theorist David Wynn Miller.",
        "Chip Berlet, a political research associate, says Loughner also wrote about something called the second American Constitution.",
        "That refers to the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments after Reconstruction, which freed the slaves and granted citizenship to anyone born in the U.S.",
        "In white supremacist circles, and in certain right-wing conspiracy circles, the argument is that these Reconstruction amendments invalidated the actual first, legitimate Constitution and that ever since then, the government of the United States has been operating illegally.",
        "In the aftermath of the shooting, there were accusations by Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik that were subsequently echoed by others on the left.",
        "The contention was that angry political rhetoric by conservative talk radio and other right-wing pundits and politicians - about health-care reform and so-called treasonous Democrats - might have goaded Loughner to target a Democratic congresswoman.",
        "That's been met by scorn in conservative quarters.",

        "The rest is ridiculous speculation by liberals trying to make political hay out of a tragedy.",
        "There's no way of knowing whether he was angry at the government or not.",
        "His writings would seem to indicate that was true, but how do we know that he wasn't angry about his French toast that morning?",
        "We just don't."
