        "And so there seems to be a lot of unhappiness about this idea.",
        "What are the arguments against it?",
        "It comes down to a lack of diversity.",
        "The argument from the Congress, from consumer groups, is that fewer bigger media owners, citizens would be exposed to fewer points of view, fewer sources of information, fewer employment opportunities for minorities.",
        "I'll let Gene Kimmelman of Consumers Union explain.",
        "Consumers says the major source for local new and information is still their local daily newspaper and their local broadcast television station.",
        "Even with the Internet, people go to their newspaper.com or their local broadcast.com to get local information.",
        "Those are still the key sources, and we don't have that many of them.",
        "So it's very important to make sure they remain competitive and offering differing points of view.",
        "So John, where does the FCC plan to take this?",
        "Where do the commission members lean?",
        "Well, this is the second try for the FCC.",
        "Their first effort was a more sweeping relaxation of ownership limits, and the courts threw it out, raising concerns about that very threat of diversity.",
        "So this time around, even though the proposal is more targeted, it's been modified, opponents are making the same arguments, that the media monopolies in cities around the country will exist.",
        "They say that the FCC chairman is acting too hastily and hasn't considered all the objections that have been filed.",
        "They say, you know, if we just had a little time for negotiation, we could get a compromise.",
        "By way of example, when the controversy over Augusta National's policy against admitting women was in the headlines a few years back, many in the media wondered aloud what Tiger was going to do about that.",
        "If Jack Nicklaus was ever asked about that, I am unaware of it.",
        "And if Jack Nicklaus was asked about his position regarding Augusta's lack of minority membership during his career, I am also unaware of it.",
        "Why is Tiger held to a different standard?",
        "Our show with Richard Florida, on the special attributes of your city, brought letters from across the country.",
        "A listener now in North Carolina pined for the Beltway.",
        "I left D.C.",
        "in tears in 2002 and relocated to Maine.",
        "I missed the intellectual energy and culture of D.C., but much enjoy the wonderful scenery, recreation and the low-key pace of Maine.",
        "On a visit to friends in D.C.",
        "in 2005, I met my husband.",
        "He was visiting the same friends.",
        "I'd never met him.",
        "Likeminded people will gravitate to certain cities even if they can no longer afford to live there.",
        "They can hang on to these little footholds in their friends' houses.",
        "So my advice is to keep visiting those places you love.",
        "And after Richard Florida sang the praises of a certain city a little too loudly, Charlie wrote us, fed up.",
        "Please ask your guest to keep his opinions to himself on Portland.",
        "We want to keep this wonderful city a secret.",
        "And last week, we asked for your stories about the floods in the Mississippi Valley, what survived, what didn't and how you dealt with all that water.",
        "Our email inbox flooded, too, and we decided that some stories were too good not to share.",
        "The University of Iowa was devastated by flooding, and Katherine Donovan, among many others, rushed to help.",
        "In particular, the library there was in danger.",
        "Kate Donovan wrote us an email about the effort to save it.",
        "She joins us now on the line from Iowa City to tell us the story.",
        "Nice to have you on Talk of the Nation today."

        "Our house was dry, and so we thought that we would go to the university and see what the need was.",
        "And how did you know to go to the library?",
        "The university was really good about putting information out on its website about where they needed help with sandbagging and the library - the main library is right by the river and so we knew that it was in danger.",
        "And you didn't end up doing sandbags, though.",
        "Not that day.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "We did later.",
        "That was Friday, Friday the 13th.",
        "And we joined - I don't know - hundreds of other volunteers in the library, grad students.",
        "I got my master's degree here.",
        "He's a PhD student.",
        "Employees, you know, just about anyone you could imagine, and we formed sort of a book brigade, if you will, passing volumes up from the basement to the second and third floors of the library.",

        "And so, the basement of the library has a lot of muck that is being cleaned out, but I believe they got most of the volumes out.",

        "Thanks very much for being with us today.",
        "My pleasure.",
        "And Mr. Marple, what happened?",
        "Well, as the previous caller described, we had quite a bit of water here in this area, Cedar Rapids being about 20 miles north of Iowa City, so upriver.",
        "We had a downtown area that was literally inundated with many, many feet of water, and unfortunately, in that downtown area, many of the artistic treasures of Cedar Rapids exist within a block or two blocks of the river.",
        "The Paramount Theatre is just about one block off the river where the waters were at some of their deepest level.",
        "And this organ is how old?",
        "This organ is 80 years old in July.",
        "The Mighty Wurlitzer.",
        "That's right.",
        "The organ, fortunately, we've had lots of reports, and we've been getting a little bit more access into the theater, and we're really happy to be able to say that the visual part of the organ, the console that's been shown, just about everywhere being dragged, appearing as though it's completely destroyed out of the theater.",
        "Above that part of the organ is the voice of the organ, the pipes of the organ, and we've been in those areas of the theater, and they have fortunately remained dry, but we still have a lot of work ahead of us to bring this instrument back to the community.",
        "Yeah, it did.",
        "There was eight and a half feet of water at stage level in the theater for several days.",
        "It's an incredible amount of water to fill that space, and when you're in the theater now, you can just see what the water has done to all the ornate plaster work, all the ornate art deco and gilded work of the theater and to the organ itself, which has been partially removed and is awaiting help at this point.",
        "So at least there the phrase \"\"high-water mark\"\" is a lot more than a journalistic cliche."
