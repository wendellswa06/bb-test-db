        "Hi.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "So, Mr. Koppell, when you started these guides 50 years ago, what was your goal?",
        "Well, our initial goal was to provide students and other young people with the tools that they needed to have a successful and particularly, an inexpensive visit to Europe.",
        "This was in the early '60s, and Europe was still sort of unchartered territory for many people.",
        "The real travel boom only started maybe 10 years before \"\"Let's Go.\"\" And so things that are much more familiar to people today and more comfortable were at that point kind of challenging.",
        "You know, we had a student who went over to Europe, who visited hotels, who visited clubs, who visited attractions and put together, you know, a basic series of recommendations for people to use.",
        "And of course now it's so much expanded and it covers so many countries.",
        "It's a, you know, a huge oak tree.",
        "We had the acorn.",
        "And, Charlotte, I understand you spent the summer after your freshman year researching the travel guide to Greece.",
        "You're now a sophomore.",
        "Tell me about one of the most surprising adventures you had in your work in Greece.",
        "Well, actually, I think my most unexpected adventure was I found myself crashing a Greek wedding in the mountains of Niceros, which is an island near Turkey.",
        "Through some travel planning mishaps - I, like, missed some buses and missed some connections and ended up driving across the island with a fellow traveler.",
        "And he was going to this wedding in this village and I kind of crashed with him and ended up having a lot of food spilled on my head, because they carry all the feast for the wedding on these big tabletops that they kind of hoist over their heads as they're serving people.",
        "And, of course, they tripped and, of course, the one person that they spilled all over was the person who was not invited to the wedding.",
        "Is it essentially a vacation working on these guides?",
        "What's the experience like?",
        "No.",
        "It's definitely not a vacation.",
        "Because while you are in these, like, beautiful, exotic surroundings, you're not relaxed because you have work to do there.",
        "You need to be constantly on.",
        "There's a lot of footwork, there's a lot of talking to people.",
        "You can't just kind of relax in your hotel and do nothing.",
        "You have to visit five hotels a day, have six lunches, visit 12 museums.",
        "Exactly, exactly.",
        "And so that's not really the typical vacation experience.",
        "On the other hand, what's great about \"\"Let's Go\"\" is you get paid for doing something that's real, that matters.",
        "And, you know, if you mess up and if you miss an island or you miss three or four hotels, that matters because it means that those listings aren't going to get into the guide and that travelers are going to have a less fulfilling experience."

        "Mr.",
        "Koppell, you're no longer a student, but when you travel abroad do you still take the \"\"Let's Go\"\" guides with you?",
        "Actually I do.",
        "I always buy \"\"Let's Go.\"\" And the fact is that it's useful not only for students, it's useful, I think, for everybody.",
        "They have listings in the \"\"Let's Go\"\"s that I've used that are kind of the high end listings for students and sort of the low end listings for middle-class people like me.",

        "When I quit my show, that room became like a home to me.",
        "So Liz is an interesting case.",
        "When I was doing the work, I was actually working as a model, I met her at a casting, and we talked, and I interviewed her several times and kept in touch with her over the course of several years.",
        "And we were in much the same position, that we were new faces, or as they're called fresh faces, in the industry.",
        "And we were being sent out to quite a few castings every day.",
        "Imagine that your job is going on a series of job interviews every day, and this is how we met.",
        "And she was doing well in the sense that she was working for magazines and testing for photographers, developing her portfolio, as every new model needs to do, but not getting paid very well for it.",
        "She was at the time going to a university in New York, and she ended up dropping out of the university to pursue commercial work in L.A., where it's a market that she had been told models could make a lot of money in commercial jobs, in television commercials, for instance.",
        "And she did well.",
        "She went to L.A., and she was really - she hit a high streak.",
        "She booked a couple of lucrative jobs that paid her very well and had residuals with TV commercials.",
        "But after a few years, her earnings ran completely dry because she ended up getting sick, and without health insurance she had to pay out of pocket for some pretty straightforward procedures that were very costly.",
        "And so she wound up broke again, back in New York, living with her family.",
        "And that's - there are a couple of important things to draw out from that story.",
        "One of them is that it is a very uncertain and unpredictable life, and you don't have a lot of safety net to fall back on.",
        "The other is the distinction you drew between an elite model, I think they're called editorial models, and commercial."

        "Yes, yes.",
        "This is a really important distinction.",
        "The modeling market is not a singular entity, but in fact very different spheres of different types of modeling work.",
        "And the spheres loosely cohere into two categories, the editorial and the commercial.",
        "And they have different logics and different amounts of prestige and pay.",
        "So in the editorial world, these are the jobs that are considered more high-end.",
        "They're like your fashion week catwalks, your editorial spreads in a magazine, a high-end magazine, for instance, as opposed to a more commercial magazine.",
        "Commercial work are jobs like catalogs, jobs that are considered the bread and butter of any modeling agency.",
        "They also include showroom work, which is really interesting, a really interesting segment of the industry because showroom models really don't get any visibility.",
        "They literally are behind the scenes with designers who use their bodies to mold garments upon them.",
        "So showroom work, catalog work, that stuff is really lucrative.",
        "If you get in with a showroom, you can make 200 to 500 dollars an hour, and you're working repeatedly, you know, many hours over many days.",
        "This is very lucrative work; however, it's very low prestige kind of work, that you don't become a supermodel from working in showrooms.",
        "You might become super-rich from working in showrooms.",
        "However, the more editorial end of the market, this is high prestige.",
        "Walking for one of these Fashion Week shows, you know, like coming up in Paris, the right designers, can really boost your profile.",
        "However, this work tends not to pay very well.",
        "So shooting for a high-end editorial magazine may pay you a flat rate of $150 a day.",
        "It may pay you nothing.",
        "It may pay you in lunch.",
        "Similarly, some of the catwalk shows, they might be fantastic for your image, but you might not get paid in cash.",
        "You might be paid in what's known as trade.",
        "So when you're paid in trade, you get to take home some clothes.",
        "So it's kind of funny because often people think, oh, if you're a model, you know, how great, you get to keep the clothes.",
        "But actually, when you're a model, and you're doing editorial work, you're forgoing the economic payment, the cash, for a gift of clothing and for enough prestige that hopefully, the bet is, it's a risky bet, that prestige can accumulate up and land you a high-end campaign like a fragrance campaign or a multi-year, multi-million-dollar contract with, say, Calvin Klein.",

        "Okay.",
        "I am - I'm in Buffalo, and my daughter, who is now 22 and a college graduate, had a fairly successful teen modeling career for a number of years.",
        "My former wife and I, when we were married, we took her to New York and they liked her.",
        "She got an agent, and things went well.",
        "She had a few magazine covers, some European covers that were shot in New York and so forth.",
        "But some of the things that happened along the way were strange.",
        "At one point, my former wife took her to New York for a shoot when she was like 14, and the photographer said: Oh, I love your daughter.",
        "Please leave her with me.",
        "I will take good care of her - which is kind of creepy when you think about that.",
        "And then when she was 16 or 17, she had a modeling gig in Toronto, one of these gatherings, and at that point we realized that she was an athlete.",

        "And I would look at her, and it didn't look like she was any thicker than my arm.",
        "And she cried all the way back from Toronto to Buffalo.",
        "And I just said, that's it, you're done, this is crazy.",
        "This is an insane circumstance.",
        "Right, well, those are definitely hard things for a teenage girl to hear, and yet, as I documented, pretty ubiquitous and not necessarily said with malice either.",
        "When I was working in the market, and, you know, using - taking field notes and analyzing all of this data of what it's like to be a model, I definitely saw lots of the kind of things that you are talking about, creepy things, insulting things, things that can make you want to cry and feel really bad about your body.",
        "And when I did interviews with modeling agents, I learned, quite interestingly, that they are also very uncomfortable with having to tell people, young girls especially, that they need to lose weight, that this is an uncomfortable thing for them to do, because they're not jerks.",
        "Thanks very much for the call.",
        "These - creepy, that part of it - that's part of it too.",
        "Yes, that is a part of it.",
        "What's - aside from individual instances in which people may hear creepy things like, you know, hearing what may have been a pass from a photographer to a young girl, that sure, those things can happen, those things can happen in lots of different kinds of arenas.",
        "What makes it problematic in modeling is that you have a lot of young people that are the labor force, young girls especially.",
        "And you have young girls that don't necessarily have their parents with them.",
        "Modeling agents prefer to have models who are at least 16 years old.",
        "However, certainly they can start much younger, and they do start much younger.",
        "At the time that I was in New York, I learned that one of the models that was in a fashion show was a 13-year-old with me, and she had her mother with her.",
