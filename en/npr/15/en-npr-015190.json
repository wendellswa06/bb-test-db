        "Put it this way, like I work, you know, basically bringing furniture onto set, doing props, that sort of thing, and I'm - you know, my day rate is possibly a fourth or a third, even, of their rate, and my day can be a 12 or 13-hour day or longer.",
        "And there's a sort of similar dynamic in terms of it's freelance.",
        "I don't have any health insurance.",
        "It's - I think it's an industry-wide problem.",
        "Right, no, definitely.",
        "Thank you, Jay, and it's culture industries as a whole.",
        "It's not just fashion modeling, of course, it's the people that are working in production, on the sets.",
        "It's people that work in fields like publishing, artists, music, graphic design, journalism, that in all these different kinds of fields you have vast inequalities, of people who have hit the jackpot and have like a selling book or a selling piece of art, and they do great, but most people are scraping by a living.",
        "And they are largely freelance jobs that...",
        "Absolutely, absolutely.",
        "Yeah, precarious labor.",
        "I've gotten - at one point at one job I got heat exhaustion, and they put me on the train and sent me home.",
        "Wow, wow, right.",
        "And so this goes back also to the last caller, who mentioned that, you know, various creepy things can happen.",
        "When you work in these kinds of fields, you're on an individualistic basis.",
        "So in the modeling market, you have an agency, but the agency, technically you hire them, and they just work as an intermediary to put you in touch and kind of play matchmaker to clients, which means that if you have a problem with a client, if a job goes badly, if something creepy happens to you, you have to work that out on your own.",
        "You can't go to the head of HR and file a complaint with a company because you're on your own."

        "And the other part of that, Jay, at least in modeling, there's the lottery chance of huge success.",
        "Is there that in your line of work?",
        "No.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "I mean, for most people I know, it's a means to an end, to get the rent paid, to try to move on to do something else.",
        "Usually, you know, it tends to be creative folks, but not necessarily.",
        "You know, I don't want to, you know, carry furniture for a living necessarily.",

        "So this is - you know, at least I'm not in a, you know, a warehouse in the suburbs somewhere, where I grew up.",
        "So that's how I sort of keep in perspective the sort of - the petty indignities that the industry puts on us.",
        "Right, and I found that with models too, that a lot of models are realistic about their chances.",
        "Once they get into the market, they realize the superstar structure and the poor chances that they will become superstars.",
        "So they readjust accordingly.",
        "They take from it what they can, networking, for instance.",
        "These kinds of fields are fantastic in order to build your store of connections that you can transfer out into other kinds of cultural work that hopefully might have insurance with it.",

        "Like a Latino woman or an African-American woman with larger hips, they almost have a better chance in the market.",
        "I just wanted to comment on that, see what your perspective was.",
        "Right, well, that's really interesting.",
        "So offhand, I think that that's problematic in itself, right, the assumption that certain kinds of bodies make more sense with certain kinds of ethnicities, that, you know, reproduces all kinds of stereotypes, as it is.",
        "And yet there is a difference in local markets versus large fashion cities markets.",
        "So in New York, a modeling agency, they're trying to take on girls - and I don't say girls in a kind of unaware sense, I mean people who are very young and therefore girls - that will do well in the editorial market and the commercial market.",
        "They're looking for models that can both secure the money and make all the prestige, which is good for the agency and potentially also, you know, really great for the model if she hits it big.",
        "And those models are very thin, and they tend to be very white as well.",
        "I just, you know, definitely felt prejudiced against because I'm Caucasian and have larger hips.",
        "So I just kind of come to that realization that maybe that's not my future, and I'm kind of getting behind the scenes in the fashion design aspect.",

        "You know, I do just want to add, though, one thing about that.",
        "I didn't interview very many non-white women or men for the book in terms of models, but the ones that I did, they also struggled very much with their hip measurements or with their body sizes.",
        "Most of the women that I interviewed had problems trying to keep in line with a very narrow set of requirements for their bodies.",
        "Jockeys are required to keep weight too.",
        "It's a...",
        "Right, athletes, lots of different types of athletes, exactly.",
        "And there's similar kinds of mechanisms for keeping bodies in line.",
        "So different types of athletes - boxers, rowers, for instance - they go through weigh-ins, which, you know, if you don't make weight, then this is a failure of all sorts of different varieties.",
        "And similarly for modeling, we don't have weigh-ins, but models are constantly being measured or asked to change clothes, try on sample-size clothing, which, you know, might be nice and roomy or might be incredibly tight and embarrassing to try to fit into.",
        "You talked about the majority of models, at least in New York, being white.",
        "There's also a large influx of girls from - and again, I'm using the word girls and young women - from overseas.",
        "Yes, so you see a large increase of people that are coming from places like Brazil and from Eastern Europe and post-Soviet societies, and this is due to the increasing proliferation of model scouts around the world, with Internet technology, digital photography, and just the ease of travel, that it's quite easy now for models to be scouted in, say, rural Siberia and then have their images go around the world, and they can wind up in a city like New York.",
        "So there's been this huge, enormous increase of people who want to be models and who are available labor supply of models around the world.",
        "But when I say that they go to Brazil, you know, Brazil is a majority mestizo or African heritage country, but they're going to the whitest parts of Brazil.",
        "They're going into the southern parts of Brazil, where there's a history of German immigration.",
        "So models who are - the people there tend to be blonde hair, blue eyes, looking like Gisele Bundchen, for instance.",
        "So there is a preference for young girls and for fair, light-skinned girls as well.",

        "So I just do it when I can and have vacations so I can do it and get paid for my job too.",
        "So a lot of people, if they want to venture into the modeling, they - I know I did it with my kids, and they do it periodically, when they have time.",
        "You can do it on a part-time basis and then, you know, build your full-time life.",

        "No, absolutely, absolutely.",
        "And I try to do that in the book, to cover the range, I mean the kind of structural instabilities that are inherent in the labor arrangements, but also, you know, working within those labor arrangements, people make of it what they will.",
        "Some people see it as a fantastic opportunity, amazing travel, as you put it quite nicely, the various connections that you don't know where they're going to lead, that people can take all kinds of different approaches to entering these arrangements, as they do in lots of different fields like music or, you know, writing your novel or being a journalist.",
        "You can try it out and then readjust your life accordingly.",
