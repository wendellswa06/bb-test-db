        "When you look at modeling as a labor market, there's this incredible gender paradox, that it's one of the few fields in which women have greater opportunities, and they earn significantly more money than their male counterparts.",
        "Significantly more money.",
        "I mean, on occasion I documented instances in which women were earning two to three - five times more than the men for equal work.",
        "So we're not talking about - you know, obviously there's - you probably can't name that many male supermodels off the top of your head...",
        "No.",
        "...I'm guessing.",
        "OK.",
        "So, you know...",

        "Right.",
        "Where, until quite recently, some of the major tennis tournaments had unequal prize monies for the women's competitions than the men's.",
        "Right.",
        "So in modeling, there's this - like in sports, you would say, that's a traditional gender wage gap.",
        "In modeling, we see an inverse - an inverted gender wage gap.",
        "We see it also in other fields like sex work, prostitution, pornography performing, for instance.",
        "So when - what was interesting was when I interviewed agents and clients about where this wage gap comes from, about what - you know, why is it that you pay the women so much more than the men, it was a kind of - default explanations would be along the lines of, well, this is a women's business, or, you know, women are better models, women are better suited to the work, that men, you know, they're in it part-time or for other reasons, or we just don't get that excited about male models.",
        "And what I argue in the book and what I try to show is that the prices for a model's time come down to the negotiations that the agents can make with the clients.",
        "Central to those negotiations is the amount of excitement or buzz that can be generated around a model.",
        "But people are not very excited about male models, that bookers fight not as hard as they would for men, or that it's already a taken-for-granted assumption that if a man and a woman are both in a fashion job together, that she will be making more.",
        "And then agents will use the woman's rate as a basis in order to - or they will use the man's rate as a basis in order to increase the woman's rate if, for instance, there was going to be pay parity.",
        "Yes.",
        "We're talking with Ashley Mears about the world of modeling.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Buzz.",
        "Buzz is that intangible quality that suddenly takes one of these young women and makes her a star.",
        "Yes.",
        "How does one rise above the rest?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's the central question I tried to formulate an answer in my research.",
        "But it's something that, you know, the agents and the clients and the models themselves don't know.",
        "When I spoke to people, they would often attribute it to timing or luck, which is indeed important, and yet it's not a purely random or chance event for someone to make it to the top.",
        "Top model careers are made out of the editorial end of the market.",
        "Yes, you need to secure enough visibility in the magazine pages or in Fashion Week in order to land those mega campaigns that indeed can make you a star.",
        "But in order to get to that level, you need certain types of people to sanction you in the editorial market.",
        "What I found in the editorial market is that what everybody is looking for, the kind of look that they value, is something that they call edgy, which is yet another fluid, fuzzy term.",
        "An edgy look is something that is not so mainstream, that it's a little bit different, and you can't put your finger on it, but it appeals to high-end editorial tastemakers.",
        "So this edgy look is incredibly uncertain, that it's very hard to nail down.",
        "When you have a market situation in which there's a lot of uncertainty, you find that people look to each other for signals of what to do.",
        "What model do we choose if they're all similarly qualified and beautiful and young and thin?",
        "Well, we look to what other people are choosing.",
        "And they look especially to what other high-status clients are choosing.",
        "So you're looking for the people that work for Vogue or the Prada shows, for instance, you know, or Chanel.",
        "Whatever they're choosing is a good sign of what is the appropriately edgy look."

        "That's where a lot of the luck comes in, is securing a place under the sponsorship of a high-status client.",

        "Yes.",

        "So people are lying about their ages in both directions; for women, especially, because they start so young.",
        "But people may be uncomfortable hiring a 13-year-old for - to model women's wear, for instance.",
        "So they may lie about her age and say that she's 16.",
        "It can also work the opposite direction that in the editorial look, what they're looking for is something that's very fashionable.",
        "They're looking for the next fresh face.",
        "If you are already, say, 22, 23, this means that you're no longer a fresh face, that, you know, people have probably seen you.",
