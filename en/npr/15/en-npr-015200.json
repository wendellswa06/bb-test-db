        "And when they go to the polls on November 20th, they're expected to vote out the ruling Socialist Party.",
        "The Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero is stepping down, and his deputy is heading the party's ticket.",
        "But if opinion polls are right, the leader of the conservative opposition Popular Party, Mariano Rajoy, will inherit Spain's woes: 46 percent youth unemployment, overleveraged banks and hundreds of thousands of empty homes left over from the construction boom.",

        "And most of the people have lost their hope.",
        "Gallego says she may not even bother to vote.",
        "Low turnout would probably hurt the Socialists more, but the conservatives' lead in the polls is so large, there's no question they'll win by a landslide.",
