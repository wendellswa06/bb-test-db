        "Darwinian evolution is the organizing principle of biology, he says, and there's a real danger to calling such an accepted theory into question.",
        "We would not, at this point, come into schools and say, `What I want to do is teach an alternate set of grammar.",
        "It really is just as good as the grammar we're using.",
        "Where would you leave students?",
        "You'd leave them absolutely disabled by what may be a cranky idea.",
        "And there's another danger, says Ken Miller, a biologist at Brown University.",
        "He believes the larger goal of the intelligent design movement is to redefine science itself.",
        "What the intelligent design movement seeks to do is basically to say that supernatural forces can be brought into the scientific sphere, and we can use them as explanations for natural phenomena.",
        "That's pushing science back to the age before the scientific revolution, more than 400 years ago.",
        "So what should be done about those scientists who favor a designer's hand?",
        "Miller says their ideas should not be squelched, but they should not be immune to criticism either.",
        "But today some professors who favor intelligent are being publicly humiliated and sometimes punished for their ideas.",
        "For example, Guillermo Gonzalez, an untenured professor at the University of Iowa, says 120 of his fellow professors signed a petition this fall protesting his views on intelligent design.",
        "When he travels, his lectures draw protesters.",
        "Michael Behe, who has felt no pressure himself because he already has tenure, gives this advice to young scientists who prefer a designer to Darwin.",
        "[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: Guillermo Gonzalez teaches at Iowa State University, and it was there that his colleagues signed a petition criticizing intelligent design.]",
        "Keep your ideas to yourself, until you at least get tenure, because otherwise you have an excellent chance of losing your position.",
        "NPR talked with 18 university professors and scientists who subscribe to intelligent design.",
        "Most would not speak on the record for fear of losing their jobs.",
        "One untenured professor at Kennesaw State University in Georgia wrote that talking to NPR would be, quote, \"\"the kiss of death.\"\" Another said, `There is no way I would reveal myself prior to obtaining tenure.'",
        "Tom Sharkey says these fears may be exaggerated.",
        "Sharkey heads the institute overseeing biology education at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, one of the nation's top research universities.",
        "He says if a professor voices these views, even in class, that in and of itself won't be a career-ender.",
        "But, he says, it might indicate a misunderstanding of science.",
        "If you're not doing science properly, that is a problem.",
        "You won't get grants.",
        "You won't get papers published.",
        "Then you will fail at getting tenure, not because your department members will say that they're voting against you based on your religious beliefs but because you won't be successful in science.",

        "It's Tuesday evening at George Mason University in northern Virginia, and about two dozen students wander from dinner to the student union building.",

        "Now she's returned as something of a cause celebre.",
        "Crocker spends about a half-hour detailing what she sees as the flaws in evolutionary theory.",
        "Then she sends a warning to these potential scientists, most of whom are also Christian.",
        "(Soundbite of lecture)",
        "So is it OK to question evolution?",
        "Well, let me tell you from personal experience, people lose their jobs for doing it.",

        "Yes.",

        "I gave one lecture on the evidence for and against evolution, and at the end of the lecture I said to students, `Well, you need to make up your own mind.",
        "Think about it for yourself.'",
        "A student complained to her supervisor that Crocker was teaching creationism.",
        "Her supervisor, she says, told her she would not be teaching the cell biology class in the spring as a disciplinary measure.",
        "Her supervisor declined to comment.",
        "Later, Crocker learned that her contract was not renewed.",
        "She believes it was because of that class.",
        "A spokesman for George Mason would not comment on the circumstance surrounding Crocker's departure because it's a personnel issue, but, he said, it's not unusual for a contract to lapse.",
        "After Crocker's talk on this Tuesday night, students told similar stories of ridicule by their peers and even teachers when they expressed doubts about Darwinian evolution.",
        "Jessica Young(ph), a senior, is majoring in biology."
