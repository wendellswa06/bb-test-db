        "In right behind those two are Cleveland, Baltimore, the Yankees and Kansas City.",
        "Now, the great chaos scenario is if several of these teams finished with identical records, then you've got the possibility of extra tie-breaker games; before you get to that one nail-biting game that determined that league's one wild card team that advances in the playoffs.",
        "It should be fun.",
        "Wow.",
        "That would be a wild couple of days if that happens."
