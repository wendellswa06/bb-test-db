        "And the other issue that I wanted to raise is that sometimes when you show the actual cost of a four-year institution, whether it's public or private - I mean, there's a kind of sticker shock that sometimes causes low-income students, even the very well-prepared students who are eligible for a selective institution, to choose to attend a less-costly, maybe a two-year institution.",
