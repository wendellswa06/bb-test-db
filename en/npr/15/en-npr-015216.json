        "And if you're brand new to democracy and don't know about everything from, you know, campaigning door to door if that's even a viable option in an area like that or even, you know, retail politics, I mean, everything that goes along with a campaign.",
        "Just wondering if there's any groups like that that go into an Egypt and teach them, help them kind of compete against a group that kind of has built in, you know, authority.",

        "To the best of my knowledge, thus far, there haven't been international groups doing that.",
        "But, you know, the Muslim Brotherhood was taught these tactics either.",
        "I think it's fair to say a couple of things on this point.",
        "First thing, here in the West, we may laud secularists and secularism as being something positive.",
        "It's got to be borne in mind that nobody in their right mind would be going to door to door in Egypt advocating secularism just by virtue of the word in Arabic or even in order to have a negative connotation.",
        "So even Egypt's secularists refer to themselves as liberals because that has less of a negative connotation.",
        "The second point is this, that there's been a huge problem among Egypt's liberals or secularists in defining what they stand for.",
        "It's been counterproductive thus far that they've, more or less, gone - attack and constantly in the offensive in saying, we're not Islamists.",
        "We're against the Muslim Brotherhood.",
        "We don't want more religion in the public space.",
        "But that's not a coherent policy in terms of what you stand for and what you offer.",
        "So thus far, the problem's been that they've been against something rather than what they stand for.",
        "And for as long as they don't have their message and their resources and their networks in place, they're not really in the position to either go door to door or mosque to mosque or hospital to hospital or trade union to trade union as the Muslim Brotherhood's done.",
        "Now, the one thing the Muslim Brotherhood can possibly be criticized for - because all these things are political sort of strategies and, you know, good luck to them for doing that, and it rests in the secularists to up their game.",
        "But even on election day, we saw Muslim Brotherhood people outside polling stations campaigning for the Muslim Brotherhood.",
        "And I think that does go against the grain of democracy and free and fair elections, that only one group, whether it's right or wrong, allowed or not, was outside those polling stations at the expense of other groups being there.",

        "We were camping in a very dense area and he was taking air samples during the night, every three hours.",
        "And he had a notebook.",

        "When he was just 27 years old, he challenged his boss, Roger Revelle, a world-renowned climate scientist, about how to take carbon dioxide measurements.",
        "Revelle wanted Keeling to measure carbon dioxide the traditional way, and that meant taking air samples around the world, sort of like taking a public opinion poll of the air, and take that poll, say, every 10 years to see how much the CO2 had increased.",
        "No, no, no, said Keeling.",
        "You don't need to go all over the world because the air will come to you.",
