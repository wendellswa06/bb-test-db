        "But it has come now, and as you mentioned, or Madeleine mentioned, John Negroponte, the outgoing national intelligence director, briefed President Bush at the White House about it yesterday.",
        "This is an interesting document in the sense that it comes to no hard conclusions about issues like is there a civil war taking place.",
        "But it suggests that, you know what, there are the possibility here for more deterioration of the situation.",

        "Not public so much as private conversations that I've had in which they are trying to focus on the good news here, the idea that the new NIE, which of course, Madeleine, represents the best intelligence of all the 16 agencies across the government that collect intelligence, that there's now opportunity here to say, you know what, if sectarian violence has diminished, if Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki is able to do a better job of limiting corruption, going after even his fellow Shia who are involved in corruption, or militias that are destabilizing the country, then they do see the possibility for improvement.",
        "But overall, they don't see that that's likely in the next, you know, in the next few months.",

        "Well, you know, I think there's - what you're noticing there, Alex, is there's a sheepishness on the part of the intelligence community.",
        "They've been wrong before.",
        "Don't forget what happened, looking back to other National Intelligence Estimates, especially intelligence regarding weapons of mass destruction.",
        "So what you have here is they've made a real effort in the document, if you'll notice, to highlight contrasting or even contradictory points of view so that no one can say that the intelligence has been skewed or is political.",
        "And so what you come away from it is no hard and fast conclusion.",
        "Although I don't think there's any getting away from the idea that they see this as a situation that could easily slide into - could further deteriorate.",
        "And Juan, what about Democratic leadership on the Hill; what is the new reaction there?",
        "Because a lot of senators have been openly skeptical of the NIEs, basically because of what you just mentioned, because of that intelligence from that infamous 2002 estimate about Saddam Hussein and weapons of mass destruction.",
        "So are they equally skeptical about this latest NIE?",
        "Well, they just don't see that it has the power that they had hoped.",
        "I mean much as you were just saying, as Alex was saying, you know, it doesn't come to any hard and fast conclusion that would drive the discussion in one direction.",

        "You take, for example, everybody's waiting on a report about Iran and exactly where is the evidence that Iran is involved in Iraq?",
