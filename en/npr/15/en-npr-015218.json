        "It's seductive, and therefore we'd better understand its true promise before we get carried away.",
        "It sounds like you were concerned that this would be an excuse for inaction.",
        "Yes.",
        "The physics panel concluded that the technology would be hopelessly expensive, costing $600 for every ton of carbon dioxide it drew out of the air.",
        "And the scale would also be huge.",
        "Consider what it would take to capture the carbon dioxide wafted into the air from a single coal-fired power plant.",
        "The calculation that we have in our American Physical Society report is that it will be 20 miles long and 30 feet high.",
        "So it's like the Great Wall of China.",
        "The committee concluded that it would make a lot more sense to cut down on emissions first - like make our cars, homes and factories more efficient.",
        "They also say it makes much more sense to capture carbon dioxide directly from smokestacks, where it's concentrated, instead of from the air.",
        "Socolow says maybe someday we'll have our emissions under control, and then we might need to remove some of the carbon dioxide that's already in the air with a capture technology.",
        "But that's a long way away, in his view.",
        "I locate it in the 22nd century.",
        "In other words, this might be a good project for Eisenberger's great-great-great grandchildren.",
        "No surprise, researchers working on carbon dioxide capture technologies today say that report made it much harder for them to raise money.",
        "And Eisenberger says the conclusions are just plain wrong, particularly the panel's cost estimate of $600 a ton.",
        "We have had third-party reports - independent people - evaluating our technology, and it's under $50 a ton."

        "Oh, without a doubt, and the history will show you that.",

        "The people that take the time to come into the lab, right, and see it working and can do their own evaluation of the costs and all the performance, they know it's not crazy.",
        "And if he and other researchers pursuing this technology can really make it inexpensive to draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, Eisenberger says it could be a game-changer.",
        "We could start producing fuels with the carbon dioxide that's already in the air, instead of unearthing more fossil fuels.",

        "There's certainly no guarantee that capturing carbon dioxide from the air will ever become big enough to make a difference to our climate.",

        "It was extraordinary at the press conference yesterday, that the Iraq Study Group gave.",
        "They talked about the specifics of Iran and Syria.",

        "He said basically you negotiate with your enemies.",
        "You know, don't be afraid of them, talk to them face-to-face - even if they're unwilling, even if they're uncooperative - that's what you do.",
        "And he brought up the example of the Soviet Union.",
        "He said for 40 years they wanted to wipe us off the face of the Earth, and we still negotiated with them.",
        "So this was sort of a lesson coming from the veteran diplomat to the diplomats now in charge.",
        "And how do you think the diplomats now in charge will take that lesson?",
        "Not very well.",
        "I think they see things differently.",
        "They don't think they want to reward bad behavior on the part of both the Iranian leader and the Syrians.",
        "On the other hand, it does appear that the president is embracing efforts by the Iraqi government to reach out to those two rouge nations, and that maybe the way in which the Bush administration kind of solves this problem.",
        "As to - they'll say we're not going to talk to these countries, but we encourage the Iraqis to continue their outreach, as a part of building stability for their country.",
        "One of President Bush's famous lines - you're either with us or you're against us - kind of symbolizing it's our way of the highway approach, dealing with the minority Democrats.",
