        "It really was the fact that there is a paradox.",
        "There was basically a mistake at the heart of mathematics, because the whole point of studying mathematics is because it is absolutely certain and everything is known, and everything has its place.",
        "And there is a very orderly hierarchy of results there.",
        "And now in the middle of that you throw this paradox and you can get all those strange results.",

        "Because in England what happened was that during the civil war, the whole social order was suddenly under threat, those revolutionaries, those radical sects, all of them just bubbled and threatened the established order that was dominated by the propertied classes.",
        "And again, there were two approaches to this.",
        "One of them was represented by Thomas Hobbs, who's known today of course as a political philosopher.",

        "On the other side, his personal enemy and rival for almost three decades was John Wallis.",
        "And he believed that the chance for that kind of order is gone.",
        "What you have to build now is some space where dissent can be allowed, within limits at least, where not everything can be known at any given time, and build a society and build a social order from the ground up, rather than imposing it by one single law.",
        "So if the Jesuits and Thomas Hobbs had won, had been able to shut the door on the infinitesimal, what would the Western world look like now, do you think?",
        "Well, I think things would've been very different.",
        "I think if they had won then it would've been a much more hierarchical society.",
        "There was certainly, in a world like that, there would not be room for democracy, there would not be room for dissent.",

        "Modern science, modern technology, and everything from your cell phone to this radio station to airplanes, to cars and trains, it is all fundamentally dependent on this technique of infinitesimals."
