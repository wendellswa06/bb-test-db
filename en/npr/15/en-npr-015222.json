        "And they go, Lynn University?",
        "What?",
        "Then I have to tell them it's in Boca Raton, Florida, and a lot of them say, oh, FAU, or the University of Miami.",
        "Many of Lynn's students and faculty who gather at the campus cafe say they hear that sort of thing all the time.",
        "But university spokesman Joshua Glanzer says a new T-shirt showing up on campus gives it right back.",
