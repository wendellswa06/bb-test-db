        "If that's not working, if we don't have regulators who are able to be strong enough, who can write tough enough rules to keep that distinction in place, the Volcker Rule won't be able to do its job.",

        "But before the Volcker Rule was even passed in the original version of Dodd-Frank, industry insisted on a wave of exemptions and loopholes, and there were so many.",

        "And Dodd-Frank theoretically addressed this by saying essentially that no one speculator could dominate more than a quarter of the market at any time while industry filed a lawsuit, which challenge the legality of that rule on the basis that the government did not perform a cost-benefit analysis of the law.",

        "That's absolutely the case.",

        "So this is kind of an example of how Dodd-Frank worked in general.",
        "You start it off with a very simple concept.",
