        "You know, most of what has been said about this is that it was a trade for the purpose of earning profits.",
        "This was a trade or a series of trades that were intended to protect the bank against losses.",
        "Now, any trade that is a hedge is potentially a loss.",
        "That only means that banking and any kind of financial activity of the kind that banks do is always going to be somewhat risky.",
        "Will this keep other banks from hedging their assets?",
        "One would hope not.",
        "That would probably contribute substantially to additional losses.",
        "So I think the only thing that it might do is to make sure that every complicated trade is gone over by many more people and followed much more carefully than this one was.",
        "That's Peter Wallison, a former Treasury official in the Reagan administration.",
        "By the way, last month, under industry pressure, the SEC agreed to exempt thousands of Wall Street firms from oversight on derivatives trading if they earn less than $8 billion a year.",
        "By one estimate, that could affect up to 85 percent of financial firms.",

        "Even though this song might make you think of a relaxed afternoon on a Hawaiian beach under a palm tree, the woman who wrote it actually lived through one of the most stressful times in Hawaiian history.",
        "The song is called \"\"Aloha Oe,\"\" and it was in 1878 by Lili'uokalani, the last queen of Hawaii.",
        "The last one, because in 1893, Lili'u, as she called herself, was ousted by a cabal of white sugar planters who eventually engineered Hawaii's annexation to the United States five years later.",

        "Maricopa is Arizona's most populous county and accounts for almost two thirds of the state's residents, and yet there were only 60 polling places, down from 200 in 2012.",
        "Reporter Jude Joffe-Block from member station KJZZ in Phoenix has been following this story, and she joins the program now.",
        "And Jude, so far, what's the explanation as to why there were just fewer polling places to begin with compared to four years ago?",
        "Well, you know, I was at a polling place in Phoenix where voters who'd gotten in line right before 7 didn't cast their ballot after midnight.",
        "So very dramatic problems that we are seeing.",
        "And it seems like the issue might've come down to budget cuts.",
        "The state passed a budget last year that cut funding to counties, and we know that county supervisors directed election officials to run a cheap election.",
        "And one of the ways they did that was by reducing the number of polling places.",
        "The idea was the 60 polling places would be larger than past polling places, would accommodate more voters and voters would be allowed to visit any of the 60 polling places in the county.",
        "But what's clear is that 60 was really not enough."

        "They're blaming the Republican administration saying that the budget cuts as well as legislation that's made it harder to vote in Arizona is really the problem here.",
        "Meanwhile, Arizona does have a history of discrimination when it comes to voting and voting rights, correct?",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, Arizona has a history of discriminating against minority voters, particularly Latino voters, and that's one reason the state was one of the states that used to be required to check any election changes with the Department of Justice to make sure they wouldn't be discriminatory.",
        "But that stopped three years ago, or almost three years ago, when the U.S.",
        "Supreme Court invalidated a section of the Voting Rights Act.",

        "Do you get the sense this episode changed the debate around voting and elections in the state?",
        "Well, this is a state with voter ID laws.",
        "There was controversy here over whether voters should have to prove citizenship in order to register to vote.",
        "And usually those debates fell on partisan lines, but what we're seeing now, this basic issue of whether you should have to stand in line for hours and hours to vote, there's bipartisan outrage over this and joint agreement that this has to be fixed right away.",
        "There's a statewide election coming up in May, and there's a lot of pressure on officials to get things right and there does seem to be a sense of urgency.",
        "We're going to see hearings in the legislature starting Monday.",
        "The secretary of state has promised to hold her own hearings.",
        "And yesterday, the attorney general announced that he intends to introduce legislation that will prevent early results from coming out when voters are still in line.",
