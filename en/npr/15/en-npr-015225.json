        "The old saying in Hawaii about the Christian missionaries who arrived was they came to do good, and they did very well.",
        "And they did very well, indeed, in fact.",
        "By the last decade, when Lili'u assumed the throne of Hawaii, the sons and grandsons of the missionaries controlled the vast majority of arable land, as well as the banks, the steamship lines and most other businesses.",
        "Like when Lili'u was born, there had been, you know, for centuries, taro fields and fish ponds, and those were very rapidly replaced by sugar fields.",
        "And so the span of her life really followed the economic transformation of the islands.",
        "And my book is really about the collision between these two cultures, very vulnerable Polynesian peoples who had been isolated for so many years colliding with the Western capitalist world.",

        "And the third leg of the stool is that native Hawaiians urged her to try to regain more powers for the monarchy.",

        "He was essentially a figurehead.",

        "She had some initial success but could never convince enough people to back her, right?",
        "Partly, that was it, and partly, that the second envoy that was sent out found something very different than the first envoy had found.",
        "And so he sent back a big report that muddied the waters about what exactly had happened.",
