        "Before the Six-day War of 1967, Israel's de-facto Eastern border was along an armistice line from 1949, the so-called Green Line.",
        "That line is more or less the border that Palestinians hope to make permanent in any final peace deal.",
        "But in the four decades since Israel occupied land beyond that Green Line, nearly half-a-million Israelis have settled in that territory.",
        "Whole Israeli cities have sprung up in the West Bank, and Israel says it would unrealistic to move them out.",
        "But Palestinians say that doesn't matter.",
        "They insist those settlements are illegal, and so dismantling those settlement cities will almost certainly have to happen, they say.",
        "Here's Maen Rashid Areikat.",
        "He is the chief Palestinian representative to Washington.",
        "The Palestinian position has always been that we need to know what the borders of a future Palestinian state.",
        "We cannot negotiate about the establishment of a Palestinian state if we don't know the borders.",
        "And this is something that Israel has been trying to avoid.",
        "When you talk about borders, is there a sense of what might be acceptable, what is in the realm of possibility from the Palestinian perspective?",
        "I mean, could you envision Israel holding on to some of those large settlements that are currently in the occupied territory?",
        "Our position is very clear on borders.",
        "We said 1967 lines with minor modifications.",
        "We absolutely are not envisioning the land swap that the Israelis have been proposing - the five, six percent.",
        "We are talking about as little, as minor as possible of a land swap to accommodate certain interests and changes.",
        "But we are not envisioning a large land swap.",
        "I'm curious to get a sense of what you make of the president's tone.",
        "Is this president seen as somebody who is perhaps friendlier to Palestinians than his predecessor or previous presidents?"

        "So we are encouraged.",
        "We appreciate the effort of the president and the administration, and we hope that it will lead to something soon.",
        "The president said that negotiations have to happen between the two parties.",
        "But it is your view that that can't really happen without the United States pushing the two parties to the table?",
        "Can it happen without U.S.",

        "I think any agreement has to be accepted by both parties.",
        "It has to be a bilateral agreement.",

        "No, it's not that.",
        "I think you just heard the president at AIPAC saying that the Palestinians' inclination to go to the United Nations is because of their impatience, frustration that the bilateral tract, the so-called peace process, did not produce the end of the Israeli military occupation and the establishment of a Palestinian state.",
        "The Palestinian leadership is responsible for its people.",
        "They have to deliver an end to the occupation.",
        "It is not the only option for us.",
        "We have said that repeatedly.",

        "Well, I think obviously the last part of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 were challenging.",
        "But what youve seen this year is our revenues, year-to-date, are running ahead of what they were for the same period in 2009.",

        "But I think it's made us a stronger company going forward.",
