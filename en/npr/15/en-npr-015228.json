        "Barrett has been involved in some of the discussions on behalf of the United Nations.",

        "Everyone's waiting on everybody else to make the first move.",
        "I mean, and it has to wait a little bit on the mechanics being sorted out.",
        "And those mechanics are where there's been movement.",
        "Broadly(ph), the U.S.",
        "has said that if the Taliban renounces al-Qaida publicly, that would trigger other initiatives, including a plan to transfer five Taliban leaders now at Guantanamo Bay to Qatar, where they would be under house arrest.",
        "In exchange, the Taliban would release Bergdahl.",
        "U.S.",
        "officials say this proposal was floated in March.",
