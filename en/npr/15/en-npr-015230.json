        "David, when you get a sense of what people are asking about of candidate Hillary Clinton, are they also anxious on that side about immigration or is that more, do you think, a Republican concern?",
        "Well, it's funny you bring that up, Robert.",
        "Immigration has been a big issue at Democratic events in Iowa, but on this trip, there have been no questions for Hillary Clinton in public.",
        "They've kept this very, very scripted.",
        "President Bill Clinton gives his free speech.",
        "Senator Clinton speaks for a while.",
        "Those are the public events.",
        "Now they have been holding smaller events with caucus goers trying to get their support and their commitment to Hillary Clinton, but with the president out here with his wife, they have been keeping those events so far close to the media.",
        "The question of either pardoning or, as it happens, it turned out to be commuting the sentence of Lewis Libby has been an awkward one for the Clinton campaign since Senator Clinton's husband made a very controversial pardon of Marc Rich, a fugitive financier, just as he was leaving office.",
        "Has that been brought up at all in Iowa this week?",
        "It did come up.",
        "Senator Clinton brought it up briefly and she accused President Bush of trying to be above the law.",
        "But you're right, it's very touchy given President Clinton being right here and his pardon of Marc Rich was very controversial.",
        "Hillary Clinton said in a wire service interview that she makes a distinction that Lewis \"\"Scooter\"\" Libby was trying to protect the White House and that was never the case with anyone who her husband pardoned.",
        "But Marc Rich was, in the eyes of many, a pretty bad person.",
        "His ex-wife had given a lot of money to the Clinton campaign and Democratic causes, but he was accused of tax evasion and oil deals with Iran, but President Clinton pardoned him.",
        "And here's one great piece of trivia, Robert.",
        "Lewis \"\"Scooter\"\" Libby actually represented Marc Rich back in the '80s and '90s.",
        "So you see how small Washington can be sometimes.",
        "Now, what have the crowds been like?",
        "Ina, did I hear you saying that at the Ask Mitt Anything events, there are 50 to 70 people typically?",
        "Typically, that's about the number and they tend to be entirely white and somewhat older.",
        "And he's been received warmly and enthusiastically.",
        "And after he speaks and after he takes all the questions from the audience, usually, he sticks around and people get one-on-one conversations with him and get their pictures taken.",
        "And he was telling me earlier when I got to ask him a question at one of these events that he really values the retail campaigning that Iowa and New Hampshire provide, and that one-on-one contact with voters and that he hopes that doesn't go away.",
        "And David Greene, the crowds that Senator Clinton and former President Clinton are drawing?",
        "They've been large.",
        "I can't say they have been huge or exuberant.",
        "But, you know, Robert, in Iowa, people don't get that crazy at this point of the campaign about campaign events.",
        "I mean, I think it's a matter of, well, let's go listen to this candidate and learn a lot and then wait for the next person to come.",
        "There are just so many candidates here right now.",
        "And even look at The Des Moines Register, the newspaper, and it's almost like movie listings.",
        "They tell people around the state where they can go find candidates.",
        "So I can open up the paper and I know exactly where Ina is at any point in the day.",

        "Pamuk classifies \"\"Exile and the Kingdom\"\" as philosophical fiction and places Camus himself rightly so in the grand company of Dostoevsky and Borges.",
        "Half of these stories - the three best I want to say - take place in Camus's native North Africa, and thus in the landscape of blue and white roof villages, sandy and stony deserts and infinite skies.",

        "He'd been born here, we learned.",
        "Any place else he felt exiled, writes Camus.",
        "But when a French policeman shows up at the village schoolhouse with an Arab prisoner and asks the teacher to turn him in over the district police, the ironic rewards of belonging to this trying land become all too clear."
