        "The issues may not be quite the same for people who are gay and lesbian, but do you think that there is something that is at least where you feel like you have a chance to date someone who is not only just your race, but who may have other similarities with you.",
        "Did that figure into how you think about things, JaNiece?",
        "Dating someone who is like me, you're saying does that figure in?",

        "One thing that I have noticed that we talked about earlier in the series is how people use language, like MSM, men having sex with men or men who - anyway, it's an alternate word for being gay or having gay sexual behavior that does not use gay, which some people don't like.",
        "What it sounds like you're saying to me Ronnell in a way - and please correct me if I'm wrong - is that there are some people who may consider themselves MSM but who would not consider themselves gay.",
        "Is that at all accurate?",
        "Possibly, but I don't even know if those people are even thinking about those terms.",
        "They're just thinking about how other people accept them if they knew that they even had an attraction to another male.",
        "As far as personally, I don't really get off into the term thing.",
        "I just kind of go with the flow.",
        "If someone used MSM, I go with that.",
        "If they used same-gender-loving, I'll go with that.",
        "If they use gay, I'll go with that.",

        "But I identify with all of it.",
        "I mean, it's very arbitrary to me.",
        "Tim, is there anything to - and I'm speaking on one hand about language, but on the other hand about behavior.",
        "I have a friend who's a gay black man who says that it's really behavior that dictates what your sexuality is, not identity.",
        "Other people might disagree.",
        "But what he says is if you're having sex with men, you are gay or bisexual and that's it.",
        "But there are a lot of people who might disagree with that.",
        "How did that play out during your time in school?",
        "And what's your opinion now as a man who continues to work in the community of gays and lesbians and HIV and AIDS awareness?",
        "Well, I think that they were not monolithic.",
        "And there's so many shades of who we are as a gay, especially African-American men.",
        "There are men who will not identify whatsoever with MSM or any term whatsoever, but they still have sex with men.",
        "And some of them are married, as we know.",
        "So the terms really don't really mean anything but - no one wants to be labeled gay, especially if you are a black male who's gay, especially if you are a black male who is very masculine and gay, because this whole image thing also is really, really messed up.",
        "But when I was going to school - actually, there were a group of us, all of us who were gay, we just happened to find each other like magnets.",
        "There were some that were really more flamboyant than others.",
        "And then when we go out on campus when we actually saw each other, the real flamboyant ones, we were, you know, they really didn't care about anybody knowing who they were.",
        "We would just say, hey, what's up?",
        "How are you doing?",
        "We'd acknowledge them on campus.",

        "Take me inside that a little bit.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "On our campus when we started our group, we had to go out and basically search out 30 people to charter our group on campus.",
        "And I will absolutely tell you I went to clubs, I went on campus and stood in front of the library, anything I could do to find these 30 people who were willing to put to their name on this charter, and we ended up with about 28 females and two males.",
        "Wow.",
        "The fact that they didn't want to put their name to it.",
        "It was okay to come to meetings and it's okay to club and it was okay if it - everything that happened in the dark and everything that happen at night or things that happen - we could talk on campus as long as no one else knew.",
        "But if their name was just on this charter, if their name was just on this piece of paper along with their student ID number, it just attached them to the word gay and it attached them to homosexuality.",
        "It attached them to LGBT, and they wanted no parts of it.",
        "And from what I've been able to gather from the males that I know - and anyone please correct me if I'm wrong - is that it's difficult because in the African-American community, males are taught to be strong and the heads of households and they have this place society.",
        "And if you attach gay to that, it somehow takes away some part of masculinity from it.",
        "And it puts this type of stigma around you, just this one word.",
        "And with females, it's not that same type of stigma attached.",
        "We're just taught to, you know, be part of a family, not necessarily lead that family.",
        "So with females they were a lot more open, a lot more excited about the group, while the males just didn't want any parts of it in writing.",
        "They didn't mind coming to the meetings or coming to the parties that we had or coming to any of the functions that we had, but they didn't want anyone to be able to attach them to the group in writing or attach them to the group by word of mouth at all.",
        "Ronnell, does this sounds like it would happen on your campus as well?",
        "It does sound like it would happen.",
        "And I definitely understand what you're saying that people don't want to be attached to the word gay.",
