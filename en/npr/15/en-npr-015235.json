        "So what are the consequences of this kind of praise in these leaders' home countries?",
        "You know, when they go back to Brazil or Turkey or the Philippines having had warm words from President Trump, what does that do for them?",
        "It obviously encourages their supporters and makes it much more difficult for anyone who opposes them.",
        "And I think this is the - one of the most striking things.",
        "For the past 40 years, there's been talk of whether it's the end of history and the emergence of democratic movements, whether it's the end of communism in Eastern Europe, the end of apartheid and minority rule in Africa, the end of military dictatorships in Latin America.",
        "And we're seeing this sweep now, this reversal, whether it's the populists taking over, the thugs, the autocrats coming back into power.",
        "And I think this undermines many of the principles that had defined the post-Cold War world and had been the aspiration of Republican and Democratic presidents before him.",
        "But are the words of an American president really that powerful?",
        "I mean, when Trump says Orban is respected, tough, doing the right thing, does that actually make a difference in Hungary?",
        "Well, he - Orban was elected.",

        "And they reflect - whether it's anti-immigration sentiment or sectarian policies, it reflects the realities on the ground in many of these countries.",
        "But it also makes it much harder for any of the opposition groups to be daring, to take to the streets, to run for office.",
        "Many of these leaders feel empowered so that they can act against their own people.",
        "You look at President Erdogan in Turkey and what he's done in arresting thousands of people.",
        "This is - this leads to actions that make it easier for autocrats and more difficult for those who are the democrats.",
        "There's a long history of American presidents making alliances out of convenience with countries whose values don't necessarily align with the United States - Saudi Arabia, for example.",
        "Is this fundamentally different from that?",
        "Well, for a long time, the United States, because of the Cold War, supported autocratic regimes and despots because they were so opposed to the Soviet Union.",
        "They took our side in that conflict.",
        "In the post-Cold War world, we've had more leverage to push - whether it's human rights, nation building, independence movements.",
        "And you're right.",
        "Saudi Arabia is one of the consonant exceptions.",
        "But what makes this particular regime in Saudi Arabia so egregious is we've just gone through a case where Jamal Khashoggi, who was living in the United States - a prominent Saudi journalist - was murdered and dismembered.",

        "and to have a positive relationship there.",
        "Do you think that argument holds up?",
        "Well, the question, really, is, what do you want out of your foreign policy?",
        "Do you want stability or do you want values?",
        "And that's been something that has torn American leaders for centuries.",
        "And in the post-Cold War world, there was a sense this was a time to move toward our values.",
        "And I think we're moving back increasingly toward those regimes that can guarantee stability, even if it means through draconian tactics.",

        "The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation and bestiality were so overpowering, I made the visit to give firsthand evidence if ever in the future there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to propaganda.",
        "That's why Eisenhower ordered American units in the area to see the camps and all their horror and for German civilians to be brought in, too, so men and women would know from their own eyes about the monstrous and unparalleled crimes that had been committed and could give their accounts to history for all time so we would never forget.",
