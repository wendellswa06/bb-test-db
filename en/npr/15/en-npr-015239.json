        "But for decades, scientists and historians have debated whether the medieval plague was indeed caused by this same bug, or was it something else?",

        "Right from the outbreak of the third pandemic of plague that's going on right now; in the late 1890s in China, scientists began to identify it with the medieval Black Death.",
        "But as knowledge deepened and as scholars went more carefully through the evidence, a number of factors emerged that caused them to be - caused some of them to be more or less skeptical.",

        "Well, that's - our interest has really been to try and identify sort of larger genetic sections of the DNA from Yersinia pestis embedded in the skeletal remains.",
        "And so, this has always been a sort of complex thing because, of course, a skeleton buried in a plague pit that's over 600 years old is, of course, a heavy mixture of the DNAs of bacteria and fungi and the insect, and any rodent that may have dug through the pit at that time.",
        "And so in addition to the endogenous human DNA that you'll have, you have a tremendous amount sort of contaminating exogenous DNA.",

        "But, yeah, so we had to really develop a novel method to actually target these few - very few - sort of circulating stretches of tiny DNA of the pathogen actually still preserved within the root cavity of the teeth that were still embedded in the jaws that we actually removed from the, the jaws from the skeletal remains at the British Museum.",
