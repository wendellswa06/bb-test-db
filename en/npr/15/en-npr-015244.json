        "Senator - Democratic Senator Russ Feingold plans to introduce a Constitutional Amendment to require that vacant Senate seats be filled by special election rather than appointment.",
        "He'll join us in just a bit, but we also want to hear from you.",
        "Do you think we need to rewrite the Constitution to end gubernatorial appointment?",

        "Meanwhile, while we await Senator Feingold, there's a couple of other political developments we could talk about, Ken, including the fact that, well, people in Virginia this year were barraged by political ads, unusual in a presidential election year that the State of Virginia was a battleground.",
        "In fact, it became a Blue State for the first time.",
        "But some people pretty tired of political advertising.",

        "You know something, he sounds very much like Mark Warner, another business entrepreneur who was elected governor, I guess, eight years ago and was very, very successful.",

        "It still is a primary, there's two other Democrats challenging him.",
        "The primary is in early June, but right now, you know, it looks very good for McAuliffe who has so much money.",
        "Of course, when you mentioned that the first time the state went blue, of course, the first time since '64.",
        "'64, right, first time in most of our listeners' lifetime anyway, but the - and you might wonder - governors in the state of Virginia are term-limited, so Tim Kaine, the incumbent and in fact the new Democratic National Committee chair, he cannot run for re-election.",
        "Right.",
        "And also if you go back to Lyndon Johnson, and I think for the last 40 years or so, every time there is a Republican in the White House, Virginia elects a Democrat governor.",
        "Every time there's a Democrat in the White House, Virginia elects a Republican governor so that it could be good news for the Republican Party this year.",
        "And you mentioned a couple of other democrats running against Terry McAuliffe, but who might be up on the Republicans' side.",
        "It would be the State Attorney General Bob McDonald who is unopposed for the nomination.",
        "All right.",

        "I suspect that many Republicans, if not most Republicans would like to turn the page, go on to a new phase.",
        "So, there were six candidates running for the nomination for the elect - for the chairmanship of the RNC including Mike - in addition to Mike Duncan.",
        "It's Michael Steele who was the former lieutenant governor of Maryland, who's African-American.",
        "Another African-American candidate is Kenneth Blackwell, the former Ohio Secretary of State, Katon Dawson, my personal prediction, who is the chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party, Saul Anuzis, who is the Michigan chair and Chip Satlzman, who was Mike Huckabee's campaign manager last year.",

        "Now, I'm not saying that Pete - this is very, very important, but I guess with the fact that the Republican Party is out of power, there's really no national Republican Leader.",

        "That's right.",
        "I mean, this isn't something that's completely new.",
        "We had a Constitutional Amendment, 17th Amendment back in 1913, that established the principal for the first time in this country that a senator should be directly elected by the people, not by state legislature.",

        "Of course, the odds of having a Senate vacancy in your state are very small.",
        "It's a rare occurrence.",
        "I would think the legislators would be open to the idea of finishing the job and having the people of their state make this decision.",
        "We've had it this way in Wisconsin forever.",
        "We're one of the few states that never had the appointment, and so it's worked just fine.",
        "All our House races, of course, are by special election and when Joe McCarthy, the infamous senator died, a guy named Bill Proxmire was elected to replace him, became one of the best senators in the United States Senate and served for 30 years.",
        "So it's a system that can work and has worked in Wisconsin and I think would be a big improvement over the circus that we've been watching.",
        "Nevertheless, the Constitution is not something you rewrite lightly.",
        "Given that example and given the fact that many states do have, like Wisconsin, the special election, why should we tinker with the Constitution?",
        "Well, only three or four states have this Wisconsin system.",
        "Very few have it.",
        "And what you see here is a real significant example of how the Senate can be distorted from a place that involves people being elected to people that were appointed in the first place.",
        "It gets to be excessive.",
        "So the Constitution has already been amended in this general area, this is just basically tidying up, and the 17th Amendment would be a separate amendment.",
        "But that would be the effect.",
        "It it's not changing obviously, the structure of the Constitution in any significant way.",
        "Ken?",
        "Senator, what are the arguments against this proposal is that it would cost upwards of tens of millions of dollars to run a special election.",
        "It's kind of a bizarre argument.",
        "We have elections - special elections for the House, we have elections in the fall for all the House and Senate races, governors.",
        "Why should people be suddenly concerned about the cost of an election?",
        "Why wouldn't people of the state want to be able to have a direct say on who's going to be their senator for the next six or 20 or 40 years.",
        "To me, it's money well-spent to have a democracy and have a democratic outcome.",
        "I think the cost argument is frankly a joke."

        "Yeah, we have our own rules in Wisconsin.",
