        "So, I think it's a wonderful idea to be quote, unquote, a democracy, but we are Republic, and I think that we should let states decide instead of just another federal mandate.",
        "And it can, Ken, run about half a million, a million dollars to hold the special election.",
        "That's true.",
        "But Paul makes a good point because if you don't like the person you've - the governor has appointed, you could even defeat him or her in the next primary election or the next general election.",

        "And Ken, this week, it was President Obama going up to Capitol Hill to say, you know, let's put politics past us and go work on this stimulus bill in a bipartisan manner.",
        "And well, this is the reaction from Mike Pence, one of the leaders in the Republican Party in the House of Representatives.",
        "But as grateful as we are for the president's spirit, as I told him personally, House Democrats have completely ignored the president's call for bipartisan cooperation.",
        "And Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, of course a Democrat, responded by saying, well, the Republicans get to say some things but they don't get to say a lot.",
        "So bipartisanship means giving them an opportunity to make their voices heard and maybe to persuade and prevail in the up - marketplace of ideas.",
        "That does not mean that we're going to have a continuation of the last eight years of failed economic policies that have taken us where we are today.",

        "You know, it's very easy for general ideas to get out there that have an inkling of truth to them that aren't really quite right, that over-simplify their problem.",
        "It actually doesn't make sense to talk about a huge continent like Antarctica as doing one thing.",
        "Just to put this in perspective - West Antarctica, which is an area that we focused on in our paper, because it's the area that's warming faster than realized, is about the size of Texas, California and Alaska combined.",
        "It's actually a bit bigger than that.",
        "And East Antarctica is twice as large as West Antarctica.",
        "Well, I'm - I mean, I'm not convinced that what Barack Obama is doing is necessarily looking for Republican vote, but I think he wants to point at a difference between himself and his predecessor, because George W.",
        "Bush really did not reach out to Democrats for much of his tenure in the White House.",
        "And I think Obama wanted to do that bipartisan at least reaching out, even if Republicans - I mean, you may have 10 Republicans who vote for at the vote in the House today is between six and seven o'clock eastern time, and so you may not get many Republicans at all.",
        "But I think Obama wanted to set the tone that at least he wants to listen, making the point that his predecessor did not want to do that, and perhaps try to build some goodwill when he'll really need those Republican votes.",
        "And he is inviting also, I think, six members from each party in the House of Representatives and five members of each party from the United States Senate over to the White House this evening for drinks and further talks about bipartisan issues.",
        "I suspect that's going to be after the House passes his stimulus package pretty much on a party-line vote.",

        "I mean, I'm very worried about the death of irony and comedy and all of that, and now, when you hear Blagojevich talking about calling the ghosts of Martin Luther King and Gandhi and comparing himself to them, I just think that comic relief is priceless, and I would love to see other crazy politicians like him out more often.",
        "Generally, you like crazy politicians in somebody else's state.",

        "Exactly.",
        "Returns, and so this not only just Blagojevich there's seems to three out of four Senate appointees, excluding the one in Colorado, which seem to have gone well, but three of them are pretty controversial."

        "It turns out that Antarctica, according to satellite data, is actually warming up instead of cooling.",

        "So, the - where did - the first question then is where did this idea that Antarctica's cooling come from?",
        "Well, the answer is that in the decades of the '80s and '90s and a little bit into the thousands, the East Antarctic ice sheet was in fact cooling, particularly in certain seasons - summer and especially fall.",
        "And when that was first recognized, it wasn't clear why that was.",
        "And that was looked into by some of the leading scientists in the world, including Susan Solomon at the NOAA Aeronomy lab, who was also the lead coordinator for the entire IPCC report.",
        "And what they showed is that there's a very strong relationship between the ozone hole and the temperature on the surface of East Antarctica.",
        "So, that paper got a lot of press; it was published in Science.",
        "They may have even been on your program; I don't recall.",
        "And that sort of morphed into all of Antarctica has been cooling for the last 50 years, which was never true, nor did they say that in their paper."
