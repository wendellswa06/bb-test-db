        "So, what we did is we said, well, OK, that's fine.",
        "East Antarctica's cooling.",
        "But actually, we've been working in West Antarctica, and we've been working there drilling ice cores.",
        "And at least 10 years ago, when we started this work, I realized there are very few weather stations in West Antarctica.",
        "We'd really like to have a better idea what is happening there.",
        "And to make a long story short, we took a look at the satellite data, which has been measured - the NOAA satellite, which looks at the infrared radiation emitted from the snow, which is a function of temperature - and noticed that those data actually showed a different thing going on in West Antarctica than East Antarctica, namely, it was warming up there.",
        "And so, our paper is essentially taking those satellite data and doing a bit of additional work to establish confidence levels in that finding.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "And can you apply it to the whole continent?",
        "OK.",
        "So, let me back up a minute and say a little bit more about the satellite data and also elaborate a bit on why other people haven't used them in this way.",
        "That's an overstatement actually, that they haven't been used, because in fact, Joey Comiso, one of our co-authors from NASA, published several papers in the past.",
        "And I think one of his papers was in fact influential in Dave Thompson and Susan Solomon's work, because he again was looking just at this period.",
        "At the time, it was just 1982 to 99, which is actually the period of strongest cooling in East Antarctica.",
        "And this is very obvious in the satellite data, and so, that supported interest in what is going on in East Antarctica, which again, is the largest part of the continent.",
        "So, looking at those temperature changes, it's the most obvious feature.",
        "Those satellite data also show very clearly that there's been significant warming on the Antarctic Peninsula, which is a relatively small bit of land that sticks up as a sort of finger towards South America.",
        "Because there were no weather station data, or very few, in West Antarctica with which to validate the satellite data, which have potential problems in them, which I can elaborate upon, if you like, people, I think, have tended to believe only those data for which they have direct local evidence that the data are right.",
        "So, the East Antarctic weather stations, where people on the ground measuring the temperature agreed with the satellite data in East Antarctica, the satellite data also agreed with the weather stations on the Antarctic Peninsula, and so, those are the areas that people focused on.",
        "For some reason, there wasn't much attention being paid to the fact that on these maps from the satellite, West Antarctica was the same color - red - when scaled, where temperature warming is red and cooling is blue, as the Antarctic Peninsula.",
        "So, what we had to do is establish that there was a meaningful relationship between the satellite's recordings and the surface temperatures.",
        "And we did this essentially by creating a statistical model which says if we have weather station data, can we add it up, can we use it to…",
        "I don't mean to cut you short, Doctor, (Laughing) but - it's an interesting explanation; we don't have that much time.",
        "I apologize.",
        "No, no, that's OK, and I like the details, but we just can't get it at this point."

        "Right.",
        "But the bottom line, does this mean - finally put to rest the idea that Antarctica is cooling - that argument?",
        "It puts to rest the idea that the entire continent has been cooling monotonically for the last 50 years.",
        "I really want to emphasize, it does not change whatsoever the results that showed that East Antarctica has been cooling in the last few decades.",
        "That's still true, our understanding of why that is remains - the best explanation remains the ozone hole.",
        "It's important also that our results actually support that, because they show that the continent has been warming on average for these 50 years.",
        "The cooling in East Antarctica, according to our analysis, didn't really begin until the late 1970s at the earliest, which is right about the time you'd expect if the cause is the ozone hole, which didn't get going until then.",
        "Why would the ozone hole be the cause for this?",
        "Well, the long and the short of it is, ozone is a greenhouse gas, just like CO2, but there's less of it, not more of it.",
        "And it's in the stratosphere, of course.",
        "With less ozone in the stratosphere you get stratospheric cooling.",
        "And that has two effects.",
        "In a sort of simplistic way, the stratospheric air sometimes actually makes it down towards the surface in East Antarctica, which is very high.",
        "So, that leads to cooling.",
        "But in addition, the change in the vertical temperature gradient over the continent that results from this tends to act like a change - it tends to create a change in pressure, which causes a change in the winds - the circumpolar winds surrounding the continent.",
        "And that limits the ability of warm air from low latitudes to get into the continent.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah.",
        "I would actually put it even slightly differently, which is that there was very little attention being paid to a very large part of the continent - West Antarctica - because of a tendency to be skeptical of the satellite data, without, I think, very careful work being done to ask, well, how good are they?",
        "And now that you have the dependable satellite data - or it's being considered shown to be dependable - you're now very much more certain that Antarctica is warming up as - in general?",
        "Yes, absolutely.",
        "I won't try to give you all the details here, because we clearly don't have time.",
        "But in the paper, we outline very carefully how we test the fidelity of our methods.",
        "I would just add that there's corroborating evidence in at least two papers published just in the last week, which get exactly the same result as we do, that are not based on those satellite data.",
        "So, it's a red herring to continue to argue about how good the satellite data are.",
        "It's actually irrelevant."

        "Do you have any misgivings at all about the program?",
        "Not all of us know everything there is to know about this program, but that's the nature of these classified programs that are important, I believe, to gather, essentially, battlefield intelligence in order to detect and deter future terrorist attacks.",
        "You know, there are not that many senators, I would think, that you'd be just a little bit peeved that you didn't know, personally, about what was going on.",
        "No one likes to be surprised, but I think it's important to remember that the revelations that, of yesterday, when we learned about this effort to compile what, in essence, is an electronic telephone book without the names added is just part of a larger program designed to trace terrorist phone calls made internationally from al-Qaida operatives overseas to people here in the United States.",
        "Part of the problem, the conundrum that the intelligence community has, is the more members of Congress they tell, the more likely it is that these classified programs will be written about or discussed in the media.",
        "And not that it's the media's fault, but the fact is that the more our enemies learn about these classified programs, the more they can take steps to avoid detection.",

        "Well, I think all of those are legitimate questions to be raised, but on the other hand, this is not a criminal investigation or prosecution that's subject to the Fourth Amendment.",

        "We have reached you at the Baltimore Washington Airport, and a lot of people around you must be making cell phone calls.",
        "They are no longer unsuspecting about what's going on, and I bet you they're wondering what's next from the government, some of them anyway.",
        "We all have our imaginations piqued by shows like one of my favorites, 24, and other dramas and fictional accounts of what spies do.",
        "And you know, there's, some of those were based in a grain of truth.",
        "But I can assure you, based on everything I know, that the government is not out there spying on domestic activities by innocent people.",
        "Hopefully, Congress will remain strictly providing the oversight to make sure these are narrowly tailored programs designed to protect the American people, and that is indeed our responsibility."
