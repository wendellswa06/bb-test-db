        "Scalia has made his biggest mark so far in those biting dissents.",
        "His pen is an unsparing skewer.",
        "He's mocked Chief Justice John Roberts, a fellow conservative, accusing him of, quote, \"\"faux judicial restraint.\"\" He's said Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's view on abortion, quote, \"\"cannot be taken seriously.\"\" And just this month he derided Justice John Paul Stevens' views on the death penalty, calling them, quote, \"\"the purest form of rule by judicial fiat,\"\" even though Stevens agreed with Scalia on the end result.",
        "So I asked Justice Scalia if using that kind of language in written opinions is wise, whether in fact it might not alienate potential allies on the court.",
