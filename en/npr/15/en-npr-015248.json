        "Republican John McCain should carry Mississippi in the presidential election, and Wicker showed benefit from his coattails.",

        "Well, that involves the new technology that we, sort of, described and the methodology we described in the paper is we're able to actually - so what you can do is you can actually - we can take the sequences on the available databases for the modern pestis strains.",
        "And we can artificially create what we like to call or what we describe to our students in the lab like a type of fishing line that actually has a set of complementary DNA pieces on this fishing line that, of course, match perfectly the modern Yersinia pestis - one of the Yersinia pestis strain.",
        "And then what we do is we actually float that fishing line into this massive pooled extract of everything I've told you about.",
        "So the actual pathogen is there at very, very low frequency and then all the additional bacteria, human DNA, everything else that you don't want to catch.",
        "And under the right conditions, which are temperature and salt conditions, you can actually get your DNA of your pathogen to actually bind to this fishing line.",
        "That fishing line is actually, itself, attached to proteins which can then attach to magnetic beads which then we can use a magnet to pull that fishing line back out, thereby enriching only for the pathogen DNA and not for all the rest of the co-circulating fragments that are polluting your extract."

        "So it actually got started from one of the earliest cases of biological warfare when the Mongols were besieging an Italian colony on the Black Sea in modern-day Ukraine, and they were not getting anywhere and the plague broke out in their camp.",
        "So they catapulted bodies with - of cadavers of those who died from the plague into the Italian fortress, the Genoese, and it broke out there.",
        "And it sailed back to Europe; it affected not only the Genoese but the rats in the colony.",
        "And they boarded the ships and with the ships of the Genoese and then the Venetian traders, which were binding together this pulsating European economy as the European economy was reaching towards its peak - its medieval peak in the 14th century.",
        "They carried the disease with them to every port they went to.",
        "Now, we can track the outbreaks as they're reported in archival records, and you really get an X-ray of the shipping schedules of the great merchants of medieval Europe as they sailed out - it from the Black Sea down to the Mediterranean and then clockwise out into the Atlantic, up into the Baltic and distributed it in that fashion.",
        "I think it's interesting that the rate at which it spread leads a lot of people to believe that - I mean there are those that it's not Yersinia, because it moved too quickly to be a plague-like outbreak.",
        "And those who do believe it's Yersinia, it was like a pneumonic form, right?",
        "So it was then eventually transmissible person to person via air, right?",
