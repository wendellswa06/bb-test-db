        "I can address that, if you wish.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "I mean, that's an argument that was started in the 1950s, because archeologists were not turning up rats.",
        "The first rats were discovered in the late '80s, in fact, in London.",
        "And the reason they weren't turning up rats is if you've ever excavated with a trowel, rat bones are extremely small and the chance of turning them up with a trowel are almost zero.",
        "In order to find rats, you have to sieve with very fine meshes, and it will take you - two summers ago, I was doing it and found a nice rat jawbone.",
        "It can take you, with a quarter of a millimeter mesh, which is what you need to reliably find rat bones, it will take you an hour or two to do a liter of soil.",

        "But actually we should and use the exact same (unintelligible) actually for the DNA of the rat.",

        "That's why in the 1370s most people who died were infants and young children, because the earlier generation in 1348 had acquired an immunity.",

        "And it was the teacher, David Herlihy, my predecessor in the Department of History here at Harvard, was the first to throw out that - in very tantalizing fashion, some very stimulating questions which challenged aspects notably of the epidemiology.",
        "But I'm satisfied, from my own personal study of the materials that, while it's worthwhile to challenges these questions, the epidemiology of - as reported from medieval resources certainly corresponds to my understanding of the epidemiology, particularly as delineated by the World Health Organization and the Indian Plague Commission.",
        "And I think that the ancient DNA evidence - this is now the, really, the second or third result, positive result of the DNA presence of Yersinia pestis from top - well, very well-regarded ancient DNA labs.",
        "And I think now we've reached the point of pretty much conclusion on this part of the debate.",
        "Now, there may well have been other - there certainly probably were other infections that occurred at the same time, but the presence and the role of Yersinia pestis for the Black Death, for the medieval plague - we still don't know about the Justinianic plague that played such a big role in bringing down the Roman Empire.",
        "But for the Black Death of the Middle Ages, I think that this part of the debate is closed, and I think it's time to move on to another one.",
        "Well, let's move on to that debate about the Justinian.",
        "Why do we know so little about that?",
        "Because there's been very little work done on it, and the - that broke out in 542, in, again, in one of the Roman Empire's grape ports and moved from there all around the empire.",
        "The problem is that that plague was so devastating - remember that the first outbreak is just the beginning of these pandemics.",
        "The medieval plague went - ran into the early 18th century.",
        "The Justinianic plague started in 542 and went to 750.",
        "It came back, I think, about 15 times over that 200-year period, each time killing between a third and two-thirds of the population."

        "If you can shed some light on that.",
        "So you think it might have transformed into a different one and so that's why it killed so...",

        "And with that information, hopefully then one has a better idea as to, are there specific genes that had been modified, or are there upstream or downstream regulators that have changed to add expression levels of certain proteins, which might explain this increase virulence in rapid transmission.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And I got about a minute left, but I want to get an interesting fact in here I know.",
        "Talking about - Hendrik, how does a flea actually transmit the plague?",
        "Well, that's interesting.",
        "So the - once it becomes infected with the Yersinia pestis, the bacteria starts replicating in its gut and causes a regurgitation of everything - the blood meal that the flea takes.",
        "And so the flea becomes increasing panicked and hungry and transfers from host to host.",
        "And each time it takes a new blood meal, it regurgitates thousands and thousands of bacteria that had been replicated within in the flea back into this new wound within the individual.",
        "So it's actually regurgitating its previous meal, which, of course, contains the Yersinia pestis, thereby transmitting it to the human and then, of course, jumps onto another host and so on and so forth.",

        "One can easily imagine that when the institutions that keep an eye on our public health are in jeopardy, it could once again get out of control.",
        "The last great outbreak - well, it breaks out regularly in India and Madagascar still today and there are great efforts to enhance the public health efforts there.",
        "Wars and upheavals are usually very good things for Yersinia pestis, because they disrupt the institutions that keep an eye on it."
