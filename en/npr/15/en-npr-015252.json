        "And we thought it was appropriate that, in that case, they be protected from being cut off at the knees politically.",

        "Yes.",
        "The statute gives the director a five-year term, and the president can't fire him.",
        "Well, it would undermine that whole concept if anything happened to the director during that five-year term, the president got to say who replaced him.",
        "We wanted that five-year period, so we said, yes, the director gets a five-year term.",
        "And the director who designates the deputy director, in effect, can continue his or her regime after a vacancy for the rest of the five years.",
        "Well, what do you think is at stake here, though?",
        "Because if everybody agrees that President Trump will get to name the successor anyway - I mean, the interim named by Mr. Cordray, who's leaving the agency, would only serve until a successor is confirmed.",
        "The Republicans are in the majority, so it assumes that whoever the president picks will be confirmed by them.",
        "So what do you think is the importance of this fight?",
        "First, it is to preserve the independent principle because it may come up at some other time.",
        "If they get away with this, then maybe the next time there's a director the president might try to fire him and say I had the right to do that.",
        "Secondly, knowing that there is a few months, it is possible that the director could finish up some pending business.",
        "It is possible that there could be some rules set forward that would be protecting people that would be cut off right away.",

        "Clearly, the person that we think should be the acting director could sue.",

        "This is an agency whose job it is to go out and fight with the largest most powerful financial interests in America on behalf of citizens.",
        "And so, yeah, we very much envisioned an administration hostile to the notion of consumer protection trying to kill the agency.",

        "Kofi Annan says he hopes for progress and for an announcement early next week.",
        "It seems that Kenya has been a little quieter this week, and does that give us a chance to kind of step back and take a look at what issues concern Kenyans the most?",
        "I think it certainly allows Kenyans to do that.",
        "The fact that they can stop to breathe and that they've been able to come up for air, means that they are now looking at this horrific month that they have lived through, the ethnic violence, the fact that rival gangs from different tribes have used machetes, bows and arrows, apangas as they call them here, they've used clubs to kill more than 1,000 people, as well as, of course, the police brutality as it's being called.",
        "And Kenyans are saying, how did we get to this point?",
        "And they're looking back and they're saying this dates back so many years, that a disputed election was just the catalyst, that we need to address things like ethnicity, power, privilege, equality - these are the deep-seated problems that Kenya has to deal with.",
        "Kofi Annan, who's mediating, says it will take at least a year to deal with these issues, but a political settlement must be reached first.",
        "I'm curious, Ofeibea, has some of the new technology, communications technology with which we're all familiar, enabled some people with, if I might put it this way, some very low aspirations to reach more people than ever before?",
        "You feel safe in this job?",
        "I was talking to George Wein at one point, who's the great producer of jazz festivals.",

        "Well, we have two things that are going on that are important to sort out.",

        "But that's only about 20, 25 stations these days.",
        "It's not a huge number of public radio stations across the country.",
        "Where we see things in play at the margin is the many public radio stations that, over the years, have done lots of different kinds of things in their programming - a little news, a little jazz, a little classical music.",
        "And many of them are in the process of sorting out what they want to present - what they're doing best, what they think their future might be.",
        "And there, jazz is taking some hits as stations remove some of the evening hours, say, of a jazz program that maybe has been an institution for a number of years and replaced that with news or classical music or other program choices that they believe are stronger in their repertoire.",
        "So, Susan, what can be done about it?",
        "Or what is being done to sort of fight back, so to speak?",
        "Well, I think that first of all, we have to take a broad view of the music and understand that, well, while during the heyday of jazz at Newport - when we're talking about Ella and Miles and Coltrane - that was then, but this is now.",
        "We have to look at the fact that the times have changed -that there is a new group of very talented young jazz musicians out there who are playing the music, and are doing it by incorporating old and new repertoire.",
        "And I think that in order to really expand the audience for jazz, we're going to have to expand our horizons as well.",
        "What I mean is no more narrow casting.",
        "We've got to look at the fact that popular music today -just as it did during the heyday of jazz, as people like to say -incorporated popular music.",
        "While I think that there's a lot of purists out there who think that music may have ended when Dizzy Gillespie stopped playing or when Coltrane left the planet, I think that there's a lot of great music out there and we've got to be able to offer that.",
        "But we've got to stop putting it in places where only the jazziest of the jazzers can hear it.",
        "If we want people to go out and hear new music, we've got to offer it to them.",
        "We've got to put it in formats so that people can listen to it and have an opportunity to sample the music.",
        "Well, that's kind of interesting, Don, what's she saying.",
        "There are a number of points, but the first one I want you to respond to is this -because she talked about narrow casting and having to tweak formats in order to get the music - sort of to sneak it in so to speak - with something perhaps more contemporary.",
        "What comes to my mind as a result of that - and some people like it, some don't - is smooth jazz.",

        "Smooth jazz seems to have reached its peak and gone beyond it.",
        "The problem that I see with this approach is that you don't - the net result doesn't seem to be that it pleases anyone.",
        "It doesn't please the people who want to hear more contemporary, pop-oriented material, and I don't think it really pleases the people who want to hear more pure jazz.",
        "The time when popular music and jazz were in synch ended, I think, probably roughly around 1960 when we began to have free jazz - when Nat Coleman, John Coltrane moved into his later period and so forth.",
        "Up until that point, there was a kind of - the line of what people who wanted to hear pop music were receptive to was pretty much in synch with what was happening with jazz.",
        "Bebop, of course, did tend to skew it a little bit more away from the popular audience.",
        "But since that point, there has been a marked difference between what popular audiences want to hear and what jazz musicians do.",

        "And narrow casting, broadcasting - I'm not sure whether either of those has the answer so much as just trying to find a wider audience and stay true to what jazz is, which is an improvisational art that swings.",
        "Well, Tom, the numbers show, don't they, that those stations around the country that - even though you've mentioned this partly in your previous answers - those stations that stick with the so-called pure jazz format have lost audience and can't compete with the smooth jazz or rap or contemporary or hip-hop or any other format, can they?",

        "Now, it's nowhere near what we've seen on the new side of public radio, where in the last few years there's been a spectacular explosion in the amount of listening to news information.",
        "But we're in an intensely news-driven time surrounded by all kinds of events that people are trying to figure out and turning to public radio to find some answers.",
        "And so maybe in the shadow of that, those inside the field look at it and say, well, what's jazz doing compared to this huge growth that we see for news and information programming?",
        "But across the years, the levels of listening - as I say, up or down a percentage point or two from year-to-year - to those stations that really commit themselves to a consistent delivery of jazz programming has been a very stable, mature level of service.",
        "Well, let me follow up with this before I bring Suzan back in.",
        "How do you explain if that's the case - and I certainly don't question your numbers, because you're the numbers expert.",
        "And yet at the same time, a station like WBEZ in Chicago or even here in Los Angeles with KKJZ, which is now threatened as we understand it to be moving away from its all jazz/contemporary-type format - how is it that these stations, if it is a successful format, are going elsewhere?",
        "Well, let's sort out two very different things that are going on in Chicago and in Los Angeles in this regard.",
        "The station you mentioned in Chicago, WBEZ, is principally a news station.",
        "Less that 10 percent of the listening to WBEZ is jazz, mostly as a program service they provide late in the evening and overnight.",
        "WBEZ is first and foremost a news and information station.",
        "And they're an example of someone who says 80-85 percent of what we're doing right now already is news and information, that's where we want to take our service forward.",
        "And I think they're doing some very bold things on the news and information side."
