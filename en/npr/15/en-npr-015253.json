        "That's very different from KKJZ, which has historically been a jazz and blues station, morning to night, all through the night and across the week.",
        "And there what's going on is the licensee - the folks who actually own the license for the station - after years of this service, are taking a look around and saying, can we do something better?",
        "And it's as much a financial proposition for the university, saying can we come up with some funds to address other priorities we have here in a better way than what the radio station is delivering?",
        "I don't know that they're going to come up with a better answer.",
        "KKJZ has been - you know, it's had its ups and downs, like a lot of stations and a couple of bad news stories of late.",
        "But the dust settled on that one yet, and I wouldn't give up on jazz in Los Angeles or on KKJZ.",
        "Let me ask you Suzan, because I have a teenage son who's in college who grew up in a household with John Coltrane and Miles Davis and Art Blakey, and the list goes on and on.",
        "And yet, he's just not into that at all.",
        "And so, for that generation of young 20-somethings - are you reaching them, do you think?",
        "And if not, how can you?",
        "Well, one of the things that we've done is we've built this Web site called gotjazz.info.",
        "And the Web site is a tool to bridge the gap between what kids are listening to today - what people are listening to today - and more traditional jazz.",
        "It gives you an opportunity to listen to Robert Glasper and hear his influences, just as well as it gives you an opportunity to hear Roy Hargrove's RH Factor or even some other musicians like Soweto Kinch, others who are doing - making music, and are - have one foot in popular music, hip- hop, rap, R&B, and the other in a more improvised setting.",
        "Let me ask…",
        "I wanted to just go back for a moment, though, and address Don's concern or comments - and just to say that I'm not advocating that we abandon straight jazz formats, straight ahead traditional jazz formats for a mixed format or vice versa.",
        "I think that we need both.",
        "I think that the only way that people can learn about new things is to have it interjected every now and then into formats that they're already listening to.",
        "And then for those jazzers who love jazz and want to hear about jazz, give them an opportunity to do that, too.",
        "Five years hence, five years from now, will we be able to turn on the radio and hear the kind of jazz music that we like?",
        "I think we will, as long as somebody starts producing some - I hate to use the word - hits.",
        "Historically, jazz has reached out to audiences - I hate to say it - when they've had some hits.",
        "If you look back, Ellis Marsalis said this to me one time.",
        "He said, if you look back at all the major jazz figures, they have all had some kind of a breakthrough song hit of some sort that crosses over to the pop audience that brings them some visibility and recognition.",
        "This hasn't happened with the Roy Hargroves and the younger players.",
        "As good as they are, as articulate, as virtuosic as they are with their technique, they have not reached out to the audience.",
        "And I think that's a problem."

        "Yes, for certain.",
        "But I don't think that it's about the music as much as it is about getting creative with the business structure that will support jazz on radio.",
        "I would hate to blame the creators for the fact that we're not getting the music that we like right now.",
        "I would like to say we have to get a lot more creative about the way we offer music to the public.",

        "You're going to have jazz on your radio that got there from ways that we don't even know how it's going to get there today.",
        "As long as the people that are presenting jazz remember to keep attention on the joy, the pleasure, the emotion that's at the heart of why people enjoy the music in the first place, and knit that together with the attention to the history and the integrity and the knowledge that all of us also feel is so important to share.",
        "Now, you said earlier that some stations that are playing jazz had stabilized themselves in the view of the fact that other stations were tinkering with their formats.",
        "But, as a format, is jazz actually shrinking over a longer haul?",
        "I think all jazz stations have a secure place on the public radio spectrum.",
        "And with the advent of digital radio broadcasting -which gives stations additional channels - I think we will see actually more stations offering a jazz service side-by-side with whatever they're doing today.",
        "So, to sort of boil this down, from the days when jazz was 24 hours a day like the old KABC, KBCA here in Los Angeles - which is now a classical station - those who want to hear jazz from a contemporary standpoint will have to find it as a program, perhaps, during part of a multi-formatted day.",

        "I'm going to give you the last word, Suzan.",
        "As we look at sort of the health of jazz music as it relates to being played over the radio -over terrestrial radio - do you think that there's a place where it can maintain itself in terrestrial radio, or will it have to go to satellite pay radio in order to survive?",
        "I think that there is a place for it in terrestrial radio, but I think that programming offerings are going to have to be creative and are going to have to be in synch with today's lifestyles.",
        "I think that people are getting the new media in many, many different ways, and I think that terrestrial radio is going to have to pay attention to that in order to be competitive.",
