        "Mario Scaramella told the Associated Press he is cooperating with authorities for investigating the death of Alexander Litvinenko.",
        "Scaramella is also being test for radiation contamination.",
        "He met with Litvinenko on the day he fell ill.",
        "British officials are still puzzled by the use of this poison, the radioactive isotope Polonium 210.",
        "And so is Frederick Hitz, who worked at the CIA for 20 years.",
        "It doesn't sound to me like the first thing you'd reach for if you wanted to terminate a life in this fashion.",
        "It sounds pretty ghastly, but it sounds fairly complicated.",
        "So why not use something simpler, like rat poison or a simple bullet?",
        "Maybe it's a traditional kind of method of dealing with people that dates from a bygone era.",
        "You are seeing references now to the famous ricin-tipped umbrella stabbing that occurred several decades ago.",
        "There appears to be a fascination with this way of exterminating an enemy.",
        "Before he died last Thursday, Mr. Litvinenko blamed the Russian government, blamed Vladimir Putin in fact for his poisoning.",
        "What do you make of that?",
        "I think it is good to realize, Madeleine, that there is a history of these kinds of operations in the KGB from whose ranks President Putin was joined.",
        "Well they called it wet affairs.",
        "They were quite active during the period after the Second World War in following closely the activities of émigrés in Western Europe in particular who took positions against the Soviet government.",
        "And where they felt they were provoked, they would seek to end that person's life.",
        "So hopefully we are not seeing anything like that again.",
        "But I think that is the reason why people are - sort of a bell goes off in the minds of some.",
        "They have seen all this or seen the preparations for all this before.",
        "But does that make sense in this modern age for the Russian government to do that?"

        "No it doesn't, and that I think is what's causing people to stumble.",
        "I mean they look back to a period in history where the Soviets were vicious about trying to keep down dissent even in places where it probably couldn't hurt them terribly much.",
        "And all we are seeing here is in the use of this poison kind of a disturbing reminder of a bygone day.",
        "But I agree with your comment, I don't see what sense it makes.",
        "So if it seems counterintuitive and puzzling for the Russians to be involved, the Russian authorities at least, who could be involved?",
        "Could it be the Russian mafia?",
        "Well that is the point of speculation right now, people who have a rival position to this individual who was killed.",
        "And I think you have to ask yourself the question: If it wasn't the Russian government, who was it?",
        "And apparently London is a gathering place for those who have been thrown out of Russia or Eastern Europe, and maybe it was a rivalry that grew out of activity outside the country.",
        "Would the mafia have a reason to embarrass the Russian government?",
        "Well the only way - the only connection that it strikes me that the mafia might be in on this would be if let's say those who wanted to suppress dissent to current government in Russia wouldn't use official officers to bring about a murder like this but would want to contract it out, so to speak.",
        "Sounds pretty far-fetched to me and obviously pretty messy.",
        "As I say, the real issue on this to me is the fact that it evokes a period of in the past where the Soviet security service had a reputation for engaging in pretty hardball tactics.",
        "Right.",
        "And Vladimir Putin, as we all know, was part of the KGB during that time period.",
        "Well I think we are making a lot of assumptions here.",
        "And I think you asked a very good question, what does he have to gain out of this?",
        "But he has got the whip hand now in terms of having a commodity that everybody wants to buy.",

        "One is called a $25 billion state growth fund.",
        "The campaign says it would help state and local governments avoid property tax hikes and budget cuts in health education and housing assistance.",
        "A separate $25 billion jobs and growth fund is meant to fuel investment in infrastructure: highways, bridges, school repairs.",
        "Earlier today, I spoke with Senator Obama, and I asked him how he would pay for his plan.",
        "You know, when it comes to a stimulus package, typically you are not looking at offsets, because what you're trying to do is to prevent the economy from going into a further tailspin, which will cut tax revenues.",
        "So hopefully just by stimulating the economy, the stimulus is paying for itself.",
        "On the short term, this is $50 billion that is financed by the deficit, but what I've said is that we need a short-term stimulus, and then we need a long-term policy for fiscal restraint, and that means eliminating waste in government, it means rolling back the Bush tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans.",
        "It means beginning to wind down the War in Iraq, where we're spending $10 billion every single month.",
        "But when it comes to short-term stimulus, the key is just making sure that we avoid the economy going into a further tailspin."

        "But with the deficit as high as it is right now, is it responsible to propose something that's likely to increase deficit spending?",
        "Well, Michele, understand that if we continue on the trends we're on right now, where unemployment keeps on going up - I'm in Florida, where they are in recession for the first time in 16 years - if you continue to see an economic slide, that is going to cost far more in terms of tax revenues because businesses aren't selling, taxes aren't being collected, and what we're going to end up with is a much worse situation when it comes to our deficit.",
        "Now, you know because of the timing of our program many of our listeners are in their cars, and so I want to ask you about your proposal to force big oil companies to share their record-breaking windfall profits, and it's hard to find an economist who supports the idea of a windfall profits tax.",
        "Most argue that this would stifle investment in oil discovery and oil production precisely at the moment when the U.S.",
        "should be encouraging more.",

        "They made $11 billion before that and $11 billion before that, and not all of this is going into research and development, and families need some relief.",
        "Now, I am the first to admit that what we need is a comprehensive plan, and that's what I've been putting forward for the last 18 months, making sure that we're increasing fuel efficiency standards on cars drastically, investing in the retooling so that we can have plug-in hybrids.",
        "I have set a goal that we reduce our oil consumption by 30 percent over the next 20 years.",
        "So that's the long-term answer to rising gas prices.",
        "But in the short term, the notion that oil companies that have been making record profits hand over fist can't give a little bit of that back to make sure that not just drivers but senior citizens on fixed income are going to have the ability to pay for heating this winter, which is going to be a huge potential problem, I don't think that's too much to ask.",
        "Before I let you go, Senator, I just want to ask you about this sparring that's been going on back and forth between the two campaigns.",
        "Yesterday, the John McCain campaign accused you of playing the race card.",
        "This morning, one of your top strategists, David Axelrod, acknowledged that you were referring to race, among other things, when you talked about how you present a different image than the faces that we now see on our currency, on our $1 bills and on our $5 bills.",
        "I just want to be clear about what you were trying to say in that comment.",
        "How has the GOP or the McCain campaign been using scare tactics, particularly when it comes to race?",
        "Look, Michele, this notion that somehow I was playing the race card is ridiculous.",
        "What I said in front of a 98 percent conservative, rural, white audience in Missouri is not - is nothing that I haven't said before, which is I don't come out of central casting when it comes to what presidential candidates typically look like, and it doesn't just have to do with race.",
        "It has to do with my name.",
        "It has to do with my biography and my background.",
        "It has to do with our message of change.",
        "And so in no ways do I think that the McCain campaign has, you know, targeted race issues, although I will say that the way they've amplified this, you know, has been troublesome, and the eagerness with which they've done it indicates they think, you know, they can exploit this politically.",
        "But in fact, what I have said, and there's no doubt about this, they've said it themselves, is that they want to make me appear risky to the American people, and that - I don't think that there's any doubt that, you know, people are still trying to figure out, you know, what's this young guy doing here running for president, and our job is to make sure that they understand that the changes we're promoting are changes that have to be made, that if we don't make them, in fact that's the riskier course.",
        "You know, I think I heard you say that you think that they might be trying to exploit this because of the speed with which they reacted to your statements, because race is such a tricky thing.",
        "You yourself acknowledged that in your speech in Philadelphia.",
        "To the extent that they do try to exploit this, how do you inoculate that?",
