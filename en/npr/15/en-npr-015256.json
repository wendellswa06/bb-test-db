        "With help from Northwestern University law professor, Jerry Goldman and his Web site oyez.org, it's easy to relive many of Roberts' arguments before the Supreme Court, including one involving the hot button issue of abortion.",

        "Roberts was serving as deputy solicitor general.",
        "The question before the court was whether the federal civil rights laws provided power to the federal courts to protect abortion clinics from massive demonstrations that blocked access for women seeking abortions.",

        "Here, petitioners do not seek to deny to someone what they would permit to others.",
        "They seek to prohibit the practice of abortion altogether.",
        "Respondents bring up the analogy that opposition to women seeking abortions is just like a conspiracy against blacks seeking to vote.",
        "If you examine the analogy closely, it breaks down.",
        "In the conspiracy against blacks seeking to vote, what animates it is opposition to a group on the basis of race.",
        "It is blacks that they do not want to vote.",
        "It's not opposition to the activity of voting.",
        "Here it is solely opposition to the activity of abortion.",
        "`But supposing that 2,000 people were massed at a clinic,' a justice asked, `wouldn't that be a conspiracy to deprive women of exercising their fundamental right to an abortion?",
        "`No,' replied Roberts.",
        "There was simply no class-based animus.",
        "Roberts won the case by a 5-to-4 vote.",
        "In a case involving the beating of a state prison inmate, Roberts, again representing the federal government, faced a skeptical Chief Justice Rehnquist in arguing that the prisoner had been subjected to unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment.",
        "The petition, while cuffed and shackled, was punched in the eyes, the mouth, the chest, the stomach, kicked from behind.",

        "I think that would be the infliction of pain unnecessarily and wantonly.",
        "Roberts won that case, too, this time by a 7-to-2 vote with Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia in dissent.",
        "He lost another prisoner case, though, in 1993, a case testing whether an inmate could sue for cruel and unusual punishment if he was subjected to life-threatening secondhand cigarette smoke from other inmates.",
        "In this case, Roberts was arguing in support of prison officials who asserted such exposure was not cruel and unusual punishment.",
        "What this court has asked in its condition of confinement cases is whether there has been a, quote, \"\"serious deprivation of basic human needs\"\" or a denial of the quote, \"\"minimal civilized measure of life's necessities.",

        "`Would it be permissible,' asked a justice, `to require inmates to drink toxic water?'",
