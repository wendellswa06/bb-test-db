        "Afterwards, the government brought a second case, a civil case seeking a fine of $130,000 for the same conduct.",
        "Roberts argued that the civil case was an unconstitutional second trial for the same crime.",
        "The government said that the $130,000 was merely repayment for the cost of prosecuting the case.",
        "The facts belie that contention.",
        "A $130,000 recovery cannot be dismissed simply as compensation for $585 in damages.",

        "An aide to the president was asked if it made him uncomfortable at all, and--you know, with all the Soviet imagery--and he said no, that Mr. Bush was very comfortable honoring and recognizing the sacrifices and suffering of a country that lost 27 million people during the war.",
        "And what about the wreath-laying that was part of today's ceremony, too?",
        "It was the solemn moment of the day.",
        "It took place at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier after all of the music and the marching, and all of the visiting heads of state walked from the viewing platform, a good distance alongside the Kremlin, around a corner over to where the tomb is.",
        "That tomb actually contains ashes that were taken from a mass grave somewhere near Moscow, and there are urns containing ashes of unidentified Soviet soldiers taken from six different cities as well.",

        "This country receives about 700 million in aid yearly, mainly military aid to erode coca crops, that's the crop used to make cocaine.",
        "But Uribe has also depended on some American aid that is used for social programs as well as military aid that's used to fight Marxist guerrillas, so that's been crucial for this country.",
