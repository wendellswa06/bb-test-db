        "It's an abomination - then told me the Romans I verses 26 to 27.",

        "It's definitely a sequence of events, and it's never ending.",

        "So that said, you know, my process, I would say, started coming out to myself.",
        "And I certainly realized that at very young age that I was gay and there was just no way around that.",
        "You know, as I got older and I learned that society didn't quite take took kindly to that, that's when I started to get confused about my sexual orientation.",

        "So from that point forward, of course, you know, being raised in a very conservative Catholic Latino family - I'm first generation - being gay, you know, was not something that was going to be easy for me - lots of guilt, lots of shame, certainly lots of stigma, and coming from Machista, you know, family and culture.",
        "So I internalized all that.",
        "And, of course, you know, the moment of coming to my parents was a big one that happened in 1996.",

        "Hmm.",
        "So having the privilege of writing the coming out story in the pages of the magazine was a great experience, and a healing one.",

        "I'd gone through a major depression, and it was either telling them or risking, you know, further personal harm - you know, potential personal harm to my mental health.",
        "So that was a big experience.",

        "You're my son, and I just want you to be happy.",
        "So I feel very, very fortunate about that one.",
        "The other one, which is kind of a funny, one was a friend of mine had invited me to a show, and I had been seeing somebody for some time, and she walked up to me and said if you want to bring somebody, that's fine.",
        "I don't care who it is.",

        "She was only 58 when she passed away, but it was so liberating to know that it didn't matter to her, and also it was me becoming comfortable with myself at the time, as well, and I think that's the first hurdle that most people have to cross before they can even address talking about it to other people, so…",
