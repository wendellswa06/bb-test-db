        "It's interesting you say that, that - first of all, I mean, that must have been awful, and I'm so sorry for that - but nevertheless that they did change their minds.",
        "And what we've read is that one of the things that transforms people's opinions about issues like don't ask, don't tell, for example, is the fact that they know somebody who's gay, that somebody in their family is gay.",
        "And Laura, I wonder if that's the experience in your family, that knowing someone who's gay has changed people's minds a little bit?",
        "I would hope so, and you know what?",
        "Even if you don't know that you know, you know somebody who is gay.",
        "Yeah, I suspect you're right.",
        "Laura, thanks for the call.",
        "Bye.",
        "Bye-bye, and I wanted to ask you about that, Irene Monroe.",
        "As a minister, obviously it's interesting you went into the ministry after your experience, but nevertheless, as a minister, you must speak with people about this fact all the time.",
        "I do.",
        "I mean, one of the reason my going into ministry was to deal with homeless youth because I was one myself, and I think it varies depending on communities.",
        "I have noticed, particularly here, you know, in the African-American community and a lot of the immigrant communities, they know that members in their families are gay, but they're quite not accepting of it.",
        "And we're noticing, particularly in immigrant communities an incident in suicide among LGBT, you know, youth.",
        "So it is very, very hard.",
        "And it's very particularly hard, I find, within the African-American community, a community that understands oppression to a certain degree, has been very enlightening around the issues of race and not understand the connection to our civil rights today.",
        "It's very disheartening.",
        "And we saw that, of course, in the Proposition 8 battle in California, where African-Americans were among the groups that, well, helped pass that resolution.",
        "Yeah, yeah, that's unfortunate."

        "And so the first 15 years of my life, I guess, was just me growing up in a glass closet where everyone knew, but I just would - just deny, deny, deny.",
        "And so, I think me growing up was harder, but coming out was much, much easier because I would just have to start to say the, like, whole setup into I'm gay, and people would guess it halfway through.",
        "So I don't know.",
        "I think it was pretty easy for me.",

        "Times have definitely changed, but it's kind of a yes-and-no answer really because, like you mentioned Adam Lambert before, you know…",
