        "He says 85 percent of Americans with serious resistant staph infections got them in the hospital or other health care facility, but most of them didn't get sick until they were back in the community.",
        "There are some evidence that people can carry this particular bacteria on their body for some period of time - months or years - without it causing any problem.",

        "Then seemingly out of the blue, they get deathly ill with a hard-to-treat infection.",
        "The new data show that it happens in both directions.",
        "Patients are bringing resistant staph into the hospital, too.",
        "Elizabeth Bancroft says the clear message is that prevention has to begin in institutions that are supposed to make as well, not spread deadly diseases.",
        "She says hospitals can do quite a lot.",
        "In Europe, some hospitals are screening each and every patient at admission for evidence of resistant staph.",
        "Those who are infected are put in private isolation rooms that can be entered only by people who are gloved, gowned, and masked.",
        "Apparently, no American hospital has gone that far, but Bancroft says some are implementing a raft of measures to stop resistant staph.",
        "For example, a patient on a ventilator, keeping the head of the bed up so that the patient doesn't inadvertently swallow or let anything get down into their lungs, get them off the ventilator as soon as possible, keep them on antacids, so there's nothing from their GI tract that might have bacteria that could potentially reflux up into their lungs.",
        "But the single most effective measure is plain old hand washing.",
        "So here we are in this - in a standard patient room.",
        "And as you come into the room, there is the dispenser right outside the door where you're supposed to..."
