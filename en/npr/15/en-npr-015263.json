        "So as we said, the White House says that they have the authority here.",
        "What is your perspective on this?",
        "Namely, that if we wanted the Vacancy Act to govern, we would not have done anything about it.",
        "Knowing that the Vacancy Act was the law, we very specifically came up with a different way of acting, and it was not an accident.",
        "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is given a great deal of autonomy.",
        "You heard Mr. Mulvaney complaining about it.",
        "He calls it a lack of accountability.",
        "What we think it is is a way to kind of prevent an agency from political pressures, which we know are going to be enormous on an agency that is challenging some of the most important financial interests in the country.",
        "The director of the Consumer Financial Bureau is different than every other in many ways.",
        "He's appointed or she's appointed for a five-year term and cannot be removed by the president.",
        "So what you have here is a conscious decision to give the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau more independence from the kind of political pressures that will come because, remember, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - what it does is to protect people against kind of aggression from private interests.",
        "And we thought it was appropriate that, in that case, they be protected from being cut off at the knees politically.",
        "So I understand that you don't have a copy of the statute in front of you.",
        "But...",
        "No, I forgot my copy.",
        "I usually travel with one...",
        "I'm sure you do.",
        "...But I left it at home.",
        "But it is my understanding the statute creating it specifically says that the agency's deputy director serves as acting director until a new director has been nominated.",
        "Does that conform with your memory of it?",
        "Yes.",
        "The statute gives the director a five-year term, and the president can't fire him.",
        "Well, it would undermine that whole concept if anything happened to the director during that five-year term, the president got to say who replaced him.",
        "We wanted that five-year period, so we said, yes, the director gets a five-year term.",
        "And the director who designates the deputy director, in effect, can continue his or her regime after a vacancy for the rest of the five years.",
        "Well, what do you think is at stake here, though?",
        "Because if everybody agrees that President Trump will get to name the successor anyway - I mean, the interim named by Mr. Cordray, who's leaving the agency, would only serve until a successor is confirmed.",
        "The Republicans are in the majority, so it assumes that whoever the president picks will be confirmed by them.",
        "So what do you think is the importance of this fight?"

        "First, it is to preserve the independent principle because it may come up at some other time.",
        "If they get away with this, then maybe the next time there's a director the president might try to fire him and say I had the right to do that.",
        "Secondly, knowing that there is a few months, it is possible that the director could finish up some pending business.",
        "It is possible that there could be some rules set forward that would be protecting people that would be cut off right away.",
        "What happens now in your view?",
        "And I am asking you for an opinion here.",
        "Does this go to the courts?",
        "I hope it does.",
        "The question is, how does it get there?",
        "In America, you have to have this standing to sue.",
        "Not everybody can bring a lawsuit.",
        "I can't go to court and say, oh, judges, they're hurting my law.",
        "Clearly, the person that we think should be the acting director could sue.",
        "She's got a right to that.",
        "That would be the ideal way.",
        "This is a dispute about what the law means.",
        "And I would hope the administration would be willing to cooperate in getting it into court.",
        "Before we let you go, I know this is a question that people ask all the time these days, but I feel I have to ask.",
        "Have you ever seen anything like this?",
        "Did you ever envision anything like this when you set up the agency - this kind of a standoff?",

        "But we clearly envisioned it.",

        "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is given a great deal of independence from any administration power, including, by the way, one that I might like.",
        "This is an agency whose job it is to go out and fight with the largest most powerful financial interests in America on behalf of citizens.",
        "And so, yeah, we very much envisioned an administration hostile to the notion of consumer protection trying to kill the agency.",
        "That was former Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank.",

        "It is clear at this moment that a traditional conservative who believes in limited government and free markets, who is devoted to free trade, who is pro-immigration has a narrower and narrower path to nomination in the Republican Party, the party that has so long defined itself by its belief in those things.",
        "Senator Flake says the party has yielded to mischaracterizing or misunderstanding our problems and giving into the impulse to scapegoat and belittle.",

        "We're in a gubernatorial cycle here in Arizona where our turnout is - really about 51 percent of the voters will turn out versus a presidential turnout of about 74 percent.",
        "So what that does is it means that the gubernatorial cycle is going to be 11 to 14 points Republican advantage.",
        "And the Trump voters are very motivated voters, and President Trump is enjoying right now in our current polling about a 74 percent approval rating amongst Republican voters.",
        "And those are really strong winds to be sailing against by Senator Flake.",
        "Let's say that some of the primaries in Arizona - the Republican primaries - turn out to be pretty nasty and the winners are from the right end of the political party.",
        "Does that open up any possibility to Democrats, or is the state just too republican for them?",
        "Oh, I think that it will open up a sliver of hope for the Democrats if the wrong candidate makes it out of the Republican primaries.",
        "I think that millions of dollars will be spent in Arizona in that case.",

        "Do you get a sense that the party has really changed, that we're into a new era, that Donald Trump may not be the leader of it but he epitomizes a new Republicanism that leaves behind old-fashioned conservatives like - well, like Senator Flake?",
        "The party has changed.",
        "It has turned into a very inward-looking party with a lot of litmus tests, and immigration is one of the litmus tests.",
