        "That's fishermen Frank Mirarchi.",
        "He says the goal is not to catch more cod - just the opposite.",
        "We're trying to fish, but not catch cod.",
        "That's the new strategy.",
        "Mirarchi has been fishing out of Scituate, Mass., for 52 years.",
        "We sat at a picnic table overlooking the Scituate Harbor where dozens of fishing boats lie at anchor.",
        "He said, here's why we want to avoid cod.",
        "The catch limit for cod now is tiny.",
        "A boat may only be allowed a thousand pounds a year.",
        "That's not worth much money, so you fish for other so-called groundfish - flounder or haddock.",
        "But if your net or hook happens to bring up a cod, you have to keep it.",
        "Throw it back, you break the law.",
        "And once you've caught your limit of cod, even by accident, that's it.",
        "You have to stop fishing for any groundfish.",
        "It's very difficult to go fishing for something else.",
        "You run the risk of catching too many cod and actually having the fishery be closed for you or for your fellow fishermen because of that catch.",
        "So the fishing community wanted to locate the cod to avoid them.",
        "The biologists wanted to find them to protect them.",
        "An alliance was born.",
        "Mirarchi and his colleagues said, hey, we've been fishing offshore waters for decades.",
        "We'll tell you where to put your microphones.",
        "Christopher McGuire of the Nature Conservancy, which has been collaborating with the fishing community on all this, says they nailed it.",
        "You probably wouldn't be surprised to learn that after our first year, the areas where the fishermen said we should look is where the fish were.",
        "McGuire says now biologists have been able to pinpoint spawning sites down to a pretty small area.",
        "That means the government doesn't have to cordon off huge tracts of ocean wherever they hear cod grunts, a practice the fishing community didn't like.",
        "You know, we're trying to find the middle ground between closing the whole area while still allowing fishermen to be able to fish around it for other target species.",
        "So the biologists now have a tool to find the haystacks where the cod spawn.",
        "As for his fishing colleagues, Mirarchi says they're still skeptical that biologists and their microphones will make their jobs easier.",
        "But he says in places like Scituate, Mass., there's too much at stake not to try."
