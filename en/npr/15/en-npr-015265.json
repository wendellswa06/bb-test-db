        "But right now, while we are doing a great job with our surge - and I'm so proud of our soldiers that are doing it - we do not find that the Iraqi political leadership is stepped across the line of departure and started to do what they need to do in order to reduce the source of this conflict, the disagreements that exist.",
        "We still see militias at work.",

        "I don't think you can just cast them into outer darkness and try to find a solution to the problems of the region without taking into account the standing that Hamas has in the Palestinian community.",
        "Another matter.",
        "In dealing with Iran, should it be, either implicit or explicit, that the U.S.",
        "would resort to some kind of military strike against an Iranian target if they proceeded with a nuclear program?",

        "You always want to keep maximum flexibility.",
        "But as I look at the situation, I don't see any circumstances right now that would suggest that there is any imminence of a military strike or that there are any conditions that exist that would suggest a military strike is forthcoming in the near future.",
        "One other subject.",
        "From time to time, I talk with groups of voters about issues and politics, and it's now become predictable - whether it's in Virginia or Ohio or wherever - I ask people, utterly openly, are there any leaders around whom you find truly impressive and inspiring and you really would follow?",
        "And frankly, one name comes up and it's yours.",
        "It's not from everyone in the room, but it's from people who vote Democrats, vote Republicans.",
