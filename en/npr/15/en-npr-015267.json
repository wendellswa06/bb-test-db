        "We're awash in sexuality, eroticism, perversion, violence, nastiness - all kinds of bizarre stuff out there is considered modern popular culture.",

        "We see it on network television programs during the early evening hours.",
        "We hear it on the talk shows on television.",
        "Have you watched soap operas lately and the things they deal with?",
        "So to think of shock jocks - Don Imus said something shocking - the word shock itself, it doesn't apply to any kind of reality when you look at radio against the context of popular culture and society in America in 2007.",
        "Well, evidently what he did say did shock some people, but we'll leave that aside for a moment.",
        "How big a sector of the talk radio industry is this kind of stuff?",
        "It's a small sector of it.",
        "Most of the talk radio industry is standard news talk, and the subgenre of the talk radio industry that takes up a large percentage of, you know, if you were to measure words said on the radio, it's sports talk.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "Exactly, and sometimes we don't even know where the boundaries are between the kinds of radio we're talking about.",
        "For example, that which is often referred to as political talk radio - if you were to talk to any of its leading practitioners, they would tell you, every one of them, including Rush Limbaugh - hey, I don't just talk about politics, I talk about life.",
        "I talk about movies, culture, my personal life, what happened on the way to the station; a funny thing happened to me on the way to the studio - that type of thing.",
        "The boundaries between these academic subjects - English class is 1:00 to 2:00...",
        "Right.",
        "...social studies - it doesn't really exist in the reality of talk radio.",
        "One of the things that we found quite interesting after this whole brouhaha erupted over Don Imus was what his contract had to say, that in fact - that there was a clause in there that CBS management understands that this is going to be controversial and irreverent, and it encourages him to be so.",
        "Oh my goodness.",
        "You mean that they weren't victimized and surprised by what he did?",
        "My goodness.",
        "I'm glad that that came out, because as somebody that - you know, I'm often a go-to guy.",
        "The press often comes to me and I listen to all the questions, and I'm always explaining to the press that performers on the radio are not operating in their own entrepreneurial, you know, kingdom.",
        "They are hired to do what they're doing.",
        "It's like the old \"\"Mission Impossible,\"\" Neal, where we're going to send you on this impossible mission, and if you get caught, the secretary will disavow any knowledge of the mission.",

        "As though they were victimized.",
        "And what has changed in the world after Don Imus was fired?",
        "Well, nobody is saying nappy-headed ho anymore, unless you're saying it with quotes around it in a clinical sense.",

        "I don't know how that relates to people being sexy, and I don't know how that relates to the double standard that still exists in terms of some people can say nasty things about certain races if they are of those races or religions, but others can't.",
        "And where do you draw the line?",
        "I mean, how dark does somebody have to be to be black?",
        "How many of one's parents must - or ancestors - have to be Jewish to be qualified to say a Jewish joke?",
        "In other words, where do we draw the line as to who's qualified to be racially insulting or ethnically insulting, and who's not?",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "And we got this email from him about an hour and a half ago...",
        "I'm sorry to email just prior to the segment, but as it turns out, I will not be able to be on with you today.",
        "Some concerns on the company's side are preventing me from doing it at this time.",
        "Perhaps in the future I'll be able to assist you.",
        "Sorry for the confusion.",
        "Gracious of him to apologize, but it does suggest maybe some people are feeling a little gun shy.",
        "Well, of course, because - look, these people are employees of corporations.",
        "What, do you expect them to go on another medium, a competing corporation if you will, whether it's public radio or whatever, and say things that are family secrets about their employers?",
        "It's not about to happen, not if they want to keep their job.",
        "Also with us is Marc Fisher, a columnist for the Washington Post, the author of \"\"Something in the Air: Radio, Rock and the Revolution.\"\" And he joins us here in Studio 3A.",

        "What are some of the things they told you about their sense of responsibility and the way their world has changed?",
        "Well, their world has changed only a little bit, and it's changed repeatedly when we have these kind of ritual purification exercises that take place after a little scandal.",
        "We saw this after the Janet Jackson breast reveal in the Super Bowl a few years ago, and quite a number of these shock jocks - particularly the ones on the FM raunch stations, the ones that call themselves hot talk - these are the stations where they have the morning shows where there's a lot of talk about exotic sex acts and that sort thing.",
        "And a lot of those jocks were called in by their managers after that, just as they have been now after Don Imus, and told let's cool it for a while; tone down the language, a few of the phrases that maybe pushed the envelop, reel those back in, and stop doing some of the call-in segments that you were doing, the strip shows, like some of them did.",
        "Or they would have listener's call in to describe various sex acts, so you don't hear that for a time.",
        "But then they end up going right back there because as these DJs tell me again and again, this is what they are paid to do.",
        "They are there to build ratings.",
        "We are in a society where the further you - the harder you push that envelop, the higher the ratings will be.",
        "Management knows that and management tries to thread, to kind of weave a path between the desire to have the content on the air be controversial and - so that listener's will say, hey, did you hear what's on this station - versus the desire to appeal to advertisers and assure them that they will not be put in the situation that Imus' advertisers were put in.",

        "So the management is very cautious about this and they will never talk on the record about it because they are really playing both sides of the coin.",
        "And the performers are caught knowing that the managers want them to be as controversial as you can be until the public reacts.",
        "And what's new here is what Imus was trapped in, which is the YouTube trap, because what happened here is unlike - you know, radio is ephemeral.",

        "When the first advertisers said that they were pulling out - I don't remember whether it was Staples or Bigelow Tea or someone - and they had their nice big logo on the evening news as having pulled out, you can be sure that all the other advertisers sat around, said let's get - let's pull out, because we can't not be up there too, we'll look like we're racist, and we can always come back later."
