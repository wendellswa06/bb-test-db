        "So I just see hypocrisy all over the place when it comes to how this was handled.",
        "And as the caller mentioned before, I think they should have kept him on the payroll.",
        "Why did they have to fire him?",
        "Take him off the air.",
        "Come out, be honest, say hey, we take responsibility for this, we try to have the edgiest - spontaneous, sometimes the wrong thing comes out of somebody's mouth but it's spontaneous, it's live popular culture entertainment.",
        "Perhaps there's a sea change in how people react to these things.",
        "Perhaps it went over the line.",
        "It was a mistake.",
        "We take responsibility.",
        "Imus is not responsible.",
        "We pay him to do this.",
        "We take responsibility.",
        "We're taking him off the air but we're not going to punish him.",
        "He's not a criminal.",
        "He's not a bad child who did something wrong.",
        "We're going to keep him on the payroll, we're going to take him off the air, we're going to - we're going to analyze this situation and we're going to do what we think is right for the benefit of the public, for the benefit of the African-American community, all minorities, all peoples, our advertisers etc. And if in fact it's time to change our programming to fit changing times, we will do so, but Imus is a person who's been with our company for years.",
        "There are many people in this country who like him; their rights have to be considered too.",
        "Maybe we can use him in some other capacity, or he will change his act using his intellect and his talent to a productive end and we will see.",
        "But no, they fired him, which was in many ways a nervous, cowardly act, and they shouldn't have done that.",
        "Mark Fisher, I wonder what you think.",
        "Thanks very much, Ben.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "Let me ask you both.",
        "Mark's point earlier, radio ratings are in general in decline as people try to reach out to gather whatever audience remains - it's certainly still considerable in the case of many, many millions of people who listen to the radio, and we thank you all.",
        "But nevertheless, if this trend continues, Michael Harrison, do you think the trend is going to be towards more outrageous behavior rather than less?",
        "Well, I think the role that the advertisers played was really a good deal larger than that.",
        "I think there is - especially in radio, as in newspapers or television, and all of these old media that are very much in decline right now and seeing the audiences dissipate, they don't really see a clear way into the future, and so there's an extra level of panic and of caution, and so when something like this blows up, these industries are especially susceptible to advertiser pressure.",
        "And that's I think part of what happened here.",
        "But the Imus program was especially susceptible to this because he uniquely mixed two worlds.",
        "He was, on the one hand, one of these FM hot talk, raunch radio jocks; on the other hand, he ran a...",
        "Though a lot of his stations were on AM.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And at the same moment, he ran a very highfalutin political talk program that drew the likes of Tim Russert and John McCain and many other big names from Washington.",
        "And it was that blend, that unique mixture that proved to be terribly toxic for Imus because he ended up being held to a higher standard than we hold almost all of the other so-called shock jocks on the radio from whom we expect this kind of nonsense and this kind of ugliness."

        "And the irony here is that there are literally hundreds of talk show hosts across the country who on a daily basis say things that are as bad or far worse, far uglier and nastier on the radio.",
        "They say it every morning and their audience is there for that reason, they expect that.",
        "Imus, because he was on a cable TV news operation that takes itself seriously and presents itself as a serious news operation, because of that he was caught when he crossed a line into extreme nastiness; he was held to the same standard that we might perhaps hold the politicians who are his guests.",

        "Yeah, he's said a lot of ugly things about Hillary Clinton, but Hillary Clinton can defend herself.",
        "Right.",
        "And she doesn't have a problem with it.",
        "Or was it more a fact that was it the semantics that he used?",
        "Had he said, nappy-headed young ladies, would this have been okay?",
        "Had he said African-American hos, would that have been okay?",
        "Was it the combination of the three words?",
        "I'm not sure any of us are quite qualified to parse the semantics that carefully, but..."

        "No, I don't think it's a matter of those individual words but I think your first point is exactly right.",
        "You know, there's even a case in point happening just in recent days of Rush Limbaugh has been repeatedly airing a parody song which is a criticism of Barack Obama in which Barack Obama is called the Magic Negro.",
        "And this is a song that goes on at some length to criticize Obama in a very racially tinged manner and there are certainly folks out there who don't like the Rush Limbaugh program, who are trying to make an Imus kind of incident out of this, and they're not getting any traction for exactly the reason that you mentioned.",
        "This is - Imus really was a different kind of program from Limbaugh on the one hand, and also from the shock jocks on the other.",
        "And Michael Harrison, I suspect that was - at least certainly part of the reason that Don Imus was certainly - was abject in his apologies about what he said.",
        "Well, I think that he was abject in his apologies because he realized he was in trouble and I think he was probably under pressure from his management to do so, as they were still trying to salvage his employment there.",
        "I was going to say his career, but his career is far from finished.",
        "No.",
        "It's probably going to be bigger than ever.",
        "And he might even wind up going back to the same company that wiped their hands of him as soon as the short-term memory of the American public creates another kind of purification.",
        "I like that term, Mark.",
        "What did you call it?",
        "The ritual purification.",
        "Ritual purification.",
        "Very cool.",
        "But I think that Imus got caught in a perfect storm.",
        "I think that the African-American community has had an ongoing in-family argument about the split between the hip-hop culture and the more conventional culture as to the use of these words, and I think that the African-American community is very sensitive when that argument spills out into the general public.",
        "I think the idea of a 66-year-old white man, you know, acting like a 21-year-old black man, which is all Imus tried to do - he just really was age and race inappropriate, I don't think he meant it to be a racist.",
        "I also don't think he saw these girls as innocent.",
        "They're champion basketball players who are on TV and kind of famous in their own world.",
        "I just think he was stupid in how he did it, but I don't think that he meant any harm.",
        "And I think that he stepped on a time bomb in terms of that whole African-American argument going on.",
        "He was the last straw, and tremendous frustration poured out and Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton knew just how to play it.",
        "And you mentioned before, a lot of people were shocked by this.",
        "I think they were only shocked after it went through the echo effect of YouTube and the politicization of it and then the media piling on.",
        "I think most people didn't care.",
        "And I find also, personally, these girls - their moment was ruined - I don't think they would have even known about it if it weren't for all these people telling them that their moment was ruined.",
        "Back to me being cynical and thinking there's a lot of hypocrisy here.",
        "So there are so many factors involved in why Imus got caught in that trap at that moment; you can't say it's anyone of them."

        "Marc?",
        "No, I think if there's a - you know, we could have an endless argument about chicken or egg here, but I think there is history that teaches us that talk radio became raunchy and explicit not because the society had changed, but because of specific events that happened - the advent of satellite technology, the congressional and FCC decisions to lighten up on regulation of content on the radio, the elimination of the fairness doctrine.",
        "That's what opened the floodgates for a much more explicit kind of talk on the radio, both political and sexual.",

        "We live in a much coarser society now than we once did, but there are areas of the media that do reflect that, and there are areas that don't.",

        "And as I pointed out earlier, people do listen to radio in this little cone of privacy, Marc Fisher.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "There is an intimacy to radio that is unlike that of any other medium, and the caller is absolutely right.",
        "It is - there is a privacy, you know, in this conversation where the person on the radio is talking to you, and it feels like a one-on-one conversation.",
        "Add to that the privacy of the car - which is one of the last places where you can kind of be alone in this society - and the longer and longer times that people spend commuting to work, and you have - and also the change in the atmosphere in workplaces, where people are much more cautious about what they say than they may have been at a previous time."
