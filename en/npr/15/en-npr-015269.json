        "And rankle against it, which makes this kind of talk more appealing.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And so these talk show hosts become a kind of stand in for what many people would like to feel that they could say someday if they could ever say what was really on their minds at the office or at home or with their friends or in the neighborhood.",
        "And the car becomes that one place where it can all be vented.",
        "And so stations have found there's an enormous ratings bonanza to be had if you get out there and say all the things that may be lurking in the minds of people - things that they might really never say, even if they did have that opportunity.",
        "So it is a kind of venting of the national id.",
        "And that's a good thing, I think.",
        "I when we try to quash that and silence it, I think we are potentially doing damage, because people do need an outlet, even it's not their own voice.",
        "Michael Harrison, I'm going to give you the last word.",
        "And one of the things that's been of interest to me is the number people working in the radio business who grew up doing standup in clubs, and again, pushing that sort of line where the kind of things - these kind of things are fairly tame.",
        "Yeah, a lot of people are former standup comics, some are former lawyers.",
        "You know, people come from all kinds of discredited fields that - just if I have final word, you mentioned Frank Sinatra.",
        "Frank Sinatra sang about tramps.",
        "He sang in praise of drinking and driving - one for my baby, and one more for the road.",
        "Nothing's changed.",
        "We're not in a dirtier, more funky, crude society now.",
        "It's just modernized.",
        "If you look back at the history of art, the history of communication and the history of societies, the history of Imus, it's - nothings new.",
        "It's just new words, just new names and categories.",
        "A case can be made we're a more civil society today than we were in the '50s.",
        "It was just couched differently.",
        "So let's not fall victim to believing things are getting worse and uglier now.",
        "It's just that we're in the now, so it seems more intense.",
        "All right, let's bring in Lynnette Khalfani Cox.",
        "She is a personal finance coach.",
        "And tell us why is it that African-Americans are having more trouble in this economy than whites?",
        "I think where African-Americans are being disproportionately impacted are in ways that impact their ability to build wealth.",
        "For example, we know that people who don't have a job obviously are at risk of not being able to pay their mortgages.",
        "And so there's been so much attention given to the housing crisis and the foreclosure scenario going on in the country right now, where you have one in 10 homeowners who are behind on their mortgage payments and one out of 10 who's under water, meaning they owe more on the home than the home is worth.",
        "In the African-American community in particular, the numbers are more dire.",
        "According to NAREB - the National Association of Real Estate Brokers - it's a community of primarily African-American and Latino brokers, they're telling us now that one in three minority households - one in three are in foreclosure.",
        "And so this has a tremendous impact of course on home ownership rates where you're seeing 73 percent of whites owning their own homes, about 50 percent of Latinos owning their own homes, and only 49 percent or so of African-Americans being homeowners.",
        "And let's bring in our third panelist, Steve Perry.",
        "He is a principal and founder of a school called the Capital Preparatory Magnet School; it's in Hartford, Connecticut.",
        "And Steve Perry, you're also the author of a book called \"\"Man Up: Nobody is Coming to Save Us.\"\" So I imagine you're kind of a pull yourself up by your bootstraps kind of guy.",
        "What do you make of these figures?",
        "Well it's hard to pull yourself up by bootstraps when you're barefoot.",
        "And one of the challenges that the African-American community finds itself facing, and Latinos as well, is that for many groups, buying a home was a long-term investment.",
        "But somewhere around 2004 people begin to buy them as a means of almost to get rich quick plan, and thinking that they could own a home that was beyond their means and specifically, as African-Americans go, some 63 percent of our wealth is tied up in our homes where, compared to white folks it's about 38 percent.",
        "And so when a person is mortgaged to the teeth, they have more house than they can manage then they find themselves from a very practical level spending more time working to pay the bills.",
        "Why does that matter?",
        "Well, I'm a principal and founder of a high school.",
        "And when parents are working second and third shift, they find less time to prepare their children for school.",
        "Long-term ramifications of that are when children are not prepared and when parents are not participating in high-wage or high-income or high-education jobs, we find a vicious cycle.",
        "That which brought them to the circumstance which is a lack of understanding in the economy and how to manage money is passed on to the next generation thereby deepening the impact and extending it to the second and in some cases, the third generation.",
        "So, President Obama has included a lot of relief in his stimulus package and a lot of relief that would specifically help urban areas and the minorities.",
        "And I'm dowering, do you think that's enough?",
        "You're there in Hartford, Connecticut, that's probably an area that's pretty hard hit and might see a lot of help from the stimulus package.",
        "What do you think about that?"

        "I think the stimulus package is well-intended.",
        "I don't know what it's going to look like when it hits the street.",
        "I think that one of the problems that we have is in a city like Hartford and many cities that are - they have in some cases a 30 percent graduation rate, the type of jobs that are necessary in order to pull people up, in order for people to be able to move forward, the type of wealth that needs to be created, requires an education.",
        "And our children, in many cases now adults, don't have the level of education that's necessary.",
        "So this low wage jobs don't exist anymore, not in this country.",
        "We don't have a education base that's consistent with the types of jobs that would be necessary at this state.",
        "So I feel like the problem that we have is that our population is undereducated for an economy that requires a high-end education.",
        "This is Algernon here.",
        "I agree completely that we need significant improvements in the education area.",
        "But I think for understanding the economic crisis as a whole, we need to look deeper into the American economy.",
        "We see greater inequality, economic inequality, in the U.S.",
        "than we see in other countries.",
        "There are more poor people in the U.S.",
        "U.S.",
        "workers work very hard, very long, but yet earn low wages than other advanced countries, yet our CEO's has higher incomes than other advanced countries.",
        "So, a fundamental part of the economic crisis is really that average Americans have not been benefiting from the wealth of the society.",
        "And that's why they are looking to their house, may be I can get some income out of my house.",
        "So, I see a root weakness in our economy, not simply in education but in the economic inequality within our society.",
        "Algernon, one of the things that I've seen - and I believe you've seen - is that people brought more house than they could afford.",
        "They really did.",
        "They bought in an attempt to either move up and out, or purchase a house before they were able to…",
        "That's probably true, but they needed a lender to be complicit with that.",
        "I agree with that.",
        "And the question is why do lenders who had their - all of their financial information, why would they complicit in that?",
        "Let me bring in Lynnette Khalfani Cox here because you probably talk directly with homeowners who are underwater and in trouble, and what do you see?",
        "This is TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "I'm Neal Conan in Washington.",
        "Tomorrow on TALK OF THE NATION, fed up after years covering problems that did not seem to have any apparent solutions, newspaper columnist Leonard Pitts started an experiment this year.",
        "No more just talking about what's wrong, he wants to know what works, and he wants you to help.",

        "There's no question that we had a group of consumers, some of whom did, in fact, bite off more than they could chew and were willing to do so.",
        "But I hold, first and foremost, the lenders responsible.",
        "These are supposed to be the quote, unquote, \"\"experts.\"\" You talk to a mortgage broker who is writing mortgages all day long, someone who has been in the business five, 10, 15 years or so.",
        "And frankly, that person has probably written hundreds, if not thousands of mortgages in his or her career, whereas the average person will buy a home, what, once - if once every seven years or so, probably three times in that person's lifetime.",
        "So, we know for a fact many minority communities, African-Americans, Latinos, et cetera, were specifically targeted for subprime loans.",
        "Every single reputable organization has found this, from the Federal Reserve Bank, to the Consumer Federation of America, to the Center for Responsible Lending.",
        "One of the central findings that they all reached were that African-American women in particular were two to three times more likely to be targeted for and to receive sub-prime loans when they were becoming homeowners regardless of their credit and/or their income.",
        "Were they duped in some cases?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And should they have, quote, unquote \"\"read the fine print or known better?\"\" I would argue that the issue there goes back to a more fundamental question about education, specifically about financial education.",
        "We've simply raised a generation of financially illiterate adults in this country.",
        "Folks don't learn about managing their money and their credit and debt wisely in their homes.",
        "They certainly don't learn about it in college or in schools.",

        "We started off in a crisis.",
        "We've now passed into the red in a very bad way.",
        "And as Lynnette was saying, quite a few of our folks simply are not educated to simple - to basic principles of wealth management or growth.",
        "And so, when you take those and you add the issue of limits in actual education - we're not just talking about the practical application of education in terms of financial, but just having a degree that will put them in a professional capacity - I think we're five, six years away from this.",
        "You know, when white America, you know, catches a cold economically, black America, for example, has the flu.",
        "So, I would certainly think that if it, say, is a year or two for America as a whole to quote, unquote, \"\"recover,\"\" I would anticipate it would be a longer recovery by and large for African-American and Latino communities in particular.",
        "And finally, I'd like you all to rate how President Obama has done in addressing these concerns and in addressing the economic disparities between whites and blacks.",
        "I give him an A for effort, while I don't know yet - I don't think anyone knows what the stimulus package is going to mean.",
        "Because I believe that the greatest issue that we have is not one of wealth, but in fact is of consumer confidence.",
        "The confidence that we have, the credit that was extended - those fundamental components of the economy have been shaken to their core.",
        "So I don't know that this is an issue of spending our way out.",

        "You know, frankly, I don't - I would be doubtful that he would address the issue of black wealth specifically, but the means to that is, you know, the first step is employment and the second step is home ownership.",
        "Has President Obama addressed the issue of black wealth?",
        "No, not directly, not yet.",
        "I think we're very early into his tenure, and, you know, he's going to be up to his administration to determine what comes first.",
        "I think he has clearly made the economy the dominant issue and addressing the economy for all Americans because he is in fact a president for all Americans, not just the African-American community clearly."
