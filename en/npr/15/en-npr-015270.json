        "Well, I think that I'm afraid that what will happen is that parents will consider teachers simply their governesses, their own personal Mary Poppins, as one of the my graduates has said, as their court tutors, where they are just there; the teachers are not professionals per se, that they are at the behest of the parents.",
        "That the parents get to tell the teachers what to do and how to deal with students.",
        "And that seems to me be like a really bad idea for everybody involved.",
        "That school is sort of like, well, in a sense, a consumer organization.",
        "Right.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And so that a parents get to come up and say, not that you're an incompetent teacher but that you have caused my child emotional harm - I mean this kid had a 4.5.",
        "Now a 4.5, I presume, is like off the charts because it usually a 4.0.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So this kid is, like, already way too accomplished.",
        "You know what I mean?",
        "This is somebody who probably has far too much self-esteem, dare I say.",
        "And I think that's one of the problems with what's happening with kids is - and it's - I've been teaching for 20 years at all different levels and so I feel quite informed in my response, and having been in school 118 years myself.",
        "So I, you know, I've been in there in both capacities.",
        "But there's a difference between self-esteem and self-respect.",
        "And what this kid needs to learn is a sense of self-respect.",
        "And self-respect comes from saying you know what, this may not be fair, life is unfair and I'm going to go on and make sure that, you know, when I am surgeon general of the United States that I make sure that kids know before they go on a trip to hand in a project before instead of hand in the project later.",
        "That's going to be my first - when L.H.",
        "or J.H.",
        "goes on and does this, she can then get in and tell all the students of America to get their projects in early.",
        "This is a discrepancy, isn't there, in the story?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "As we read it because the parents or the lawyers for the parents are saying that she's being punished by the teacher quote/unquote, \"\"punished by the teacher\"\" for submitting her report on falling leaves.",
        "And again, the whole - I think it's very funny that the story is about falling leaves and the judge's name is Bloom.",
        "Somehow we have to negotiate that, but there may just be too much stuff about, you know, flora in West Virginia that really just (unintelligible) the problem.",
        "Well, let me quote what her lawyer had to say.",
        "She's not really protesting a bad grade.",
        "What she's protesting is the refusal to follow the rule in this particular county, that if you're absent from school with permission, then you're given the days your absent to make up or complete the work you've done and hand it in a little late.",
        "Okay, but you also have here the teacher saying or, I believe, it's the teacher actually being quoted saying that…"

        "I think it's the lawyer for the board of education.",
        "Right, right, right, was saying that she had plenty of information that any late submission will not be accepted.",
        "And part of going to school, the lawyer says, part of going to school is learning there are rules, learning there are deadlines.",
        "Unfortunately, this is a pretty good student, but sometimes you just have to learn from your mistakes.",
        "And you're suggesting that she just suck it up.",
        "Well, I mean, that really is part - part of what students need to learn to do is to get a B, to get a C, to get, you know, an F on something, to learn that look, she had - if she had all of this time to hand this in, if she knew that this was going on, that she was very - she sounds like she's an enormously prepared young woman.",
        "I think that she should have handed it in early.",
        "That's what one does.",
        "Anybody in school knows that.",
        "This still sounds to me, first of all, like somebody whose life is not going to be ruined unless her parents insist on making this a traumatic event.",
        "It seems to me that the parents are traumatizing kids in this case.",
        "The story, and it comes to us from the Associate Press, says the West Virginia Education Association says they're watching this case closely because it could set a precedent.",
        "Right.",
        "Do they have a - are they correct to be worried about this?",
        "No, no. But what I'm saying is when somebody is really an accelerated student, somebody is a high achiever and allowances have been made for this type of situation, they should honor that.",

        "There are other people whose kids go to school, get a B, and the parents don't think of suing.",
        "This kind of thing just exacerbates the difference between the kids from the have families and the have-not families.",
        "This - it makes the teacher feel - I also think - I'm going to go into a whole gender thingy here.",
        "I bet, you know, my five bucks is on the fact if this had been some Mr. Chips as opposed to Ms. Chips who was in front of the room, the parents would've had a harder time thinking that she should've been cut some slack, that female teachers of all stripes - including professors - are supposed to be all warm and nurturing and fuzzy.",
