        "And late last year, some of her students came around to her office to say they'd seen her picture on the Fox News Channel.",
        "And they said that Glenn Beck thinks that you are a plotter, a conspirator, that you have a plan to take down American capitalism.",
        "And then they giggled because my students think that's very funny.",
        "So she tuned in and found herself right at the heart of one of Glenn Beck's trademark chalkboard diagrams."

        "Elaine, could you give us a list, and it's fairly impressive, of notable figures in the ancient world who were also poisoned.",
        "Well, yes, but let's distinguish.",
        "These people died of poison.",
        "They weren't necessarily other people's victims.",
        "We start, of course, with Socrates, and let me just throw into the babble - we can talk about them - Hannibal, Cleopatra and Mithradates, the king of Pontos.",
        "In Socrates's case, it was a public punishment.",
        "He was condemned to death.",
        "The Athenian democracy actually condemned a lot of, as far as we can see, honorable people to death.",
        "I don't have a very high opinion of the Athenian democracy, I'm afraid.",
        "And death was in a way rather painless.",
        "They were required to drink hemlock, and the dose was measured exactly.",
        "And we happen to know blow-by-blow what it was like for Socrates.",
        "His guardian in the jail told him that he had to drink it all - he couldn't afford to pour out a couple of drops as a tribute to the god of health - and that he would gradually feel his legs go numb and then his arms.",
        "And as the numbness reached up to his heart, he would crease to be alive, he would die.",
        "And he drank it.",
        "In a sense it was voluntary, but in another sense it was, or course, compelled.",
        "What were some of the substances that were used with people who weren't as cooperative as Socrates, if I might put it that way?",
        "Well, I can only say the chief source of poison that was known was serpent venom.",
        "People must also have used extracts of poisonous plants - well, hemlock is a poisonous plant.",
        "Remind us about Claudius.",
        "That was mushrooms, right?",
        "Yes.",
        "And the story, as we have it, is that once Agrippina, his second wife, has persuaded him to adopt her horrible son Nero as his heir, Claudius became unnecessary.",
        "And the question when you're poisoning people is slow or quick poison.",
        "Slow poison, of course, goes unnoticed.",
        "It looks like an illness, like poor Litvinenko.",
        "I must say my heart grieves for that man.",
        "So the slow poison was the less obvious method.",
        "They tried slow poison and it didn't seem to work very well, so then they resorted to instant poisoning in a dish of mushrooms, I suppose Amanita muscaria instead of nice, safe mushrooms.",
        "And of course Claudius's son Britannicus?",
        "Britannicus was a couple of years younger than Nero and he was, of course, the rightful heir by blood to Claudius and his dead wife Messalina.",
        "As he approached his 14th birthday, Nero got anxious.",
        "So it was December, like now, and it was Saturnalia, the season of parties, and they knew that Britannicus had a taster who tasted his food before him.",
        "And if the taster dropped dead, then it would kind of look bad socially.",
        "So they gave Britannicus his drink without any poison in it, but they served it to him so hot that he had to ask for water to cool it.",
        "And they put the poison in the water.",
        "Oh, my gosh."

        "Well, I want to be careful, obviously, about analogies between the ancient world and modern Russian politics.",
