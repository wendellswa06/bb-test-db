        "You know, Elizabeth Warren grilled him about whether or not he would rule out grants to Trump properties.",
        "He said he would not.",
        "He was also asked why a neurosurgeon would want to head up Housing and Urban Development.",
        "And he said interestingly that he wants the agency to go beyond people thinking of it as, quote, \"\"putting roofs over the heads of poor people\"\" and, quote, \"\"develop our fellow human beings.\"\" So he may want to take somewhat of a more activist role never seen before for a HUD secretary.",
        "Well, look, as if this wasn't busy enough - and it was busy enough - there was also other action on Capitol Hill apart from the confirmation hearings - pretty significant - a potentially significant move on the Affordable Care Act.",
        "Domenico, do you want to take it from there?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Look, the Congress passed a budget resolution that creates the framework to begin repeal, but that's not going to happen for a while.",
        "The big reason why - Republicans have not agreed on a plan to replace it.",
        "They set a date of January 27 in this resolution for the committees to report back with repeal legislation, but everyone acknowledges on the Hill, according to Susan Davis our congressional correspondent there, that this is going to slip 'til at least late February, probably go past that, could consume all of 2017 for Republicans.",
        "So with this legislation that has passed, Congress can repeal at least parts of - they can potentially repeal at least parts of the Affordable Care Act with only 51 votes in the Senate.",
        "But if they want to replace it, they actually need 60 votes which means they're going to need help from Democrats which means they really need to have a replacement that is broadly acceptable.",
        "And at this point, they don't have that yet.",
        "And just with this first step that's been taken, you can see the backlash starting to build with people saying, wait, I actually got my health care through the Affordable Care Act.",
        "Are you taking it away?",
        "And there are - you're starting to see stories of real people with real health conditions telling their stories and that - as that builds, that makes the job even harder of repealing and replacing.",
        "And, again, there's so much news this week, we can't drill down on, you know, all of it.",
        "But then yesterday, we learned that a close aide to Trump had spoken by phone with the Russian ambassador to the U.S.",
        "on the very day that the Obama administration announced that sanctions against Russia - that there were sanctions being imposed against Russia for meddling in the campaign.",
        "So, Tam, tell us about that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So this is General Michael Flynn.",
        "He's Trump's pick for national security adviser, and he spoke with the Russian ambassador by phone at the ambassador's request, according to Trump aides, on December 29 which was the day that the Obama administration announced it would impose sanctions and expel 35 Russian diplomats.",
        "There's other reporting, including from The Washington Post and Reuters, that it wasn't just one conversation, but several conversations.",
        "But Trump's spokesman Sean Spicer insists that it is doubtful that they discussed the sanctions and says that it was really just about logistics for after the inauguration.",
        "The reason that this matters is that it raises questions about whether Flynn was trying to influence the Russian response to the American sanctions and also whether he was sort of conducting foreign policy as a private citizen because President-elect Trump isn't president yet.",
        "We really still don't know all the details about this.",
        "It's a very odd situation where you have the incoming White House press secretary telling reporters on a phone call the morning this becomes revealed that it - that they spoke the day before the sanctions were announced.",
        "And then it's revealed later and confirmed to us at NPR that Flynn and the Russian ambassador spoke around the same time as the sanctions were being announced.",
        "And the reason that this all matters is because of the Logan Act which says that no one can conduct foreign policy without the U.S.",
        "government's permission, meaning if Flynn were discussing something with the Russian ambassador, saying something like don't worry about these sanctions, we'll deal with it when Trump gets in, that would be a violation of the Logan Act."
