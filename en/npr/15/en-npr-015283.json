        "Super Tuesday has come and gone, but the largest primary day in U.S.",
        "history continues to reverberate in national politics.",
        "The Republicans have a clear front runner, but the Democratic contest looks tighter than ever and there are plenty of question marks about the results.",
        "Joining us to sort these out is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson.",
        "Welcome, Mara.",
        "And - I can't imagine you got much sleep last night.",
        "First though, what's happening since everybody got a few hours of sleep this morning?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Speak for yourself.",
        "It felt like minutes to me but we have gotten some news overnight.",
        "We got closure about Missouri.",
        "That's the state where there was an exceedingly close race.",
        "It was called first for Clinton by the AP and some television networks but then for Obama.",
        "So Obama has won Missouri by about 6,000 votes.",
        "The delay appears to have been those Saint Louis inner-ring suburbs that report late and if you remember they were responsible for the cliffhanger in 2006 when Democrat Claire McCaskill won her Senate race after midnight.",
        "So Missouri or Missouri, however you say it - that now settled.",
        "What about New Mexico?",
        "Still too close to call.",
        "They're still counting the provisional ballots.",
        "That will either become Obama's fourteenth state or Clinton's ninth.",
        "We just don't know yet.",
        "What about the overall delegate count at this point?",
        "I've gotten a lot of reaction.",
        "It's been overwhelmingly positive.",
        "It's been shared a couple thousand times.",
        "And one interesting thing that's happened since I put the post out is how many people I've heard from that actually knew Thelonious.",
        "I've heard from several family members.",
        "They say that he had a lifestyle that most people think is wrong, but, you know, they considered him a really good person.",
        "And he was always trying to turn his life around.",
        "And they talk about the great loss that they feel now that Thelonious is gone.",
        "And I think that's just really telling, especially when all you have to look at is a criminal record.",
        "This was a loved person who was trying to make his life better.",
        "I've also heard from people in the system who knew Thelonius, including a Baltimore city public defender, where she told me that she personally has lost 15 or 16 young men that she's worked with to homicide over the years and how much that affects her and the other public defenders in Baltimore City.",
        "And I just find that to be such a profound statement.",
        "We always talk about systematic failures and how these young men are failed by the system, but here we have people in the system who clearly care and are also deeply affected by these murders.",
        "That was Baltimore Sun editor Adam Marton talking about the death of a young Baltimore man named Thelonious Monk.",
        "He was killed in that city - one of 344 homicides in Baltimore in 2015.",
        "And the week in politics began with big wins for party front-runners in the presidential primaries, but it wasn't enough to send their rivals packing.",
        "For Democrats, Bernie Sanders vowed to continue on.",
        "On the Republican side, even before Tuesday's primaries, John Kasich and Ted Cruz brokered a sort of non-compete agreement to improve their odds of winning delegates going forward.",
        "Then Wednesday, Cruz went so far as to name a running mate and welcomed today the endorsement of Indiana Gov.",
        "Mike Pence.",
        "It felt like a turning point in this primary contest so we're going to talk about why with our Friday regulars, E.J.",
        "Dionne of The Washington Post and Brookings Institution."

        "Well, first of all, I didn't think her voice was that bad.",

        "And I think in terms of the breaking up the news cycle, he had to do something 'cause the news was so bad from the assail of primaries.",

        "First you had the defeats.",
