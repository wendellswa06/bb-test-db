        "I guessed the project started the night my brother told me that he was HIV-positive, and of course that's now been 25 years, or a quarter of a century.",
        "But really the project started a few years ago, maybe four or five years ago, when I approached Jeffrey, my brother with an idea that we should do something.",
        "We didn't know what yet, but we should somehow share our family's story in how we handled his disease with other people in an effort to help them.",
        "When we found out that Jeff was HIV-positive, my parents took a very proactive, very supportive, a very loving approach to dealing with and managing that situation.",
        "And they very effectively set the tone within our immediate family as well as our extended family that my brother was going to be stood by and supported throughout this crisis in his life.",
        "What we discovered as we began to look at other families' stories, other families around us, other families next door across the street in middle America, in urban America, was that our family unfortunately was atypical of how far too many families handle this disease.",
        "So in order to make sure that the community could relate to this project and that no one felt left out, it was expanded and expanded and eventually evolved into the anthology that you see (unintelligible).",
        "So your brother - your brother has survived HIV and AIDS for a quarter of a century, which is almost the duration of the epidemic here in the United States.",
        "I mean that must be an incredible feeling for you and for him, and for everyone who supported him.",
        "I think so.",
        "I mean, you know, as I stated in my piece, you know, for a very long time our family existed under this constant dark cloud of when is it going to happen, when is it going to happen.",
        "And eventually - I'm just speaking just for myself - we came to accept his condition for what it was and when the time comes for him to make his transition, it will simply be that.",
        "But to enjoy him and the time that we have for what it is, and to value that time and to know that we're blessed for having it."

        "Regina, how did you come in?",
        "How did Gil solicit you into this project?",
        "Well, Gil and I have known each other for about six years now, and I knew he was working on a book, he talked a lot about the book in the beginning.",
        "And he reached out to me about two years ago, I believe, and said that he wanted me to write an essay for him.",
        "And, of course, it was due like, you know, the next day, right, Gil?",

        "You said I'm not sure if I will ever feel fully confident and secure enjoying sex without the benefit of a thin protective barrier of latex.",
        "Wow.",
        "How does it feel to put that on paper and know that everyone's going to read it?",
        "You know, I did not think about that when I wrote it the first time.",
        "You talk about creeping and the culture of, you know, I mean in some ways don't you think that creeping and cheating has been culturally validated?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "And so at the same time, if you're talking about safer sex, then you have to take into account that people don't always tell the truth in romantic relationships.",
        "Writing this piece definitely made me think, and I really worry about the younger women.",
        "Because you can't really afford to make mistakes now, you know.",

        "I want to get back to you in a second about the issue of the media and how that all plays into how younger people especially view sex and AIDS prevention.",
        "But, Gil, did you find any differences by generation, by gender, in terms of all of the people that you solicited for this project?",
        "Yes, certainly.",
