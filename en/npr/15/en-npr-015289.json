        "Yeah.",
        "Mattis clearly wants the Sultan's help blocking its extremist groups such as ISIS and al-Qaida that are fighting in eastern Yemen because they could spill over the border into Oman.",
        "OK.",
        "So we hear Mattis there heaping praise on the sultan, the leader of Oman.",
        "But I mentioned in the intro, there are these reports that Iran has been smuggling weapons to Houthi rebels in Yemen through Oman's border.",
        "So is that not a problem?",
        "I mean, is the secretary of defense putting pressure on Oman to crack down there?",
        "Well, he's saying nothing.",
        "At least, not publicly.",
        "I think American officials are concerned about Iranian arms going through Oman, but anything they say would likely be in private.",
        "Oman is just too important a back channel for the U.S.",

        "Well, Mattis had some pretty tough words for Syria and Russia.",
        "He was referring to unconfirmed reports which the U.N.",
        "is still investigating that Syrian government forces used chlorine gas in attacks in Eastern Ghouta.",
        "Now, for the past five years, Syria's government has been banned from even possessing chemical weapons, much less using them, and Russia's the guarantor of that agreement.",
        "Mattis said that Russia's either been incompetent, or, as he put it, in cahoots with the Syrian regime, and he said that it would be very unwise for Syria to use weaponized gas."
