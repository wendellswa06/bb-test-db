        "And, John, the president last night said the economy is improving.",
        "So, how to explain, then, the higher deficit for this year?",
        "Well, the big reason is the agreement between the president and Republicans during the lame-duck session of Congress to extend the Bush tax cuts for another two years.",
        "The CBO estimates that will reduce tax revenue by about $400 billion next year.",
        "And that represents a huge chunk of this projected record deficit.",
        "The CBO did say that those tax cuts are likely to help boost economic growth next year.",
        "So they're predicting the deficit will drop some in 2012, but it would remain above a trillion dollars.",
        "John, last night in the State of the Union, the president proposed a five-year freeze on non-security portions of the federal budget to help with the deficit problem.",
        "First of all, what is that non-security portion of the budget and how much of a difference will a five-year freeze make in that sector?",
        "Well, under the administration's definition, the non-security part of the budget includes all discretionary spending except spending on Defense, Homeland Security, the State department and Veterans Affairs.",
        "It also excludes entitlements like Medicare and Social Security.",
        "So, as the president admitted last night, the freeze only applies to 12 percent of the overall budget.",
        "Right.",
        "Now, according to the White House, the freeze will save more than $400 billion over 10 years, so around $40 billion a year, but not a lot when you're trying to fight annual budget deficits of more than a trillion dollars."

        "And another thing, John, the president talked about last night was the expansion of a number of programs including clean energy, high speed rail, all of those would seem to be non-security spending.",
        "So, how do you increase spending on those programs under the freeze that he's talking about?",
        "Well, the president will do it by cutting spending for other programs in the category.",
        "This is not an across the board freeze.",
        "Every program will not be treated the same.",

        "How do those compare?",
        "Well, the Republicans would cut more deeply.",
        "The Republican leadership plan is to go back to spending levels in 2008.",
