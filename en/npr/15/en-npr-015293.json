        "I dont think the million-dollar contribution will make Fox News Channel more right wing-oriented because for the most part, I dont see how it could be.",
        "Officials at Fox News itself declined to comment, while News Corp.'s spokesman Jack Horner wouldnt talk on tape.",
        "But he rejected the notion that the gift in any way undercut the professional standing of its journalists.",

        "And it's fine if thats, you know, how they want to build their business model.",
        "But we dont think we need to treat them as though they are a news organization, the way other news organizations here are treated.",

        "In a display hall filled with wonders like Skylab, the Lunar Lander and the Apollo Soyuz Spacecraft, it's easy to overlook a small glass case with a modest rocket-shaped thing inside it.",
        "But the museum's chief space historian, Michael Neufeld, says this 30 pound object holds a special place in space history.",
        "This is a backup of Explorer 1, the first United States satellite that was launched on January 31, 1958.",

        "Four months earlier the Soviets had built a rocket that was able to carry Sputnik 1 into orbit.",
        "It was the first manmade satellite.",
        "The first Sputnik achievement was followed one month later, less than one month later, by Sputnik 2 with the dog Laika.",
        "And that was a real shock because the payload was so large.",
        "The message was loud and clear.",
        "If the Soviets could lob a dog around the world, imagine was else long-range rockets could carry.",
        "We would never have invested all this money in rocket technology, nor would the Soviets, if we weren't fundamentally trying to find a way to loft a warhead thousands of miles.",
        "Neufeld says the U.S.",
        "had been urgently working on its own space program, but it was running a bit behind the Soviets.",
        "And the first attempt to catch up came in December 1957.",
        "The Navy tried to launch a satellite with a rocket it was developing.",
        "And it's a humiliating failure.",
        "It goes up a few inches, engine cuts off, falls back, explodes, and dumps a satellite out on the scrubland.",
        "And in fact over here in another case we have the satellite.",
        "The Navy got to work trying to figure out what was up with its rocket program, and that gave its rival, the Army Space Program, a chance to put America into orbit.",
        "Wernher von Braun had adopted the German V-2 Rocket used in World War II.",
        "And at 10:48 p.m. on January 31st, the Army launched his rocket.",

        "From this little satellite to putting a human on the moon in 1969 in only 12 years was really astounding.",

        "Can you believe that?",
        "After 34 years being located in Altadena, California, we made one move up to the high desert and the recreation and parks department offered their space at no charge, which I thought was very nice.",
