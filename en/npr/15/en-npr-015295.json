        "Jenny seems to me to be so - you know, on one hand so innocent and naive and giggly.",
        "She's - you have these wonderful dimples and this incredible little laugh, but at the same time, there's such wisdom on your face in this part, even while, as a viewer, you know that you are headed towards some disastrous fall.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Is that how it was written in the script?",
        "Is that what you picked up from the director or the writer?",
        "But the camera thing has always been weird for me.",
        "I've always, when I was a kid, I hated having my photo taken.",
        "And then I had braces when I was about 12 for a couple of years, and I kind of taught myself not to smile because I didn't want to show anyone my braces, and then I never kind of came out of that.",
        "So when I'm standing, like, on a red carpet, and people are asking me to smile, I get this sort of rising panic because I haven't found a smile that I'm comfortable with, that I - you know, that I look nice smiling.",
        "I, sort of, look sort of terrible.",

        "You know, the teenage thing kind of kicked in the following years.",
        "You know, this is pre-Beatles and pre-swinging '60s, and it's still post-war.",
        "You know, the first couple of years of her life, she still would have been on rationing.",
        "You know, it wasn't a fun, fun society.",
        "It was kind of a getting-on, surviving society still.",
        "People still had all that in their minds, and she was written very intelligently and very - and she was very witty.",
        "And in a way, Jenny does know, you know, she's headed into something not brilliant.",
        "I mean, she's not naive to it, which is why it doesn't feel like she's being taken advantage of in a sort of inappropriate way because she kind of drives certainly the romantic side of the relationship more than the Peter Sarsgaard character, David, does.",

        "Yeah, I mean, that was a decision at the beginning that, you know, we'd make sure that she was driving that relationship because really, David isn't interested in her sexually as a 16-year-old, or he doesn't think of her in those terms.",
        "And David - when Peter talks about David, he says, you know, he's just a guy who missed out on his teenage years.",
        "I mean, he was that age during the war, and he never got to be a kid, and this is more about him wanting to be young than be with someone who's young.",
        "There's a scene when David, the older man, takes you to Paris, and you are sort of dancing along the Seine, and your hair is in this fantastic updo, and you're wearing this very slim, sleeveless, sheath dress, and you're very birdlike, you're a very tiny person, and you know, the Audrey Hepburn comparisons are just right in front of you as a viewer.",
        "You're just looking at you, thinking, my god, there she is again.",
        "I mean, when you look at that, when you look at yourself in those scenes, do you see that, or does it seem really other to you?",
        "No, it doesn't seem like - I mean, those scenes were the last scenes we shot in the whole movie.",
        "We shot that on our wrap weekend, and we just went around in a van and shot, like, you know, shot dancing by the river, and then we'd run over there and shoot going up the steps, and you know, people were having a glass of wine.",
        "It was very relaxed and fun.",
        "And I watch that, and all of that comes into my head, and I just think about the crew and us all kind of hanging out, and the sound men being really hungover, and you know, I don't really think about any of that other stuff.",
        "And you know, we had so much fun and improvised and messed about, and you know, it's all that kind of stuff for me.",
        "And if the Audrey Hepburn comparisons come with it, so be it.",
        "I mean, god, you know, it's hugely, enormously, madly flattering, but it doesn't - it's, too, sort of crazy to think about.",
        "It's just very kind of - it's like, well, it's nicer than being compared to Shrek or something.",
        "I would think.",
        "Yeah.",

        "He's just sort of very direct, and his directness is comforting because you know that he'll never let you move on or complete a scene without getting what he needs.",
        "So - and actually, we did a scene a month ago.",
        "It was something of - kind of a really emotional scene, and the camera kind of came towards my face, and I sometimes get this kind of stupid reaction to cameras, and I suddenly think, like, oh, I'm an actor, and I'm on set, and I'm wearing a costume, and I'm doing an American accent, and this is so weird and stupid, and I don't feel kind of like I'm in the scene at all.",
        "And I had one of those, and I was getting really frustrated, and I went off into this back room to wait for them to set up to start again because I'd ruined the take, and Oliver came back and kind of stood next to me and went, all right, so what's going on?",
        "I said oh, no, I'm just freaking out.",

        "Cameras are really tough, yeah.",
        "Words to live by.",
        "Yeah, yeah, I know.",
