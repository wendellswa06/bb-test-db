        "For example, in Colombia, one species, magnolia wolfii, is reduced to less than 10 individuals and that's the consequence of coffee plantations taking over the national habitat of that species.",

        "They are gap colonizers.",
        "That is a tend to seed themselves in little disturbances in the forests, sometimes called gaps.",
        "So as a result, all 240 or so species of magnolias is relatively uncommon where they grow, or in fact I can say mostly rare.",
        "Wipe out just one little pocket of magnolias and the whole species is gone, just as of all the finches died on an island in the Galapagos.",
