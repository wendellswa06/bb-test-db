        "And hundreds of Dutch soccer fans arrive wearing their orange lederhosen with lion's tails on them, courtesy of Bavaria beer and they were told to take them off.",
        "Yeah, they were asked to take them off and there were a lot of fans, yeah, standing there literally in their underwear and they were sent into the stadium with their underwear on.",
        "And what's the reasoning exactly, for, I realize it wasn't your reasoning, you were against this, but the idea was they were wearing an advertisement into the stadium.",
        "Yeah, because on the lederhosen, because there is Bavaria on the lederhosen, the FIFA says that this is not possible because Budweiser is our sponsor.",
        "And was that the principal reason you moved out there?",
        "Well did FIFA have a point here that perhaps one or two people wearing their orange lederhosen with lion's tails might be an individual choice, but hundreds, bordering on 1,000, would constitute a human advertisement for your beer, an advertisement that your brewery has not paid for?",
        "I can understand that if it was ambush marketing, if we are really distributing them at the stadiums, then I think the FIFA has rights, but now people are just buying a piece of clothes, like, it's the same, like for example, Adidas is the main sponsor of the FIFA and I have my Nike shoes on and I cannot go into the stadium because I have Nike shoes on.",
        "And in my opinion that's the same as, yeah, they are wearing Bavaria lederhosen, so why not going into the stadium with Bavaria lederhosen if you also can wear your Nike shoes?",
        "What do you think about the idea of people being required to go in in their underwear or not go in at all?",
        "Should FIFA be prepared with other, with substitute clothing for them to wear in that case or Adidas shorts or Budweiser shorts or something?",
        "Yeah, that would be a possibility, or for example that they ask people to take it off, but that people really can get it back after the game, and yeah, my opinion people paid for it in the supermarket so in fact, I literally seen it as a theft."
