        "Richard Florida, one of the things you say in your book is that, well, you could work in the software industry anywhere, but if you work in the software industry in Silicon Valley, you're going to make a lot more money.",
        "You will, and not only in initial pay.",
        "It's significantly percentage higher than most other average regions.",
        "But in terms of your career future, because - you know, the old saying was, if you work in Silicon Valley, you can change jobs by changing your parking space.",
        "And I think that gets it to the nub of the matter.",
        "It has what economists like to call a thick labor market.",
        "And so there's many jobs.",
        "And we know the average duration of a job for any American is about three years.",
        "So people are much more mobile between jobs.",

        "It may be that San Francisco, Silicon Valley, San Jose appear more expensive to buy into.",

        "He's the best real estate economist in the United States or the world.",
        "And he calls it one of his superstar cities.",
        "In other words, if you bought a home in Cincinnati or in Buffalo, it would stay the same value, maybe go up a little or go down a little.",
        "What he's shown over four decades is that homes in San Jose, even if they start off seemingly expensive, appreciate at a dramatic rate.",
        "Now, they go up down at different times, but the point is that that location decision is partly a career decision and partly a real estate investment decision.",
        "And it's not only that the cheapest - it's not always that the most affordable real estate is the best bet.",
        "For the real estate decision alone, it may be that that more expensive superstar market will pay off in the long run, as well.",
        "Heather, sounds like you made an interesting choice.",
        "We made a great choice.",
        "My husband's career, given his specialty, was not going to go anywhere in Chicago, and this was pretty much the only place where I could see it have taken off as well as it has.",
        "Well, good luck to you and to your husband.",
        "Well, thank you.",
        "Thanks very much for calling.",

        "But it also has a great lifestyle, an urban sustainability environmental ethos.",

        "We found that in our research.",
        "The cities where the natural environment worked in unison with the built environment, that's where people were really happy.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Charlotte, North Carolina is probably one of the most prosperous areas on the East Coast.",
        "We've got something like 3,000 people a month moving here from the Northeast.",

        "Plenty of jobs, banking town, lots of money.",

        "In fact, they've actually had Chamber of Commerce meetings where they pulled guys in from the university to talk about how they could finally get themselves an identity because this sprawl is taking away from us."

        "And what a remarkable change, though, that a Sun Belt megalopolis like Charlotte would be thinking about their image, thinking about how to become more compact, more effective in a more exciting urban destination, not just the fun-in-the-sun suburban destination.",
        "Yeah, but they have one problem that they can't seem to overcome, and that is that more development means larger tax pays and more money.",
        "So they continue to turn developers loose, and what that does is it continues to take personality away from the city itself.",
        "What we've seen where cities go far down that road, what happens now in Charlotte - and I'm not saying this is great - but they are growing enough that they can absorb development economically, even if it damages the amenity and the lifestyle.",
        "What happens, though, is when the growth stops, they continue to sprawl.",
        "And I have a friend who calls this \"\"sprawl without growth.\"\" And you see it happening in many places, continuing to sprawl and just moving people from one suburb to the next suburb like pieces on a chessboard.",
        "So I think you're right.",
        "I think what Portland did was have growth control and made sure that with growth control, they could have a more compact development, which has become a talent advantage and a quality of life advantage for them now."
