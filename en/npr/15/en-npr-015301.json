        "You know, I think it goes back to happily.",
        "And I think Malmo, Sweden probably has more in common with a Denver or a San Jose than it does with a rural area in the middle of America or Sweden.",
        "And I find this quite challenging because I do believe that our society is - my friend Bill Bishop wrote this remarkable book, \"\"The Big Sort.\"\" Our societies are sorting people with ambition, with means, with talent, are clustering in urban centers, and many other people are being left behind in more rural areas and parts of the country.",
        "So yes, I think we're talking about these mega-regions that are culturally and sociologically - not only economically similar, but they're similar in terms of lifestyle and people's attitude.",
        "So yes, I think it's easier, certainly than it was 20 or 30 years ago, to move across the peaks of the world economy.",
        "We're talking with Richard Florida about his book \"\"Who's Your City?: How the Creative Economy Is Making Where to Live the Most Important Decision of Your Life.\"\" And you're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",

        "Yes.",
        "And thank you so much for taking my call.",
        "I had something I wanted to say, but I wanted to preface this with I've lived in Denmark.",
        "I lived, actually, in North Aarhus.",
        "And you have to get used to living a good part of your life with no light, because come wintertime, the peak of winter, there is no light from morning until night.",
        "And part of the reason that I left Denmark was that there were certain things I could not acclimate.",
        "But this actually has nothing to do with why I called.",
        "I've just been sitting on the phone listening to you, I thought I would just comment that.",
        "And it's also a book that focuses on all - many of the world class writers that I interviewed.",
        "I've been privileged and lucky enough to interview - like you, of course, I interview different people everyday…",
        "I'm a medically trained massage therapist and moved to Hilton Head out in South Carolina because it is a resort area and it's very good for people who are very talented in massage and such.",
        "But I am spiritually starved, I am emotionally starved, I'm living in the White Bright capital of the United States, and it's all pretty and there's a lovely beach and people are polite.",
        "But there is a certain quality to life that I'm starving for that I'm not getting here.",
        "And I'm a person who grew up in Washington, D.C.",
        "A picture from me from the '60s is very well known.",
        "I'm the girl that's holding the flower when the soldiers are pointing their rifles at me.",
        "We've all seen that picture.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "But I'm somebody who's been very involved and who's been involved in political processes and this and that.",
        "And I do some community service here, but basically it's like beating my head against the wall to try and motivate people.",
        "People are very self-satisfied here.",

        "Making a good decision, do you think, Richard?",
        "I think Los Angeles would be a great place for you.",
        "And the book talks about these personality types, and we mentioned it a couple of minutes ago.",
        "But this young, fellow Jason Rentfrow(ph), he's truly a genius in psychology.",
        "We know that there are five personality types, and I know your one just listening to you.",
        "There's conscientious people, there's extroverts, there's agreeable people, there's emotionally stable or conversely neurotic people - you're not that.",
        "And there's a group of people who are many of the callers, called open to experience.",
        "Yes.",
        "Open to experience people, when we map them, and they're on the maps in the book at the web site.",
        "They are like pinpoints on a map of New York, Washington, Boston, Seattle, LA, San Francisco.",
        "Open to experience people need new energy.",
        "They need diverse experiences.",
        "They need to be about exciting environments naturally, socially.",
        "And what we're finding is that it's not like you're going out and saying, I want to find open to experience people.",
        "You're looking and searching for a place that has that environment with others like you.",
        "Los Angeles is one of the top destinations.",
        "And just finally, when you said light, one of the things we found is that so many people are drawn to natural environments that are not only light but have blues and greens.",
        "So from everything you're saying, you are an open to experience kind of person.",
        "And the other thing, finally, Neal, you'll get a kick out.",
        "Jason has identified the NPR listener as a specific subset of the open to experience person in his research.",
        "So I think the callers reflect that, but there are a group of regions that we talk about in the book that are a better fit.",
        "And although I like vacationing in Hilton, it is not the best for someone with your personality.",
        "Well, I have to bow to your wisdom because most of my life I've identified myself as more experiential.",
        "And I go in for the - I really try to dig in the meat of life.",
        "I really try to live life to the fullest, but with a conscience.",

        "We do have young children, and we like San Antonio, there's a lot to do here.",
        "But we find our kids - we have to drive 30, 40 minutes to get to a park that's shady and safe for them.",
        "And it is a big, sprawling city now.",
        "Where would you suggest that we look?",

        "But the key is, what's the place that fits you and your family best?",
        "And that's what we tried to do in the Place Finder.",
        "That's what we call questions.",
        "You take them, you put in some city names, some suburb names, and it tries to generate a profile of a place that you would like, possibly like, and fit the best."
