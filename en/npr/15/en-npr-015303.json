        "But it was on the order, if I remember correctly, of about a third of a grade, in difference between a B-plus and a B average for your freshman year.",
        "And, of course, that has longer term consequences if you've got a good roommate in terms of studious habits and high school GPA versus a less studious roommate, let's say, who is a binge drinker.",

        "So you would add - that's perhaps the selfish reason you advocate that other universities follow the lead of Hamilton College where roommate choice is not allowed.",
        "Oh, for my selfish reasons but also for the experience of the kids themselves.",
        "This research is ongoing with other folks.",
