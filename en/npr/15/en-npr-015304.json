        "Well, let's see how it goes.",
        "I know you are a great admirer of the novelist Saul Bellow.",
        "And when you were in college, you went to Chicago to see the great man.",
        "Tell us about that very first interview.",
        "Well, I was young and I was very impressionable, and Bello was a mentor to me.",
        "I wanted to be Saul Bellow.",
        "I've said, at that time, I would settle to be a younger son or a brother, or even poor cousin.",
        "Hitchhiked from Athens, Ohio to Chicago and got to see him through a series of sort of strange circumstances.",
        "And he was kind to me.",
        "And from that point forward, I decided - I wanted to try to see what it meant, in Bellow's terms, to be a good man and live a good life.",
        "And that became a very important quest for me.",
        "Because I've been a bad boy and ran with what Billy Joel would call the wild boys…",
        "Hmm.",
        "…through the younger years of my life.",
        "And so, Bellow was a major impact on me.",
        "Interestingly, in response to one of your questions, he went into a rant against literary critics - and, of course, you noted that at that time, you were hoping to become a literary critic.",
        "But he says to you, when I wrote \"\"Henderson the Rain King,\"\" they said I had written a Nietzschean novel or some said Reichean or Hegelian or Freudian.",
        "What do they know, really?",
        "Suddenly, he broke into a boyish, nearly furtive-looking grin and added, me, I'm not telling.",
        "Oh, that was so characteristic of Bellow.",
        "He was, in many ways, boyish like I tried to describe him, almost mischievous and impish in some ways.",
        "But he was also probably - easily one of best writers.",
        "I mean, along with Faulkner, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a major…",
        "Hmm.",
        "…figure of that stature in the 20th century.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "You then go on, of course, to become, well, a student of literature and a teacher of English literature; go on to become a professor at San Francisco State University, though, the story of your interview for the job, when you were at - in Illinois, in Carbondale, what happened is a pretty interesting story.",
        "It's a pretty funny story, and I like to think there's a lot of humor in this book.",
        "Adam Hochschild, the founder of Mother Jones, is a friend of mine who read this book in its galley form, said, there are a lot of funny stories, but two that are definitely worth the price of admission.",
        "And that story is one of them.",
        "Should I give it away here, or…"

        "Oh, I think you'd better sell it.",
        "Sell it, Michael.",
        "Not used to vending when we work in public radio, are we?",
        "It's actually is a story in which I took a couple of airlines to do this first job interview for an academic position.",
        "Didn't think I really wanted this job, but nevertheless, I didn't have any other offers at the time.",
        "And I went there and suddenly found myself surrounded very solemnly by other professors who are offering me an assistant professorship.",
        "And the flying, which could have been routed from, well, Madison to Hong Kong, what was to…",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "…at Carbondale.",
        "And - what I call rancid lasagna and a lot of drinking, and so forth.",
        "They offered me the job and I got up and bolted, and it was like something out of, I guess, a Ben Stiller movie, because I was throwing up in the chairman's toilet.",
        "And then, what happened after that was the toilet overflowed.",
        "And I asked readers, what do you do in a situation like this?",
        "You got people who are waiting for you, you know, to offer you this - thrown, almost, as the way they were offering it.",
        "And you're there and this water is seeping out under the door.",
        "So I said, well, I did what I thought was - I heard my mother's voice saying, go back and tell the truth, and I did.",
        "And that led into the chairman of the department telling his son to mop it up -and I wouldn't hear this, because after all, I've made the mess.",
        "So, we were struggling for the mop.",
        "And this was my first academic offer - struggling for a mop and the chairman bringing the bucket and finally resting the mop away from his son and doing the work myself.",
        "And here's part of what our listeners had to say, people who heard that interview.",
        "Ray Craig(ph) said, \"\"I wish him the best and hope we get to hear a positive update before long.\"\" Sandra Duncan(ph) said, \"\"Imagine a veteran having to think about leaving the country just to find a job.\"\" And a reader named Drew listened and said, \"\"I just want Mr. Smith to know that my heart goes out to him and I hope his situation improves.",
        "And I should say this week, we're looking for people who have actually found bright spots in the economy, folks who are actually making more money than they were before.",
        "And they can go to our blog and share their story with us.",
        "Are these the stories that are dominating the blog, or are there others as well?",
        "There are others.",
        "There's one story in particular about a Georgia lawmaker who wants the state's university system to consider merging historically black public colleges with nearby white institutions to save money.",
        "The move would effectively merge Albany State and Savannah State with other neighbors.",
        "And Bill M.",
        "wrote in our blog, \"\"I'm not saying HBCUs should be immune to the current economic conditions, but it just seems odd that the greatest sacrifices are being asked of the schools least able to sacrifice.\"\" And Matthew Scallen(ph) said, \"\"If we're holding out the separate programs just out of a sense of racial pride, there's not much difference between that and Jim Crow.",
        "I think we're going to be taking a closer look at that topic on tomorrow's show.",
        "But I also understand though, Geoff, that YouTube Channel - our YouTube Channel is becoming very popular."
