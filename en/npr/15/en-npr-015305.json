        "So what about the ways that people were hired?",
        "You had people leaving the Department of Justice, what was the new crop of people who generally came in?",
        "Well, I didn't have anything to do with the hiring process, didn't know very much about what went on with that.",
        "But I do know that for years our attorneys were hired under the attorney general's Honors Program and that they came from top-flight law schools and usually had some civil rights experience or at least an interest in enforcing civil rights law.",

        "They're not from very good law schools and they have no interest in civil rights enforcement.",

        "I got a lot of high-fives, people, you know, telling me they were very appreciative that I did that.",
        "But my supervisors disabled my computer the next day so that I would not be able to send out any more emails.",
        "And finally, how do you think that the low number of black attorneys and perhaps the dwindling number of civil rights analysts could affect the voting rights of African-Americans?",
        "Oh God, I think it'll be catastrophic.",
        "I mean, for years - 40 years -minorities, especially blacks in the South, depended on the Justice Department to do the right thing.",
        "I mean, if they didn't have the money to file lawsuits against discriminatory voting changes, they knew that it had to go through the Justice Department and that they there had a chance, that they could provide information, and that we - I still consider myself them - the Justice Department would do the right thing.",
        "Now they don't have that.",
        "They have nobody to call to give information to.",
        "The people that they would call, most of them have retired.",
        "Those that are there are too intimidated by the management to do anything.",

        "Over the past five fiscal years, approximately 27 percent of the new attorney hires in the Civil Rights Division were minorities.",
        "This has nearly tripled the national average as reported in a 2004 study by the American Bar Association, which found that minority representation in the legal profession is only about 9.7 percent.",
        "This administration has promoted as many minorities to section management positions in the civil rights division in six years as the previous administration did in eight years.",
        "This administration has promoted two minority section chiefs, including the first Hispanic section chief in the division's 50-year history.",

        "So we went back last week to check out a special exhibit - a rare Bible on loan from Fisk University that was published by British missionaries in the 1800s to convert and educate slaves, or, perhaps, a better word would be indoctrinate them.",
        "If you look here at this - the card here, that's the actual title, \"\"Parts Of The Holy Bible, Selected For Use Among Negro Slaves, In The British West-India Islands\"\" (ph).",

        "The first instance that we know of, that it was published was 1807.",
        "And it was intended for use among enslaved Africans in the British West Indies, which is modern-day Caribbean, so Jamaica, Barbados, Antigua.",
        "But what's unique about it is that it's an abridged version of the Bible.",
