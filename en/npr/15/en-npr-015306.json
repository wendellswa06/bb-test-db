        "And frankly, I think even though we're not the highest paid people when it comes to the world of radio and - think - I was calculating when Howard Stern was named to be a host at Sirius, he signed a contract of five years for $500 million.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And at that point, I had been on Sirius five years and hadn't received a check yet from them.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "So there's the kind of metaphoric difference between what we do and what they do out there.",
        "But I love talk radio in public form that we're doing now, and it's certainly a great passion, and has answered many of those feelings that I had about wanting to do something to serve the public.",
        "Let's see if we can get a caller on the line, and this is Vic(ph) and Vic is calling us from Oakland, California, across the bay.",

        "You do a terrific job.",
        "And there's a television program produced by KQED that in my opinion has a terribly talentless interviewer.",
        "So, I wish you could go to the television side as well.",
        "Well, that's kind of you.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I've done television, both in public television and commercial television.",
        "But I was selected for this job by trying out for it, by auditioning.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, it's one of the distinctions between commercial and non-commercial broadcasting, though not everybody in non-commercial broadcasting reads the books, and I suppose there are some people in commercial broadcasting who do read the books.",

        "And Michael, I wanted to ask you about an interview you did with Isaac Bashevis Singer - this is before you were on the radio.",
        "It was on stage, and you asked him a lot of questions about winning the Nobel Prize for literature and many other things.",
        "And then, at one point you say, do you believe in free will?",
        "And Singer replies, I have no choice.",
        "It wasn't until over a year later, you write, that I read in a literary journal the transcript of an interview in which he offered the same identical quip.",
        "And you wonder at that point, should you not flatter yourself about asking so many questions when you're just eliciting quips, pre-boiler played quips from authors.",

        "And I think - I'm sure you've encountered it.",

        "Yeah.",
        "You think you're the catalyst because you are doing your job as an interlocutor and, you know, your high energy and you're offering all of the things that you've prepared diligently into the interview and mixing it all up, and then you get this very clever response or this response that seems so sui generis and original and all that, and you hear it again in another interview with the same person or you read it in the transcript like I did.",
        "And this has, of course, occurred a number of times during my career and it's understandable.",
        "I mean, why wouldn't people use compost in terms of the quips that they have or the anecdotes that they tell?"

        "One thing that Terry Gross does do is she greatly prefers that her guests not be in the same studio with her.",

        "But my question to both of you is how do you see and perceive the differences in both commercial and public radio over the last 25 years?",
        "Because when I was in radio back 25 years ago, all the old jocks and personalities were saying to me, oh, it's not like it used to be and so on and so forth.",

        "So, Michael?",
        "Well, commercial radio has many good things about it, but it's pretty much now - and I write about this as I say in a kind of miniature cultural history, it's pretty much now personality and opinions, and a lot of about that demagoguery and bloviating as well.",
        "What we try to do in public radio is very different, and what we try to do is bring you at least some element of impartiality, certainly thoughtful analysis, different points of view, knowledge and less entertainment, more knowledge perhaps - though we like to entertain you as well.",
        "When I was in public - excuse me, I mean, commercial broadcasting, the emphasis was on infotainment - a terrible word - but that's what kept being emphasized.",
