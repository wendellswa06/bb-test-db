        "Yes.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "You're on the air.",
        "Okay.",
        "A pleasure to talk to both of you at the same time.",
        "My question is around how do you guys feel about having to maintain neutrality, I mean, having both sides of the argument represented?",
        "Sometimes, it's balanced, but sometimes, it's painfully not, and one side is obviously winning or, you know, talking nonsense sometimes.",
        "And you have to still respect, I suppose (unintelligible).",
        "I just wonder how do you feel about it.",
        "It sometimes gets for the listener boring or aggravating.",

        "Well, I'll weigh in.",
        "And the fact is that I work for NPR News.",
        "And my training is as a journalist and that's what I spent my entire broadcast career doing and what I've done out of broadcast, too.",
        "So it's not - I don't think it's boring being - trying to be fair and objective, giving everybody a chance to say their point of view.",
        "That's my creed.",
        "That's what I do.",
        "That's in my blood.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And mine as well.",
        "But it's sometimes very difficult.",
        "And to be objective is sometimes an impossibility, just because we use language.",
        "So you do the best you can to be accurate, to be precise, to be thoughtful and to be illuminating.",
        "And if you could be all of those things, then I think you're acting in the best public interest.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "Thank you, indeed.",
        "Let's - I wanted to ask you - before we completely run out of time, I wanted to ask you about some of the authors that you've talked to.",
        "And one of the people - you've clearly talked to several of these writers several times, for example, Joyce Carol Oates, who you write about.",
        "These are not just transcripts of your interviews, but your impressions of these writers sometimes over the years.",
        "And it's interesting, you write, I remember, too, the flash of anger at me on stage when I said others view her work as depressing.",
        "Brecht's words: the man who laughs has not yet been told the terrible news could be hers.",
        "It's difficult to sustain relationships with people you've come to regard or you hope to regard as your friend, sometimes.",
        "That indeed is the case.",
        "I think that's well stated.",
        "I do a lot of interviewing on stage as you've indicated.",
        "And Stanford University Press, my publisher, talks about these portraits of writers as vignettes.",
        "And that was a vignette within a vignette.",
        "I was talking to Joyce Carol Oates, and I like to say we're old dancing partners because we have done a number of interviews through the years together and, you know, she's written a lot of books.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think the last one was her 45th.",
        "And I just said to her, I had seen this Francis Bacon exhibit at the museum here in San Francisco and said to her, you know, Bacon's work is depressing, but it's enlivening and so forth, and it makes me see in different ways.",
        "And there are a lot of people who feel your work is depressing, and I think she was quite defensive about that and felt a little stung by it.",
        "She's even written essays to the effect that she doesn't like to be called depressing because - read the news.",
        "That's why I quoted Brecht.",
        "There was also a moment with her on the air actually when I mentioned her literary agent who had died, and it was sort of at the end of the program.",
        "And she actually just became totally mute and started sobbing.",
        "And I was actually holding her in my arms.",
        "It was one of those moments listeners said, what happened?",
        "You know, they just heard dead air.",
        "They didn't have any idea what it was, but that's what it was.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Let's see if we can go to Mary(ph).",
        "Mary is on the phone with us from Traverse City in Michigan.",

        "And I have a question.",
        "Is there anyone that you wouldn't want to interview if you were asked to do it?",
        "Is there anybody that you really would try to refuse or not want to do?",
        "Yeah, I think there are some people who probably don't deserve to have the airwaves because they're bigoted or because they're racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic.",
        "I've interviewed people like that.",
        "I write about interviewing Tom Metzger, for example, and I write about some of those experiences when I was in commercial broadcasting.",
        "Think of a past-tense verb.",
        "But I don't feel that people, particularly these kind of extremist views, necessarily have any real right to the airwaves except if they are going to come on and say things in a reasonable way.",
        "Now, you may say how can you make that subjective judgment?",
        "I think it's an easy judgment to make in many cases of how not bigotry is pretty transparent and clear.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Also, perhaps another category, charlatans.",
        "Yeah, one has to be on the guard for that.",
        "You know as well as I do, Neal, that you get inundated with requests - and some of them seemed fascinating - by authors and by people who are out there in the public relations machinery.",
        "And suddenly, you're looking at something and it seems like a magic bullet or it seems like a way to navigate through one of our social problems.",
        "And one has to really take stock and be as reflective as you can be because there are certainly a lot of charlatans out there.",

        "Well, a lot of guests surprised me, and I write about this - for example, you know, we all, who do this work, have various kinds of war stories of one sort or another.",
        "And there are - David Byrne comes to mind instantly because he's such a talented musician and lyricist.",
        "And he was very reticent and almost non-communicative on the air with me.",
        "And I still don't understand why, except that, you know, maybe he was just a shy person or not inclined to be as talkative as people are when they come on a radio program.",
        "I was surprised, and I write about it by a very touching moment I had the actor Billy Dee Williams, who is on with me and who showed a great deal of emotion.",
        "His mother had just died.",
        "He, too, had been very reticent, and I hadn't expected that think kind of reticence.",
        "And you feel like you're pulling teeth.",
        "And suddenly, find out that the man's mother had just died - a lot of those kinds of moments.",

        "He was austere and he was condescending and he was, well, probably somewhat inebriated, and it was the most unpleasant interview beforehand.",
