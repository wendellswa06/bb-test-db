        "Okay.",

        "He's a Berkeley professor.",
        "He's a member of the National Academy of Science.",
        "He's certainly a man of many bona fides.",
        "But he's a man who, as a virologist, said that HIV was not a virus, and took great exception to it and said that many of the researchers - indicted many of the leading researchers - people like David Baltimore and others who were working on behalf of ameliorating the HIV problem.",
        "Mm-hmm, indeed.",
        "Okay, well, maybe that wasn't the right word.",
        "It's contentious.",
        "But, yeah, there's a lot of people that are disappointed with Duesberg.",
        "And one of the great things that I love about your show is how you don't insert, you know, you don't insert yourself into someone else's story and let them tell their story beautifully.",
        "Michael Zielenziger comes to mind, you know, his book, \"\"Shutting Out the Sun.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "And I thought there was an absolutely great interview because he had a lot to say.",
        "And he said, you let him say it and then - but then you also came in with very a succinct question that - then took him onto another of part.",
        "And that's what I find as the greatest part of your show is that people can really stretch out intellectually.",
        "Well, thank you.",
        "I'm grateful for your comments and I appreciate them.",
        "A lot of what - and I don't know if you feel this way, Neal - but a lot of what we do is really listening, facilitating and educating, and also letting people tell their stories, as opposed to maybe telling our own stories, as I do in this book.",
        "Yeah.",

        "The - we actually did a couple of interviews with him through the years.",
        "But the interesting thing about that interview, I think for me, personally, was the fact that we could connect in different ways and could do it without necessarily becoming too esoteric, which is a danger when you've got a couple of guys from the same…",

        "She wrote \"\"The Modern Jewish Girl's Guide to Guilt,\"\" and for this week's book segment, NPR's Karen Grigsby Bates talked to Ellenson about everything from pedicures on Yom Kippur to divorcing the perfect Jewish man.",
        "Here's her report.",
        "Meet Ruth Ellenson.",
        "Between the ideal of who you should be and the reality of who you are lies guilt, and when you're Jewish, there's no shortage of people who are willing to point out just how guilty you should feel.",
        "Families, rabbis and communities happily, but perhaps not so helpfully, are all too eager to bring it to your attention, or you can even agonize over it yourself.",
        "For me, it often takes the form of the following internal reprimand: Jews have barely managed to survive for thousands of years, and you, you little pisher, are going to make one bad mistake and screw it up for everybody.",
        "Or maybe just enlighten everybody.",
        "Ellenson is the daughter of a rabbi and a Christian convert to Judaism.",
        "Ironically, the idea for the book on Jewish guilt came to Ellenson in the middle of the Methodist service she attended with her maternal grandmother.",
        "And I was sitting in church, watching her sing in the choir, and thinking, `What on earth am I doing here?",
        "and the delight I saw in her face by my presence was mitigated by my own guilt for sitting in front of a giant crucifix, and those divided loyalties very much inform who I am and how I approach my religious identity, which I imagine they do for many modern people.",
        "When she returned home, Ellenson contacted Jewish women writers she admired to ask them to contribute essays on this inner conflict.",
        "To her delight, nearly all of them jumped at the chance, and she ended up with an assortment of intriguing essays.",
        "That spanned the range from writers like Tova Mirvis, who's an Orthodox Jewish woman who writes beautifully about the Orthodox and Ultra-Orthodox world, talking about how, for her, guilt isn't induced by an individual relationship with God, but rather by a community that always watches and judges, to writers like Rebecca Walker, who is of African-American and Jewish parentage.",
        "The book is full of such tugs.",
        "Katie Roiphe writes about her feminist mother's campaign to make her a suspiciously retro wife and mother.",
        "Daphne Merkin sheepishly reveals how a slow-drawing pedicure made her miss Yom Kippur services.",
        "And Kyra Bolinick(ph) discusses how her mother came to terms with having a lesbian daughter.",
        "What happens is that Kyra's mother comes to accept it for herself, but worries about the judgment of her community that she lives in.",
        "And when she discovers that her community actually isn't going to be judgmental and that everyone in her Yiddish club that she goes to actually also has a gay child, it somehow makes it OK for her to accept it.",
        "So not only--it's a particularly poignant example of how a community influences what we do and don't feel guilty about."
