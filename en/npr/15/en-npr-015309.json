        "So the missionary society for the conversion of Negro slaves in the British West Indies was founded - or you might say refounded - in 1794.",
        "Originally, it had been aimed at the conversion and education of Native Americans.",
        "After the revolution, however, that - those ties broke off, so they were looking for different avenues to direct that revenue.",
        "So what was the intention, though, in excising the Bible so - or editing it, or I might say censoring it...",
        "Right.",
        "...So heavily?",
        "What was their intent?",
        "There are several theories and several - there are several layers to this, the first one being that most of the planter class in the West Indies were opposed to missionary work among enslaved Africans there on their land.",
        "And so this can be seen as an attempt to appease the planter class, saying, look.",
        "We're coming here.",
        "We want to help uplift, materially, these Africans here.",
        "But we're not going to be teaching them anything that could incite rebellion.",
        "And so coming in and being able to educate African slaves would prepare them one day for freedom but, at the same time, would not cause them to seek it more aggressively.",
        "The sense that I get - this comes with a video where there are students at Fisk encountering the text.",
        "And this - also, the exhibit has a place for people to reflect on the text.",
        "The sense I get from some of the people is that they're shocked.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They are shocked...",

        "I was talking with a person who was looking at the text.",
        "And they kind of verbalized it for me - is that I can't believe it was printed like this.",
        "Like, it wasn't taking a razor blade or anything like that.",
        "It was actually printed like this.",
        "And knowing that - the intentions behind it - so, yeah.",
        "That is shocking.",
        "I wonder if this is going to change something for people.",
        "Does this change something for you, knowing that what was delivered to certain people is different from what you received, right?",
        "Right.",
        "I wonder.",
        "Does that change something for people?",
        "I hope...",
        "I'm asking you to speculate...",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, one of the points of the exhibit is that, you know, time and place really shape how people encounter the Bible.",
        "And what I mean by that is people don't look at the Bible or approach the Bible or read the Bible in a vacuum.",
        "They're shaped by their social and economic context.",
        "And what's - your coming from this different from what other people are going to be coming from.",
        "And so I - if anything, I hope people take take away a greater appreciation for that, maybe even self-reflection, to be more cognizant of why you read something a certain way.",
        "And if people can better appreciate that, maybe they can better empathize with others."
