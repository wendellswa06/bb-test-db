        "In 1992, Congress created a system that would have been much more comprehensive.",
        "It's called the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System, in government acronyms speak NMVTIS.",
        "But NMVTIS has been crippled and consumer advocate say one big reason is opposition from commercial interests that wanted it to fail.",
        "That opposition showed up in the form of bills introduced in Congress that would have made NMVTIS much less effective.",
        "One allowed states to opt out of the program.",
        "If just a few states pulled out of NMVTIS, that would have given scam artists a place to wash titles.",
        "Bill Brock from the Iowa AG's office says those legislative efforts were led by the largest auto insurer in the country, State Farm.",
        "They were very, very active back in the mid and late 1990s in proposing the federal legislation that would cap what the states could do and, in our view, weaken the laws that are out there.",
        "Those bills did not pass, but NMVITAS never got the money it needed to be effective.",
        "Some consumer advocates suspect State Farm was working behind the scenes to undercut the program, but they don't have hard evidence.",
        "But Kansas City attorney Bernard Brown believes State Farm did have a motive for opposing a system that would reveal every car's history.",
        "They've had a very lucrative business selling their totaled cars.",
        "But a big part of why it's been lucrative is that they've sold them, a lot of them, with clean titles.",
        "And the actors were able to channel their emotions through to the puppets there.",
        "They remind me of each other.",
        "Well, I'm thinking about another Republican senator, Lindsey Graham, who has been notably supportive of the president after being notably critical of him during the presidential campaign.",
        "He gave an interview to The New York Times recently in which he said, not for the first time, that he supports President Trump 'cause he wants to be relevant, wants to get things that he thinks are important for the country.",
        "Also acknowledged that he wants to get re-elected, and there are a lot of Trump supporters out there.",
        "How reluctant are Republicans to cross the president, even at this moment when he's very unpopular?",
        "Well, it depends on what state they're in and how red and Republican it is.",
        "But just before we go, very important to note that the president has said he will veto it if it gets to his desk.",
        "And it's not clear that there are really enough people of either party to add up to a veto-proof majority."

        "So wow - you have almost as many mayoral candidates as there are potential presidential candidates in 2020.",

        "Last time was 2011, when Rich Daley chose not to run for re-election.",
        "But had Rahm Emanuel actually chosen to run again, there were several candidates already lining up against him feeling he was vulnerable, particularly because of the fallout of the Laquan McDonald case.",
        "You remember, Laquan was the 17-year-old who was shot and killed by a police officer.",
        "The trials of the police officer just happened last fall.",
        "Many people are unhappy with it, even though he was convicted with a sentence.",
        "So when Rahm got out of the race, even more candidates jumped in, including Bill Daley, as you mentioned, and a couple of other local political heavyweights - Toni Preckwinkle, who's president of the Cook County Board and chair of the county Democratic Party, Suzanna Mendoza, who's the state comptroller and has some labor support behind her, as does Preckwinkle.",

        "Sounds like police conduct is quite central to this campaign.",
        "It's a really big issue, and it's a really big issue particularly among younger voters, who have kind of rallied and mobilized and tried to recruit people to register to vote.",
        "They turned out in very strong numbers in the November midterm elections, and the turnout for this election is a little questionable.",
        "Steve Valles is with Chicago Votes, which is a nonpartisan group that works to engage young adults in politics.",
        "If young people turn out and vote, we could elect the most progressive mayor in Chicago's history.",
        "Although, of course, Chicagoans could also elect another Daley.",
        "We're curious, David, when a Daley is running, do they just use the same Daley signs, campaign signs, around town they've been using since the 1950s?",
        "No.",
        "No. See, they have a lot of money behind by these candidacies so they're able to print up new signs every election.",
        "So none of them are faded.",
        "And there is kind of a trend here.",
        "Even Bill Daley is trying to almost out-progressive some of the other candidates in this race, trying to make him seem not as much like his father and his brother, who many people feel left the city with a legacy of inequality across the city and even racism, as many cities in the North do.",
        "But, you know, all of the candidates are kind of trying to out-progressive one another.",
        "Be - you know, shoulder progressive credentials.",
        "And it's part of this trend that the Democratic Party is experiencing all across the country, as we saw in the November midterms.",
        "This could just echo those very similar themes across the country.",
