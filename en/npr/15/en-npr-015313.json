        "OK.",
        "How did you stumble on the idea?",
        "It's serendipitous indeed.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I - a few years ago, in 2004, I had a little extra time, and I had a little extra money, and I wanted an adventure.",
        "And a friend suggested I log-on to EarthWatch.org and see what kind of studies they had people participating in.",
        "Basically you pay an amount of money and you get to work with scientists or conservationists.",
        "And so I chose Sri Lanka.",
        "It's always fascinated me, and the civil war was in a ceasefire then.",
        "And I've always been fascinated by monkeys, so I got to indulge my sort of Jane Goodall fantasies.",
        "And what they were doing there?",
        "What were you observing?",
        "They are - Dr. Wolfgang Dittus and his team has been observing Toque Macaques in Polonnaruwa, which is an ancient capital of Sri Lanka, for - it's about 40 years now, I think.",
        "Yeah, next year it'll be 40 years."

        "It'll be 40 years.",
        "And they track 20 to 30 troops of Toque Macaques in the site, and you know, tell their stories and track, you know, if they're expanding their territory or what the genealogies of the monkeys are and...",
        "Well, what made you decide to write a play about what was going on there and...",
        "Well, a few things.",
        "I was overwhelmed with the place.",
        "It's a really magical place.",
        "There's all these overlapping layers of wonderment there.",
        "They're historical ruins and there's the sense of history there, and then there is the science study and the scientists observing monkeys, and then there are these monkeys living very much in their wild state there, which is different than how the monkeys in the cities of Sri Lanka live, and it was just magnificent.",
        "And you chose to concentrate on a couple of different themes in the play.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "One theme was how the scientists almost - they make a monkey out of the scientists.",
        "Scientists actually start behaving like the monkeys they're observing.",
        "Well, I'm definitely hoping that instead of a one-to-one ratio between scientists and monkeys, there's a sort of creative tension of how much are the monkeys and the scientists alike.",
        "I do have the monkeys played by the scientists, using puppets, and each scientist plays the monkey that is perhaps closest to him or herself in status within a troop.",
        "But there's definitely differences, and there's many ways humans are like monkeys, and many ways we're not.",
        "And so by having one actor play both, I'm hoping to maybe explore and open up questions about how much we are alike and we're not.",
        "And you also talk about the friction within science between scientists and critical of each other's work.",
        "I definitely have observed that.",
        "There's - the site is sort of cut off from the rest of the city, this monkey camp, so it's definitely sort of a hothouse of conflict and discussion, and it's really exciting to be in the presence of that."

        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "You bring up a very important issue about whether these scientists who are observing the monkeys are actually doing real science or not.",
        "You bring in a Russian competitor to the science who's observing.",
        "Right.",
        "And he says this is not laboratory stuff.",
        "You can't make any real conclusions just by watching monkeys.",
        "Well, I do think there is a question of how soft the science is with long-term observation.",
        "It's not repeatable.",
        "The data is all filtered through a human writing down what he or she sees.",
        "And I think the world is a much richer place for the observational science of the past few generations -the Jane Goodalls and the Dian Fosseys - but it definitely is very anecdotal.",
        "It's a lot about specific animals you see and how you interpret what they've done or how they're behaving",
        "Mm-hmm, Dr. Melnick, what do you think of the play, I mean in terms of accuracy, and what was your role exactly ensuring that it was close…",
        "It's actually - giving another example of serendipity, I had actually worked in Polonnaruwa 20 years before David arrived there, and I worked there on a number of occasions in the 1980s.",
        "It's an extraordinary place from a scientific point of view, because it is by far the longest-running continuous observational study of primates.",
        "It'll be 40 years next year.",
        "It's an extraordinary accomplishment to be able to run a project like that for 40 years.",
        "The one thing I would possibly take exception what David is saying is that, yes, it is a question of your doing individual observations of each animal, but when you spread it out over 40 years and over 30 groups and you individually identify every single monkey, and you're collecting data on many of them from the day they were born until the day they died, you have a collection - you might say it's anecdotes, but a lot of people say statistic is - statistics are just a very large collection of anecdotes.",
        "You have such an enormous data set that you can begin to see patterns in that data set.",
        "It begins to approach what you would get in a very carefully controlled laboratory study, because one of the advantages of a laboratory study is the immensity of the data you can collect, but - and you could not really do that on most primates because they live a long time.",
        "But in this case, if you run a study for 40 years, you can begin to collect that kind of data and begin to see patterns.",
        "Now, to me the interesting - obviously the interesting tension there is one scientist, or set of scientists, who believes that, you know, much of what happens in terms of dominance arch and who's dominant and who is not is contextual, it's sort of nature, it's the environment you're in and the interactions you have, and another coming in and saying, no, you know, basically giving a presentation of the biological determinist point of view: no, there are genes in there, and that animal would have become dominant no matter what, in what environment.",
        "So there is this tension between that.",
        "But I think what David pointed out is really true.",
        "All science is done by people, and so it doesn't matter what science you're engaged in, you're going to bring a certain level of bias to what you're doing.",
        "It doesn't matter whether it's laboratory science or field science, just the questions you're asking are going to somewhat reflect that bias.",
        "But the other interesting part about field research is if you think about it, it's a disparate group of people who are suddenly put into a very small, confined space, and who are interacting with each other almost on a 24-hour basis..."

        "...create the social, sexual tension that goes on there.",
        "It's interesting, because I found myself, when I was there watching both the scientists and the monkeys, so I sort of wanted to have the observers be observed.",
        "And through the documentary filmmakers who come to make a documentary about the monkeys, we get some of those themes into the play.",

        "I congratulate you.",
        "I have a quote from the play that says, if I can read my handwriting: Hot people and cool animals; that's what people like.",
        "And that's what you gave them.",
        "Well, yeah, it's cute animals, not cool animals."

        "I'm sorry.",
        "It's similar.",
        "Yeah, those are - that's a rather cynical point of view from the documentary filmmaker, but I think the environmental movement has been very canny about using cute and cool animals as their sort of spokes-animals to help save the ones that maybe aren't so cute to us.",
        "And you made that point in the play that - one of the characters say, we need this to preserve these animals.",
        "If we don't get the public attention from the documentary we can make about the hot people and the cute animals, you're not going to get your funding or the public attention.",
        "I met a scientist there in Sri Lanka who very impassioned - a very impassioned woman - who said that scientists now can't afford to do what Dr. Dittus did 40 years ago because she said the natural world's on fire, which is a line that now is in the play.",
        "She said we all have to become activists now, we have to fight to save these species, we can't just have the luxury of sitting in the woods and watching them.",
        "And so whether that's true or not, that's definitely a point of view that threads its way through the play.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "Yes, go ahead.",
        "I was just going to say that, again, on that theme of serendipity, that it - I had spent about 15 years of my career doing basic science research, doing basic genetic work on various species.",
        "It was actually on my way to the Polonnaruwa site that I had an experience that really transformed what I was doing and really I begin to apply my science to conservation.",
        "So it's very much so, when David used the words in one of his characters that the world is on fire, how could we just focus on just what these animals are doing instead of the larger context.",
        "We were traveling into the Polonnaruwa site on a road, and we were going down this road, and all of a sudden I - an elephant came out from this dry forest that exists in that area and just began browsing along the side - we stopped our jeep.",
        "We were bringing provisions in for months, and we stopped our jeep, we were just sitting there watching it.",
        "It was a beautiful thing to do.",
        "And these elephants are known to do - people who've watched elephants - they can just fade off into the brush almost before your eyes.",
        "And this elephant eventually did that and faded, and then we went into the - up to the camp, we worked for about three months, and we were on our way back to get more provisions, to the capital, and came to the area, and the whole area was gone.",
        "It had all been cut, burned, gone, all animals gone.",
        "And at that moment I thought, you know, I can't do this anymore.",
        "I can't just do my basic science research.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "There has to be an applied part of this that's dealing with habitat preservation and species preservation.",
        "Otherwise all I'm doing is bearing witness to the end.",
        "I'm not really making a contribution and not really - in some ways, all I'm doing is taking from nature for my own career, but not putting anything back in.",
        "Did you feel, when you were writing this play, that you had to make a statement like that, like he is saying?",
        "Or were you more interested in just a theatrical..."
