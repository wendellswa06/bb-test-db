        "And does he come across as a sympathetic figure to you?",
        "Well I - with the material I have that Peter has provided - that the transcript has provided - I certainly want to strike those chords that will elicit as much sympathy as you can.",
        "But you also have to realize that in this country I think the majority of people of our population - as opposed to I think the rest of the western world - believe in creationism.",
        "And so you can't - you can't present enough of the Scopes Trial, \"\"The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial, or \"\"Inherit the Wind\"\" as a means of education because we are - in terms of our populous - I think way behind the rest of the world in acknowledging Darwinism and acknowledging evolution.",

        "I would say they root for me but they understand and they ache as I could possibly ache.",
        "I'm just finishing this phenomenal book called \"\"David and Solomon\"\" about the manufacturing of the Davidic myth throughout the centuries.",
        "And it's a phenomenal and wonderful lineage and history to believe in, as is all faith and religion."
