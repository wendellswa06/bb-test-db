        "In this time when a woman really couldn't get a formal education - although women were allowed to go into Charles Wilson Peale's Museum and get an informal one - sometimes they didn't even own clothing, a married woman couldn't own property, what kind of influence could a woman have on politics?",

        "They wrote letters to each other that they knew would be published.",
        "And so they were formal and pompous.",
        "And the letters they wrote to women were filled with their hopes and dreams and fears and ambitions.",
        "They were much more ambitious in their letters to the women.",
        "And the women's letters to each other about them are the best of all because, you know, we think of these men as some sort of stone and bronze deities, and you can be sure their wives did not think of them that way.",
        "So we do - we see the founders as much more flesh and blood human beings through the letters of the women.",
        "Today it's possible to instantly see Michelle Obama, Cindy McCain, how they behave, how others analyze their behavior, their dress, how they interact with their husbands, their families, the voters.",

        "Yeah, he is little and that's one of the surprising things.",
        "It doesn't seem like he'd be so menacing, but they have quite an appetite for small juvenile mussels.",
        "The Asian shore crab was first reported on the Atlantic coast in New Jersey in 1988.",
        "In the two decades since, the crabs have migrated north to Penobscot Bay in Maine and south to North Carolina.",
        "Byers and his student, Aaren Freeman, found that as the crabs have worked their way up and down the coast the mussels have evolved a way to fend them off - and they've done it in the blink of an evolutionary eye.",
        "Freeman says that when mussels sense crabs nearby they will thicken their shells.",
        "Mr. AAREN FREEMAN (Student, University of New Hampshire): And that then benefits the mussel by making them less susceptible to predation from the crab.",
        "The crab usually accesses its prey by crushing the shell.",
        "The thickening process takes a few months and it's a drain on the mussel, costing it energy that could go toward reproduction.",
        "To save energy, the thickening process is like a switch.",
        "When crabs are around, mussels flip the switch on.",
        "If the mussels don't sense crabs, they leave the switch off.",
        "Scientists have long known that mussels could thicken their shells in response to other varieties of crabs, but what they didn't know was that the mussels could rapidly evolve the same response to a new crab predator.",
        "Freeman argues that it's taken the blue mussel just 15 years.",
        "He found that only mussels from Long Island Sound will flip the thickening switch when the crabs are present.",
        "Their ancestors have lived among Asian shore crabs since the 1980s.",
        "But mussels from northern Maine - where the Asian shore crabs have not yet arrived - don't thicken their shell when they're placed in the same environment as the crabs.",
        "I knew that they would have the capacity to recognize a crab and they would have this capacity to respond.",
        "And the fact that they didn't respond to the Asian shore crab, it's pretty good information that they don't recognize that as a predator.",
        "Freeman says the best explanation is rapid evolution.",
        "Although rapid evolution has happened in other animals, this is the first time scientists have seen it result in a major physical change an animal can turn on and off.",
        "Jeb Byers says shell fishermen could use the adaptation to their advantage by selectively breeding animals that can thwart Asian shore crabs.",
        "But mussel harvesters say their more concerned about starfish than crabs.",
        "Byers says mussels have also evolved a defense against starfish.",
        "Now he wants to know whether the mussels can fend off both predators at once.",
        "His study appears in the current issue of Science Magazine."
