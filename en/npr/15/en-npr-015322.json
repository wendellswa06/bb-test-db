        "Exactly.",
        "I mean, when they saw that the jokes - I'm sorry, that the war was basically turning sour, and the bombing raids were happening, obviously there were very kind of dark, cynical jokes - also like jokes wishing death to Hitler.",

        "You've mentioned the reaction to the television program and to the broadcast of your film on television and to the sales of your book, which are going very, very well, as you mentioned.",
        "But I wonder, when The Producers first came out - Mel Brooks' film - I mean, there was sort of a gasp of shock that you could do jokes about Hitler.",
        "A lot of people still question the taste.",
        "I wonder what's - have people asked you questions about that in Germany?",
        "Well, first of all, it was - yeah, I was very happy by the reaction.",
        "I'm also quietly confident that it will be translated in English, even though we don't have a publisher yet.",
        "But to answer your question, yeah, the reaction was actually quite positive.",
        "Concerning my film, I actually used actors to visualize some of the jokes, and some of the press loved that, and some of them were actually critical about that, and you know, I defend it.",
        "I think I did it in a good way, and I think the people who liked it were right.",
        "But it is still of a sensitive issue.",
        "And I'm 33, so I'm of a different generation.",
        "I think there's a different generation now who have to grapple and come to terms with what happened and what their grandparents did.",
        "So I mean, there's a new way of treating and looking at the Third Reich, and I guess I belong to that sort of generation in a way.",

        "And it was mobs who attacked your film sets in India in 2000?",
        "Yes.",
        "I believe it was around, a mob of around 12,000 people that threw our sets in the river and burned my effigy.",

        "In fact, as you come away from this movie, the thing that seems to demand publicity is not just that this is an historical movie set in 1938 in this terrible situation afflicting widows of Hindus, but this goes on today.",
        "It does.",
        "You know, there are Hindu widows, and except there aren't any child widows.",

        "And what's fabulous is that in the last 10 years, a lot of work is being done on a grass-root level with widows to make them more economically independent, teach them skills, because only if you're economically independent do you have a choice."
