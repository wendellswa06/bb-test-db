        "When did you first experience serious depression and when did you first recognize it as depression?",
        "I'd had some minor episodes, which I didn't recognize, when I was younger, but my first serious episode came in 1994 when I was 31 years old at a period after I'd gone through some rather difficult things after the death of my mother and when I was publishing a novel and so on, and it took me a long time to recognize that and the delay in recognizing it lead to its escalating in quite a terrifying way.",
        "When you did recognize it, what did you do about it?",
        "When I did finally recognize it, which was when I was finally completely beaten down and totally paralyzed and unable to get out of bed and unable to function, I went to see a psychiatrist about it and I ultimately went on medication.",
        "But I should say that as the depression was building and as it was developing, I was seeing a psychoanalyst who failed to recognize it or to identify it and who told me it was very courageous to keep fighting on without drugs and that because of that bad advice, the depression escalated and was a great deal worse than it would have otherwise needed to be.",
        "And that was just a medical error.",
        "I mean, he didn't recognize it either.",
        "Right.",
        "But those medical errors, I think, really constitute a form of malpractice, and they're terrifyingly frequent.",
        "Since writing this book, I've talked to lots of people who, for whatever reason, are resistant to the idea of seeking help and therefore don't get any and I've talked to people who've had good help, but also to a huge number of people who have gone to see doctors and have not had the help that they really need.",
        "And doesn't that play into the whole stigma idea that, hey, you can fight this on yourself.",
        "This is a, you don't really want to even admit that it's there.",
        "Yes, people have the idea that they should be able to control depression.",
        "There is this huge stigma associated with it.",
        "I think it's very difficult to bear the anguish of being depressed even if everyone around you is being as supportive as possible.",
        "It makes it a lot more difficult if you're trying to keep it a big secret, and the idea that you should be able to pull yourself through it is not only wrong but impossible.",
        "(Soundbite of music)",
