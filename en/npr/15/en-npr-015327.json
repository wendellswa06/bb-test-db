        "Right.",
        "Which one?",
        "The first thing I would say is that people often say, I just really want to brave this out on my own, and I don't want to take medication.",
        "But the fact of the matter is that untreated depression tends to escalate.",
        "It tends to get worse, and that while the medications cause temporary changes in your brain which are reversed if you stop taking the medication, untreated depression ultimately causes lesions in the hippocampus and really causes damage, physical damage to the brain, and so people should recognize the seriousness of the enterprise.",
        "I think I should've sought help much sooner.",
        "I think I should've gone on medication much sooner.",
        "I think I should've been working with a therapist and I don't think medication is the only answer.",
        "It is the most efficient and the most proven, but I think the combination of medication and psychotherapy was the right thing for me and I wish I had gotten into it sooner.",
        "Despite the fact that at least one psychotherapist gave you the bad advice.",
        "Yes, but one of the things that I wanted to achieve in writing THE NOONDAY DEMON was to allow people to be informed enough so that they would understand what depression is, know when they were settling into one and have a sense of what they should expect and should be able to demand from people who are treating them.",
        "And that's one of the things we want to get to.",

        "I think, in the first place, you have to have someone who you feel when you interact with that person is listening to you and understands you and that if you meet someone who you feel doesn't get it, that that should be a sign to you to go find somebody else right away.",
        "It's stressful looking for a therapist, especially when you're feeling depressed, but you really need someone who connects.",
        "Ideally, you should have someone who can look at the extent to which the depression has been triggered by external causes, who can ask, will ask you questions about the trajectory of the depression because I often say to people when they say, well, I'm feeling really terrible, but I'm not sure if I'm just upset or if I'm depressed, and I say, okay, there was an event a month ago.",
        "If you're feeling a little better than you were feeling a month ago, even if you're feeling horrible, you're probably headed in the right direction.",
        "If you're feeling worse than you were a month ago, you're on a downward trajectory and that's very dangerous and you're probably heading into a serious depression.",
        "So you need someone who's going to take a history from you in a coherent way and try to follow the emotional issues behind you and then I think you want someone who will lay out a lot of options, who will say, look, these are the different medications.",
        "This is how they work.",
        "This is one that I think might work for you.",
        "This is the kind of talk therapy I can do.",
        "These are the effects it might have.",
        "If you wanted to work someone else, here are the other things you can pursue, someone who will sort of paint a set of options rather than someone who will kind of bossily say to you, oh, well, what you have to do is this and sort of shove you into doing something without allowing you to understand what it is.",
        "Somebody who approaches it, obviously, medically, but at the same time as a service provider, in the same way, providing you an estimate.",
        "This is how we're going to go about it.",
        "Here are your other options, but I recommend this.",
        "And I think it's always, always worth seeing at least two people so that you can have a little bit of a different perspective from somebody else and then you can think, oh, that's so strange.",
        "This one person said these things and this other person said - and sometimes that'll send you to a third person.",
        "If they both say the same thing, maybe that indicates that they're sort of onto something, but you won't have any perspective if you go to only one doctor.",
        "And how do you find these doctors, from your friends, from the phone book?",
        "What?",
        "You can find them, actually people do find them in both of those ways.",
        "The best thing to do, however, is to get in touch with a teaching hospital, whatever the best hospital in your area is, and ask for advice from their department of psychiatry and see if they can give you an initial interview.",
        "The best people in the field tend to cluster around big hospitals, so if you live anywhere near a big hospital, it's worth starting at a big hospital and then they may be able at the hospital to refer you on to somebody else.",
        "And one final question.",
        "Many people have family members, loved ones, dear friends who are suffering serious problems from depression and are reluctant to look for work.",
        "Is there any advice you can give them to how to nudge people towards getting help for themselves?",
        "The question of what to do when someone you love is depressed is a big and a complicated one.",
        "Frequently people who are depressed say just leave me alone because they find all human interaction incredibly stressful.",
        "But actually depression is a disease of loneliness and if you leave people alone, the depression is only going to get worse.",
        "Sometimes they can't bear to have a lot of social interaction with you, but you should make it known always that you're present and that you're in the next room.",
        "And in terms of getting them to seek help, I think it's important A) to medicalize it, to say, look this is a dysfunction that has been traced as a chemical set of processes in the brain and it's a disease like any other disease, to say it's incredibly frequent."

        "Now who offers mental health services and what are the differences among them?",
        "Well, there are - in terms of professionals that do mental health services, there are a couple of different groups, fairly common professions offer it.",
        "Psychiatrists, who are medical doctors, who have been trained to diagnose and treat and also to prescribe medication.",

        "The key is licensed practitioners in the state or in the area near where you live.",
        "And, again, that question that we talked to Andrew Solomon about, where do you begin?",

        "Sometimes I would feel like I was doing well and would say I don't need the medication anymore.",

        "You may find a family practitioner here and there who really has an interest in it.",
