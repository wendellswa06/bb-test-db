        "But there are other ways you can go about doing it and hopefully we'll have a chance to talk about that.",
        "One of the things that you need to always ask a therapist is what is their area of specialty?",
        "What is their focus?",
        "What is their area approach to treatment of depression?",
        "To at least begin to get a sense of whether or not it feels right for you or fits how you're thinking about what's going on in your life.",
        "It's a give and take process and you have to be willing to, and the therapist has to be willing to let you explore that with them.",

        "I really, it, we kind of stepped our meetings back to, you know, to like every other week and stuff like that.",

        "I said, you know, I think I'm on the right path and she told me - she said, I'm here whenever you need me.",
        "And that was you know the point where I said, okay, there's a point that you have to do this yourself and once you've been given all the tools, you go.",
        "And I do, one of the things that I do want to say is that I have a younger sister who suffers from the same kind of depression that I did.",
        "And the hardest part about someone suffering from depression is you can give them all the tools that they want or that they would ever need, and if they're not ready to use them, it won't change anything.",
        "And that's the hardest, the hardest part in dealing with someone who has depression, is that if they're not willing to take those major steps and buckle down and do those - the things that they need to do to change, nothing in their life will change.",
        "And I think that's a problem that a lot of people have.",
        "George, thanks very much.",
