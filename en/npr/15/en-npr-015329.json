        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And I think we've managed to relocate Dr. Allen Dietrich, who's up at the Dartmouth studio in Hanover, New Hampshire - a practicing primary care physician and professor of Community and Family Medicine at Dartmouth School of Medicine.",
        "Good to have you with us today.",
        "Hi Neal.",
        "Good, there you are, finally.",
        "Now why is - why do you advocate asking your family doctor as sort of a gateway?",
        "Well, I wouldn't use the term gateway, so much, as a doorway - for patients needing mental health services.",
        "Primary care physicians today - family physicians, general internists, general pediatricians - are quite well-trained for assisting people to make early decisions about whether they have a mental health problem, beginning to help them make choices about how it should be pursued, and if necessary, to facilitate referrals.",
        "The situation that Andrea described, having to call up a medical center department of psychiatry and sort your way through that seems like quite a formidable thing to have to work your way through.",
        "And most primary care providers are very well prepared to help patients decide if they have a mental health disorder that needs specific treatment and to help them get the treatment they need.",
        "So, are primary care doctors, internists for example, trained to treat mental health?"

        "Yes they are.",
        "They're trained to treat the most common mental health disorders that show up in a primary care practice.",
        "So, for example, in family medicine residency training; general internal medicine training; general pediatric training; people do rotations.",
        "They also have instruction from experts as they do their training in their own training practices, to learn about diagnosis, to learn about how to help patients get the care they need.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "One of our callers said, earlier, that there had been so many developments with various kinds of drugs and various kinds of studies, that primary care physicians can't possibly keep up with it.",
        "Two Es, yeah.",
        "Well, there are a lot of drugs, all the time.",
        "But, I think a primary care physician may actually be in a position to have a protective role.",
        "When I was in training, one of the things that I learned was to not be the first doctor on my block to prescribe a new medication.",
        "And there are tried- and-true medications that have been around for ten years or more that primary care physicians are well qualified to prescribe.",
        "But I'm not shy about referring a patient with a cardiac problem to a cardiologist, or a pulmonary problem to a pulmonologist, and so too, if I need help with mental health - whether it's medication - I'm happy to send him to a psychiatrist.",
        "If it's for counseling, I'm happy to send him to any of the other mental health specialists that were listed earlier.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "And just along those lines, should a patient be a little bit suspicious, in fact, if their primary care physician says, oh I can help you, we don't need a referral, or at least, not at this point?",
        "Well, I think the primary care physician is in a good position to help with diagnosis.",
        "If the patient's not satisfied with what the primary care provider is doing, or if the provider's not listening, the patient might want to consider finding someone else for their primary care.",
        "Yet, as you know, a lot of patients feel intimated by their doctors.",
        "I mean, afraid to ask even basic consumer questions some of the time.",
        "But it's less intimidating, I think, to talk to a primary care physician whom you know over time, and to raise a question about whether a mental health disorder might be involved, than it is to go to an entirely new provider - perhaps have to park your car in front of your office and have to face the stigma.",
        "And many primary care offices now have co-located mental health personnel, either on an all the time basis, or a rotating basis.",
        "So, it's also, in many offices, possible to get mental health specialty services right in the primary care office."

        "Nouri al-Maliki says he expects to present his team to Iraq's parliament for approval by the end of this week.",
        "You can hear details on those stories and, of course, much more later today, on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.",
        "Tomorrow on TALK OF THE NATION, a man in Alabama made up a whole new life for himself and his family.",
        "Another man lived for 20 years as a British lord before being unmasked as an American from Florida.",
        "There's a long American tradition of starting fresh and reinventing yourself.",
        "We'll be talking about that tomorrow on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "In a few minutes some residents of New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward hear some good news and your letters.",
        "But first how adults can get better mental health care.",
        "Our guests are Raymond Crowell, a clinical psychologist and Vice President of the National Mental Health Association.",

        "Yeah, my brother suffers from depression.",
        "And it's a family problem that's been happening for the last 15 years or so.",
        "And it's not always the person with the problem that has to find the care for the person, you know.",
        "It's sometimes the family members that have to find the care for these people with the problems.",
        "You notice one thing, that you'll get a different opinion from every doctor, and a lot of these doctors are quick to the pharmaceuticals.",
        "That problem will be solved with a pill.",
        "Did you have your purple pill today?",
        "And family members put a lot of faith in the medication.",
        "And, in my case, we saw a lot of bad side effects from the medication - like stammers, stuttering, stuff like that - where the problem became even more evident, through the medication.",
        "And, in our case, after several doctors, he was weaned off the medication and was more into a group thing.",
        "My point is, mental health is big problem in the country.",
        "And we're so quick to find answers through doctors; and we put faith in these pharmaceuticals; and sometimes they're not the answer.",
        "Sometimes, I think there's a lot of pressure to push pharmaceuticals.",
        "And finding your doctor isn't always on the patient, it's on the part of the family, also to support - because we're the ones that recognize there's a problem there.",

        "Let's get a response from Raymond Crowell.",
        "Obviously, every case is different, every patient is different, but there does seem to be a sort of sociological push to go to the pharmacy.",
        "Well, the science around medication has blossomed in the last decade, and so has the need - or the marketing of medications.",
        "And there may be a tendency or temptation to rush to medications.",
        "But we want to make sure that there's a proper assessment and diagnosis that's done, and that that's done in a timely way, but also takes the time to consider a variety of factors that may contribute to depression, or may sustain a depression.",
        "Medication is something that works, and does - and has been demonstrated to work.",
        "Medication in concert with some forms of therapy has also been demonstrated to be highly effective.",
        "And so, it's oft times important not just to stop with the primary care physician or the psychiatrist you see, but also to think about what kinds of therapy you need over time.",
        "And if the medication isn't working, then that's something that has to be discussed quickly with the prescribing physician so that they can make changes and adjustments in it.",
        "And Bob how's your brother doing?",
        "He's doing well.",
        "Again, he's been weaned off these, you know, these psychotropic drugs that they use for - and he's become better.",
        "He does a group therapy type thing - one-on-one with a therapist; and sometimes I guess - and I can't - you know, every person you said is different.",
        "But sometimes it's just a matter of talking to somebody and getting to the core of the problem.",
        "Whereas, everybody's so quick to scientize everything, that it's, you know - we can look at it under a microscope - and it's not always the answer through pharmacology or that.",
        "Again, like I said, choosing doctors, which the topic is, a lot falls onto the family members and…",
        "Well let me ask Dr. Dietrich about that.",
        "And, are you approached sometimes by family members on behalf of their relatives?",
        "Indeed.",
        "And it's admirable what Bob talks about, having to do to help his family member.",
        "I think that also, the issue of patient preference enters into the choice of therapies.",
        "And most primary care physicians, I'm sure most mental health professionals, psychiatrists, might assess with the patient what their choice was about embarking on treatment.",
        "And sometimes it takes a few tries.",
        "Sometimes patients will prefer medication because it doesn't involve weekly visits, it doesn't involve necessarily pre-approval with an insurance company.",
        "But it is a matter of staying with it.",
        "And families need to be very supportive of the people that are suffering."

        "The primary care visits are typically oriented on the order of 15 to 20 minutes.",

        "Where do you go?",
        "Is, it depends on several tings.",
        "First of all, understanding the roles of your healthcare provider.",
        "Secondly, understanding that medication in the body - the body changes, becomes acclimated, and at times you have to change medication.",
        "And number three, figuring out what your insurance is going to cover.",
        "Now starting out with your providers, it took me along time to realize that psychiatrists are not there to necessarily to give you backtalk when you tell them what's bothering you.",
        "I look at them as I do my primary care physicians, with the utmost respect, but as a mechanic, if you will, of the mind.",
        "You take your car to a mechanic and you say, you know it's making this funny sound.",
        "And the mechanic says, oh, okay, well does it make it when it goes uphill or down?",
        "Well, when it goes up.",
        "And that way you can analyze, you know, your carburetor, or whatever is wrong with the particular thing.",
        "I guess that's what's called being clinical about the situation.",
        "So that's the psychiatrist's job, is to kind of analyze what issues you have.",
        "Are you bi-polar?",
        "Are you depressed?",
        "What are the issues?",
        "And from there he can look at medication that will work to help you.",
        "Once you've done that, you can then, and this is what worked for me, is see a psychologist, whose job is to talk back and forth with you.",
