        "You hear stories about things recorded on hardware and mixed on hardware, or I should actually say software, things like ProTools editing software ten years ago, but the new version of the software isn't compatible with the digital files that were made 10 and 20 years ago.",

        "The reason so many of the sounds from the very earliest days of recording are lost is not because the recordings are lost, but because we have very expansive copyright laws in this country that essentially lock them up and make them unavailable.",
        "For two reasons, the rights holders to those recordings can't be found or the rights are now owned by the multinational corporations that absorb the record labels and who have no reason to bother with stuff that won't make them money.",

        "He spent nearly a decade researching the archives of EMI Records and saw the label capitalize on its vast holdings.",
        "If this material has a commercial life, no matter how old - and some of the material goes back to 1906 - then they will digitize it, and that means it is much more readily available for future exploitation.",
        "And this too is one of the National Recording Preservation Plans recommendations - collaborations between the public and private sector can benefit both and make recordings available for everyone to hear.",
        "But in the end, Sam Brylawski says the plan is, well...",
        "Only a plan and Washington's full of plans and studies which have been done over the last 200 years.",
        "But I think this one could be effective because it is, in effect, a roadmap of how we might approach audio preservation and assure that as much as possible is here for posterity.",
