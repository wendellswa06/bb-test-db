        "In 2007, David Goldhill's 82-year-old father who was in otherwise good health checked into the hospital with a minor case of pneumonia.",
        "Once there, he caught a series of infections and died.",
        "Shortly thereafter, Goldhill read an article that changed his life.",
        "He learned just how common it is for hospital infections to result in death, up to 100,000 such cases each year.",
        "He also learned how simple it can be to prevent them.",
        "In some cases, as simple as regulating that physicians wash their hands.",
        "So Goldhill set out to learn as much as he could about our convoluted insurance-based health care system, and he found that much of it is broken.",
        "His new book is called \"\"Catastrophic Care: How American Health Care Killed My Father and How We Can Fix It.\"\" Goldhill, who is president of the Game Show Network, approaches the topic from a business perspective, and that's why, he says, the more he learned about the industry, the stranger it all seemed.",
        "It felt strange that any industry could have a relatively simple low-cost way of significantly improving its customer experience - and here the customer is a patient and then - the experience is a life or death one - and it would be hard to get the industry to adopt it.",
        "A hundred thousand deaths is an extraordinary number.",
        "And there are estimates of up to 200,000 people are killed by error in a given year, a variety of errors in addition to infection.",
        "And a recent study that Medicare did suggested that one out of four hospital admissions of a Medicare beneficiary involved some type of error that had a meaningful impact on that patient's health.",
        "Why do you suppose we don't hear more about this?",
        "There is a sense that there is something uniquely different about health care.",
        "You'll often hear people say that health care shouldn't be a business, as if 15 million people can perform this service without caring about their economic interests.",
        "We fund all of health care through insurance.",
        "We, as consumers, are extraordinarily passive on health care.",
        "We think because our insurer or Medicare will reimburse something, we probably should do it.",
        "It's one of the explanations why there's so much waste in health care.",
        "And then another point in which we hold health care very different than everything else is we almost always think more of it is better.",
        "What I find extraordinary is almost anybody who looks at the Medicare program sees an enormous amount of waste.",
        "And what's interesting is we talk about the waste in terms of money.",
        "That's not the right way to think of it.",
        "These are treatments and tests and surgeries done on people who didn't need them, shouldn't have had them.",
        "It's an assault on their bodies.",
        "And yet that kind of accountability is something that we've given health care a pass on because we feel it's just so different from any other human activity.",
        "How much are we going to pay for health care over our lifetimes?",
        "In my book, I looked at an actual entry-level employee at my company.",
        "She's earning about $35,000 a year.",
        "And I said let's look at her life.",
        "Let's assume that she's the breadwinner of the family.",
        "She does well, has a nice middle-class income.",
        "And she lives till 80, and she has a couple of kid.",
        "What is that young woman going to put into our health care system over her lifetime?",
        "Well, the number's incredibly shocking.",
        "If there's zero growth in health care costs, she will put in - between insurance premium, taxes, Medicare, Medicare premiums out of pocket - and I should point out this is assuming she never gets really sick - she'll put in over 1 million dollars over her life to support her and her family's health care.",
        "If health care costs grow by only what the Affordable Care Act estimates, then the number is a million-nine."
