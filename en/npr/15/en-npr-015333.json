        "The challenge is to create a similar square with as many Ls as possible and no plurals or verbs formed by adding S.",
        "And our reference for acceptable words will be Merriam-Webster's 11th Collegiate Dictionary.",
        "So, again, make a four-by-four square with different words reading across and down and as many Ls as possible.",

        "Every economist will tell you that money, which has grown so enormously, is just coming out of our paychecks.",
        "It's a major reason that wage rates in the United States flattened in the last decade and are expected to stay flat is because your employer is paying more and more for your health care instead of paying more and more to you.",
        "Many people think that, you know, if they're seniors, that Medicare is paying for their health care.",
        "What's interesting about seniors and what almost no one understands about Medicare is in 1965, when seniors paid for almost all of their health care themselves, roughly 10 to 12 percent of their income was spent on health care.",
        "This year, when seniors pay almost none of their health care themselves - Medicare pays 95 percent of the bill - that little 5 percent they pay now accounts for 20 percent of their income.",
        "So what you have is people who think they're being protected by having these big intermediaries between them and the price of health care, in fact, what those intermediaries are doing is so inflating prices, so inflating demand, building so much waste and complexity into the system that all of us are bearing this extraordinary cost.",
        "We just don't see it because it's so many different hands into our pocket.",
        "But there is no other place for the money to come from.",

        "Well, I'm a Democrat, and I share what I think the administration's goal was of creating a national cradle-to-grave safety net.",
        "The problem is I think the Affordable Care Act is fundamentally old fashioned in what it understood about the health care system.",
        "It saw the big divide as being between the insured and the uninsured.",
        "And I think that's a very simplistic and probably inaccurate evaluation of what the key problems are in health care: ever greater price inflation, care that is more expensive over care that is less expensive, care that is wasteful and therefore harmful over that that is needed.",
        "The idea of adding 16 million more people to Medicaid and the difficulty with the Affordable Care Act - like so much of the political discussion of health care - is it's all about insurance, as if insurance is health care and as if health care is health.",
        "What we have in this country is a system that is already hazardous to your health and your pocketbook.",
        "What about solutions?",
        "Do we realistically think that we can improve the system that we have now?",
        "Well, I think we see green chutes all the time in the system.",
        "And the question is not just how are we going to pay for it but how are we going to make sure that innovation, service, quality and safety in health care are truly accountable.",
        "I think we've gone through 50 years of relying on intermediaries to drive those things, and I think they failed.",
        "And so as a businessperson, I look at them and say there is no other business like that.",
        "And we give it a pass because we say health care's so complicated that's why it's like that.",
        "I spent a lot of time in hospitals.",

        "You go to a dry cleaner, your bill's computerized.",
        "They've been using electronic records in dry cleaners for 10 years, right?",
        "It's not because they only hired guys with computer science to be at the counter at the dry cleaner, it's that it's expensive to lose a shirt.",
        "Almost no technology in hospitals is interoperable.",
        "They don't buy interoperable technology, even information technology, which is why you fill out the same form, you know, 200 feet from where you filled it out last time."

        "We're going to have to take more responsibility.",
