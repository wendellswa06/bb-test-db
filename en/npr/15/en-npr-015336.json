        "Well, let's talk about running mates.",
        "Given the questions that have been raised about Governor Romney's consistency, his change of position on some issues dear to evangelical Christian voters, will he need a running mate who can reassure those voters as opposed to a running mate who sort of reaches out to moderates and signals a move toward the center, or toward more libertarian Republicans?",
