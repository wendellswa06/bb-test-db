        "I'm glad we did it 30 years ago.",
        "The problem is right now, we really need the emissions fixes that are going to provide the most bang for our buck.",
        "The cheapest way of reducing our emissions is through efficiency, more efficient refrigerators, more efficient air conditioners, more efficient light bulbs.",
        "Let me ask about that, because on the surface that sounds like a very valid argument.",
        "Anybody can understand that a more fuel-efficient car uses less oil.",

        "Let's listen.",
        "Efficiency in car engines have improved by about 30 percent, yet your average American driver consumes just as much gasoline as he or she did 30 years ago, because the cost of driving has fallen and we've consumed those efficiency gains in ever more consumption.",
        "Efficiency can only lead to conservation if we don't allow the price to fall."
