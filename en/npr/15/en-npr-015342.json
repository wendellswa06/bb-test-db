        "Well, I must say, every time I listen to that segment of the interview, and the interview actually went on a great deal longer than that, I am coming more and more to the conclusion that I think Mr. Black, Ambassador Black, was trying to make the point that if a targeted killing takes place in other than a - some guy standing in front of you with a gun and shooting you through the forehead, if in other words it's done from 5,000 feet by a Predator, which is being - which is launching Hellfire missiles at a particular target with the expectation and the knowledge that certain people are going to be inside that target and therefore will be killed, that that somehow is different.",

        "officials, too.",
        "Precisely.",
        "And as you may recall, one of the reasons that George W.",
        "Bush was said to be so adamant about going after Saddam Hussein is because Saddam Hussein did precisely that, apparently launched an assassination team that was supposed to kill the first President Bush.",
