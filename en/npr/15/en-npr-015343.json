        "And usually what you've done is gone through, do you have political solutions, do you have economic solutions, do you have diplomatic solutions, and quite often you end up at a point where none of those are effective.",
        "And so quite often the leadership of the country turns to the CIA and says all right, what kind of covert action can you conduct that might change the situation?",

        "Do we have a group that could support a coup?",
        "Do we have an insurgency that can overthrow a government?",

        "It's a wartime effort to disrupt the communication and the leadership of the enemy, and I think it's kind of an insult to refer to it as an assassination.",
        "Keith, let me ask you, then, in that context, if Mullah Omar was the head of the Taliban, is it now okay for him to target the president of the United States?",
