        "But what you have here is a situation where the vice president - people around the case think it may not even get to court, because the Supreme Court ruled in 19 - I believe it was - 82, Madeleine, that it's hard to sue the president or the vice president, especially in this kind of case, and especially since Valerie Plame was not fired.",

        "He said in the column, that Rove had been a kind of a secondary source, not the primary source for this.",
        "Yeah.",
        "He said that Karl Rove had confirmed that Plame was the - was a CIA agent at the time.",
