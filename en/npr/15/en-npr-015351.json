        "So it is by far the most studied tornado ever.",
        "And Wurman, who co-directs VORTEX2 with Erik Rasmussen, says those mountains of data will come in handy.",
        "If we can understand more about tornadoes, then we can make better warnings.",
        "If we can get the warning lead time up from its current 13 minutes to 20 or 30 minutes, that's great.",
        "People's lives will be saved.",
        "If we can reduce the false alarm rate from its current 70 percent down to 50 percent or even lower, then those warnings will be more precise.",
