        "Right.",
        "A lot of it is personality-driven.",
        "We're talking - we're hearing things about anti-Israel, anti-Semitism, Auntie Em on \"\"The Wizard of Oz.\"\" But all those things are - I think perhaps what it really is is personality, and maybe it is a little way of getting back at the president.",
        "But we have seen that the president, as we heard during the upcoming debt ceiling fight, the president looks like he's itching for a fight and not looking to back down.",
        "Trying to stretch out that mandate he thinks he has.",
        "All right, let's try for another - for another answer here on our trivia question.",

        "Anyway, he's going to name an interim appointment, appointee, and Barney Frank, again who left Congress, just left Congress after all those terms, says he wants the job.",
        "He will not run for the special election, matter of fact he all but endorsed Ed Markey, who seems to be the consensus Democratic choice for that seat, but he wants that interim appointment.",
        "Which means Barney Frank, if he got it, and that's a big if...",
        "Right, because there are other people who want it, as well.",
        "Would serve for how long?",
        "Well, until there's a special election, and of course that depends on when John Kerry officially leaves the Senate because of course he still has to have the confirmation hearings and then get confirmed.",
        "Now of course given his views on Israel, Hagel would probably get confirmed but not bar mitzvahed.",
        "I think I just - that's part of the problem, too."

        "They were - but they were principled conservatives that did not believe in compromising.",

        "You kind of wonder why he wants it because of all the stuff - and I mean, given the fact that he was pushed aside during the fiscal cliff negotiations, his Plan B went nowhere because his own party didn't like it.",

        "And she says she will testify about what happened in Benghazi.",
        "Right, I mean, that was - I mean, all the crazy and mostly unfortunate stuff you read on the Internet about what her illness really was, whether she really had the flu, whether she really had a concussion, whether she really had a blood clot, and that's just so despicable is probably the best word I can think of.",
        "But she came back, and she's now back at the State Department, back at Foggy Bottom, got a helmet as a present, you know, a sense of humor and everything.",
