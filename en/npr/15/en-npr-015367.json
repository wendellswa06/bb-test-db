        "All right, Congressman LaTourette, let me read you this comment from Joshua(ph) in South Bend, Indiana.",
        "Joshua says: I don't identify as a Republican.",
        "I identify as a conservative, which means I do largely vote and support Republicans, as well as third-party candidates and the occasional moderate Democrat.",
        "Something I think people don't understand is that not all Republicans care about social issues.",
        "In fact, a true conservative stance on social issues would be for the government to not be involved, which would leave things like abortion and gay marriage up to the choice of the individual.",
        "I think there's a negative stigma that associates Republicans with social conservatism which is not always the case.",
        "What do you think?",
        "Well, that's a great point by Joshua, and, you know, that's independent, conservative, almost libertarian in his views, and I think that's right.",
        "I mean, you know, what I hear from people all the time is I happen to be pro-life and I'm proud of that and so forth and so on.",
        "But I don't wear it on my sleeve, and nor do I need to have a vote on it every week to establish to a set of people back in Ohio that that's my position.",
        "And if you - even the Tea Party, if you look at the Tea Party what it stands for, taxed enough already, they don't have anything to do with abortion.",
        "They don't have anything to do with guns.",
        "They don't have anything to do with gay marriage.",
        "They have to do with fiscal policy...",
        "Right.",
        "...which should be the strong suit of the Republican Party.",
        "And - but what happens to these movements that are successful, however, we get these outliers, and so the Tea Parties at least in my area have become, you know, oh, well, they're getting news, and so all of a sudden, the LaRouchies who, you know, weren't getting press all by themselves, they become active.",
        "And the Ron Paul people come in, and they try to sort of (unintelligible).",
        "The squeaky wheel is getting all the grease.",
        "Well, that's exactly right.",
        "And so they do a disservice to the Tea Party because they sort of morphed them into these extremists, when by and large most Tea Party people are just interested in paying fewer taxes and balancing the budget.",
        "Congressman, I'm just wondering what prospects do you think — see for the 113th Congress?",
        "Do you see the same kind of interparty stuff going on between the Tea Party and the so-called establishment?",

        "Now, you know, I don't have a lot of not pleasant things to say about the president, but I do believe that the president is unwilling to challenge his party on the two-thirds of the budget that is spending, entitlement spending.",
        "Yeah.",

        "So you're saying Republicans are not coldhearted as they're portrayed?",

        "Next thing is the thing that you get right is the same-sex marriage and this illegal immigration.",
        "It's devastating to the African-American community, and there are a lot of African-Americans out here that are sitting on the fence.",
