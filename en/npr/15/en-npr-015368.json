        "Yeah.",
        "And so - there's one more floating around out there but so...",
        "At least.",
        "...it's exactly what I'm talking about, in that a concerted effort by a dedicated core group of Republican primary voters, very conservative, determined who the nominee was going to be.",
        "And they may have won the nomination but there's no way when you talk about, you know, a child conceived as a result of rape being a gift from God are going to get the independents in this country to think that you're nothing but a dangerous person when it comes to everything that the government shouldn't be involved in.",
        "OK.",

        "Bush and President Barack Obama.",
        "As President Obama said, what better revenge than to get us - than to force us to say nice things about John to a national audience.",
        "It was a good line.",
        "But at the same time, I think that the genuine affection and the remarkable degree of respect and admiration for John McCain in both of these two speeches really would have to strike people.",
        "So there must have been a double smile there - not only getting his old rivals, the two men who frustrated his own presidential ambition - first in 2000, then in 2008 - to get up there and eulogize him in this way.",
        "Yeah, there'd be a smile in that from the rivalry standpoint, but I think there was a double smile in knowing that in the end, both of them would quite sincerely lionize him and respect the things that John cared most about in himself."
