        "You know, that rating isn't just among Trump voters or Republicans.",

        "Yes.",
        "His approval rating is dropping.",
        "And it's now either in the high 30s to mid-to-low 40s.",

        "These people are going to stick with him no matter what.",
        "The president is also paying very close attention to his base.",

        "He delivered on Neil Gorsuch.",
        "He's rolling back Obama-era regulations.",
        "These are the things that his base and conservatives wanted most.",

        "And he doesn't seem to feel that he needs to reach out much beyond that.",
        "What about the left?",
        "I see a whole political sector mobilized by Comey's firing.",
        "You know, you look on social media and cable news - they're calling for Trump's impeachment.",
        "What do you think when you hear calls like that?",
        "Is it feasible?",
        "Well, no, I don't.",
        "And I think there's a lot of magical thinking on both ends of the political spectrum.",
        "You know, his supporters think he's rewritten the rules.",
        "And they'll tell me, well, it doesn't matter what he does.",
        "It doesn't matter what his approval ratings are.",
        "Remember during the campaign, he said he could stand on Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and not lose any voters.",
        "On the left, I think they are in the grip - many people - critics of him are in the grip of this delusion that he's going to be impeached or that we're in a full-fledged constitutional crisis.",
        "So this is a phenomenon of our very tribalized politics.",
        "You know, someone criticizes your guy, and you cleave to him even more.",
        "People feel - his supporters feel he's being treated unfairly by the media.",
        "He certainly feels that too.",
        "I talked to a conservative yesterday who was accusing the media of Trump Derangement Syndrome because CNN was focusing on the fact that Trump gets two scoops of ice cream when everyone else gets one at the White House.",
        "So I think that Trump is a divisive figure, and he's divided America even more."
