        "But beyond that, O'Mara, who is a former TV analyst as well as a seasoned criminal lawyer, told reporters he will not try the case in the media.",
        "MARK O'MARA: There's a lot of high emotions, maybe some of them have been salved by the fact that there have been an arrest.",
        "But let's just - let the process work.",
        "Zimmerman maintains that he shot Martin in self-defense.",
        "Neither O'Mara nor Corey would talk about the evidence in the case.",
        "For that, we may have to wait for the process of discovery, which could begin in the next few weeks.",
        "Trayvon Martin's father, Tracy, greeted Zimmerman's arrest with muted relief in this interview on CBS.",
        "I felt a little bit at ease knowing that he had been apprehended, that he had turned himself in, knowing that he wouldn't be able to take another 17-year-old's life."

        "That's what they asked for, and I'm so relieved that they are getting that.",

        "And she said to the Israelis, what do you think you're going to get by shelling innocent civilians?",
        "But then later, after spending about a half hour, hour with her, Steve, she sort of switched and started to say, you know, my kids, I encourage them to be apolitical growing up.",
        "But now, I don't see any reason not to encourage them to join Hamas to become part of the resistance.",
        "If all we're going to get is death and destruction, then we should fight on - were her words.",
        "We're talking with NPR's Eric Westervelt; he's in Gaza City.",
        "And Eric, you've touched on something that Anne Garrels also reported on a moment ago: the debate now within Israel about whether Israel used too much force.",
        "I wonder, now that you're on the scene of some of these explosions - you talk about destroyed living rooms; of course, we've heard about destroyed schools.",
        "Israel has said anytime that it was striking targets like that, it was firing at Hamas rocket launchers nearby or fighters of one kind or another.",
        "Do people, do survivors that you talk to, give a sense that they were at least in the neighborhood of Hamas fighters when they were - their homes were struck by Israeli forces?"
