        "Right.",
        "And McCain stood firm on that to the point where Cheney was taken out of the negotiations, which is interesting because Cheney is a guy who in the past has been used by Bush to negotiate with Capitol Hill.",
        "He knows Congress; he was in Congress.",
        "Here there was just no meeting of the minds.",
        "McCain, you know, was a wall on this one.",
        "And so Bush talked to McCain and put Steve Hadley, his national security adviser, in charge.",
        "What they ended up with was, you know, about 95 percent or better of what McCain wanted.",
        "They did ultimately agree not to any kind of an exception, but they agreed to a provision whereby non-military people, which would really be the CIA or contractors, would have the same opportunity to invoke a superior orders defense, the kind that soldiers can under the Uniform Code of Military Justice where they have the right to counsel and they can, you know, try to argue that the orders from a superior officer were what led them to do whatever they might have done.",
        "So, in other words, if they thought they were obeying a legal order when they did whatever it was they did.",
        "Exactly.",
        "OK.",
        "But, you know, as McCain himself, I think, indicated, because he harked back to Nuremberg, that has always been a very problematic defense.",
        "So it's not a very strong protection for interrogators.",
        "You know, as you know, the issue at the Nuremberg trials was whether following an illegal order is any defense at all.",
        "And of course when it came to Nazis, it was determined that it wasn't.",
        "Let me ask you a bit about the politics.",
        "Senator McCain always had a strong hand in the US Senate.",
        "His amendment was approved by a vote, I think, 90-to-9 in the US Senate.",
        "The House of Representatives was much slower and resistant to come over.",
        "Then suddenly last night--it's not a binding vote, but overwhelmingly the House voted in favor of the McCain amendment.",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "I mean, it gathered a huge amount of momentum, you know, not least because people on Capitol Hill were aware that many in the administration in the uniformed military, in the State Department and elsewhere also supported some kind of legislation.",
        "I mean, everyone knew that America's image was getting hit badly over this.",
        "But it's not over yet, as McCain indicated in its comments today.",
        "He said at one point it's a done deal, but he said at another point we want to resolve this in the next 24 hours.",
        "And I think what he was referring to there was the fact that Duncan Hunter, the Republican chairman of House Armed Services Committee, is resisting this deal.",
        "You know, he doesn't like it and may still try to muster some opposition.",
        "But it was a 308-to-122 vote in the House yesterday for this legislation.",
        "So it looks like it's going to go through and of course it's not going to be vetoed now.",
        "Yes, the White House had said earlier any legislation that included the McCain amendment would be vetoed.",
        "Of course this is the defense appropriations bill, a gigantic bill that includes a lot beyond defense appropriations.",
        "But that's a lot of money to begin with.",
        "Right, exactly.",
        "So yeah, this looks like, as McCain said, a done deal.",
        "I will just add that, you know, there is another aspect of this that is not getting much attention today, and that's what's happening on the other side on the Lindsey Graham effort to clarify detention procedures at Guantanamo and in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "And there, I think, the administration is winning a little bit more of its position, because this has not yet been finally negotiated, but I believe that Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator who's the main author of this, along with Carl Levin, the Democratic senator, are going to agree to language that will allow for evidence obtained through coercive interrogations in other countries to be used.",
        "And that's extremely controversial and has made a lot of human rights people unhappy."

        "A similar ruling against that was just issued in London just the other day by the law lords.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Let us turn now to Larry Johnson, a former CIA analyst and deputy director at the State Department for counterterrorism.",
        "He's with us now by phone from Bethesda, Maryland, and he is currently CEO of Berg Associates.",
        "And, Larry Johnson, always nice to speak with you.",
        "Hi, Neal.",
        "How do you think this agreement is going to affect the CIA on the ground?",
        "President Bush in an appearance earlier today with Senator John McCain of Arizona, speaking after an agreement was reached to include the McCain amendment as part of the defense appropriations bill that's currently making its way through Congress.",
        "Our guests are Michael Hirsh, a senior editor at Newsweek magazine, and Larry Johnson, a former CIA analyst and deputy director at the State Department for counterterrorism, now CEO of Berg Associates.",
        "And let's bring another voice into the conversation, John Yoo, a former lawyer with the Justice Department under President Bush.",
        "He was involved with the Justice Department memos which spelled out White House policy on torture.",
        "And he joins us now by phone from Berkeley, California.",
        "It's going to give them some reassurance that they're not going to be hung out to dry.",
        "I think what you've seen over the last month or so, particularly with leaks about the secret prisons in Europe, that there was real concern within at least some in the agency and the operations area that they were being set up to be the fall guys when things started going south.",
        "And, you know, I've got friends who have been on the ground in charge in operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan in particular, and three to be specific, and each of these gentlemen have told me that, you know, they saw no value and in fact thought torture, the idea of even using it, was counterproductive to what you're trying to accomplish and at the end of the day you're going to create more enemies than you're going to obtain valuable information.",
        "So I think this is going to be welcomed as taking them a little bit off the hot seat."

        "And so there is the awkward period of what happens between those things that have happened in the past three our four years, though.",
        "Well, no, that's true.",
        "Most of--you know, it's important that people understand, CIA does not have trained interrogators.",
        "The interrogators that have come to work at the CIA have come out of military backgrounds.",
        "You know, just as an example, when I went through the training at Camp Perry and was held hostage for two days, the people doing the interrogation of us were Army personnel, active duty military.",

        "Hi.",
        "One thing that just strikes me as kind of strange about the conversation so far is that it seems to assume that we haven't been engaged in torture in the past.",
        "And in fact US torture in Vietnam in the Phoenix program and training torturers in the School of the Americas is a, you know, well-documented longtime thing.",
        "So I'm wondering why, first of all, did the Bush administration feel it was necessary to make explicit that we could torture and would torture, and will it change anything if we make it explicit that we don't when, you know, a lot of people think we do and probably will continue to do so?",
        "Well, Michael Hirsh, why don't you try that?",
        "And I do have to say, Xander, the Bush administration's position all along is that the United States does not conduct torture.",
        "Definitions of torture, however, are, I guess, slippery sometimes, Michael.",
        "Well, I mean, I would just first point out that it's not well-documented.",
        "I just don't think the caller is right about that.",
        "I know there have been a lot of stories over the years about what goes in the School of the Americas where, you know, Latin American military and paramilitaries were trained ostensibly by the CIA as well as a lot of stories about the Phoenix program in Vietnam.",
        "But whatever might have happened under those programs, there was never any kind of explicit authorization of torture.",
        "I'm not saying it never occurred, but the idea that it was US policy, official US policy is just not accurate.",
        "The manuals, which are part of the public record, you know, are textbooks in how to torture.",
        "And there's been congressional studies.",
        "It's all fully in the public record.",
        "Well, Xander, I'm afraid we're just going to have to agree to disagree on that in terms of the past."

        "Well, no, I think they're going to change.",
        "I mean, there has been this push to, you know, really, I guess, cross over some boundaries with some of the duress.",

        "John Yoo, very good of you to speak with us today.",
        "Well, I think this has always been a question of balancing costs and benefits.",
        "And I think the benefit of being able to interrogate people aggressively was that they would yield information about potential attacks on the United States.",
        "And so I think some of the worst possible interrogation methods we've heard of in the press have been reserved for the leaders of al-Qaeda that we've captured, people like Abu Zubaydah or Khalid Sheik Mohammed or Ramzi Binalshibh, the, you know, number three, four and five people in al-Qaeda at the time they were captured and planners of the 9/11 attacks.",
        "And certainly there was never doubt there was any cost, which was harm to American foreign policy, harm to our image or, you know, our foreign policy views and cooperation from other countries.",
        "And I think what's happened is that the political leaders that we've elected have made that decision that at this point those interrogation methods, the costs they were generating in terms of political costs, outweigh the benefits that we were getting from interrogations.",
        "I guess those costs to some degree became evident on Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's recent to visit to Europe, where this issue came up over and over and over again every single stop.",
        "Yeah, I don't disagree with that.",
        "I've always thought that it became clear the last year, the year and a half, that there were very serious political costs.",
        "And I think the people we have elected and put into office had to make that kind of judgment about whether even despite those costs, the information we might get from interrogating al-Qaeda leaders would yield benefits that would be more important to the country.",
        "And I think at this point in the war on terrorism, the president and the senators who have access to, you know, the information that's not publicly available about who we have, how we're interrogating them and the information that it's yielding, have made that kind of judgment, that that's no longer worth the political costs we've been paying in the international arena.",
        "You've also spoken in the past about the other side of the conundrum, the fear that if you had someone with time-urgent information, all you could do under the McCain amendment was ask questions.",
        "Yeah, I mean, I have to say I think that's really where we are now, is that if the McCain amendment is passed finally by the Congress, as I expect it would be now, what happens still in that situation?",
        "I mean, it's commonly referred to in law schools and journals and so on as the ticking time bomb hypothetical where you have someone in your hands who has information about an attack that might be, you know, a little bit of time away.",
        "And unfortunately I don't think that's a hypothetical anymore.",
        "I think that's a real problem that our, you know, politicians, our elected politicians have to deal with.",
        "And I'm not sure actually how the McCain amendment would deal with that, because the McCain amendment on its face, as you say, you're quite right.",
        "I think it would limit our government to mostly just asking oral questions, maybe playing psychological games through oral questioning, but it would pretty much limit interrogation even in that kind of situation of high-ranking al-Qaeda leaders.",
        "And I've heard, you know, comments that McCain has made and other people have made--well, if we were really in that kind of situation, you would expect the president to do what he would have to do.",
        "But I think the law now bars him from doing that.",
        "Larry Johnson, as a former CIA agent, let me ask you--or CIA analyst--I know you've talked to people about this kind of situation.",
        "Right.",
        "And again, it really--it crosses a line.",
        "This notion that you're going to get the magic information--at the end of the day, when you're interrogating somebody, information they give you, you still have to go out and corroborate it.",
        "They don't just tell you something and you say, OK, that is now written by the finger of God and it's true and you immediately act on it.",
        "And so under duress, people will tell you anything.",
        "And one of the techniques that we were taught is--in being ourselves interrogated under duress is that you try to feed out information slowly over time because as time passes, certain sensitive information that you have is perishable and you can divulge it at some point, say, two or three days into the process and it's not going to damage an intelligence operation.",
        "So, you know, I think at the end of the day, we have to come back and ask ourselves what are we--as a people, what are our values?",
        "If we justify invading Saddam Hussein in part because he had torture rooms and rape rooms and yet we ourselves will then argue that there is a point at which we're willing to torture and rape, well, then we make ourselves no different than Saddam Hussein because it's just a difference of degree.",
        "And I think we have to make a fundamental decision that there are certain things that we as civilized human beings who embrace Western philosophy will not do and will not permit to be done.",
