        "Hi.",
        "Yeah, I'm glad somebody made the connection between us being no better than Saddam Hussein.",
        "But my question was, as I understand it, the McCain amendment says that you're not allowed to do anything that's not on the Army manual.",
        "Now I read, I think last night, there's a 10-page secret addendum that's just been passed through that actually puts down exactly what you are and are not allowed to do in torture.",
        "And so far I haven't heard what's in it.",
        "I'm wondering if that has something to do with why McCain made a deal with the White House.",
        "Does anybody know what's in it?",
        "Just to clarify, Sierra, you're not allowed to torture at all.",
        "But anyway, Michael Hirsh, can you fill us in on the changes to the Army field manual?",
        "No, it's classified.",
        "It's a classified annex and they're going to keep it classified because part of this is not letting the bad guys know what your interrogation techniques are, even if they're only psychological.",
        "But I would add that the McCain amendment, you know, makes clear that cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is not allowed.",
        "And again, what that does is define this kind of treatment as whatever is prohibited by the Fifth, Eighth and 14th Amendments to the Constitution.",
        "So even though we don't know specifically what those techniques are, they would still have to fall under that restriction.",
        "And if this new field manual did call for things that went beyond the McCain amendment, clearly the McCain amendment would rule them illegal.",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah, but, I mean, we're talking--specifically, when you're talking about, like, forces overseas, like, with the Abu Ghraib problem, there were some soldiers who were tried, found guilty and have been, you know, put in prison.",
        "It hasn't gone up the chain.",
        "It hasn't necessarily been proven that the people above them either knew what they were doing or approved it.",
        "We still--I mean, that's still really iffy.",
        "I can't imagine some of the things that were going on, either hadn't been, you know--they'd been given the idea...",
        "Let me bring John Yoo in on that point about enforcing this.",
        "Well, there'd be several ways to enforce it.",
        "I mean, one--first of all, I think as you said, the ban on torture itself is already established by federal criminal law.",
        "So anyone who engaged in torture would already be subject to enforcement by military and by the Justice Department.",
        "So this is a question of how you would enforce the new change in the McCain amendment, which is the ban on cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment.",
        "So, first of all, that would be, I think, through the McCain amendment and through the manual, it would now be a violation of military law for anyone to engage in that activity.",
        "So the people at Abu Ghraib, if they were to do--I think what they did at the time was illegal, but if they were to do what they did then now, that would be illegal under the McCain amendment and then they would be disciplined through the court-martial system, which is the system we have been using.",
        "Now in terms of your questions about who knew higher up, you know, another thing you would not be able to claim, I believe, is that you were acting under legitimate orders now to engage in those kind of interrogation methods if there's a law that prohibits you from doing it.",
        "So to the extent there are people who were in command above the people who committed the crimes at Abu Ghraib, if they were to say, `Look, I was following legitimate orders,' they wouldn't be able to claim that as a defense anymore.",
        "And so we would still go through that method.",
        "I don't think the McCain amendment actually makes it a crime to engage in cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment, so it would still be--more have to be enforced by the president and the head of the CIA and the head of the Defense Department issuing orders down through their agencies to prohibit people from engaging in those activities."

        "Thank you.",
        "Joining us now is White House correspondent David Greene.",
        "He's with us from the White House where preparations are under way for a Christmas party.",
        "David, good of you to take time to speak with us.",
        "Ah, well, apparently he's getting a bowl of punch or something ready to get--we'll get back to him as soon as he gets that.",
        "Let's take another caller.",
        "This is Steve.",
        "Steve with us from Jacksonville in Florida.",
        "Steve?",
        "Yes.",
        "You're on the air, go ahead, please.",
        "Hey, just real quick, I hear throughout this whole conversation the word `agreement,' but I also hear the word `deal.",
        "And of course whenever a deal's made, it involves negotiation and a negotiation means one side's giving and another side's giving.",
        "And it's real obvious that the White House is giving on their side.",
        "I'm kind of wondering what Senator McCain gave up and what kind of an advantage he gave and where to the White House in exchange for this deal.",
        "Michael Hirsh, you would probably know that best.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, it's not completely clear because it's just been announced, but from what I understand, what McCain gave up was pretty minor, essentially allowing interrogators who are non-military protections under what's called Rule 916 of the Manual for Courts-Martial, which would allow them to invoke a defense of superior orders, as I was saying earlier, so they would have the benefit of counsel, as Senator McCain said.",
        "And the reason that that's in this particular bill is specifically for non-military, you know, CIA employees who might be doing interrogations in Defense Department facilities."

        "But Senator McCain also said a pretty thin defense.",

        "We'll have to watch carefully.",
        "Well, amid--accordingly, if I may.",
        "If you keep it quick.",
        "Wouldn't there also then be ahead of some kind of maybe a give-up just in the wording that says that the order giver won't be held accountable for charges that stem from any kind of an action that might go against the new bill?",
        "I'm sure that that's not in the legislation, Steve.",

        "We'd like to know that as best you can.",
        "We got a hint from McCain and from the president.",
        "McCain said that he was satisfied that he will allow legal counsel and certain protections that a reasonable person might view as carrying out orders, but not to contradict the Nuremburg decision, which says that obeying orders is not a sufficient defense.",
        "The president mostly said that there was a deal, and he said he was happy to work with McCain and said that McCain's a good man, and he said there are protections in place that are good enough for him.",
        "It looks like there was a cave-in by the White House, and I think that's what will become clear as time goes on, but I think the president today just wanted to appear with McCain and make it clear that he wanted to send a message at least that the government of the United States does not torture.",
        "He did not make his threat, though, to veto any legislation that included the McCain amendment likely.",
        "What was it--Do you have any sense?--that forced him to back down?",
        "Well, there's no doubt, Neal, that politics certainly made it difficult for the White House.",
        "Whether or not you agree with their position substantively and technically, this was a very hard position politically to sustain.",
        "McCain, as you know, is a maverick Republican senator but one who's very popular and served in Vietnam; was a POW; has experience with the type of things that he's trying to restrict.",
        "And it was hard, even though the president went out there often, even though Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley kept repeating that the United States does not torture, it was hard politically to avoid the impression that this position on the McCain amendment was condoning torture, and I think they just ran out of time and realized that they had to have some sort of compromise and had to have an event like in the Oval Office with the president smiling and sitting down next to McCain.",
        "That, after the vote last night in the House of Representatives, though, as we also heard.",
        "Duncan Hunter, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, is not entirely on board with the deal as yet.",
        "Have we heard anything also from Vice President Cheney, who was the champion of an exemption for CIA?",
        "We haven't yet, and the vice president, as he often is, has been very quiet on this issue.",
        "He--there were reports that he was really heavily lobbying a lot of Republicans in Congress to support an exemption for the CIA, and evidently that lobbying effort didn't turn out to be successful because we see the compromise today.",
        "McCain and Bush do not--their history has not always been quite so sunny.",
        "There was a primary election about--What?--six years ago.",
        "They came together on this out of political reality, I guess.",
        "I guess so.",
        "You know, every time you think that you've kind of gotten a feel for the relationship between President Bush and John McCain, something surprises you.",
        "They were bitter foes and in a presidential primary fight and then they came to some sort of an agreement, and McCain was actually campaigning for the president in the last campaign.",
        "But this time, he didn't hesitate.",
        "He stood up to the White House, and it would appear at this point that he got the White House to move his way.",
