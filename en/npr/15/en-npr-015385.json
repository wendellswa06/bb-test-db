        "Larry Johnson's a former CIA analyst, now CEO of Berg Associates, and we're going to ask Michael Hirsh and John Yoo to stay with us over the break to take more of your calls on this agreement that's been reached to define US policy on interrogation and restrict--indeed, ban--the use of cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment of detainees anywhere in the world.",

        "Right now we're discussing the McCain amendment.",
        "Senator McCain attached an amendment to the defense appropriations bill to ban cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of anyone in US custody anywhere in the world.",
        "The Senate approved that measure by a vote of 90-to-9.",
        "After several weeks of wrangling with the White House, last night the House of Representatives voted in favor of the measure by a wide margin, and today President Bush, who vowed to veto any bill that included the McCain amendment, came around and accepted this as a political reality with minor changes."

        "Well, I think it's very good news.",
        "I think it shows just how far the country has come on this question of torture since 9/11, going from the sort of anything-goes attitude that a lot of people expressed immediately after the attacks to a very profound sense that the torture and cruel treatment hurt America.",
        "And does this language, as far as you know it already--or now at least, does this go far enough, do you think?",

        "Well, I think it's very, very clear language.",
        "It absolutely, clearly without any ands, ifs or buts forbids the sort of cruel and inhumane treatment, which unfortunately has at least for some period of time been authorized by the administration for use against al-Qaeda suspects and prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "The administration can still try to find some complicated or clever legal arguments to get around it; it would be defying the will of Congress if it tried to do that.",
        "So that at this point do you think it's a settled issue?",
        "It's a settled issue as far as the members of Congress who voted for this, and I think it should remain a settled issue as far as the United States is concerned.",
        "I think if the Bush administration tries to find a clever way to get around this, as they have tried to do in similar efforts in the past, it would be a tremendous political mistake and it would continue the self-inflicted damage that the administration's policies have inflicted on the United States.",

        "Good afternoon.",
        "Are there any provisions in the McCain amendment that address the practice of turning over prisoners to allies with less restrictive interrogation techniques?",
        "Michael Hirsh?",
        "Well, no, not in the McCain amendment.",
        "But as I was mentioning earlier, in the companion bill sponsored by Senator Lindsey Graham and co-sponsored by Carl Levin, the Democrat, it does address that, and I think Tom and other human rights activists may be somewhat upset this has not come out yet because it hasn't been announced.",
        "But from what I hear, there may well be a provision in that bill that allows evidence coming from coerced interrogations or coercive techniques, I should say, in other countries to be used against detainees at Gitmo and in other facilities in Afghanistan and Iraq.",
        "And that may, you know, be a subject of some controversy.",
        "Justin, thanks for the call."

        "If the Bush administration adamantly denies ever using torture, why not agree in the first place to the McCain amendment?",
        "John Yoo, let me ask you about that.",
        "Well, the Bush administration always said it wasn't engaging in torture and that it was following the criminal laws prohibiting torture.",
        "The McCain amendment, the real fight about it, is not about torture.",
        "It's about what's called cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment, which is potential course of interrogation methods that are short of torture.",
        "For example, sleep deprivation I think would probably be a good example.",
        "That--there is no federal criminal law that prohibits that.",
        "We have signed a treaty which says the United States should undertake to prevent that, but the Bush administration's position was that there was no legal prohibition on something like sleep deprivation or other forms of cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment short of torture when it came to interrogation of members of al-Qaeda.",
        "And so the McCain amendment, I think, made a big change in the law there, and that's why the Bush administration I think for some time had resisted the amendment.",
        "And also because they thought that style of questioning had utility in the use against these high-ranking al-Qaeda prisoners.",
        "Oh, certainly.",
        "I think, for example, the head of the CIA, Porter Goss, and the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee have said that the interrogation of people like Abu Zybaydah or Khalid Shaikh Mohammed had yielded good intelligence that had saved lives.",
        "But they haven't been and I don't think could be more specific than that in public.",

        "How could anybody possibly know what goes on inside a secret prison?",
        "Tom Malinowski?",
        "Well, that's why they're secret, so that no one can know what goes on inside of them.",
        "You know, I think one of the decisions the administration is going to face in the coming months and years is what to do with these prisoners who've been essentially disappeared into secret detention facilities around the world.",
        "and the only really good reason to hold people in secret, to hide them from International Committee for the Red Cross, for example, is to enable us to use interrogation techniques that we're ashamed of.",
        "The Congress has acted to forbid that kind of treatment, and I think that takes away the need to have these facilities.",
        "Does this mean, then, we're going to have Red Cross inspections of these sites?",
        "Well, the Congress hasn't required that yet.",
        "But the administration's under a lot of pressure.",
        "You know, it know--it's held some of these prisoners in facilities in European countries until recently.",
        "It's now had to move them.",
        "There are very few places around the world that are going to allow the United States to maintain secret facilities given the attention on this issue, the leaks that are coming out.",
        "I think as a practical matter, it's going to be very difficult for the administration to sustain a policy of holding people for years in secret facilities without even access to the Red Cross.",
        "And, Michael Hirsh, the advantage of having these people overseas was, according to the Bush administration's interpretation, that more aggressive questioning techniques were permitted overseas.",
        "As that advantage now is eliminated, is there any purpose to having prisons overseas?",
        "So I'm looking at an orange screen, watching a video, realizing I'm also drinking a cup of coffee.",
        "And it started to make me wonder then why I'm actually trying to, you know, decrease the amount of blue light when the caffeine that I'm drinking in my cup of coffee is probably having a larger effect on my sleep quality.",
        "Also, he really didn't like all those orange screens.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "I think they're going to continue, and I think that the caller's question is right on point.",
        "If they're secret and they remain secret, then how do you know what is being done and how could you enforce a law or a rule against abusive techniques, and the answer is you really can't.",
        "And in fact, you know, going back to this idea that US governments are now going to be limited in--you know, against ticking-time bomb scenarios, I don't think that's true.",
        "I think what this does is set a standard for what's allowable.",
        "I think that, you know, there's a lot of military lore about officers using techniques that contradict military regulation in order to do something heroic like save their unit, save their battalion, and that's, you know, what will happen here.",
        "I could foresee a case, for example, where a CIA officer used some abusive technique against a future Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and was perhaps brought up on charges because he violated this particular new law, but then, you know, was given a slap on the wrist or was perhaps even exonerated because people acknowledge that he did it to, you know, save a city or whatever the case might be.",
        "I mean, that's what's likely to happen.",
        "So I don't think that practically it's going to make that much difference in the small handful of cases that involve these truly dangerous terrorists."
