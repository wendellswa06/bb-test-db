        "John Yoo, before we let you go though, I did want to ask you about that point that Michael was just talking about.",
        "Well, I mean, it's certainly the case as a matter of reality that people in the field, if they come to some decision that they want to employ these course of interrogation methods short of torture or even engage in torture, the law can't prevent them right there from doing it.",
        "But I don't agree with what he said at the end, that that means that people won't feel any restraint.",
        "I mean, the law has penalties for violating it and it will be, I think, present in people's minds that if they were to do that they will be prosecuted after, or they will be brought up on charges, or they will be sanctioned by the military system.",
        "And so, you know, we can't--the law's not going to prevent people on the spot in the field from doing what they feel is necessary to protect their lives or the lives of their unit, but you know, this new standard will I think go into training and people will be trained not to do it, and they will be told very specifically that if they do engage in any kinds of these interrogations, they will be potentially prosecuted and punished.",
        "So I think that will have a significant effect on the way people conduct interrogations in the future.",
        "John Yoo, thanks very much for being with us.",
        "Thank you.",
        "John Yoo, a former lawyer with the Justice Department, currently a professor of law at the University of California at Berkeley, and joined us by phone from his office there.",

        "That's typically a charge of good, old gunpowder or black powder that produces that effect.",

        "Are there ever silent fireworks?",
        "Are there things that make an incredible light display without making a sound?",
        "The sound is largely a function of how tightly you wrap the firework device that's thrown up in the air.",
        "So if you have it very loosely wrapped, a minor pressure inside that firework will open up the package and light the contents.",
        "And there's a lot of interest in these quieter fireworks just because people don't like to bother the neighbors.",
        "They're trying to entertain the people in the immediate vicinity - particularly for theme parks and state fairs that have nightly fireworks shows over a period of time, and every night, those booms can start to, you know, to perhaps bother the residents around the area and so they ask, can you quiet them down?",
        "And the industry can do that.",

        "There really hasn't been much for a few decades.",
        "We have the boom, the bang.",
        "We have the pyrotechnic whistle effect where you press a chemical mixture into a small tube, and as that burns, it pulses and it produces gas products, much as you create a whistle with a mechanical whistle.",
        "And then the newest effect is really the crackling effect where you have a chemical mixture that burns layer to layer to layer and crackles - gives a repeating bang, bang, bang, snap, snap snap.",
        "That's probably the latest thing in sound.",
        "Do you have a favorite fireworks sound?"

        "It is scary, David.",
        "My jaw dropped when I heard that number.",
        "Now, even if we take a more conservative estimate than Chi - let's say a third of his estimate - that's still 3,000 lives a year.",
        "It's an enormous number of people."
