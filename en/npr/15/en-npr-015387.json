        "So, Shankar, why is this happening?",
        "Well, the biggest factor of course, David, is that people simply drive a lot less when gas prices are high.",
        "Chi told me that he himself started this line of research when gas prices spiked in 2008, and he noticed a change in his own behavior.",
        "Instead of taking a lot of separate trips to home and shopping and to pick up his kid, he would start to combine all these trips into one trip.",

        "I pick up my kid from day care.",

        "But now, with the gasoline price so high, I try to do all the things together - just do it in one trip.",
        "Well, that's a good analogy.",
        "For generations now, the breeders have been breeding for speed and in the back of their mind maybe they're thinking, yeah, resilience would be good, stamina would be good.",
        "But first and foremost it's brilliance.",
        "And I think it's something the industry needs to take a look at, the breeders.",
        "There's many components.",
        "This is one.",
        "They need to look in the mirror.",
        "Are we breeding a sound horse?",
        "And you do see some farms that try to do that and will bring in these stallions that could infuse stamina and nobody wants to send their mares to them.",
        "After Barbaro went down, a lot of tracks switched to a cushion surface I understand rather than hard packed dirt.",
        "Well, synthetic surfaces or artificial surfaces.",
        "It was in the works even before Barbaro but certainly, you know, in the wake of that California mandated all their tracks by 2008 be an artificial surface.",
        "The jury's still out though on how the injury rates compare.",
        "They're still so new.",
        "And I have seen some catastrophic injuries on the synthetic tracks.",
        "Jennie Rees, what story are you writing for tomorrow morning's Courier-Journal?",
        "I'm writing about Big Brown and what a big race, you know, he ran and can he win the Triple Crown.",
        "And one thing Larry Jones, the trainer of Eight Belles, did say this morning was he feels bad for the Big Brown camp because of what happened with Eight Belles, this very gallant Philly that finished second in the Kentucky Derby and ended up dying.",

        "Shortly before final passage last week of the war spending bill, President Bush says he'll veto, West Virginia Democrat Robert Byrd rose on the Senate floor.",
        "Byrd chided the president for trying, in Byrd's words, to scare the pants off the public by suggesting the bill could lead to death and destruction in America.",
        "What utter nonsense.",
        "What hogwash.",
        "And yet, right after Byrd spoke, Texas Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison repeated the president's claim saying if terrorists are not defeated in Iraq, they will follow U.S.",

        "There will be genocide.",

        "The longer we stay there, the more we're going to create people who will volunteer to come here.",
        "That same point was made in the National Intelligence Estimate released last fall, says Senate Intelligence Committee member and Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden.",

        "So I have to think about the fact that the National Intelligence Estimate is reporting that their policies are the ones creating more terrorists.",

        "There's no national security analyst that's really credible who thinks that people are going to come from Iraq and attack the United States, but that's a credible scenario.",
        "That's retired Army lieutenant colonel James Carafano, a specialist in international security threats at the conservative Heritage Foundation.",
        "Carafano calls asserting that terrorists will follow U.S.",
        "troops home naive and poor rhetoric.",
        "It's not that if the United States leaves Iraq that terrorists are going to come to the United States.",

        "The problems, they're going to go and fester.",

        "The principal activity was organized around a series of teams.",
        "We had a physics team, which would be responsible for designing the bomb, and we had several other teams: a team that operated a foundry that would cast the uranium metal; we had a team that would put together the gun mechanism, this was a very simple atomic device that just essentially slam two lumps of uranium together.",
        "The real thing you need though, is enriched uranium, to make a bomb.",

        "Well that's the hardest part and that's the place we think we should spend most of our efforts.",
        "But, at the same time, there is at least one case where there was a theft of a substantial amount of highly-enriched uranium.",
        "Fortunately, the fellows who stole it tried to sell it to some Czech police officers.",
        "And so, that worked out all right.",

        "Why can't the Iranians get one next week?",
        "Well in the case of Iran, the reason that Iran hasn't been able to build a bomb is that they don't have the fissile material.",

        "In terms of North Korea they have had a bomb, probably for ten years, because they acquired plutonium - which they separated from the spent fuel of a nuclear reactor.",
        "The decision of the North Koreans to threaten to do that was what precipitated the crisis in the early 1990s that the Clinton Administration intervened to stop.",
        "I guess it's how to think like a terrorist.",
        "But still, the calculations that I find you making here are disturbing in a weird kind of way.",
