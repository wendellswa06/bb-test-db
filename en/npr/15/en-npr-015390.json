        "And what does it have to do with the nature of the people in that room?",
        "And we think of the White House press corps, of course, as the people who sit in the Brady breathing room everyday and fire off questions.",

        "It is, and I mean, one of the interesting things, I think - you know, the context of this is there were a lot of sort of allegations, both by Hillary Clinton and John McCain and others, during the campaign that Barack Obama was the favorite son of the media, that, you know, that he had received overwhelmingly positive treatment.",
        "And so, against this context, the situation changes.",

        "And another issue you've been writing about is who is reporting on the president.",
        "I've spent a good bit of time since Obama has been running looking at the complexion of the Washington press corps, and it's disappointing that it's overwhelmingly white.",
        "And what difference does that make?",
        "It makes a difference because the person who brings you news also brings something of himself to the news.",
        "And if you have only one slice of the population, you get - you exclude a larger, broader swath of what's going on in a society.",
        "I'd give you two quick examples that sort of illustrate that: Back during the campaign, there was a moment when Barack Obama greeted his wife by bumping fist with her.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "And that was wildly discussed, and some people called it a terrorist fist bump.",
        "Very few people described it as an act of affection.",

        "But when you have largely white, older, middle-aged men commenting about those kinds of events, they distort the real meaning of it and bring their interpretation to it.",
        "Another example - we saw Obama during his inauguration where he - well, the benediction, which was given by Reverend Joseph Lowery of Atlanta - he began it with a verse.",
        "Very few of the commentators understood what he was talking about when he was actually reciting the opening stanzas of \"\"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\"\" also known as \"\"The Negro National Anthem,\"\" and he ended his benediction with an African-American folk rhyme or saying that almost people all across the country who are African-American understood.",
        "Had there been more commentators to be able to explain both of those, it would have brought a dimension to what was going on that was totally missed in most of the media reports of those things.",
        "First heard that - an old Big Bill Broonzy song, so quite some time ago.",
        "Nevertheless - so what you're suggesting is people who might be younger or Hispanic or African-American, not necessarily that they would be more biased in favor of President Obama, they would just understand the cultural context a little bit better?",
        "Yeah, I think that we get flummoxed when we start thinking that race infers some sort of bias or privilege, and that's not what I'm talking about at all.",
        "What I'm talking about is understanding, and race does contribute to our understanding of the society.",
        "Anyone who would deny that is completely missing what's gone on in this country over the last 400 years.",
