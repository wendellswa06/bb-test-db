        "Yeah, hi, Neal.",

        "The question about whether or not the media is tough enough or not tough enough?",
        "In my opinion, I think the media should just ask questions that extract facts, keep their opinions and their translations to themselves.",
        "Let me form my own opinion.",
        "What kind of facts do you mean?",
        "Uh huh.",
        "My basic comment is one of the most frustrating things I've seen over the years watching reporters deal with politicians is they don't ask the obvious follow-up question.",
        "I don't know how many times I've gritted my teeth in anger going, ask the basic question!",
        "You know, the simple follow-up like, you know, when you hear a politician clearly reading from a talking point or campaigning during the interview or something, you know, they need to be called on the carpet for that.",
        "And that just drives me crazy when I see that.",
        "I even heard it on NPR this morning.",
        "Well, I'll let that go, but Sam Fulwood, you've asked a few of those questions, and sometimes it's really hard to get a politician off answer 14B.",
        "There's a couple of things I think people need to understand.",
        "If you're watching the interaction of the media and a politician, particularly at the highest level, like the president, what people don't understand is that the president isn't there to answer our questions.",
        "He is there to sell whatever it is that he has to say.",
        "They have a strategy, they have a set of talking points, and the really skilled politicians never, ever deviate from whatever it is.",
        "You could ask them, you know, what is today?",
        "And they will tell you about whatever it is that they want to talk about.",
        "The classic answer is - well, that's a fascinating question, but, you know, the really interesting point is...",
        "That's right.",
        "And so that, by definition, the reporter is always asking a question that the politician does not want to answer, and only when they make a mistake in answering a question, do you have that gotcha moment, which reporters live for but everybody else hates.",
        "So, it sort seems as though it's this adversarial thing that you're really trying to get the gotcha question to get them off of point."

        "So, maybe we should hope that the news conference was Vice President Biden?",
        "Well, there you have it.",
        "Now you will see a lot more of the gotcha things, because he tends to go off script.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And...",
        "And a news conference really is not an ideal way to get news.",
        "The format is actually quite staged, and the president is up at the podium and controls who gets to ask a question, who gets to ask the follow-up question.",
        "And on top of that, especially for something like a primetime news conference, the reporters are doing some posturing.",
        "They've come in with questions that they want to ask.",
        "They're not necessarily going to follow up because with a follow-up to the response that they got to the first question, they're going to ask their second question.",
        "So, it's a really problematic format.",
        "I was - I would have much preferred, you know, President Obama to sit down for, for instance, a long-form sit-down interview with somebody over a longer period of time.",
        "Those are the ones that - where you can possibly dig in a little bit deeper, especially with this stimulus issue.",
        "You know, obviously the president tried to address that, you know, the other day, and instead, all the questions were, you know, understandably about Daschle and about Tom Daschle…",
        "Sure.",
        "Stepping down and the tax problem.",
        "But you know, even - he still was only giving these anchors 10 minutes.",
        "I'd rather him sit down with somebody who actually who actually knows a lot about the economy and who will push him beyond those talking points into an area that I actually think would be much more persuasive terrain for the president and for the country.",
        "So, you're talking about sort of a Nixon/Frost type of interview...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Which is exactly what most politicians are loath to do.",
        "It's interesting, when you look at a campaign for example, and all of the candidates will trot out and go and talk to David Letterman, for example, and you're more likely to get an honest, candid, revealing answer when you're sitting at David Letterman's couch or you're sitting with Oprah than you are when you are with someone in the Washington press corps."

        "But, Sam, you're…",
        "Let me just raise one other possibility, and that's if they're talking with actual voters, the electronic versions of the town hall meeting.",
        "If the president were to come on a program like this one - one thing to dodge questions from a journalist, it's another to evade questions from actual people calling up and asking questions on the telephone.",
        "That's exactly the point, is that they want to sell themselves in the best possible way.",
        "When you're playing this dance with the reporter, there's too much noise that gets in the way.",
        "But when you're really going before the public, they become a little unglued.",

        "I'm just saying, Sam's cynicism is certainly understandable, given our track record over the last several presidencies.",
        "But I do think, you know, President Obama has at least said things that would lead us to hold him to a higher standard.",
        "I would like to challenge him to actually answer these questions.",
        "I think we can hope, at least at this first news conference, that he'll do that.",
        "We may be disappointed, but I think we can hope.",
        "The other issue - I think you're absolutely right.",
        "I mean, another format that I think would have been terrific for getting at some of these issues is, you know, a road show.",
        "Get Obama out of town, go and talk in a town hall and not, you know, not the Bush-style town halls where everybody was, you know, pre-screened for agreement on the way in, but a genuine town hall.",

        "Facts are good.",
        "I think a lot of people - facts are great, but I think most Americans don't like facts, and they would not listen to people asking just the who, what and where questions.",

        "But Sam, isn't it a critical question to say that - there was a big argument, for example, about whether there should be money in the stimulus package to reseed the National Mall, you know, and you say, well, who, what, where, when?",
        "That's pretty simple.",
        "Don't you want to ask somebody why do you want to reseed the National Mall and how could this possibly stimulate the economy?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think that the journalists wouldn't be doing their jobs.",
        "But you get callers - you get readers saying, don't ask that because they feel that the why question and the how question is reflecting some bias from the journalists, rather than trying to illicit more information.",
        "I'd just like to say that asking about the Mall is actually the wrong question, period.",
        "That - you know, this is a package that is absolutely gigantic that people don't completely understand why it's needed, how it will work, how it can create jobs.",

        "If he does bad, it makes them look bad, if he does good, it makes them look good.",
        "I have no expectations that they will objectively cover his administration.",

        "There's been, you know, probably a lot more written about Daschle than there has been about, you know, green energy.",
