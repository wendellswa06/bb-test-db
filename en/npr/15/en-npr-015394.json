        "Yes, I am, and in what is not quite sunny but remarkably warm Manchester, New Hampshire.",
        "Oh, you'll take it.",
        "Maybe it's a little different from New Hampshire primaries in the past.",
        "But, you know, I don't have to tell you, Ron, that you know that John F.",
        "Kennedy's father said that he was going to sell his son like a box of soap flakes, I think is the quote.",
        "Has a lot changed since that election, when Joe Kennedy was talking about his son like he was a product?",
        "I lost my husband last year to ALS - Lou Gehrig's disease.",
        "Moyer would like more attention paid to the needs of LGBT seniors.",
        "Well, the marketing aspect of politics has only become more intense since Joe Kennedy's day.",
        "Of course, at that point, television was just coming into its own and had not yet come to campaign dominance.",
        "But of course, since then, it has become the principal instrument by which all political candidates at this level disseminate their views and contest with other candidates.",
        "So television runs the show.",
        "A lot of people, I think, feel that our entire presidential nominating and electing process has essentially become a long-running TV reality show.",
        "Do you think that the campaigns themselves if, in a moment of honesty, would they tell you what we have to do is position a candidate who the people like the most as a person, or would they tell you what we have to do is think about a set of issues that the people will respond to the best?",
        "Normally, you would get an intense argument, a pitched battle over that very question.",
        "But not right now because in this 24 or 48, 72-hour period, we are seeing one of those phenomena that comes along every so many decades in American politics, where a particular individual for a certain period of time -very hard to predict how long it will be - captures the imagination of a large proportion of the voters, at least in a few states in the primary process.",
        "Whether or not it'll be a national phenomenon is yet to be seen, but Barack Obama is ripping through New Hampshire much the way he did in the final days of the Iowa campaign, and vastly increasing the number of people who would consider voting for him tomorrow in the primary, or consider voting for him in November for president, or just be able to imagine him being president."

        "And is he a collection of issues, or is he a cut of his jib type appeal to his candidacy?",
        "Well, with all respect to his views on the issues, and I'm not saying he hasn't many views on many issues and plans and proposals for things to do, but that's not the sum of his candidacy.",
        "In fact, his candidacy is all about transcending that sort of talk and transcending the kind of laundry list of things that you want to do and change that most politicians like to rely on or tend to rely on, and instead, offering something that is, well, it's more music than it is prose.",
        "It's more a kind of almost mysterious appeal to some portion of people that is not entirely rational.",
        "Now, it's not said, in a lack of respect, for the rational aspects of Barack Obama's campaign.",
        "The man is a trained lawyer.",
        "He's a United States senator.",
        "He can make a rational argument.",

        "Maybe not so much in Iowa and New Hampshire, where the population of people who are non-white is quite small, but I think there will be people, who in the course of these primaries, want to vote for Barack Obama based on his racial background.",
        "I do agree with the caller.",
        "I am surprised that there has not been more discussion of the importance for women, for the history of women in America, the history of women in all world politics, of the notion that the Democrats have come quite close, have had a front-runner for months who is a woman and who is bidding fair to become the first woman president of the United States.",
        "That got a lot of attention around the world.",
        "And if she does stumble in these early events, and if she is frustrated in her effort to become president, many people will see that in terms of sexual politics, gender politics.",
        "Okay.",
