        "You know, I'm really disappointed at what - at Ms. Mack's, the way that she describes this process, I feel like I'm listening to somebody playing a campaign to sell laundry detergent when she talks about the candidate's brand.",
        "I think that what that does is that whole process cheapens the political process.",
        "That's not to say that I don't think it's effective.",
        "I do think it's effective, but I think it's very unfortunate.",
        "Anne Mack, what do you have to say that?",
        "Well, it is called a campaign for a reason.",
        "And it is building their brands along the duration of this campaign.",
        "There is a reason why a number of the candidates are changing their messaging in the days leading up to New Hampshire.",
        "It's because they see that Barack Obama's messaging worked.",
        "So they're doing an about face, and Hillary Clinton, for instance, is no longer emphasizing experience; she's emphasizing change.",
        "Mitt Romney is emphasizing the idea that Washington is broken.",
        "They are definitely glomming onto the idea of change.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I think that again, she's using the same kind of terminology when she said something like messaging.",
        "I want to know what somebody's position is, you know.",
        "I think that one of the problems is, you know, and I wasn't a supporter of either Joe Biden or Chris Dodd, but those are the two most experienced guys in the Democratic race, and instead, the front-runner is Barack Obama.",
        "And the thing that I know most about him is I know the least about him.",
        "And I really don't know if I would vote for him or not.",
        "I live in Kentucky, so we're not really a player in this whole primary process, so I haven't had to make up my mind.",
        "But some of the things that he said bother me, some of the things he says I agree with, but he doesn't have the record.",
        "He is the one we're least able as voters to predict how he's going to act in the future because he has the shortest track record.",
        "And I think that treating this whole thing, like, you know, a soap commercial…",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "…is harmful for the process, and I think that's exactly why we are where we are, and I think it's harmful.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, thanks very much for the call there, Chris.",

        "All right, I just wanted to say I agree with one of your callers earlier that I think issues are an absolutely essential part of the process.",
        "And I look at the issues, however, I feel like our country is in a state that a charismatic and inspirational leader is somebody that we really need, so that we can get behind somebody that we can love, somebody like JFK.",
        "And I definitely think that in terms of issues, we go to somebody in our community and look for somebody that's really digging down to the core of the issues.",
        "It's difficult for people like me who are apparent to get all the information necessary to determine how the issues are going.",
        "And so I'm really looking at charisma right now.",
        "Well, do you worry that a sufficiently or overly charismatic candidate can sort of fool you on his stance on the issues?",
        "Absolutely, and that's what we - that's where the issues come in, to kind of help us get behind somebody fully.",
        "I don't want to see somebody - I don't think that our country is in the position to watch somebody that's going to be dry and difficult to love and get behind.",
        "I'm a widow, so I don't have anybody to fall back on.",
        "And if I'm not able to take care of myself, who's going to take care of me?",
        "And not only are more people living together...",
        "I think that we need somebody that we can truly love and that's where I think the issues are going to come in as backup.",
        "And we need to go to our community members that we really trust and look up to in terms of digging down into the core of the issues and ask them who they think is somebody that we can truly support when it comes to health care, Iraq War, et cetera.",
        "Okay.",
        "Thanks very much for the call there, Nathan.",
        "And, Ron Elving, any reaction to that?"

        "I want to endorse what Chris, the earlier caller from Kentucky, was saying.",
        "I think he really eloquently laid out the challenge to our process, that the television - and I really do believe it is the medium of television that has done this.",
        "And …",
        "And you don't say that just because you're a radio professional?",
        "Well, radio was doing its part and would have probably been as effective, but television just had this enormous power for a number of decades, where people were getting very little political message anyplace else.",
        "Sure, they looked at the newspaper - maybe they looked at the newspaper endorsement but it did not have the power to get across what the candidates stood for and how they did it - their manner, their personality, the television had.",
        "Now, we're moving into another media age in which television is just one arrow in a quiver of many ways that a candidate can try to reach the voters.",
        "And I think that's a good thing.",
        "Now, with respect to whether or not we're going to see the effects of that in this particular vote, in this particular election, I think we're seeing a charisma election right now.",
        "And it has things in common with JFK.",
        "And when the caller says, yes, the issues matter, but he also wants somebody whom he likes, somebody he wants to see, somebody he wants to hear from over the next four years, I think that's enormously powerful to the American voter no matter what their education level, what their income level.",
        "That's one of the things we really care about.",
        "I mean, in the current media age, aren't they all charisma elections?",
        "This is the old would - would Abraham Lincoln have had a chance, given the current state of the media.",
        "But if you look back at all the races, doesn't the guy who seems to have more charisma, however the most Americans define it, seem to have the upper hand at least, since, maybe - oh, I don't know, even Eisenhower beat Stevenson.",
        "Yes.",
        "And I think that Ronald Reagan stands out as a kind of paragon of that - clearly, that man had a communication skill and a connection with the average voter that transcended party.",
        "And that made a huge difference.",
        "And it reinvented the Republican Party, and it reinvented conservatism in our politics for generation - for a generation, perhaps more than a generation.",
        "We have not seen anyone else with anything approaching that kind of charisma.",
        "Although Bill Clinton would be the closest thing to it over on the Democratic side, he has not yet established that he was redefining American politics in the way Ronald Reagan did.",
        "He tried.",
        "He is still trying.",
        "Now, it's being done to some degree through his wife's campaign.",
        "We'll see whether or not that's ultimately successful.",
        "But I don't think it's ever fair to say that somebody who is highly charismatic is only about charisma.",
        "I don't think we've had a president who is only about charisma.",
        "Ronald Reagan stood for a lot of things, agree or disagree, you have to say he stood for certain concepts, certain ways of seeing the world, and he made that stick.",
        "I think as people who watch politics define charisma; charisma without substance is not charisma.",
        "But let's, you know, we've been talking about trying to get inside the head of the voter and that is an abstract term, except for a guy like Dr. Marco Iacoboni, who's a researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles Semel Institute for Neuroscience."

        "That's right.",
        "What do you see?",
        "Well, we did an experiment with brain imaging.",
        "That was done in September.",
        "And that's something to keep in mind because things change quite a bit in this campaign in the last few months.",
        "So what we did was to take voters that are called swing voters because they have not made up their mind.",
        "They're open to choose a candidate from either party.",
        "And we show them a series of pictures of the major candidates from all parties.",
        "But again, keep in mind that we did this in September.",
        "So, for instance, we didn't choose any picture from Huckabee because at that time, he wasn't considered a major candidate.",
        "And now he is.",
        "And we used brain imaging and so we looked into their brains while they were looking at these pictures.",
        "And while you're looking, what parts of the brain are you looking to see if they light up?",
        "Well, we can look at the whole brain but certainly, some brain regions are so more important than others.",
        "So, for instance, when we looked at - the other thing we did was to ask questions about what they felt about the candidate.",
        "And so one thing we found was that, for instance, when our voters were looking at the pictures of Hillary Clinton, it turns out that the voters that rated Clinton lowly, they had low ratings for Clinton at activity in this brain region that is often associated with conflict, internal conflict.",
        "So we interpreted that as suggesting that the people that gave low ratings to Clinton, they don't feel too good about that."

        "Mm-hmm.",

        "Well, they feel conflicted themselves.",
        "Okay.",
        "So they feel bad to give her a low rating.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "What about some of the other candidates?",
        "Well, another thing that we found was that, you know, these are swing voters and it's - you can see that they also - they have swing brains, in a way, because the way we did the experiment, we had - first, we showed the pictures, then we showed them a little stump speech from each candidate.",
        "And then we showed them the pictures again and we want to see whether there's a difference in the activity of the brain before and after watching the video.",
        "Okay.",
        "And what we found, for instance, was that Giuliani, what he shows is that in our men voters, swing voters, Giuliani had a very strong response in the brain of male voters before the speech but much less after the speech.",
        "In women, it was the opposite.",
        "Giuliani shows that there's very little response in women's brains before the speech.",
        "But after the speech, there's a much stronger response.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "And if - I don't know if any political consultants have asked you to give them advice.",
        "But is there any advice that you could give based on what you've seen by watching people's brains?",
        "Well, it's really hard to say, I mean, one thing that was interesting was that when we, again, this was in September, and when we did the study in September, what we found was that, for instance, Barack Obama, at - in our female subjects, he showed no response whatsoever.",
        "Remember, at that point, Barack's campaign was probably at the lowest point of the campaign.",
        "And since then, he really changed the tone of the campaign and you can see the difference that he made."
