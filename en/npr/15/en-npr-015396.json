        "So in a way, yeah, you can use brain imaging to give some advice to candidates and consultants because it seems that what we saw in the brain at that point really reflected what was going on in the campaign.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And I want to throw it to Ron Elving.",
        "This brain imaging, do you know if the campaigns are aware of this sort of research that's going on?",
        "I imagine some of the people within the campaigns are somewhat familiar with some of the literature and would love to make use of it.",
        "But I think it's probably some distance yet away from practical application for them.",
        "And do you think that candidates themselves would say, no way am I just going to say the things that light up certain parts of people's brains; that doesn't fit my definition of what being authentic is?",
        "Possibly.",
        "But I think politicians are also inclined to say things that make the part of people's heads known as their mouths turn upward.",
        "And I've seen this over and over and over, when a politician is talking to a group of people and one line is not working, he'll work for another, look for another, keep pushing until he finds the line that does light up the faces he's looking at, does bring those smiles, does show him bright eyes and, of course, eventually applause.",
        "But you're watching the face.",
        "You're watching the face and when those faces light up, that's the issue, that's the line, that's the message you want to send.",
        "It's like a comedian working his act out on the road before being booked at the big room at Caesars'.",

        "And I asked her if she thought the country was ready for a black president, and her response was that she thought they would elect a black man before they would ever elect a woman, which took me by surprise.",
        "I'd have to say if I was - felt more of an affinity towards any group, it's probably more towards being a female than it is towards my race.",

        "However, I'm unsure that the way she's running her campaign, if she's going to have a chance to get the nomination, and that has raised my awareness and it is a concern.",

        "Well, I'm not surprised that your callers would definitely be listening with a keen ear to the issues, more so than the general population because they're probably well-versed in politics.",
        "But at the same time, I do think that emotion plays into our decision-making.",
        "Just as it does in our decision-making when we go to the store, and I know that caused an uproar to liken politicians to products.",
        "But they are marketing themselves much in the same way we market products.",
