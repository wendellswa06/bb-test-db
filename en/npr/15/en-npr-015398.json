        "Hi, Frank.",
        "Hi, Steve.",
        "So eight people in custody - that suggests - what?",
        "- some kind of a network here?",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "What they said yesterday, the Manchester Police, is they're investigating a terror network.",
        "And to make this very clear to the listeners, basically what they're talking about is a terrorist cell operating in Manchester, which the police clearly didn't know about.",
        "And they're trying - they're playing catch up.",
        "They're trying to find people now and figure out what actually went on and obviously make sure there isn't another bomb out there.",
        "They're raided an Airbnb yesterday, blew the door off there.",
        "But it's very hard for the public here to make sense of this.",
        "There are no names, no charges, no narrative that the police are giving.",
        "The public is largely in the dark.",
        "And that seems to be the style of British police in contrast to, say, the American police in these cases where they provide a lot of information.",
        "Regular updates on the investigation.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "This leads to so many follow ups, Frank.",
        "One of the myths - you said a terror cell appears to be operating in Manchester.",
        "Does it reach beyond Manchester to other parts of the world?",
        "Well, we don't know.",
        "There's a lot of people looking into that right now.",
        "The most recent events from - we got yesterday is actually out of Libya.",
        "Remember, the bomber, his family is originally from Libya.",
        "His name is Salman Abedi, and Libya's RADA, it's a counterterrorism force, they actually arrested the bomber's father, whose name is Ramadan.",
        "And they claim in a statement that they interrogated the bomber's brother, Hashem (ph).",
        "They say that he has confessed to being connected to ISIS.",
        "They say this in the statement.",
        "That said, we should take this all with a big, big - a lot of salt because there's no sign that the British have been involved in this, and interrogation in the region often will involve torture.",
        "So we should be very suspicious of what we're hearing out of Libya.",
        "To borrow from the language of computers, there are, for the few Westerners living in Baghdad, two basic default settings.",
        "There's lockdown; that's when you choose not to go anywhere because of the risk of being kidnapped, shot or blown up.",
        "And there's fort-hopping.",
        "No one dislikes lockdown more than the Iraqi capital's small corps of foreign correspondents.",
        "These are journalists who live discreetly in the city itself and not in the Green Zone, the giant, tightly sealed citadel in which the US Embassy and the Iraqi transitional government are based.",
        "Lockdown means being confined to lodgings.",
        "To get a picture of the violence that's going on in Baghdad, sometimes within earshot, we rely on mobile telephones and e-mail, on the Arabic-language media and, crucially, on brave Iraqi colleagues who act as our eyes and ears on the streets.",
        "It's frustrating, claustrophobic work of the kind many journalists go overseas to avoid.",
        "As we labor away behind our desks, reluctant prisoners of the conflict, we dream of better days, of fort-hopping days."

        "In the residential boulevards of central Baghdad, you see forts wrapped in high concrete barricades and razor wire.",

        "Sometimes during these fort-hopping expeditions, we'll drop in on an Iraqi politician.",
        "Sometimes it'll be an academic or a businessman or a colleague.",
