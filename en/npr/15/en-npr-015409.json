        "You know, after all, you know, what is it that we did, Palestinians, to warrant this kind of action by way of retaliation?",
        "What we did was to go to the United Nations, the custodian of international law and legitimacy.",
        "So I think the response needs to be one that is shaped by the need to take advantage of what happened to build on it as opposed to continue to be scornful about it and to really be driven by sense of anger, frustration or wanting to basically retaliate.",

        "You know, it isn't really.",

        "Whether there's a process that they're talking about, whether it's substance that they're talking about, no one can - in their right mind, whether Palestinian or Israeli say they're against negotiations because the substance of what is between us or has been between us since we had entered into this Oslo framework going back to 1993 is a path of negotiations to a settlement, a fair and lasting settlement, one that guarantees Israel's security and on the other hand provides us, Palestinians, with the opportunity to live as free people with dignity in a free Palestine.",
        "That's the essence of it.",
        "The process has gone on way too long without it being productive.",
        "Not only that, but actually it has been a story of disappointment that that's not really outside disillusionment.",
        "The occupational regime has not become loser.",
        "If anything, the occupation has become more deeply entrenched.",
        "So the question as to what it is that we are really involved in here, a process that is credible enough, strong enough to deliver on that which we all want to see happen, an end to Israeli occupation, security for all Palestinians and Israelis, a lasting settlement, sustainable one and all.",
        "On the one hand, a process about this or substantive engagement.",
        "When you really actually look at what has been happening on the ground, it's very difficult to view the process as having been strong enough to deliver, either by us, Palestinians, or Israelis.",
        "So something needs to happen in order to really put things on track.",

        "We have been.",

        "What's your answer to that question?",
        "I believe it would be wrong strategy to wait for the perfect alignment of stars before we begin to do meaningful things in a substantive way to produce outcomes.",
        "There's a serious problem, agree.",
        "But it is not something that precludes the possibility of a meaningful negotiation between the sides.",
        "Why do I say so?",
        "Negotiations are supposed to take place between the PLO, Palestine Liberation Organization, acting on behalf of all Palestinians.",
        "It had that power.",
        "It was empowered to do this, actually by virtue of the Oslo Accords going back to 1993 when Israel - government of Israel then - recognized the PLO as representative - legitimate representative of Palestinian people throughout the world, not only in Palestine.",
        "Now, that body's still there, and it is the body empowered to negotiate on behalf of all Palestinians.",
        "I think as people begin to see the process moving in a serious and credible enough manner, that cannot but have positive ramifications for the prospect of reunification of our country.",
        "It's something, by the way, that I - before the Israelis would say - is absolutely necessary if we are going to have a state.",
        "Because without Gaza, the Palestinian state is going to lose much of its appeal to many Israelis because those who are in favor of two-state solution in Israel - most of them anywhere - argue the case as one of an Israeli influence on demographic grounds.",
        "If Gaza is allowed to continue to drift along the path of becoming a standalone entity, that and to this count would mean that some 1.7 million Palestinians are dealt out of that demographic equation."

        "Since you've been prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, your approach has been to focus on institution building and creating structures even in the face of pretty overwhelming obstacles.",

        "So when people ask what's the point, what do you say?",
        "If a state is what we want, and if it is really our overriding objective - we Palestinians that is - it makes a great deal of sense for us to get busy building one, even under occupation.",

        "There were skeptics from the very beginning.",

        "With the passage of time, with us delivering on the objectives of getting our institutions to be institutions of a functional state and all, but with no prospect of the occupation ending soon, a lot of people - a lot more people started to buy into the theory that, well, you know, this is about adapting to the reality of prolonged occupation.",
