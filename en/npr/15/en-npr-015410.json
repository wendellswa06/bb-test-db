        "means for the Palestinian Authority.",
        "Israel and the U.S.",
        "strongly opposed that resolution.",
        "We asked Israel's ambassador to Washington, Michael Oren, why his government sees it as a threat.",
        "Because it represents an end run to the peace process.",
        "You know, the Palestinian Authority signed on agreements with Israel that said that there'd be no alternative to direct negotiations.",
        "The only way to reach a two-state solution for two people was for Israelis and Palestinians to sit and to work out the very complex issues between us.",
        "If you just run to the U.N.",
        "and declare that you're a state, you get the territory without giving the peace, you really haven't advanced the peace process.",
        "You've set it back.",
        "Those are also violations of the Palestinians commitments to the United States.",
        "The United States is cosignatory to these agreements that say that there's no alternative to direct negotiations, and that's why President Obama also opposed the Palestinian move in the United Nations.",
        "How, though, will nonmember observer status substantively change the political equation?",
        "Well, they really won't.",
        "And the only way it could be changed is if the Palestinians try to use this nonmember status in the General Assembly as a means of going to international bodies like the International Criminal Court and try to accuse Israel of war crimes; in which case, that will force us to take countermeasures that we don't want to take.",
        "Actually, what we want to do...",
        "Countermeasures, what do you mean?",
        "Well, the Palestinian Authority - President Abbas has now claimed he is the president of a state that includes the Gaza Strip.",
        "And the Gaza Strip is an organization called Hamas that has fired thousands of rockets against millions of Israeli citizens.",
        "Now, that is a war crime by any definition.",
        "And we could take him to an international court and accuse him of war crimes too.",
        "We don't want to do that.",
        "We want to negotiate with him.",
        "And if he declares his state and it's a symbolic measure, if he keeps it as a symbolic measure and sits down and negotiate with us, he'll find us to be a ready and eager partner and very anxious to reach this two-state solution."

        "You say this just as news has come out this week of several thousand more housing units to be developed in the West Bank territory that the Palestinians see as their future state.",
        "So I mean, put yourself in their shoes for a moment.",
        "They have seen these settlements expand and expand and expand throughout this peace process, or so-called peace process, for the past 20 years, and it hasn't really changed.",
        "I mean, they don't have what they have sought.",
        "What other options do they have at this point?",
        "I mean, what else can a Palestinian leader do?",
        "The settlements altogether take up something less than 2 percent of the entire West Bank.",
        "But settlements are part of the border issue, the part of the territorial issues.",
        "Those are one of what we call the core issues that have to be discussed at the negotiating table.",
        "But...",
        "And if they keep on expanding during these non-discussions, doesn't it make it harder to dismantle them?",
        "We understand that the Palestinians don't like settlement expansion.",
        "We get it.",
        "But there are many things the Palestinians do that we don't like.",
        "They name town squares after suicide bombers.",
        "They instruct their kids...",
        "But that's easier to change than a settlement.",
        "But they haven't changed it.",
        "And it's educating a young generation that Israel has no legitimacy, that terror is the way to approach Israel, rather than peace negotiations.",
        "It's a serious problem.",
        "We don't make it a precondition.",
        "We say, come, all right, let's talk about it.",
        "Let's sit at the table.",
        "We don't like some of the things you do.",
        "We understand that you don't like some of the things we do.",
        "That's the nature of negotiations.",
        "We are willing to discuss everything.",
        "Everything's on the table, and just join us.",
        "The last four years, they've been refusing to join us.",
        "You ask what the Palestinians can do - they can negotiate.",
        "But what incentive do they have, Ambassador, I mean, if the settlement expansion is so problematic to them and many countries in the international community would argue it's a violation of international law, why would they negotiate under those circumstances?",
        "We froze settlement negotiations, settlement expansions, for 10 months in an attempt to induce the Palestinians to come to the negotiating table.",
        "They did not avail themselves at that time.",
        "So even when we freeze settlements, they're not negotiating.",
        "They may not be negotiating for many reasons, perhaps related to some of the changes going on in the Middle East.",
        "But we strongly believe that the only way for the Palestinians to change the reality on the ground, to actually have a real Palestinian state, not a virtual Palestinian state, the great way to respond to Hamas, to terror, which cannot give the Palestinians any future other than continued strife, which is not investing in education, which is not investing in infrastructure, the only way to do that is through genuine peace.",
        "And the only way to reach genuine peace is through direct and candid negotiations."

        "Now, the fact that the Palestinians brought a proposal that they will be recognized as a state in creation, not even as a full member of the United Nations, but this emphasize again the two-state solution is in line with the basic interest of the state of Israel.",
        "Of course, it requires negotiations afterward.",
        "But I didn't see that this particular proposition that was adopted by the U.N.",
        "is in contradiction to the basic interest of the state of Israel.",
        "And why should we isolate ourselves from the entire international community and have a vote in the United Nation where 139 nations vote against us?",
        "What was so smart in this?",
        "I don't understand.",
        "There is much speculation, Prime Minister Olmert, that a hard-line Israeli government will be elected in January again with Prime Minister Netanyahu at the helm.",
        "Do you believe that might be an obstacle to any near-term progress?",
        "I definitely have to be hopeful that things have changed both in the politics of Israel and in the policies of Israel.",
        "But on the other hand, you know, one can look back at the last four years and say to himself that four years, we didn't do anything that would encourage the resumption of serious, meaningful peace process, so why do we have to expect that something will change?",
        "And if it doesn't?",
        "Is time running out?",
        "Time is certainly running out for Israel.",
        "There is no question about it.",
        "I'm very, very concerned about it because I think that if the world will not see a major progress in the dialogue between us and the Palestinians, then more and more people in the Palestinian community and in the international community will resort to the one-state for two-people solution.",
        "That which will change entirely the nature of the state of Israel, and I'm not sure that this is what we were dreaming all our history for."

        "So after those games, the sport's international governing body changed the rules.",

        "And what we did this time around is instead of just focusing on one item of the products use - the swimsuit - we focused on all of the products use.",

        "And we've developed all of these products together to optimize the hydrodynamics of that swimmer.",
        "Speedo calls it the Fastskin3 racing system.",
        "Many top athletes are wearing it in London.",
        "Santry says it can reduce drag on a swimmer by up to 16 percent.",

        "And then when you go into the goggles, we use 3-D head scanning.",
        "So we scan a lot of athletes' heads, and from that, we took the exact eye-socket dimensions.",
        "And that - those dimensions are used to create a perfect seal.",
        "So the seal on these new goggles is so comfortable and very confident.",
        "As soon as they're very confident, they're not going to leak.",
        "And we test these experimentally.",
        "So, for example, the fabric, we tested in a water flume.",
        "We would drag athletes through a pool, which could measure the drag on that athlete in different suits.",
        "What we're confident in is actually, this Fastskin3 system is the fastest system available.",
        "And if an athlete chooses the right parts of that system, they can get really, really good times and good performance improvements.",
        "I read that it can take the female swimmers up to an hour to get into this new swimsuit, the Fastskin3.",
        "Why is it so hard to get into?",
        "So this suit - because it's a full coverage suit on the back, so we don't have an open back on this suit where you would normally climb into a suit.",
        "And on the suits in 2008, they have a zip.",
        "But within this new set of rules, the zips have been banned.",
        "So actually, to get into this suit, you stretch the arm hole open and you climb into the suit through the arm hole and then you pull the arm over your head.",
        "So the first time someone does it, it's quite daunting.",
        "But once you've got used to it - Rebecca Adlington takes about five, six minutes to get into the suit.",

        "And only we have this fabric, and it's specially created for us, and it took a year to develop.",
        "What it allows us to do is create a very tubeless shape for the swimmer.",
        "So other swimmer goes through the water, they're slowed down by the water passing over the lumps and bumps on their body.",
        "So to make them faster, what we have to do is try and make them into torpedo-type shape.",
        "To do this, we use a fabric, which allows us to add compression in where we need it.",
        "So over the chest and the hips and the bum, for example, we need to compress that tissue and that body into a very tubular form.",
        "So we've added more compression into the fabric at key locations.",
