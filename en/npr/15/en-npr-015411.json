        "The health care law's requirement that workplace insurance policies include free birth control has been controversial from the get-go.",
        "The law grants an exemption for churches and other exclusively religious organizations, but not for church-affiliated charities.",

        "Marcia Greenberger of the National Women's Law Center argues the charities are trying to impose their own religious views on employees who may not share them.",
        "Not only are they asking for the authority not to provide it themselves, but we want to veto the ability of a commercial insurer to pick up the tab, too, for these women.",
        "So that is a very extreme right that has never been recognized before."

        "That's because their insurance provider is a self-insured church plan, exempt from government regulation.",
        "In other words, Greenberger says, neither the nuns nor their insurance carrier will actually have to provide any birth control.",
