        "We need them to say a sustained sound; like, they say ahhhh.",
        "Patel can then take that sound, run it through a computer, and find out all kinds of things about how that person would sound if that person could talk.",
        "Can determine their pitch, the loudness, the breathiness of their voice, the changes in clarity.",
        "She then takes the voice of what she calls a healthy donor - for example, the voice of a child roughly the same age as the disordered child she's trying to help - and gets them to say a large number of words so that she can sample the sounds they produce.",
        "She then combines that voice with the pitch, breathiness, etc., of the disordered child.",

        "Now, at the time, Patel wasn't at the stage where she was actually constructing voices.",
        "But she's since - obviously - figured it out and recently, she created a new voice with Samantha's sample.",
        "Last week, she gave the voice to Ruane and Samantha so they could hear it.",
        "Now, this voice was constructed from a sample taken when Samantha was much younger.",

        "Still, it was the first time that Samantha and her mother had heard anything close to Samantha's voice.",
        "Ruane had listened early in the day, when Samantha was still at school.",
        "And the experience clearly moved her; made her realize, in a fresh way, how difficult it was for her that she had never heard her daughter's voice.",
        "When I heard it, I thought yeah, that could be it.",
        "'Cause I could hear - like my son, Nicholas, I could hear some of his voice in it.",
