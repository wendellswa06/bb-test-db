        "That's Joseph Cirincione, head of the anti-proliferation Plowshares Fund, greeting Lemack at a screening of the new documentary she's produced.",
        "It focuses on Ashraf al-Khaled, a Jordanian Muslim who lost 27 members of his family when his wedding was blown up by an al-Qaida suicide bomber.",
        "Lemack decided it was a story that needed to be told.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Enjoy the show.",

        "Hello everyone.",
        "We're going to get started.",
        "Just moments before show time, Lemack fidgets nervously in the front row.",
        "It's the umpteenth time she's done this, so that's not it.",
        "No, no. What I am nervous about is I hung up with my sister and I haven't heard back from her.",
        "And I don't like it (unintelligible).",
        "Let me just call her real quick.",
        "It's one of the many ways 9-11 has changed her.",
        "Hey.",
        "I'm okay.",
        "I just want to make sure everything okay 'cause we didn't say goodbye.",

        "I don't like watching this part.",
        "I don't need to see those images.",
        "But the gory reality is critical to their mission, as al-Khaled puts it in the movie, to break the silence in the Muslim world about the true cost of terror.",
        "If we just going to sit there and we are not going to say anything about what we have been through, this terror will never end.",
        "Afterward, onstage, Lemack explains how the film is already doing what she hoped, like when she showed it to a group of radicalized Muslims in the U.K.",
        "At the end, one of the guys said, well, hold on a second, you said your mom was on the plane on 9/11.",
        "And I said, yeah.",
        "He said, but we were taught that there were no people on the planes.",
        "Lemack's film was nominated for an Oscar.",
        "And talk about ending up on an unlikely path, Lemack got to walk the red carpet in $100,000 worth of borrowed bling.",
        "It was just phenomenal.",
        "I got to meet all these stars and very out of my league - having dinner with Ann Hathaway and her parents.",
        "And it was just mind-blowing in that sense.",
        "But then again, everything has been kind of surreal these past 10 years.",
        "Hers was not a normal loss, nor has it been a normal grieving process.",

        "It makes me almost want to be ill to think I haven't talked to my mom in 10 years.",
