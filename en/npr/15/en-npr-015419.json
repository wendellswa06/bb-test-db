        "You know, this late blight was a real nightmare for tomato gardeners last year.",
        "How much of a threat does it pose for the upcoming garden season?",
        "Not as much of a threat, as long as there's cleanliness on the back end of the industry.",
        "Last year, the late blight outbreak was so bad because it actually began with infected plants, baby plants that were released into the trade all through - up and down the East Coast.",
        "So gardeners started out with dying plants, unfortunately.",
        "If you had blight last year, how much eradication do you have to do this year?",
        "Can you use the same plant stakes, the same garden tools, the same sheers or do you have to throw all that stuff out and start fresh?",
        "Luckily, no to all those questions.",
        "Late blight typically occurs in the Northeast when it slowly works its way up by windborne spores from the South, where they grow year round.",
        "So, most years you start out with a clean garden 'cause the spores can't survive wintertime outside.",
        "Those spores really travel quite a distance.",
        "They can travel 30 miles in a day if the wind is correct.",
        "Now, if growing plants from seeds is something that you're able to do in your home garden, start them in the basement or in some sort of garden shed, is growing plants from seeds a foolproof way to avoid the blight or do you still have to worry about it coming in from the South or are those spores flying in from your neighbors' yard?",
        "Unfortunately, starting your own seeds is zero protection.",
        "I didn't buy any of my starts last year from any stores that had infected plants.",
        "I start all of my tomatoes from seed.",
        "But the wind and the weather last year just carried it from garden to garden with lightening speed.",
        "So, most people who were hit did not begin with infected plants.",
        "The spores blew into their garden from other gardens.",
        "And for those who grow tomatoes, whether it's in the ground or in containers, what should they be doing right now to ready their gardens?",
        "Not readying their gardens, not rushing the season.",
        "One of the biggest mistakes people make - 'cause everybody wants to grow tomatoes.",
        "Tomatoes are the gateway drug to all of our gardening.",
        "The supermarket tomatoes are so terrible that even people who think they have a black thumb want to get out there and grow some of their own to get that childhood flavor of a fresh garden-ripe tomato that they remember."
