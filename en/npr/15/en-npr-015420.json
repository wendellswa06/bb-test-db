        "Pearce says one monkey is impulsive and hyper; the other is more patient and thoughtful.",
        "The patient monkey waited until all the information was known to him, in order to form that plan.",
        "The impatient monkey, on the other hand, planned on moving straight to the target as soon as the target showed up on the screen; and only later, would change his plan if the obstacle got in the way.",
        "It may seem odd to think that the brain cells involved in extending an arm could reveal something about an individual's personality.",
        "But Krishna Shenoy, at Stanford, says that's not a crazy idea.",
        "He says the brain tends to use the same approach for high-level tasks, as for simple ones.",
        "So is the strategy you might adopt in reaching, somehow reflective of the strategy you might adopt when making an investment or choosing a purchase, or deciding whom to marry?"
