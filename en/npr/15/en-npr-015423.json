        "As you look at these numbers, do you think that a tipping point of sorts has been reached?",
        "Well, I think it has.",
        "But it has among, you know, well-to-do Americans, who wear ties.",
        "I think the tragedy is if you look at these numbers, even though we're down 20 percent in sales, of all the Americans alive today, 12 million are going to die from cigarette smoking in their lifetime.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "What we have done is we have, you know, gone after tobacco but seeing the tobacco industry only target higher risk groups, people who are poor, low income.",
        "And unfortunately, I think we're seeing the states, because all the money they're receiving from big tobacco in the settlement, take that money and use it for purposes other than tobacco control.",
        "And that's...",
        "We're making progress.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yes.",
        "I'm asking you about, and the reasons behind the progress.",
        "Yes, of course, we know that tobacco remains the most preventable source of disease in the country.",
        "But why do you think those numbers are turning around?"

        "Okay.",
        "Well, I think a couple of things.",
        "One, we can ascribe one- third of the decline to price increases, so price increases do work.",
        "Thirty- three percent of the decline is associated with increasing price.",
        "But two- thirds of decline is associated with state campaigns, making it unacceptable to smoke in public places, protecting the health of restaurant and bar workers.",
        "That's been critically important.",
        "And also, some states, not every state, but some states have been allocating their money for aggressive campaigns showing the harmful effects of tobacco use on television, making sure kids don't buy cigarettes illegally, working with their doctors and healthcare providers to counsel patients.",
        "So, one-third is due to price.",
        "Okay?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But price works with all these other measures to make sure people aren't smoking.",
        "So it is working.",
        "But I just want to caution everyone in America today, but it is working, but it's probably not working as well with low-end people in America.",
        "And companies, like Philip Morris and R.J.",
        "Reynolds, you know, they're probably saying we're going to give away those people who quit otherwise, but we want that core of people...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...who are not thinking about quitting.",
        "And that's a problem.",
        "You used an interesting word in your answer, unacceptable to smoke in office buildings, and restaurants, and bars in a lot of places.",
        "Unacceptable is the interesting part.",
        "It's illegal to smoke in most of those places these days.",
        "Unacceptable is sort of the social stigma that is attached once you're forced to become a pariah of sorts.",
        "Well, that's not true because, you know, the people who get harmed today from smoking in public places are restaurant and bar workers.",
        "And they have some of the highest lung cancer rates of any occupation group.",
        "We don't make nurses go in and smoke in operating rooms.",
        "We don't make teachers smoke in schoolrooms.",
        "We don't make flight attendants smoke in airlines.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "You know, today, because we're saying we're trying to afford restaurant and bar workers a clean environment, that's not a stigma.",
        "That's only giving them the right that they deserve.",
        "I was sort of turning it on the other side, that people who feel like they have to step outside to smoke, might say I feel like a pariah.",
        "Therefore, maybe I'll quit smoking."

        "Well, you know, a pretty good way to help people quit smoking, you know, is to say that you can't smoke at home.",

        "And the data is very, very clear that second-hand smoke is going to increase the risk of asthma attack among the child.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "All of these lots over here is where fires were in the past 10 years, and one was just a year and a half ago, you know, that went down.",

        "In any one given year, they're stopping for 24 hours.",
        "And that's really a serious quit attempt.",
        "But the problem is, if that smoker who quits goes into a bar where this beautiful woman comes up to him and says hey, you know, let's start smoking again, and here, I'm going to give you a cigarette, you get someone who relapses.",
        "You know?",
        "And in the old days, what we did because we didn't change social norms, you know, we were sort of seeing people quit.",
        "They would go then and use nicotine replacement therapy drug companies gave them.",
        "And they'd be back smoking again.",
        "Hmm.",
        "So, I think, America, I think our success, you now, has been in changing social norms.",
        "I just got back from the Middle East.",
        "I did a training on behalf of Harvard with 18 Middle Eastern countries, Jordan, Iraq, Syria.",
        "And smoking is so prevalent there.",
        "And I think one of the tragedies, and there was health minister in Iraq, from the Basra area saying, You know, our people are being killed in Iraq for terrorist issues, but we're losing so many, many more people from smoking.",

        "They were all healthy, they're all macho and I'm immune, I'm not going to die because I smoke Marlboros.",
        "So, we show the Marlboro man, we've actually put a Marlboro man on TV who is dying from lung cancer and broke down those barriers and communicated personal risk.",
        "It was like reality TV at its best.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And it worked.",
        "We did a survey of 700 former smokers.",
        "One of the main reasons why they said they quit smoking is because they saw aggressive television advertising about the dangers of smoking.",
        "And Martha's point about children and the restriction of, well, I guess the loss of Joe Camel is how everybody summarizes it, as you look at these numbers, slightly higher numbers of, I guess, teenagers smoke than the numbers of adults these days, still."
