        "This is a national problem, these structures.",
        "And when we look at that, we've got to look at the risk and benefit, and that's what each, I think, city and town, including Philadelphia and other places, have already got in place to look and put power in far as enforcing the codes, enforcing getting some of these structures demolished beforehand.",
        "Hello.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "You know, it's funny, the tobacco industry has been doing big sponsorships of bars and clubs, they have Marlboro nights, and Camel nights.",
        "In a sense they're, you know, for that young cohort, that young crowd, they're trying to make it cool and hip.",
        "And that's why when you prohibit smoking in public places, New York City, Washington's going to go smoke free, San Francisco, Boston, you know, you're denying the tobacco industry the nicotine classroom.",
        "They want to use the bar and the club to make it the nicotine classroom for the next generation, and they don't deserve it, nor do the lungs of the young people in America.",
        "Matt, good luck to you.",
        "Thank you kindly.",
        "We're going to take a short break.",
        "When we come back, more of your calls on why you think the numbers of smokers are down in the United States, down to historic levels, 800-989-8255, e-mail us, TALK@NPR.org, back after the break.",

        "The study shows a more than four percent fall in 2005 and more than 20 percent since tobacco companies reached a legal settlement with the states back in 1998."

        "We've seen the decline, probably with the people wearing ties, only we've seen big tobacco get smarter and target those people who are poor, who are disadvantaged.",

        "So, we're not claiming victory here.",
        "We've made success, but we really got to think about the long- term.",
        "A few years ago, two years ago, the Congress considered legislation to regulate tobacco products as drugs.",
        "Maybe we should do that.",
        "Maybe we should be thinking about in our lifetime, over the next 30 years, that, you know, the conventional cigarette as we know it is treated like lard.",
        "It's not made available to the American public or if it is, it's highly priced, and it's, you know, back on the counter and we have other mechanisms for giving people nicotine, so they're not highly dependent upon the tobacco product.",
        "I think we have to be very, very concerned in that big tobacco has given the state hundreds of billions of dollars to settle this suit.",
        "In a sense, the states now potentially are binding themselves to big tobacco to assure they get revenue to pay for things other than quitting smoking or preventing children from smoking, for paying for roads and for pension funds.",
        "And that can be a disaster, a public health disaster, for our nation.",
        "And I think if you look at the settlement payments given to the state, only a fraction of those dollars are being given for prevention programs with youth, or providing smokers with help to quit.",
        "And I think the states have to take a very, very serious look and ask a big question.",
        "When they sued big tobacco, and when they went to court and they raised their hand and they said to the judges, we sued for the children.",
        "We're here to prevent the children from smoking.",
