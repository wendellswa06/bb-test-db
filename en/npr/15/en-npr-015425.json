        "They have to put the money back into communities where we see high smoking rates.",
        "And that's not being done universally in our country, and I think that's a tragedy.",

        "And again, one of the highest rates of lung cancer we see among restaurant and bar workers in our nation, and I've been to city council hearings, New York, Boston, elsewhere in the country, and I think some of the most compelling witnesses is when you hear a restaurant worker get up and say before the city council in New York, I'm a single mom, I don't have health insurance, I can't quit my job, I come home at night and I have sinusitis, and my clothes stink, my hair stinks, and you in the city council in New York, if someone told you you had to go through with this, you would be outraged.",
        "That's my life.",

        "The term cool has now been transliterated into Chinese, and it's coo.",

        "Well, there's an interesting debate cropping up in the Israeli media, questioning whether by putting up the roadblocks the government is essentially admitting that Jerusalem is a divided city, divided Palestinian and Jewish halves.",
        "And this is true in a lot of practical ways - which days which shops are open, for example.",
        "But it's a key part of the Israeli point of view of this conflict that Jerusalem is united and it's Israel's united capital, which is in conflict with Palestinians' view of East Jerusalem being their future capital.",

        "Netanyahu's government officials say this is ridiculous; this is a security measure.",
        "Well, here's something else the Israeli government is doing, not returning the bodies of Palestinian attackers who've been killed - not returning the bodies to their families.",
        "Why refrain from doing that?",
        "Israeli officials say that when they return bodies of people who've been killed by Israelis who are often treated like martyrs or heroes among Palestinians, the funerals can become very political and can lead to further confrontations with Israeli security forces.",

        "The older Palestinian was shot and killed.",
        "The other, the 13-year-old, was neutralized - that's the only word police will say in this case - and taken to the hospital.",
        "Last night, when Abbas spoke on television, he mentioned this child by name.",
        "He held up his picture.",
        "And he used him as an example of a child who has been executed in cold blood.",
        "But the thing is that this kid is alive.",
        "And the Israeli government, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has - during this whole rise in violence - has been accusing Abbas very strongly of nurturing the violence through incite-ful statements.",
        "Israeli officials and the media are expressing outrage this morning about this misrepresentation of facts in Abbas' speech.",
        "By the way, the official translation of Abbas' speech does not use the word executed, but it's there in the Arabic.",
        "And when I spoke to a PLO member of Abbas' Fatah party about this, he said, look, the details aren't important.",
        "It's symbolic; the 13-year-old is a symbol of what Israel is doing to our children.",
        "So that's the incident.",
        "The big picture, Israeli officials sound like they're ready to be done with Abbas in many of the very dismissive and critical statements that they're making.",
        "And Palestinians are focusing on overall that too many Palestinian children have died in this conflict over the decades.",
        "Emily, one other thing.",
        "I've seen these attacks by Palestinians on Israelis described as an uprising.",
        "Is that the right word for what's going on?",
        "Steve, that's a question that's being batted around quite a lot.",
        "I think the bigger question is, what if it is an uprising?",
        "What if it is the third intifada?",
        "What does that mean?",
        "Does that mean another five years of continued violence?",
        "Does that mean there's no chance of going back to the negotiating table right now?",
        "I'm not sure if the label makes that kind of difference or not.",
