        "If that happens, my prediction is that Mitt Romney will lose the first ballot and if he loses the first ballot, he will be abandoned.",
        "And then Newt, I believe, would have better than a 50/50 chance of winning the nomination among the remaining three candidates.",
        "So you're saying an equal footing would be if Newt Gingrich had 900 delegates and Rick Santorum 700 and Newt Gingrich 400, that would qualify as equal footing because nobody has a majority for the first ballot, you're saying.",

        "One reading of the speaker's fortunes is that it really doesn't matter if he's winning a lot of delegates or attracting endorsements or new contributions so long as the superPAC that you're involved with can advertise against his rivals, there's no reason for him to drop out.",
        "First of all, can you tell us what percent of the funds that Winning Our Future has raised come from two people, Sheldon and Miriam Adelson?",
        "Well, I don't want to break it down that way and I don't talk about donors and I'm not going to speculate on further fundraising.",
