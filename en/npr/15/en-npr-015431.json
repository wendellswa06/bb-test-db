        "So we gave up and just put it off.",
        "But in the past couple of months, Sutherland says friends have been calling to tell him about not just condos, but single family homes they've seen in the area for sale in the mid-300s range.",
        "He says he never saw that last year, though when we tagged along house hunting with Sutherland and his broker, Anita Shishmanian, he was finding those cheaper houses had some problems.",
