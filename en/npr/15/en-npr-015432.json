        "When you think of drones, the image is often of the military targeted terrorists abroad, and we'll hear more about that in a moment.",

        "At a drone industry conference this week here in Washington, D.C., manufacturers were bullish about commercial drone potential in the United States.",
        "But as NPR's Larry Abramson reports, there's still a lot of uncertainty about how new privacy laws will affect the ability to operate drones.",
        "Most of the booths at the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International meeting are staffed by people with lots of engineering degrees.",
        "But others feature leggy blondes gesturing toward sleek, shiny unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAV's.",
        "As this industry grows up, it's trying to stretch its appeal beyond the traditional military market.",
        "A company called Scion has developed a remotely piloted helicopter for the Naval Research Lab.",

        "Border patrol, things like delivering packages with it, where you could fly out, instead of having a UPS truck to go out 150 miles to a remote ranch, you could fly it out in a vehicle like this and drop the package off.",
        "The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq helped spark the boom in the UAV business.",
        "And now that the end is in sight in Afghanistan, companies know they must make the leap to domestic uses.",

        "At an indoor demonstration area, DJI demonstrates its S800 hexacopter.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF S800 HEXACOPTER ENGINE)",
        "As the copter's six blades whir, the ungainly looking craft levitates and dances around inside a big cage, as spectators watch.",
        "Lots of companies are making smaller copters like this one - too small to carry people, but big enough to carry a film camera.",
        "But if you have fantasies about having burritos delivered by air, you'll have a long wait."

        "Tim Finegan of the Teal Group says the FAA won't allow any commercial use of unmanned vehicles until 2015 at the very earliest.",
        "Probably next year, it's going to open somewhat for small, unmanned systems under, for example, 55 pounds.",
        "But it's going to be a long process before there's a complete opening of airspace.",
        "Still, many companies are betting on a brilliant future for unmanned craft.",
        "But that domestic market might never come into being if the industry can't address concerns about civil liberties.",

        "We don't want to live in an American where, from the minute you walk out your front door, until you get home at night, you have to wonder if there's some invisible eye in the sky that's tracking your every move.",
        "Those concerns have led at least seven states to pass laws that restrict the use of unmanned aerial vehicles.",
        "And a bill introduced in Congress would require, among other things, that law enforcement get a warrant before collecting information on people in public spaces.",

        "And go back down below $100 a barrel.",
        "Yes.",
        "And it didn't.",
        "And bear in mind that when you talk about $100 barrel of oil, the airlines are talking about $130 a barrel, because they pay more to have it refined into aviation fuel.",
        "So you're saying Delta and Northwest seriously thought about this merger, didn't look like it was going to be worth it, but as oil prices keep going up and up and up, there's a desperation to do something to cut costs.",
        "There's a desperation to do something, and we've seen the economy simply get worse and worse.",
        "I interviewed the president, the number two, at Delta on February 29th, and he was saying then, yeah, we can make money on our own.",

        "Not only is oil up and staying up, but people are starting not to fly.",
        "The economy is going into a downturn.",
        "And one of the first thing that dies is discretionary travel.",
        "Now, if you merge two airlines, though, doesn't it take years to reorganize things and get some savings out of that?",
        "Indeed, it does.",
        "You get some immediate savings by cutting out a headquarters, cutting out a fair number of flights, and in the creation of a network.",
        "But, yeah, it takes years to get the full synergies.",
        "And I hope people can hear the quote marks around the word synergy.",
        "And it takes years to get over labor issues.",
        "Even if they had gone in with labor eager for a merger - and that's what we thought was going to happen six weeks ago - even if they'd gone with labor as full allies, you would have a long time getting the unions merged and integrated, as well as getting the systems.",
        "Well, let's talk about that.",
        "The reason that you came on and said that it looked like this deal might be dead a little while ago is because the pilots' unions could not agree on seniority, who was going to have greater seniority and greater leverage in picking flights and so forth.",
        "Have the pilots' unions agreed at this point?",
        "No, they haven't.",
        "What has changed is that Delta, which had committed very, very solidly to not going into any kind of a merger deal without a pilot agreement before the deal - Delta has said maybe we have to do it without the pilots."

        "US Airways and America West merged in the autumn of 2005, and the pilot groups there basically are picking knives out of each other's backs.",

        "Basically, you're running two airlines that are coordinated but not merged.",
