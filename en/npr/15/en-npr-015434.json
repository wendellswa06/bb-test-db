        "It's not the outcome that I wanted, but that was the will of the House.",
        "So unless the president and Congress take action, tax rates will go up on every American taxpayer and devastating defense cuts will go into effect in 10 days.",
        "And all of this could have a profound impact on every single taxpayer in this country.",
        "So could a deal be reached before the deadline?",
        "We asked NPR senior Washington editor Ron Elving to explain.",
        "He began by describing the outlines of that Plan B that never made it to a vote.",
        "Plan B was an effort on the part of John Boehner to change the politics of the negotiation he was involved in with the president.",
        "Now the speaker could see he was negotiating from weakness.",
        "And the polls said the country wanted a deal, and the polls said the country was going to blame him more than the president if we didn't get one.",
        "So Plan B was an effort to adjust the Republicans' image, if you will, by adjusting their bargaining stance.",
        "Say yes to higher taxes on income over a million dollars a year.",
        "Make sure that the spending cuts did not fall on the military.",
        "And those two points, just standing on their own, are relatively savable.",
        "And if the House could pass that, the House could go back to negotiations with the president or fail to reach a deal with the president but have a little better standing with the public.",
        "OK.",
        "The president's been calling for higher tax rates on income over 250,000.",
        "John Boehner's plan said we'll do it on income over a million dollars.",
        "But that wasn't enough to get enough support from the House Republicans.",
        "He didn't even bring this up for a vote.",
        "What happened?",
        "They didn't have nearly enough votes.",
        "If it had been just a few shy, they would have brought it to the floor and tried to push it through in the sort of dramatic moment of crisis.",
        "But dozens of his members - perhaps 30, 40 of his members - had made it clear they were not going to go for it no matter what.",
        "And then we're not even going to listen to any further arguments about it.",
        "And so Boehner eventually quit even trying and sent everyone home for Christmas.",
        "So before we get to the politics of this, Ron, last night, the president made a very terse statement saying, look, I'm going away for Christmas.",
        "Everyone is going away for Christmas.",
        "Let's have some Christmas cookies and drink some eggnog and maybe everyone will calm down and come back and we can hammer out a deal.",
        "He will be back, what, maybe on the 26th.",
        "They will have six days to hammer out a deal before we go over the so-called fiscal cliff.",
        "Is that possible?",
        "One should never underestimate what Congress can do when it wants to.",
        "The president is coming back on the 26th.",
        "The House and Senate are due back on the 27th.",
        "But negotiations can be taking place in all of the interim.",
        "They would not be face to face, but they would be through surrogates long distance.",
        "And if they want to, they could put a deal in place to be implemented.",
        "But, Ron, if John Boehner could not get the support that he needed from his own backbenchers in the House, how can he cut a deal with President Obama?",
        "How can he go into the White House and say, I represent the Republicans in the House, and I will deliver their votes if we can come to an agreement?",
        "How would he do that?",
        "Well, this is the same problem that we had with the debt-ceiling crisis back in August of 2011 when he and the president reached a grand bargain and then John Boehner discovered he couldn't sell that back to his folks in the House.",
        "That is exactly the same situation that we're in now.",
        "We have seen that demonstrated yet again."

        "But I actually think that there is a way for Boehner to recover.",
        "I think there's a way for him to come out of this as something of a hero, at least in the sense of the broad public opinion, and even to keep his speakership when the new Congress convenes in January.",
        "And how would he do that?",
        "Well, he'd have to go back to the negotiations with the president.",
        "They have to go back to where they were a week ago - face to face, long distance, whichever.",
        "And they have to get a deal that can pass in the House and the Senate with what I would call half-and-half support.",
        "It's particularly crucial in the House that they get half the Democrats and half the Republicans plus one, and that deal would probably be able to clear the Senate.",
        "Probably.",
        "And it could get done in time to avoid the fiscal cliff.",
        "And, of course, it wouldn't satisfy everybody in anybody's camp, but it could get done.",
