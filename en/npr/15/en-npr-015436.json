        "John Boehner's speakership is really already in tatters.",

        "He would be in a stronger position if they can get the deal, get it through, even using Democratic votes, and please the country.",
        "That, I believe, would make enough Republicans feel better than they feel right now.",
        "Right now, the way they feel is that they have been embarrassed by some of their members.",
        "Their speaker has been humiliated in public.",
        "This is not a long-term strategy for the Republican Party.",

        "Ron, thanks.",
        "Thank you, Guy.",
        "Now if a deal isn't reached, taxes will go up for everyone and the automatic spending cuts will go into effect.",
        "The biggest chunk will come out of the defense budget.",
        "But in a recent article in The New Republic, reporter Noam Scheiber suggested that going over the fiscal cliff may not actually be a bad outcome for the president.",
        "If the president sits back and does nothing, he gets basically the tax, the income tax regime that he wants, which obviously is one of the - if not the most - sensitive part of these negotiations.",
        "I think no one wants the cuts the way that they are designed now, but I think Republicans want them less because they absolutely eviscerate the Pentagon, which is close to the hearts of many Republicans.",
        "So even if you set aside the tax issue, I think the president still has a lot of leverage because Republicans want out of these defense cuts, and only the president can give them a way out of them.",
        "But you actually go beyond the political argument.",
        "You actually think that it would make sense to do this because the president would get more than half of what he wants.",
        "The top income tax rates would go up.",
        "Yes, taxes on the middle class would go up, but you argue he could sort of negotiate to roll that back.",
        "But once we go over the cliff, you're saying it's going to be hard for Republicans to lower the tax rates on the highest income earners.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, once we go over the cliff, I think the obvious next step is that Barack Obama and Harry Reid immediately propose a middle-class tax cut for the bottom 98 percent.",
        "And at that point, I think it's going to be very difficult for Republicans to oppose that so that they can argue that the top 2 percent should have their tax cut along with it.",
        "But could we avert an economic recession by passing middle-class tax cuts?",
        "I mean, you're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars in very rapid cuts.",
        "I mean, this is a huge risk that the president would be taking.",
        "I mean, it would be happening on his watch.",
        "Well, I would say it's a risk.",
        "A huge risk seems overstated to me.",
        "I think the whole notion of the cliff is a bit of an inept metaphor.",
        "It's more like a gradual slope.",
        "There are some $500 billion in cuts and tax increases slated to happen next year, but they're spread out over the course of the entire year.",
        "And if this thing were to end in a matter of days or weeks after January 1st, the impact to the economy would be very, very minimal, and much of it could be retroactively corrected."

        "But what about the huge spending cuts?",
        "I mean, it's not just cuts in areas that Democrats want to see those cuts.",
        "It's also in place like entitlement spending.",
        "Those, if allowed to go in place and stay in place, could be potentially severe.",
        "But the way that this thing is designed is these agencies could continue their spending.",
        "It's not like a government shutdown.",
        "They just have to, if the cuts were to stay in place, have to ensure that they, by the end of the year, have not spent more money than they are allowed to spend.",
        "OK.",
        "The headline of your article is - I mean, you don't write the headlines, but it is called \"\"To Save His Second Term, Obama Must Go Over the Fiscal Cliff.\"\" Why does he have to do that to save his second term?",
        "Well, the problem is if you look back to 2011 and some of the previous interactions between Obama and the House Republicans, even when Obama wins a victory, a sort of tactical victory, it often turns out that the Republicans believe that they've been out maneuvered, that he's pulled the wool over their eyes, that he's just played his hand a little better and that they have the cause of righteousness.",
        "The public is behind them.",
        "They are morally in the right spot.",
        "And so I think if Obama were to do a deal that they regarded as unfair to them, they would not be cured of this sort of righteousness and would want to get even down the road.",
        "And unfortunately, for all of us, there are lots of opportunities for them to get even.",
        "The flip side is if you go over the cliff and they suffer a fairly stunning repudiation in the court of public opinion, I think they are going to be much more tempered and understand that it is the public that has rejected their agenda.",
        "I think that's a very important precedent to set as we go into the second four years of this president's administration.",
        "So if they do come to a deal on averting the fiscal cliff, how are they going to avoid problems down the line?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think it's going to be very difficult.",
        "If they do a deal that a lot of House Republicans consider illegitimate - and they are already saying that they consider basically any deal that would get done illegitimate - I think they are going to be absolutely determined to fight this out, demand austere cuts to Medicare and Social Security when it comes time to raising the debt limit in February.",
        "And as the president himself has said and a lot of people in the business community say - it's not just Democrats - there's really no way to run a government to have this risk of default on your debt obligations looming over you at any moment.",
        "That's Noam Scheiber.",

        "Others kept that model but they all had one thing in common.",
