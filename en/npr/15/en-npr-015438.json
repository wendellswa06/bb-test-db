        "Ah, that was semi-miraculous because if you picture it, if you've got a gizmo that does this, that allows you to run with a camera and the results are smooth, you have a priceless thing that very few inventors have the advantage of.",
        "And that is - I could show up with a demo reel of 30 impossible shots, obviously impossible to anybody that knew anything, and not give them a clue of how it was done, right?",
        "So showing with up with a reel just knocked down the doors.",
        "It just floored everybody.",
        "In fact, that reel was sent to Kubrick right away, and John Avildsen who directed \"\"Rocky,\"\" and a lot of my heroes in, you know, faraway movie business.",
        "And in fact, it was Kubrick who telexed back wonderful compliments and so on.",
        "But then he said, oh and by the way, you better clip out the 14 frames in the middle of it that show the shadow of it on the ground because, you know, a skilled photo-interpreting guy could detect that something is rotating and so on and so on.",
        "Of course we rushed into the screening room, and lo and behold, there they were.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "We clipped out the damn 14 frames.",
        "So who was the first to bite?",
        "Well, there was a pile-up, actually.",
        "I shot - I ended up the next year on three films simultaneously, and one of them was \"\"Rocky,\"\" because John Avildsen saw the reel and the last shot on our impossible shots reel was my then girlfriend, now wife Ellen running down the art museum steps and back up, 'cause we were driving by.",
        "And I said, well, Ellen, why don't you run down?",
        "I'll chase you down.",
        "Then she ran back up.",
        "So we had this astonishing shot, impossible to do.",
        "And, of course, Avildsen said, how did you do that?",
        "And where are those steps?",
        "And that led, a few months later, to me chasing Stallone up those steps.",
        "Was he faster than your girlfriend?",
        "No.",
        "I have to say no. But you know, the first time he did it, he was exhausted for that scene early on when he failed to run up the steps.",
        "Mm-hmm."

        "You had a career before you got started in (unintelligible) before you got started in inventions, before you're success at inventions.",

        "Somebody who knew Nichols and May and also knew that my friend Anne, who you just heard, and I used to joke all the time in the agency, which is where we started, asked us if we would knock off Nichols and May and try and do some ad-lib radio spots.",
        "And we sort of took to it.",
        "And we had a hell of a lot of fun and made a lot of dough and actually paid for some failed inventions with it, with the money from radio spots.",
        "And in a way, oddly, that's kind of an invention because we figured out how to make them sound ad-libbed, which that was sort of the appeal of those spots.",
        "We did them for Molson Beer and for MX(ph).",
        "It was quite a run.",
        "One of the Molson spots was on the air 13 years.",
        "For 13 years.",
        "Might be a record of some sort.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's - you said that they were funding.",
