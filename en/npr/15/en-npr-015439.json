        "Well, that was - I actually thought it up in 1979 during a chat with Merlin Olsen, oddly enough, on \"\"Little House on the Prairie.\"\" A lot of standing around on shows like that, which we, you know, we enjoyed working on those things.",
        "But Merlin and I were talking about how dreadful football coverage was because the cameras are miles away, way up and high in the stands.",
