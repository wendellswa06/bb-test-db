        "As we come to the end of this very tough year, I want to do something I haven't had a chance to do that often during my first year in office, and that is to share some modestly encouraging news on our economy.",
        "The nation's jobless rate had unexpectedly inched down, and while employers still aren't hiring workers, job losses have slowed to a trickle.",

        "Jobs have become a crucial barometer for the president, who took office in the middle of the worst recession in at least a generation.",
        "Even before his swearing in, Mr. Obama was lobbying Congress to pass a huge economic stimulus package.",
        "The package worked like sandbags piled on an economic levy, but the recessionary waters kept on rising.",

        "Chief Economist Nariman Behravesh of IHS Global Insight says the president's team made an honest mistake.",
        "They and many other forecasters did not realize how bad this recession was going to be and how high the unemployment rate was going to go.",
        "That said, they probably oversold it a little bit in terms of its impact, but it has had an effect.",
        "It has prevented things from getting worse.",
        "Behravesh says the stimulus, along with actions by the Federal Reserve, ought to get some credit for getting the economy growing again in the second half this year.",
        "But that's little comfort to the one in 10 Americans who are still looking for work.",
        "What's more, the stubbornly high unemployment rate has eroded confidence in the government's ability to tackle other problems.",
        "While two-thirds of the stimulus money has yet to be spent, idle workers are getting impatient.",
        "And Behravesh says that's why the president's back to pushing programs to boost hiring, such as spending on infrastructure and home energy retrofits.",
        "So for most guys, it might slow them down, but - excuse me, it might slow them down a little bit, but for most guys they'll still enter.",

        "To the best of our knowledge, he was only heard on North Korean radio publicly once, one single sentence in an almost 20-year rule, whereas his son seems to be very camera friendly, likes to be in front of the cameras, likes to give speeches in public, likes to show off his attractive young bride in public.",
        "And so there's a big atmospheric difference.",

        "So I think we may be a little bit in suspense on that.",
        "There was a surmise that there - to the extent one can talk about opinion or public opinion in North Korea, that there might be a yearning for something like de-Stalinization or thaw after the previous dictator's demise.",
        "And the young general, as he's sometimes called, as his first really public speech last year on the anniversary of his grandfather's birth, 100th anniversary of his grandfather's birth, declared that - words to the effect that the era of belt-tightening for the North Korean people should be over.",
        "Now, of course in a system like that, you say something like that and people's expectations must be elevated.",
        "But yet since that time we haven't seen any sort of change towards more pragmatic policies that might be consistent improving the population's living standards.",
        "Quite the opposite, we've seen kind of a reinforcing of the militarization of North Korean policy.",
        "OK.",

        "It is, of course, the most closed society in the world.",
        "It is the closest thing to a perfect totalitarian dictatorship that we have on the planet at the moment.",
        "But there is more contact with North Korea, more travel in North Korea, more international broadcasting from North Korea today than ever before.",
        "And you can even find North Korean propaganda, or media, if you wish to call it that, on the Internet, because North Korea has picked up its country code from ICANN.",
        "And so if you want to go to Rodong Sinmun, their party newspaper, you can look at pretty pictures of nice police ladies, or sometimes kind of knockoffs of Disneyland things.",
        "One of the best observers who is independent of - regarding North Korean affairs - is a Soviet-born Russian, Andrei Lankov, L-A-N-K-O-V.",
        "And if you put Lankov into your amazon.com search engine, you'll see a number of different books that he's written with, I think, very accurate and often very amusing essays about daily life in North Korea, as best we can tell."
