        "Hi.",
        "I just wanted to say that I read Demick's book, \"\"Nothing to Envy,\"\" and got really interested in North Korea, which I had known nothing about it.",
        "It's a fabulous book.",
        "And I wanted to recommend, actually, a novel set in contemporary North Korea called \"\"The Orphan Master's Son.\"\" And I know it's a departure from politics and nonfiction but it really is a great novel and a really interesting companion to nonfiction reading that you might do about the country.",
        "That's great.",
        "We'll take all fiction suggestions.",
        "Samantha, thank you so much.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Can I mention - there's an interesting and I think quite amusing set of books.",
        "It was written by a former American intelligence officer who goes by the name James Church.",
        "And his novels - mystery murder novels - follow a fictitious Inspector O, who is relatively apolitical in this very awful system.",
        "And I think it starts with - the first book is called \"\"A Corpse in the Koryo,\"\" Koryo being a great big Flash Gordon-style sci-fi-looking hotel that has been built in Pyongyang, that really does exist.",
        "But these are kind of interesting apertures on the North Korean life because they try to imagine what it would be like if you really tried - if you really wanted to be a real detective working in a system like that.",
        "All right.",

        "It's called \"\"Pyongyang: A Journey into North Korea.\"\" And it's his experiences in North Korea.",
        "He's an animator.",
        "Because a lot of animation companies ship their work to North Korea.",

        "What's on your reading list?",
        "Well, I would - I mean, we rightfully mentioned already \"\"Marked for Life,\"\" which I think is a disturbing but terribly important report.",
        "Another disturbing but really excellent book is by Bryan R.",
        "Myers.",
        "He calls himself B.R.",
        "Myers.",
        "Melville House put out a book called \"\"The Cleanest Race.\"\" This is about North Korea's logic of racialism.",
        "We hear - we see Kim Jong Un, we see this cult of personality, but do North Korean people hear from their government?"

        "That's a concern, Melissa, that more consumers will be defaulting on credit card debt, partly because banks have raised rates and fees to such high levels.",
        "Nowadays, if you miss one payment, you go one dollar over the credit limit, you could get your rate raised to 32 percent.",

        "In 1992, President Clinton, who was young and was from the, you know, central part of the country and from the central wing of the Democratic Party, defied every ticket balancing theory that exists to mankind and picks someone who is the exact same age with a very similar ideological perspective from the state right next door to his state, Al Gore, and put him on the ticket."
