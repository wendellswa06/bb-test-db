        "The story of \"\"That's Amore\"\" and the songs made famous by Frank Sinatra, Perry Como and others is told in a new book.",

        "And the song came from here when Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin went back to visit his family and they were welcomed by a large Italian dinner.",
        "And this is the song that they broke out into.",
        "And then when we hear it today, it almost sounds like a caricature, right, like a self-parody.",

        "I guess it's more about, kind of a turning point in the 20th century when all of these Italian entertainers started to be seen as American entertainers.",
        "And you write that it was a sort of a golden age that began around 1947.",
        "How did it happen?",
        "Well, this is when second and third generation Americans of Italian descent were coming of age.",
        "This is the postwar, it was a time of optimism.",

        "They were good-looking, they had a certain sensibility to them, a certain attitude, which was open, charming, and I think a lot of it had come from their style of singing, which when I interviewed almost every single one, I have to say every person who I interviewed and talked to, they all named Enrico Caruso as their influence...",

        "So it kind of influenced me to dig a little deeper into what was going on.",
