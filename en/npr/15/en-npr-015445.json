        "Indeed, it was - they used to call it Little Rome in Boston, these beautiful, old buildings that the seminary owned and the church ran out of, and by selling them, the seminary is kind of this one remaining outpost over there in Newton.",
        "And you describe it, as the scandal broke, as a nearly deserted, quiet place.",
        "And that's changed.",
        "Absolutely, and, you know, around 2002 when the scandal broke, I think there was about 60 students or so at the seminary, down from a peak of about 400 at mid-century.",
        "And, you know, by 2004 it was down to 30.",
        "And since then, since, you know, Cardinal O'Malley has made his changes, you know, currently I believe there's 120 students over at the seminary.",
        "It's the highest in 20 or 30 years.",
        "And we were talking earlier with Jim Martin, who said in a way this is a scandal that is in the past, these are for the most part older allegations that are just coming to light, in part in Los Angeles because lawyers for the church resisted the publication of these documents for so long.",
        "But in any case, there in Boston, what is the rate of new allegations, and how does it compare with the past?",
        "The new allegations are pretty low.",
        "The vast majority occurred before 1990.",
        "And a lot of the changes they've made in the training and selection of seminarians and then actually the training of students and church staff I think has really cut down, you know, on these terrible crimes.",
        "Is it fair to say the archdiocese there in Boston has gone a ways in recovering the trust of its - of church members, of the parents and indeed of the victims?",
        "I think that it's going to be a long road, still, to travel.",
        "You know, back in the 1960s, around 76 percent of Catholics were going to Mass weekly.",
        "In Boston now I believe it's about 16 percent of area Catholics are going to Mass.",
        "So there's a lot that they can really improve.",
        "And they've got a new marketing campaign.",
        "Now I'm not sure how successful it's been, but they really are trying to bring people back to the church.",

        "And I wanted to ask you, Jim Martin, we were talking about the Archdiocese of Boston there.",
        "How much does it matter, archdiocese to archdiocese, location to location, how the church has responded to this crisis?",
        "Well, I think you have different bishops who initially took it, you know, more seriously than others.",
        "I think there was a little bit of resistance at the beginning.",

        "But, you know, there's a kind of baseline that you can't go beneath in terms of as the writer was saying, Mr. Doyle, some of the new standards that are being set forth by the church.",
        "So, you know, and thank God, I mean, because, you know, if we hadn't, you know, taken a look at this and hadn't sort of faced this squarely, I mean, you know, it's a very - it's the only Christian response, basically.",
        "But to answer your question, I think there's a baseline, you know, below which no bishop or archbishop can go.",
        "And is one of those national standards that allegations of molestation are treated as criminal charges?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "Any credible allegation means that the priest, you know, or brother or sister, you know, whoever it might be in the church, or as Father Kirby was saying, a lay worker in the church, is removed, you know, from ministry, you know, until there's an investigation.",
        "So it's really strict.",
        "I mean, it's very draconian.",

        "You know, you look at something like Penn State or the BBC.",
