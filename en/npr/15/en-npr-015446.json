        "Second, the pro-choice position that Obama holds troubles some Catholics, not merely because it's a pro-choice position, but because his voting record is very much in the camp of those who would polarize the debate.",
        "And then finally, and the selection of Biden as a vice presidential candidate helps in this regard, the appeal to post-ethnic Catholics, that is, Catholics whose families come from an ethnic background, blue collar, working class, who are not quite so sure about this African American portrayed as a kind of an elitist, and is he one of them and how?",

        "That - I think that will be true more generally in the electorate.",
        "But to the extent that Catholicism as a voting bloc - that Catholics as a voting bloc still follow questions that the Church teaches to be important.",
        "There will be more consideration of issues that are not strictly speaking economic or foreign policies.",

        "He's come out strongly pro-choice.",
        "How can he convince Catholic voters to vote for him on that issue?",
        "What Senator Obama has to do, I believe, is to indicate to the electorate that he understands the complexity of the issue, and that he's really going to be a pro-choice candidate, meaning he is going to give women a choice between abortion and bringing that child to term because he's going to support legislation already that's been submitted that gives women support who want to bring the child to term.",
        "He hasn't really been as strong or as nuanced on these issues.",
        "And if he wants to demonstrate that he's a uniter, well, here's the issue we need uniting on.",
        "We need to find common ground.",
        "So he needs to move closer to a middle position, a common ground position, on an issue that is, in many ways, intractable and not resolvable.",
