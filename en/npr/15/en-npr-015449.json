        "It has been one day now since the release of thousands of pages describing, in new detail, CIA interrogations in overseas prisons.",

        "And some of the details he provided was for example, traits and profiles that al-Qaida sought in western operatives after September 11th.",
        "He told interrogators how al-Qaida might conduct surveillance of potential targets in the U.S.",
        "He mentioned he'd been in the jail in the U.S.",
        "for not paying his bills.",
        "And apparently that was part of the reason why he so disliked this country.",
        "You know, there were other details...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...too but you get the idea.",
        "Well, are as those bullet points enough to at least to make an argument that they justify the harsh techniques of interrogation.",
        "Well the inspector general's report that came out yesterday concluded that the harsh interrogation techniques, and this is his quote, \"\"did not uncover evidence of imminent plots\"\" unquote.",
        "And the CIA says the information they got from the detainees led to arrests and disrupted attack plans in progress.",
        "But they have stopped short of attributing this directly to the enhanced interrogations.",
        "You know, in interrogation circles they talk about an interrogation being successful when you can foil the plot or break-up a cell or get some detainee to give up his boss.",
        "And that didn't seem to have happened in this case.",
