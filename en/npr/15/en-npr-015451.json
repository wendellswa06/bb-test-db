        "It's made with Heinz ketchup, garlic and salted brown beans - a Chinese staple - plus some other ingredients.",
        "It's sweet and savory, mellow and pungent, a bit different than your standard barbecue sauce.",
        "Wanda wanted to learn how to cook like her mother and that endeavor was a bit of a challenge.",
        "My mother immigrated to the U.S.",
        "in 1948 and she had to teach herself how to cook, and she always trusted her own instincts and her own sense of taste.",
        "And she had this way of measuring all the food.",
        "She'd use like her fingers and she's telling me.",
        "She'd say something like, you use a finger of garlic.",
        "And I wonder, well, which finger?",
        "And she never wrote any of her recipes down.",
        "And if she had, they would've been in Chinese anyway, which I can't read.",
        "But that's how she cooked.",
        "In one summer, after my mom died, my husband and I went to a friend's house for an intimate potluck barbecue.",
        "We brought the ribs and I made my mom's sauce.",
        "But I was worried that my friends wouldn't like it.",
        "It turns out I had nothing to worry about at all because they loved it.",
        "And then they were asking me for a recipe.",
        "And I said, well, have you got a pen?",
        "So, what you do is, you start out with a fingerful of garlic, and then we go from there.",
        "Hmm.",
        "No need to get a pen.",
        "You can go to our Web site and find that recipe.",
        "But first, preparation is key to our next summer food that comes to us from Mary Carole Battle of St. Petersburg, Florida, who by the way celebrates her birthday this Friday."

        "Mary, I am intrigued.",

        "Well, I had to ask my mother.",
        "It's just the pure simplicity of it.",
        "It's why it's called wacky cake, it's just all poured into one pan, mixed up, and thrown in the oven.",
        "What are the ingredients?",
        "I have the recipe right here.",
        "One and half cups flour, one cup sugar, a half-teaspoon salt, a quarter cup cocoa, and one teaspoon baking soda.",
        "You sift that and mix it up and make three holes.",
        "In the first hole, you put a teaspoon vanilla; in the second hole, a tablespoon of white vinegar; and in the third hole, six tablespoons of cooking oil or salad oil.",
        "Vinegar?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay.",
        "I'm sorry.",
        "That one stopped me, but you should keep going.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Then you pour a cup of cold water over the whole thing and just stir it up.",
        "And if it's in the pan that you're going to bake it in, just pop it in the oven at 350 degrees for about half an hour."

        "In Ramallah at the parliament, gunmen took out any Hamas-affiliated employees, including the deputy speaker and they said that anyone associated with Hamas should not come back.",

        "The body of a Fatah field commander was found in southern Gaza.",
        "Hamas said that the bodies of seven Hamas men were found in the basement of the Preventive Security Force in Gaza, which had been allied to Fatah before all these happened.",
        "And there were also reports that two Fatah loyalists were killed in Gaza, that Fatah said they were revenge killings.",
        "One of the problems in Gaza is that all these gunmen are walking around with, you know, black masks.",
        "So it's hard to tell who's killing who and whether it's on personal issues or whether it's on, you know, national issues."
