        "She also reprised some of what she clearly considers to be her greatest hits from last night's debate especially the answer she gave to the question of what she would do if two American cities were hit by al-Qaeda, and it was a question that she feels showcases her ability to be commander in chief.",
        "She said as a president I would retaliate, as swiftly and as prudent, you know, it is the job of the president to protect and defend us, and she clearly is running even in this primary season with the general election campaign in mind.",
