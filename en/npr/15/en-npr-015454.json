        "And how did you get involved as a gay black man with the Republican Party?",
        "I think like a lot of gay Republicans, I think the most physically conservative, socially, more moderate and liberal.",

        "I was chief party adviser for their previous two governors, both from the Republican governor Paul Cellucci and Governor Swift.",
        "So I was politically involved in terms of philosophy, but also I worked in the Republican administration.",
        "How did your leadership of the Log Cabin Republicans add race into the mix there, because I'm assuming that the organization is mostly white?",
        "It is.",
        "I think Republicans tried - they'll always (unintelligible) that, but tried to view race as not a defining issue and to treat people equally regardless of the race or gender.",
        "So from my perspective when I was president of Log Cabin, people (unintelligible) that I do a good job and hopefully I did.",
        "I think they were pleased to have some diversity in the leadership, but it felt there was not a situation where people say, oh, we need someone black, so we'll pick Abner.",
        "Jasmyne, let me turn to you.",
        "So when you think about your role in the universe where you have a blog, you do political advocacy, you do a lot of different things.",
        "Where do you fit it in terms of raising specifically gay and lesbian issues, and then also translating them to the black community and to other communities?",
        "You know, I sort of look at my role as just that of, you know, being an African-American female who is also lesbian.",
        "So, you know, I'm dealing with all of the issues that, you know, we deal with us as blacks, issues we deal with as gays and lesbians, as well as just being female.",
        "So when I look at the work that I do, I'm always very conscious to make sure that, you know, especially sort of in the gay and lesbian political arena -which oftentimes it's very colorless - that, you know, we have a voice and that we're represented.",
        "And that's very, very important to me.",
        "And at the same time, let me ask the American community, it's very important that it's known that we're not all homophobic and that we're not all heterosexual and that we are and have always been an important part of the community.",
        "So it's kind of blending the two together.",
        "And race, you know, becomes an issue oftentimes between the gay and lesbian community as well as homophobia in the African-American community."

        "I think it's, you know, the forum for me and for a lot of people is particularly important because when you think again of gay and lesbian politics, you'd never think of sort of the subgroups that are come in to the African-Americans, Latinos and Asians.",
