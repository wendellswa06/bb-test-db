        "The risks of sun exposure to your skin - skin cancer, sunburn - are very well-established, so you still need to use sunscreen when you're going to be outside and on exposed skin.",
        "The FDA has said that they consider that titanium dioxide and zinc oxide as active ingredients are safe and aren't absorbed through the skin.",
        "However, in Consumer Reports' tests of sunscreens, we found that they don't perform as well.",
        "So one thing that you might want to consider is using a sunscreen that does not have oxybenzone.",
        "Of all the chemical active ingredients, that's the one that seems to be most worrisome, although it's far from determined whether or not it is actually a problem.",
