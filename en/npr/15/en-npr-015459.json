        "Senator Ed Markey says he won't meet with Kavanaugh because the president is now an unindicted co-conspirator to a crime and that, as a result, Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is, quote, \"\"tainted\"\" and should be considered illegitimate.",

        "What did you hear from him on that issue?",
        "Well, it turns out that some of the things that he has written as long as 10 years ago he now amends in his answers.",
        "And we should let people know he once wrote that a president shouldn't be subject to civil litigation or criminal investigation while in office.",
        "He made it clear to me over and over again that he did not believe there was any constitutional obstacle to the president being held responsible while in office.",
        "But it was merely in his Minnesota Law Review article a suggestion to Congress - giving the president a breathing period or break during his presidency before he'd be held responsible.",
        "How does this affect your thinking given that there is a special counsel looking into the president's actions, there are civil case attorneys seeking to get him in a deposition?"

        "In a way, the acclaim the world now heaps so justly on Nelson Mandela commemorates them, too.",
        "There was Walter Sisulu, who first recruited Nelson Mandela to the African National Congress, and formed the ANC Youth League with him in 1944.",
        "He was arrested many times, and spent years living underground before they were arrested and stood trial in 1964.",
        "When a prosecutor told the court the defendants did not represent the real South Africa, Mr. Sisulu replied: Why doesn't the government put the matter to the test by having elections in which everyone could vote?",

        "He was inmate 468/64.",
        "After their release, Mr. Kathrada wrote a great memoir, called \"\"A Simple Freedom,\"\" in which he said that a prisoner can look through his cell window and choose to see either bars or stars.",
        "There's Stephen Biko, a fierce, funny and eloquent former medical student who led the Black Consciousness Movement.",
        "In the 1970s, while Nelson Mandela and other ANC leaders languished in prison, Mr. Biko seemed to many exactly what South Africa's racist regime feared he would be: the next generation in the struggle against apartheid.",
        "He was banned in 1973, and arrested outright in 1977; thrown into a prison cell in Port Elizabeth, stripped and chained.",
        "Police said, unconvincingly, that he struck his own head.",
        "So they put him, naked, into the back of a police van and drove 750 miles to Pretoria, where he died of his wounds.",
        "Steven Biko was almost 31.",
        "There are so many names to memorialize, they are difficult to remember.",
        "There were the men, women and children who died at the Sharpeville Massacre in 1960, when police fired into a crowd protesting a law of South Africa's apartheid; and those who died in the Soweto shootings of 1976.",
        "And there were thousands of township kids who marched peacefully, and boldly, into police bludgeons.",
        "Each sacrifice helped tip South Africa toward justice.",
        "In many ways, the victims of apartheid pardoned their country.",
        "As Stephen Biko said: In time, we shall be in a position to bestow on South Africa the greatest possible gift - a more human face."
