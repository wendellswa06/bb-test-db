        "What she asked was if I could put something together that would allow us, as the younger group, to speak to some of these women: Dorothy Hayden, Mrs. King, and Tina Turner, and Diana Ross, and just a wonderful, wonderful group of women.",
        "And I, of course, said I would love to do it.",

        "And once he suggested that to me, it kind of brought the whole thing into focus for me, because I knew that if I could make kind of a choir of these youngins singing this praise song to these wonderful, legendary women, it would really be able to bring forward the feeling that she was looking for and that I was definitely trying to tap into for this work.",
        "We should also talk a little bit about the book We Speak Your Names.",
        "The poem, of course, is in there, but there are little descriptions of each one of the ladies that were saluted, from Dorothy Hayden, to Lena to Horne to Leontyne Price and Rosa Parks, and many, many others.",
        "But also, a brief synopsis of your thoughts of the weekend.",
        "And one of the things I found most intriguing as I perused the book was this: you talked about seeing a snippet of it on Entertainment Tonight, and that they really missed what the evening, and what the weekend was about.",
        "If you weren't there, it is really almost hard to convey what it was.",
        "It really is.",
        "That's part of why I'm really happy that we're publishing the book and that, you know, that she's decided to do a special of her own--Oprah is--where she's gonna to kind of frame how we looked at that weekend.",
        "Because it's difficult to convey to people how much it felt like something deeper than a great, big party.",
        "That it really was a tribute to people whose work and whose lives have made it possible for so many of us--I know for you and for me--to do the work that we do.",
        "And I'm very happy that she's going to really let us take another look at that.",
