        "I think everybody who works on poverty has seen that just having these vertical approaches is falling short in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.",
        "We gathered together what we called the panel to look at poverty, 25 experts with different expertise.",
        "And they went out to many communities and pulled together a report about what types of jobs, what types of programs would be helpful.",
        "And, you know, our foundation alone can't possibly fund all those things.",
        "We'll continue to be mostly specialized in education.",
        "But I think it's brought a lot of philanthropists together to think, OK, if we front various pieces of this, how can it be more coordinated to have a significant impact?",
        "Before I let you go, you formed this foundation in the year 2000 with your wife Melinda, and virtually every year since then you have made the argument that this is a better time to be alive than it has ever been.",
        "And you make that argument again in your 2018 letter.",
        "And I wonder whether you think people remain unconvinced, and if so, why.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "People are exposed to the setbacks - the natural disasters, the disagreement.",
        "And so when you say to somebody, hey, you know, the murder rate in the country is less than half of what it was, they're kind of surprised.",
        "They, you know, think, oh, it must be the most violent time both globally and domestically.",
        "And that's a bit of a problem because if you want to look at why we've made progress, if you're blind to it, you're both, you know, a bit depressed and not getting the benefit of where things really went super well.",
        "So we can be outraged about the things we haven't fixed yet while actually recognizing that we've made a lot of progress and that that should inspire us and educate us.",
        "Bill Gates of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, thanks for taking the time to talk with us today.",
        "Thank you.",
        "You have to look for a few basic things.",
        "Number one, is the site a retailer in the offline world?",
        "Is there a physical presence for that site offline?",
        "That's one thing you can do.",
        "Number two, you can look for specific things like a contact number.",
        "Is there a phone number to call, or is there simply a virtual shop online in cyberspace?",
        "And then when you're actually shopping, you need to look for clues like the padlock in the bottom left-hand or right-hand corner of your browser screen.",
        "Only when you're on the shopping page, or more specifically, where it says `http,' you know, right before you type the www, look for the letter S.",
        "That means the transaction is, in theory, secure.",
        "So when you say, `https,' when should you look for that kind of information on your Web browser?",
        "It starts out with http, w-w-w-dot whatever Web site you're on dot-com.",
        "As you progress through the shopping on that Web site and you get to the actual payment page, the page where you have to plug in your credit card and other personal information for the specific transaction, that page, right before you click `submit,' should have `https,' S standing for secure.",
        "And what about people e-mailing and saying, `Your bank account has been adjusted.",
        "You need to e-mail us with your Social Security number'?",
        "When do you decide when someone is e-mailing you and saying, `I need this, that and the other from you,' when is it legitimate and when is it fake?",
        "One of the easiest ways that you can check is go into your e-mail system and there is a option that you can go into--doesn't matter what e-mail service you use--and ask to display headers.",
        "You want to reveal the actual `from' address, not where they're saying it's coming from.",
        "Where is this e-mail actually originating from?",
        "That is one of the scam busters and easiest things that consumers can do to prevent themselves..."

        "Basically, someone had gotten my debit card information, and they kept charging up $70 increments until they drained my entire bank account.",
        "Now here's the twist on it.",
        "When I went to the bank, they froze my account, so I had no money whatsoever, and I learned a valuable lesson there.",
        "If you are going to make online purchases, only use a credit card.",
        "Never use your debit card, because if a credit card is charged, they will look to get their money back.",
        "If you use your debit card, it's your money, and that's going to be frozen until the issue is resolved.",
        "So never use your debit card for online purchases.",
        "And let me just tell you that tomorrow, we're going to continue our conversation with Mario by talking about what do to if your identity, like mine, has been stolen or compromised.",
        "All right, Farai.",
        "And we should note that Mario Armstrong covers technology for Baltimore-area NPR member stations WEAA and WYPR.",
