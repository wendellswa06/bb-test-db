        "Well, I suspect not.",
        "I mean, I don't think it's a very good ad.",

        "I mean, you start out with these comments about being a celebrity and not really having any substance, and then you move into a discussion about oil and Obama's views on that.",
        "It's not a very effective ad, and what it reminds me of a little bit - and I want to stress the word little - is the ad actually that was aired here in Tennessee which used a blond women to try to attack Congressman Harold Ford in his bid for the Senate.",
        "I don't it's any accident that Paris Hilton and Britney Spears were in this ad, two young, blond women.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And what I was struck by when I looked at these ads was that they're almost sort of subliminal.",
        "In other words, if people haven't seen these ads, it's hard to explain, but the images of Spears and Hilton sort of flash by in between pictures of Barack Obama speaking before this massive crowd in Berlin.",
        "And I was, you know - I don't know.",
        "You've analyzed these kinds of ads.",
        "What is the purpose of that kind of tactic?",
        "It almost felt like, subliminally, you were supposed to be associating Obama with these two young Hollywood - not even stars really, anymore, but - celebrities.",
        "That's right.",
        "Yeah, I mean, failed stars, in some sense...",
        "Right.",
        "Because of their own particular personal problems.",
        "I mean, I think it's an effort - the McCain campaign is struggling with a way to express their concerns about Barack Obama's experience and lack of substance.",
        "So, they continue to struggle to find the right ad, the right message, that will communicate this.",
        "And this is typical of candidates who are behind, because they're trying to find some issues, some ledge, or maybe catapult, if you will, that will allow them to get back into a more competitive standing.",
        "And this goes on all the time, and it's not unique in the sense of a strategy of it.",
        "The substance here, I think, is unique, and some people, maybe incorrectly or correctly, depending on your point of view, would even say there's a little bit of racial politics involved here, too.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Now, earlier, there was a McCain ad which implied that high gas prices were Barack Obama's fault, and the Obama campaign then ran an ad that challenges that.",
        "And it played a portion of the McCain ad in order to refute it.",
        "So, let's listen to that ad and talk about that."

        "Now, what's your analysis of that ad, where he actually incorporated some of the McCain ad into his own campaign commercial?",
        "Well, actually, that's a reasonably common tactic, at least over the last 20 years.",
        "The first person to do that at the presidential level was Michael Dukakis, who was very upset about some of the ads that Senior Bush was running in 1988, and he then ran ads attacking the ads that were being aired against him.",
        "So, that's common, and it's happened by, you know, other candidates as well at the presidential level.",
        "I don't think this ad is particularly inspired either.",
        "But it's, you know, it's just common to try to deal with this, to try to knock McCain off his game, because he's trying to be somebody who's above partisan politics, who's truly bipartisan, but yet he's firing off these attacks.",
        "And so the Obama people, maybe correctly, think that this will be an effective tactic.",

        "We have pretty clear evidence that if you tell people something's negative, they react a little differently to it.",

        "Yeah, I very much agree with your guest.",

        "And you know, I think that the Obama and McCain ads, the original ads about gas prices and so forth, regardless of, you know, kind of setting aside the factual - whether they were factual or not, they can be effective in that they have a particular message.",
        "But it seems like a lot of ads, they're not necessarily personal attack ads, but they're - they get people so far away from a particular message that a candidate is supporting.",
        "You know, they're not really contrasting the candidates, they're just attacking one person, and then leaving a big vacuum.",
        "And perhaps that could be effective as a political strategy, but if the candidate is really ultimately trying to support some set of policies, it may not be effective in the long term outside of the election in getting that policy through.",
        "John Geer, what's your reaction to that?"

        "Well, there are a couple of very sound observations there.",
        "I mean, first of all, the negative ads overstate the negative, and so, it pushes the - you know, the candidates seem much more ridiculous than they really are.",
        "Of course, the flip side is that if you take the positive ads, they're way overselling the positive aspects, and so the answer lies somewhere in between.",
        "What the real question that we as political scientists don't have a really good handle on yet is, do ads - let's say, a lot of negative ads - affect a candidate's - whoever wins that race - ability to govern after the election?",
        "A few people have looked at that, and the answer seems to be basically a favorable one, but we haven't studied it as effectively as we could.",
        "What - favorable, meaning - what do you mean by favorable?",
        "Meaning...",
        "Well, that it looks like - that basically the content of ads are kind of a precursor to the agenda that the candidates are going to pursue once they're in office, and so, that these ads are just not solely strategy, solely unimportant, that the candidates do pay attention.",
        "Because remember, let's say that Barack Obama wins, or John McCain wins, not only do they want to govern effectively, but they're already going to be thinking about 2012, and they know full well that if they don't fulfill the promises that they made in '08 that it's going to come back to haunt them.",
        "Whoever runs against them will certainly raise them.",
        "And so there's that kind of incentive to try to make these claims and these promises come to life.",
        "But oftentimes, these ads will push candidates in directions that they don't necessarily anticipate because they've got to respond to attacks and criticisms.",
        "But it's a conversation.",
        "I mean, again, one of the things about attack ads is that - let's say that for Barack Obama's attacked, and even if it's an unfair attack and it's inaccurate, all like that, if Barack Obama can't respond effectively to an attack, how is he going to govern as president?",
        "Because as President Bush could tell you right now, every day he comes under attack.",
        "It's part of being president.",
        "Right.",
        "And so you've got to be prepared and be able to deal with that.",
        "Even if the attacks were unfair, you've got - just being able to respond effectively is an important skill and something the public needs to know.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks for your call, Steve.",
        "Thanks.",
        "But if the drum beat becomes so negative, isn't that harmful?",
        "I mean, if the attack ad - if that's all people are seeing?",
        "Well, I mean, it depends.",
        "It's a hard question to answer, for sure.",
        "But we know, for example, 2004 was the most negative campaign probably since 1948 and certainly in the era of television.",
        "Yet that very negative campaign saw huge jump in turnout from 2000 to 2004, and the public needs to know about the bad sides of these candidates.",
        "I mean, when you're asking - you know, when you're going to go buy a car, you want to know both the good and the bad."
