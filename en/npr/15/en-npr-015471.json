        "By using those - yeah, you're right.",

        "And then if, let's say, that is one of the goals - which I'm not so sure about that, but that's OK - the question becomes, how does Barack Obama respond to it?",
        "I mean, Barack Obama does need to show that he has real substance, that he's got real, you know, heft in a lot of different ways.",

        "He has lots of talents.",
        "But over the course of the campaign, that's going to be the big thing.",

        "The risk of that is that if during the course of the campaign Obama shows himself to be pretty tough, pretty substantive, and does well, for instance, in the debates and his acceptance speech, et cetera, it's going to really pose problems for the McCain campaign.",
        "And it reminds me, in some ways, of the '80 campaign, where Carter talked about what a risk Reagan was.",

        "And as opposed to that, Obama's campaign ad just went to talking about Obama, as opposed to firing back, you know, in what I see to be a childish way.",
        "So, for me, that was effective in the way...",
        "So, you didn't think it was a negative ad?",
