        "But one of the things that a lot of people walked away thinking was that these are American and Northern Hemisphere fishing cultures that need to be changed.",
        "I wondered if she wanted to comment about indigenous fishing, say, in the Galapagos or in the Philippines.",
        "A lot of people in the audience had heard her speak about changing the fishing culture, but I think a lot more needs to be said about cultures outside of European and North American cultures.",

        "We started with the large creatures, have by and large eliminated on the order of 90 percent of the big fish in the ocean through the new means that have developed largely in the last 50 years, new acoustic means to locate fish...",
