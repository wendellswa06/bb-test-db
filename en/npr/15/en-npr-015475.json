        "You know, they are fearful that once in prison, these radicalized people might influence the others.",
        "And in French prisons, the rate of people who are mentally disturbed is very high.",
        "It's around at least one-third of the inmates.",

        "And in this case, it's very difficult to have spies because they would not cooperate with the authorities.",
        "Once people are separated, what does the prison do then?",
        "You know, in November - October, November 2014, one single prison segregated people before the law was enacted.",
        "And that was Fresnes, which is in the neighborhood of Paris.",
        "What they intend to do is to have a kind of program of de-radicalization.",
        "It is based on the fact that there should be programs integrating them, communication with them not only on daily life's issues but also on religious matters, which is very complicated in France because of the laicite.",
        "Laicite means that religion is a private matter and the state government should not get involved in it.",
