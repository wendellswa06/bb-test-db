        "McConnell said Republicans wanted more time to negotiate changes to the bill before it hit the floor.",
        "That's because once it does, Republicans wanting to amend it may have to muster 60 votes, since any Democrat can filibuster GOP amendments.",
        "It used to be relatively rare that so-called motions to proceed, or to bring up a bill, were filibustered.",
        "Before Democrats became the majority in 2007, such filibusters occurred only about eight times a year.",
        "Since then, the Republican minority has nearly quadrupled the frequency of such filibusters, which is why New York Democrat Charles Schumer convened a meeting last week of the rules committee he chairs.",
        "It was the first of what Schumer said would be a series of hearings on what to do about the Senate filibuster.",
        "The threat of filibusters has become an almost daily fact of life in the Senate, influencing how we handle virtually everything debated on the Senate floor.",
        "The filibuster used to be the exception to the rule.",
        "In today's Senate, it's becoming a straitjacket.",
        "Schumer held the hearing at the urging of New Mexico Democrat Tom Udall.",
        "He's part of a group of freshmen and sophomore Democrats who've gotten fed up with the filibuster.",
        "It is time again for reform.",
        "There are many great traditions in this body that should be kept and respected, but stubbornly clinging to ineffective and unproductive procedures should not be one of them.",
        "GOP leader McConnell was also at the hearing.",
        "His message on changing the filibuster: Don't do it."
