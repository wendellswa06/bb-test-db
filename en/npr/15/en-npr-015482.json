        "Historian Stephanie Coontz says she's seen the same patterns over and over again in the last century.",
        "During the Great Depression, the divorce rate went down; domestic violence went up.",
        "In the 1970s, when states began to permit no-fault divorces, this had an immediate effect on domestic violence.",
        "In the first five years after the adoption of no-fault divorce, divorce rates did, indeed, rise.",
        "But domestic violence rates fell by about 20 to 30 percent, and wives' suicide rates fell by 8 to 13 percent.",
        "So we know that divorce actually provides a safety valve.",
        "Women were not the only beneficiaries.",
        "It also has reduced the rate at which husbands are murdered by their wives, so it's been a lifesaver for some men as well.",
        "Coontz predicts that when the current downturn ends, we will see exactly what happened after the Great Depression.",
        "Couples that have postponed this, or even one individual in a couple who has postponed seeking a divorce because of the financial recession, is going to feel much more enabled to get that divorce afterwards.",
        "As the Great Depression lifted and more people found jobs, history shows the divorce rate went back up.",

        "will promote democratic reform.",
        "He challenged not only adversaries such as Syria, but also allies like Bahrain.",

        "President Obama began with the observation that peaceful protesters have brought more change to the Middle East in the last six months than violent extremists have delivered in decades.",
        "The pace of change has been unsettling at times, but not unfamiliar.",
        "Mr. Obama likened the demonstrators standing up to power in Egypt and Tunisia to civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks and the patriots behind the Boston Tea Party.",
        "There are times in the course of history when the actions of ordinary citizens spark movements for change because they speak to a longing for freedom that has been building up for years.",
        "The president said Americans should approach these revolutions with a sense of humility because the citizens of the Middle East will determine their own fate.",
        "But Mr. Obama said the U.S.",
        "will support those working for democracy and self-determination, even if that sometimes means looking beyond our own narrow interests like security or protecting the flow of oil.",
        "Yes, there will be perils that accompany this moment of promise.",

        "presidents have long paid lip service to the need for greater freedom and democracy in the Middle East, only to find themselves frustrated by the sclerotic governments in the region.",
        "What we have is we have a different set of opportunities.",
        "As the Middle East is in a case of greater flux, there are opportunities for larger steps than we've seen up to now.",
        "And the question is whether the U.S.",
        "can play a constructive role helping these societies take steps that in many ways the U.S.",
        "has wanted them to take for quite some time.",
        "Mr.",
        "Obama says one way to support the region's fledgling democracies is with economic aid.",

        "When Robbins went to the Indiana Department of Health looking for information, she says workers there directed her to a clinic that only does TB testing and standard physicals - no Pap smears, no breast exams, no STD tests.",
        "If you don't have any insurance, really, it's kind of like cut and dry.",

        "She says this intense focus on abortion is unfair.",
        "The mission of Planned Parenthood, principally, is to provide basic reproductive health care to patients and most of those, the vast majority of them, are low-income women and men here in Indiana.",

        "I would call it branding.",
        "I think they're branded.",

        "But Betty Cockrum says the measure prevents 22,000 women from accessing Planned Parenthood without paying out of pocket, and the other options the governor talks about won't be able to handle that load.",
        "The midtown Indianapolis location Nicole Robbins uses will lose about $155,000 per year if it can no longer accept Medicaid."
