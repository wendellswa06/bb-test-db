        "We don't try to feed six billion people with wildlife anymore.",
        "We never did try to feed that many people.",
        "But going back 10,000 years, as hunter-gatherers, we largely made a living from wildlife.",
        "It's only when we started to cultivate that we began to get to an era where we could support larger numbers, and today, about half the calories that feed the people of the world come from a handful of grasses, you know, corn, rice, wheat.",
        "Wildlife from the sea is still contributing to the protein that we extract.",
        "But we have really not only taken the fish themselves, but we've destroyed much of the resilience of the ocean through the by-catch that goes along with taking the fish that are consumed and the habitat destruction.",
        "It's really a growing problem.",
        "Now there are some guides that have been circulating.",
        "In Monterey, the aquarium has one that's useful that gives a guide for the red list that you'd better watch out for and not consume the things, such as the various species of tuna, especially blue fin; swordfish is on the red list; orange roughy, certainly.",
        "These creatures may take 30 years to grow and may be a hundred years old by the time they reach your plate, 30 years to mature.",
        "So in time, we will necessarily have to look to ways to cultivate what we take from aquatic systems for large amounts of protein if we are to take aquatic creatures at all.",
        "Ira, there's one thing that I hope we can have the chance to talk about, and that is the importance of the ocean beyond what we can take out of it or what we can put into it.",
        "The ocean, after all, governs the way the world works.",
        "It's our life support system, and we've been taking it for granted, thinking that it's infinitely resilient, able to withstand whatever we put in or whatever we take out.",
        "But we've learned the hard way in the last 50 years in particular that destruction of places such as the mangroves and coral reefs and even what we're doing in the deep sea has repercussions back to the system as a whole.",
        "And we have a chance, but it will slide away from us unless we take it in the near future, to take actions that will protect those elements that make the planet work as it does.",
        "Tell us about what parts of the ocean, then--let's get into this conversation, if you'd like to have it, 'cause I'd like to have it, too.",
        "What parts of the ocean need the protection?",
        "How do we protect them, and how do we put back after we've taken so many years?",
        "Well, on the land in the early part of the 20th century, policies began to emerge recognizing that we have the capacity to destroy the natural systems, whether it's a river or a forest or whatever, but we're not very good at knowing how to put things back together again.",
        "The Park Service came into being to protect areas of natural beauty, our cultural, our historic, our natural heritage, and today, not just in North America but around the world, about 12 percent of the land enjoys some form of protection.",
        "In the ocean, it's a tiny fraction of 1 percent, and that's probably because we still have this attitude that the ocean is infinite and able to rebound no matter what we do.",
        "But again, in the ocean, we're learning not only that it can be influenced by what we do but we can take positive actions to protect what's there.",
        "And just as on the land, some organizations, not just the Park Service or parks services around the world, but I'm working closely with Conservation International, with their efforts to identify critical areas in the sea that are like the critical areas that have been identified as, quote, \"\"hot spots,\"\" places of high diversity and high threat, that if we can invest in those places, we'll do a pretty good job of stabilizing some of these destructive processes.",
        "One of those places--let's go through a few of them in order perhaps.",
        "One of those places you talk about are the seamounts.",
        "What are the seamounts, and why are they so important to preserve?",
        "Well, we've just recently have discovered that they're there.",
        "If you want to...",
        "What are they?",
        "Big, high places, mountains in the seas or what...",
        "Mountains in the sea.",
        "Sea mountains, basically.",
        "In the 1950s, when Rachel Carson wrote \"\"The Sea Around Us,\"\" there was some knowledge of the formations in the sea, but really most of what we know about the configuration of the seafloor, extensive mountain ranges, run down the Atlantic, the Pacific and Indian oceans like giant backbones.",
        "And then individual peaks that just stand out throughout the ocean basins that arise from the bottom of the sea up to at least a thousand meters that qualify technically as a seamount, and they're crowned with life.",
        "They're--one of the special things about them is the apparent high degree of specific endemism, creatures that live there and nowhere else, not only in the ocean or the world but in the universe.",
        "That's it.",
        "We look at the Galapagos as a special place because it has creatures that occur there and nowhere else that we know about.",
        "The same appears to be true of these undersea islands.",
        "They don't break the surface, but they're islands nonetheless separated from other places where such creatures can grow by many miles and so they've developed their own character."

        "Diversity has its place, a really important place in the world.",
        "In terms of providing stability, when changes occur, if there's great diversity, somebody's going to be able to respond favorably to those changes.",
        "If you've got everybody basically responding in the same way, then the consequences can be really drastic.",
        "Should a seamount then--should that be included then as a--even though it's in the middle of the ocean outside of international boundaries, should that be included as a conservation, make a park out of these areas, a place you can't drag those nets and rip up everything that's on the surface of the mountain?",
        "I mean, what is your idea about how do we conserve them or preserve them?",
        "Yes, indeed.",
        "And he does home stay.",
        "He would put a diplomat or an ambassador to stay in the home of one of his constituents.",
        "And you did that.",
        "Well, actually about 64 percent of the planet, the blue heart of the planet, the ocean out there, beyond exclusive economic zones, is like the Wild West.",
        "Presently, there's little to inhibit people from doing just about anything they want to do out there, and a handful of industries and a handful of nations are currently moving out into the high seas and unilaterally taking actions that are extracting from the high seas treasures, if you will, resources that, if they belong to anybody, they belong to everyone, and yet, they're disproportionately destroying something that we don't know how to put back together again.",
        "And just some examples that by trawling, using these heavy nets that scrape the sea floor, like using a bulldozer to catch songbirds and squirrels, they're knocking down ancient corals, sponges--the whole cross-section of life that is there, and it is simply thrown away, in order to capture a relatively small number of fish that feed not a lot of people, but a high-end luxury market, people who are not really dependent on the sea for food, but rather are willing to pay a high price, and all of us pay a high price because of the destruction that is brought about because of this action.",
        "Now the United Nations could and the United Nations may, in fact, come together and have a resolution.",
        "There is some discussion, as we sit here right now, about the possibility that just as high seas drift nets were sort of put off-limits back in 1992 because they were found to be so destructive and disproportionately favoring just a few industries and a few countries at a loss to all of us, and similarly, at this point in time, now that people are moving deeper and further offshore to get the last remaining pockets of protein in the sea, there is a similar concern that the cost of doing this and the big bank balance sheet, if you will--the cost to all of us for all time for the benefit of a few in the short term is just not worth it.",
        "Talking with Sylvia Earle this hour on TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.",
        "What other places in the ocean--what about--you mentioned the coral reefs.",
        "You mentioned the fact that these nets just carpet-sweep everything that they touch at the bottom.",
        "Are these the biggest threats to the oceans, the fishing threats?",
        "It's certainly high on the list.",
        "It's one of the greatest concerns, but it's also one of the greatest opportunities.",
        "We can do something about that.",
        "There are other things that are happening to the ocean that are also cause for great concern.",
        "The carbon dioxide increase in the atmosphere is affecting the ocean as well by an acidification process that is setting alarms off everywhere.",
        "Suppose the ocean increases to become--becoming increasingly acid.",
        "There is the concern that this would affect things like reefs, weakening the structure.",
        "Perhaps even more a worry, the tiny little creatures in the ocean, the (technical difficulties) and other planktonic (technical difficulties) have calcium carbonate in their shells would be affected in a more acid environment."
