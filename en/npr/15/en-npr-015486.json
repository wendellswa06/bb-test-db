        "We had 70 different organizations, only a hundred and fifty people, that gave rise to something like an action plan for trying to come up with not just `woe is me, here are the problems,' but here are some things we can do.",
        "And I see conservation organizations working together: World Wildlife Fund, Nature Conservancy, Environmental Defense, NRDC--a whole suite of organizations that are really pulling together, or they always have had common objectives, but now seems to me there is increased motivation to try to get the job done, and that means working with industry sometimes, really often, because the solutions are there, or working with governments, working with whatever it takes to find a common ground, to show the connection between a sound environment and a sound economy, a sound environment and health, a sound environment and all the things we hold near and dear, including life itself.",

        "The thing that worries me somewhat is that people seem to be getting increasingly detached from nature.",

        "It used to be pure blue at the surface, but the Gulf of Mexico is suffering these days a bit.",

        "I taught environmental science here in northern New Jersey and the (technical difficulties) economics in environmental studies and has longed grappled with this idea of getting the message to young kids, and I was actually teaching environmental science during the 2000 election, so much of the science was actually tabled for discussions of policy and what--the administration's view on conservation and clear skies, etc. But I'm sure you could talk volumes on that.",
        "The one question I came up with while listening to your description was what are some of the issues that you envision with regards to opening up access and encouraging people to move out into the deep, which may cause some of this increased impact that we're finding?",
        "And I'm a mountain biker as well, and I run into discourse issues and issues of different phrases being interpreted by different groups, hikers, horseback riders, riders, cyclists, all wanting to enjoy the outdoors and the trails that are there for them, but ultimately, this increased activity...",

        "Well, in fact, the idea that the ocean should be respected overall, and as we exploit it--and we will, we are taking things out and letting things flow in--but we must be mindful of the most critical areas and take special care there, the breeding areas for fish, the aggregations where fish get together and whoop it up and do what it takes to make more fish.",
        "I mean, we should certainly protect those occasions and those places.",
        "And there are places specifically that attract not just one kind of fish, but many kinds, for whatever reasons, maybe the currents are just right for dispersing the eggs once they are in the water column.",

        "I mean, we don't have a perfect record from the fossil history, but we do know that only about half of those that we find in the sea occur on the land.",

        "And I--it was a great set-up for me, because I said, `Well, with all due respect to mountain climbing on the land, there are thousands of mountains out there under the sea--tens of thousands--that have not been climbed,' never mind that you have to start at the top and work your way down, but they're not only formations of tremendous interest geologically and otherwise, but biologically, they host this great array of creatures that we are just beginning to know.",
        "Rain forests are wonderful for similar reasons that they have--they host these--this glorious array of diversity.",
        "But think of what's out there in the ocean that hits on these big, broad sections of life, not just splintery ends of individual species, thousands of species of insects, but think about the great trunks of life, jellies and starfish, relatives and things that never occur on the land at all that we have yet to get to know.",

        "There was a commission that independently formed, the Pew Oceans Commission, that came to very similar conclusions about what we need to do to reform fisheries, to establish within the ocean policies that are really geared to protecting the assets there.",
        "And that includes establishing networks of protected areas, national parks, if you will, sanctuaries--whatever you want to call them--the places that we really respect, and it doesn't mean that you don't got there, but it means that you keep them intact because they're so valuable for all the things that we care about in the ocean.",
        "The conference that we had called Defying Ocean's End that brought nations together, that was another turning point, I think, but it's happening all over the world.",
        "I was just at a Wilderness Congress in Alaska; another conference, the first International Marine Protected Area Conference, in Australia just a few weeks ago.",
