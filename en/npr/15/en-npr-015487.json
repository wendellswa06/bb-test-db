        "As Trump's poll numbers continue to fall, he's created two positions above his campaign chairman, who's been embroiled in controversy.",
        "One of them is an executive for Breitbart News, who will fill the role of chief executive.",

        "Now, the Trump campaign is denying that Roger Ailes is an adviser.",
        "What's going on?",
        "Well, what's going on is probably something a little equivalent to arguing over what the definition of, is, is.",
        "Roger Ailes, effectively, informally advised Donald Trump even when he was leading Fox News.",
        "The two are friendly from New York circles.",
        "And I think what you're seeing is Roger Ailes will continue to advise Donald Trump a little bit on positioning, on body language, on how to approach certain key events coming up, like the debates, and probably with a little bit more urgency now that Ailes has more time on his hands and a little bit of a grievance, now he's no longer running Fox News."

        "But of all the people he could look to, why seek out Ailes' help at this point?",

        "Roger Ailes helped to advise 3 of the last 4 Republican presidents to win office through an election.",
        "He's very smart about both politics and about how to handle the media.",
        "And, you know, he really knows how to serve red meat to the Republican and conservative core base that Trump is relying on, even as he, at a certain point, has to expand the number of voters he's appealing to.",

        "And, you know, you can see it in the way in which he was able to - to help influence Republican and conservative politics for so many years through the media.",
        "Well, Trump, though, at times, has clashed with Fox News.",
        "And, pretty famously, after tough questioning by Fox journalist Megyn Kelly during a primary debate, Trump got in a very public feud with Kelly and Fox.",
        "So did that feud not also pit Trump against Roger Ailes?",
        "I think it forced Ailes back on his heels, but I think what Ailes was really doing was trying to, in a sense, triangulate or walk a very delicate line between needing to defend his own journalists.",
        "Trump essentially made that first debate a year ago in the Republican primary about him and Fox News, effectively icing the other nine candidates who were on the stage that night.",
        "But Ailes really didn't come out after Trump that hard.",
        "In fact, Megyn Kelly was somewhat resentful, I can tell you, about the fact that Ailes didn't have her back, to her perception.",
        "And - and that was a grievance that she's had in recent months as she's sought to consider whether she would be better-placed working for a different outlet.",
        "Ailes ultimately did condemn Trump, but he very much wanted Trump back on the airways.",
        "Remember, every time Trump was on the air, the ratings would spike up.",
        "Megyn Kelly, it's worth remembering, is one of the women who's been speaking to the law firm investigating the ongoing and growing sexual harassment scandal that cost Roger Ailes his job.",
