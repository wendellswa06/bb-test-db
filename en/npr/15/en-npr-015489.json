        "I want to begin with South Carolina, obviously at the center of this debate - and holds the first Southern primary.",
        "Remind us how complicated this has been - the issue of the flag - for national candidates visiting in the past.",
        "Well, it's been a hot button issue in South Carolina.",
        "It's sort of a litmus test as to - are you on the side of what South Carolina conservatism stands, or are you within the Republican Party?",
        "When you look at how some of the candidates have responded in the last few days, do you still see kind of remnants of that hesitation?",
        "Well, I think they're being somewhat cautious.",
        "What will be interesting to see is the reaction of potential Republican primary voters and state legislators in South Carolina who are more conservative than the political leadership in the state at this point and whether, in fact, there will be some candidates in the field of Republican presidential candidates who will reject the idea of removing the Confederate flag from public grounds.",
        "Help us understand some of the broader changes that have been happening in some of these states - maybe demographic changes - that are worth noting as an undercurrent to this discussion.",
        "Well, again, there is variation in different states in the South.",
        "And places like North Carolina, for example, were very much affected by the immigration of people in the technical industries in the Research Triangle, for example.",
        "And in Georgia, you've had a big influx of Latino population in recent years.",
        "In South Carolina, for example, there is some change because you're getting people in auto industries which have set up plants and have brought in workers from different areas of the country and people who are, if not in labor unions, at least more sympathetic to the labor movement.",
        "So you're getting this sort of change going on.",
        "And in some cases, you're having increases in African-American population, as some African-Americans who had migrated to the North - that migration has ended, and there's some movement back to the South.",
        "And as some have noted, in South Carolina, one of the senators is African-American - Tim Scott.",
        "Yes, and he's a Republican, but it might be said that not to doing something about the flag might have been an affront to him, as well, at this point.",
        "But do you think that the same discussion could have happened at all a few years ago?",
        "I think that when some crisis or horror story hits, there is always an immediate reaction.",
        "In this case, you're getting a reaction probably that would not have occurred, at least, at this point, had this event not happened."

        "In a way, does it serve as a kind of proxy conversation for something else?",
        "It may, but this is largely, in part, a symbolic issue, although it does have real substantive meeting to the states which are doing it.",
        "And it gets away from the issues which are of greater concern, I think, to African-Americans and other minorities in the South - for example, new voter registration laws reacting to the changes that have been brought about in the Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court decision.",
        "Those sorts of things which are - you know, this may be the sauce, but those of the meat and potatoes of this issue.",

        "NPR's Noah Adams has the story.",
        "In west Michigan, there's an apple-growing region called The Ridge, and here, they'll be talking for years down the road about that 2012 apple calendar.",

        "The buds came out too early.",
        "April, one dark night, the killing frost settled in.",

        "We found, in other words, about 20 apples.",
        "That's how short they are.",

        "And there are actually areas in the Internet where if you know where to go and you know how to get in there, you'll be able to just download already written malicious code and utilize it.",
        "So to answer your question, it becomes a little bit easier because today a hacker doesn't need to absolutely sit down and write the code.",
        "They can obtain the code ready-made, so to speak, from a Web site of like-minded individuals.",
        "How much of what you do now deals with trying to find out - track down who is infecting the Internet?",
        "Quite a bit.",
        "Part of the difficulty in this area of investigation is that we could have a victim company in Silicon Valley have their network intruded upon and we will trace the hack; the final step, we'll be able to trace it to will be an ISP in Eastern Europe or Southeast Asia or something like that, and this is a relatively common occurrence, the origination from areas where we have difficulty obtaining evidence.",
        "So at that point, so to speak, the trail runs cold.",
        "Well, it can.",
        "It's critical for us in this area and for the United States as a whole to develop relationships with these countries whether it's by treaty or otherwise to help obtain evidence in these cybercrime matters.",
        "For instance, I had a prosecution a few years back of the major counterfeiter of Microsoft products who was a Singaporean citizen, and Singapore would not extradite one of their own citizens, and we ran an undercover operation where this individual was lured to Hong Kong, arrested on our arrest warrant, and it took us two and a half years to extradite her from Hong Kong to San Jose where she was prosecuted.",

        "First of all, can you briefly explain what that is?",
        "Well, it's moving many of the applications and computing power from the private individual's PC onto a series of systems that's operated by a provider.",
        "So, your PC or your workstation or your company's network will operate more efficiently because it doesn't need to store and run the actual applications.",

        "What it will do is it'll put a price on anything that generates greenhouse gases by having a system of licenses that are bought and sold, so it's a market-based system, and that will percolate through.",
        "It means that all kinds of things that now might be on the borderline or not worth doing become worth doing because you get some extra savings from not having to buy as many permits.",

        "If you're going to continue doing a hundred thousand tons then you have to buy those extra permits, so you don't want to do that.",
        "And, in fact, if you can cut it down to 60,000 tons, you can sell the extra 20,000 permits.",
        "So any way you look at it, there is a price, part of your cost calculation about those emissions which gives you an incentive to do less of it.",
        "And this is called cap and trade, of course."
