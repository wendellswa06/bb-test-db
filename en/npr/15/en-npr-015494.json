        "So, in the interview, you'll hear some quiet from time to time as his interpreter, Stephen Nugent, interprets his questions.",

        "Here in California, \"\"Fargo\"\" show runner, Noah Hawley, joined me in our studio.",
        "I started by asking Russell if he thought this role could help him break out and really make a living as an actor.",
        "(Through Stephen Nugent) Oh, yes.",
        "I think so, yes, very much because the character is not really specific about being deaf or having any related deaf issues.",
        "It's just \"\"Fargo.\"\" Period.",
        "And Russell, have you always wanted to be an actor?",
        "(Through Stephen Nugent) I have since I was a little kid.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I saw my cousin play the Wicked Witch in \"\"The Wizard Of Oz.\"\" The next thing you know, I wanted to be the witch myself.",
        "And so, I've been playing on stage ever since then.",
        "But for some reason I always knew that, you know, maybe the acting thing won't happen for me.",
        "And so maybe I'll have to become a teacher.",
        "And then \"\"There Will Be Blood\"\" came along and I got it.",
        "And what do you like most about this character that you're playing in \"\"Fargo\"\"?",
        "Obviously, he's not a nice guy.",
        "(Through Stephen Nugent, laughing) Well, I have many friends that have said that the problem with you is that you are the Mr. Nice Guy.",
        "And so I'm just so happy that I was given the opportunity to play somebody that's not myself - that's not me - you know, the villain if you will.",
        "And that's - I've always been motivated to play something like that.",
        "But this character is really nice because he doesn't have to use his voice.",
        "The communication skills are just through signing.",
        "And, you know, Mr. Numbers interprets for me, in the show, which doesn't really happen often on TV.",
        "So that's nice.",
        "Well, I'm happy to hear that you're not that guy.",
        "(Laughing).",
        "Noah, I wanted to ask you - this show is your brainchild.",
        "Where did the character of Mr. Wrench come from?",
        "Well, Russell's in Austin right now.",
        "He's an Austin resident and I also spend a lot of time in Austin.",
        "I lived there for a few years.",
        "I have a home there.",
        "And I'm in a neighborhood called Travis Heights, which is very close to a large school for the deaf.",
        "And as I was formulating the show, I kept seeing sign language around everywhere.",
        "And it's such a compelling and visual means of communication.",
        "But it's also a language that most people don't speak.",
        "So it creates an amazing amount of privacy for deaf people - to be surrounded by hearing people and to be able to communicate in a way that no one can really understand."

        "People have to vote in the primary to be eligible to take part in the caucus, then they have to come back and take part in the caucus.",
        "But he's better organized and so he will do well in the caucuses.",
        "But actually the reason that the Obama areas do better, have more delegates, is because of the way Bush performed in Texas among Hispanic voters in 2004 and how badly our gubernatorial candidate performed in 2006.",
        "So the only areas that really performed well for the Democratic nominee in Texas in 2004 and 2006 were the African-American areas so they got extra districts, extra delegates.",
        "When people talk about even just the media markets in Texas, there are so many of them.",
        "Texas really is a combination, a variety of different areas.",
        "You have the major urban areas, Dallas/Fort Worth, which his about a quarter of the vote in this state normally, and the Houston area, which is another quarter of the vote in the state.",
        "And then you have the valley, the Rio Grande Valley, is a significant part of the vote.",
        "And then the rest of the state is more rural in west Texas and in east Texas.",
        "The interesting thing about the primary is that assuming that Hillary Clinton does well in the Hispanic areas, that she may get two-thirds of the Hispanic vote, Obama gets 80 percent or more of the black vote, that pretty well cancels each other out and the primary will be determined by the white vote.",
        "And what's happened in Texas is in the last 20 or 25 years, the whites who vote in the Democratic primary have gotten progressively more liberal because conservatives don't vote in the Texas Democratic primary anymore.",
        "So this will come down to a battle in May, come down to a battle of who wins the liberal white vote.",
        "And it's very interesting because Hillary Clinton has made a curious decision the last couple of days in the campaign, she's moved right in her media.",
        "She's got this ad, a red phone ad, talking about who's best equipped to be commander-in-chief whereas the Texas Democratic electorate has moved left.",
        "And so the ad may actually work against her because it'll remind liberal Democrats, white Democrats who vote in the primary, that Hillary voted for the war and that Obama was against the war.",
        "It's a very interesting state, very complicated because the state is changing so much.",
        "You have an awful lot of new people in Texas, people who have moved in from the Midwest and from the northeast looking for work.",
        "I suspect that the Clinton's, Bill and Hillary, are in somewhat of a time warp in how they view Texas.",
        "They were active in Texas politics in 1972 for the McGovern campaign.",
        "I'm not sure they fully understand the Texas of 2008.",
        "And if they lose the primary there, it will be because they were thinking of Texas 20 and 30 years ago rather than the way Texas is today.",
        "Texas is still a conservative state in the fall in the general election.",
        "But in the Democratic primary, Texas is a very liberal state."
