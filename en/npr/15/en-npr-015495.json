        "But Mark Patterson, the chief of staff at the U.S.",
        "Treasury from 2009 to last May, dismisses the idea.",
        "I think if you ask anybody who has been secretary of the Treasury, you know, of either party, going back many years, they would tell you that is a god-awful idea.",
        "Ultimately, says Patterson, making payments to bondholders, but delaying checks for seniors on Social Security, for instance, still undermines confidence in the commitment of the United States to meet all its obligations.",
        "If we go into an internal debt crisis, if you will, where we're not paying Social Security beneficiaries who've paid into the system over the years, many of whom live check to check, then we are going to appear like a country that is in a whole lot of trouble and the world is going to view us that way.",
        "Patterson says that Treasury Departments in both Democratic and Republican administration have concluded that paying all of the nation's bills on time, in full, is what makes investors, whether they're individuals or other countries, willing to lend money to the U.S.",
        "I liken it to a household.",
        "If you are a homeowner and you decided to pay only your mortgage payment, but you stopped paying your utility bill, your credit card bill, your student loan bill and your car payment, your credit rating would go down the tubes, even though your mortgage was still current.",
        "And you'd find that from then on very hard to convince people to loan you money down the line.",
        "Even if a president and Treasury secretary decided to prioritize payments, it would be a huge technical challenge, says Patterson, because the Treasury's system that makes 80 million payments a month is automated.",
        "It is designed only to make all payments on time and in full.",
        "There's no switch that says pay payment A, C, D and G today and tomorrow, pay some other set of, you know, priorities that's not all payments.",
        "Both sides in Washington say they don't want to default, but Patterson, who is now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, says he worries every time the nation tiptoes up to the abyss.",
        "He says he fears that one of these times, there won't be a last-minute solution.",
