        "The two genes each make a protein that plays a key role in fighting inflammation.",
        "These two proteins work together to keep the system well balanced and effective.",

        "If we have such a good predictive model we may be able to identify individuals who might develop macular degeneration before they actually develop it and maybe be able to try some preventive treatment which has never been possible before.",

        "Haines says if you know who is going to develop AMD, then you know the right people to test preventive treatments on.",
