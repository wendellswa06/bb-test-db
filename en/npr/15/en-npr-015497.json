        "Its intention is to help prevent additional injury at the time of childbirth, when it's used routinely, and we know that it's happening in 30 to 35 percent of vaginal deliveries in the United States.",
        "And that adds up to how many?",

        "The literature about the short-term outcome shows that we're not getting those benefits, that women with spontaneous tears do just as well and, in some case, better, and also that the act of performing the episiotomy is depriving some women of having the opportunity to have no serious tears and no stitches at the time of their childbirth.",
        "When you were looking at short-term effects, what were you looking for exactly?",
        "Our questions addressed issues like pain and comfort, wound healing complications such as infection and, importantly, also addressed whether or not the tear was severe involving the area near the rectum.",

        "We find that in most cases, the outcomes are completely comparable, whether or not the woman had a routine episiotomy or not, and that in some cases, the episiotomy is creating the opportunity for a more severe injury.",
