        "Oh, the discovery was shocking, really.",
        "I liken it to if you took a pair of keys and threw them up in the air with the purpose of measuring how fast they fall back down, to measure how much the Earth tugs on your keys, and then they went up instead, you would be very confused, and that's the position my colleagues and I were in, in 1998, when we saw the universe not slowing down as we expected but actually speeding up, implying the existence of this very mysterious dark energy.",
        "And where does the dark energy live?",
        "It's here with us in the room.",
        "I brought some with me.",

        "Now, the strange rules of quantum mechanics tell us that that's impossible, that would violate the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.",
        "And so we believe, and we've verified, that there are virtual particles, particles that just flip in out of existence and for very short periods of time borrow energy and create this vacuum energy.",
        "So how do you measure it?",
        "How do you know it's there?",
        "Right, well, what we do is we look at distant exploding stars called supernovae, and we've developed techniques to measure how far away they are and how fast they're moving away from us.",
        "So like in the example when I toss the keys, in order to know that the keys were going up instead of down, you would want to measure how far away they are at different points in time, in that trajectory.",
        "And so supernovae are the tools, are some of our best tools for making those measurements.",
        "Under Dodd's proposal, the consumer bureau would not be headed by the chairman for the Fed.",
        "It would have its own boss, budget and authority to write rules for mortgages, payday lenders and other consumer credit.",
        "But when it comes to enforcing those rules, the bureau would share some of that job with banking regulators.",
        "In fact, a council of banking regulators could veto a consumer rule if they think it would hurt banks.",

        "After all, last November, Senator Dodd called the Federal Reserve an abysmal failure at consumer protection, but things have changed.",
        "Well, again, I've never - I know there were those - this notion of being punitive or - and so forth with the Fed.",

        "Dodd's original proposal actually sought to strip the Fed of most of its supervisory powers, but this version actually adds new responsibilities over the largest financial firms.",
        "The proposal would give the central bank a seat on the new committee of regulators called the Financial Stability Oversight Council.",
        "This council would be charged with watching firms for signs they're posing a risk to the financial system, and it would empower the Fed to impose stricter requirements on such companies, or even break them up.",
        "Meanwhile, the bill tries to avoid future bailouts by having the largest firms pay up front into a fund for crisis situations.",
        "But John Dearie of the Financial Services Forum says instead, the government should impose a tax or fee at the time of liquidation.",
        "You know, here we at a period where we're trying to find every way to encourage bank lending, so taking either $50 or, in the House bill, $150 billion of capital out of the banking system, that money can serve to support, you know, 10 to 12 times that amount in lending.",
        "This is the second draft bill in six months from Senator Dodd.",

        "Marc Solomon, with the Freedom to Marry Coalition, says the fact that New York passed gay marriage with bipartisan support bodes well for bills coming up this year in Washington state, Maryland, and New Jersey - where even some lawmakers who opposed gay marriage just a few years ago are now in the support column.",
        "We're seeing a really dramatic shift.",
        "I think the trend – the accelerating trend is very clear.",
