        "That's right.",
        "Yeah, in fact it's quite interesting.",
        "If we had lived many billions of years ago, we could not have inferred the presence of dark energy, as it only started accelerating the universe a few billion years ago.",
        "And as Lawrence Krauss(ph) points out in his new book, there will come a point in the future when, if the universe keeps accelerating, galaxies will be so far away from us, most of them, we will not be able to see them anymore, and so we will lose the means to actually infer the universe is accelerating.",
        "So before dark energy sort of kicked in, then we had gravity as a greater force pulling the universe back?",
        "That's right, attractive gravity, right.",
        "And then what happened?",
        "And then as the universe got larger, the space between galaxies increased, and ordinary attractive gravity of the dark matter declined, just like you learn in physics class, as one over the distance squared.",
        "So the matter density is always dropping, but the density in this dark energy is about constant.",
        "So if something's falling, and something's staying the same, at some point the thing that's staying the same will win, and we are in that winning period.",
        "And as you say, because the universe is expanding, that space has the dark energy in it, sooner or later it got greater than the attractive force of the gravity because space is getting bigger.",
        "That's right.",
        "And why didn't we know about this until a few years ago?",
        "Well, you might say Einstein gave us a clue.",
        "Einstein wrestled with a problem back before we even knew the universe was expanding, and he was looking for a way to keep the universe from collapsing.",
        "And so he discovered, in his theory of gravity, something like this dark energy - he called it a cosmological constant - could play this role, pushing things away."
