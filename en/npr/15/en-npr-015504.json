        "Now, he gave up on it once he learned the universe was expanding, but it was always sort of waiting in the wings as a possibility.",
        "So once we saw this, that was the first thing we thought of.",
        "Yeah, and he later said that was the biggest blunder in his life.",
        "That's right, that's right.",
        "Yeah, let's go to the audience here, a question here.",
        "Yes, sir.",
        "Can I ask two questions since I got squeezed out in the last segment?",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "OK, we'll see.",
        "Start out with question one.",
        "The first question is: Do you envision this dark matter, this dark energy, to be able to be beneficial or used by man like gravity?",
        "We can use the force of gravity for particular things.",
        "Do you ever see that force, the dark force getting - the dark force...",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "...getting to be significantly large enough, in particular in our area, that we can harness it for something, space travel?"

        "Right.",
        "I think the greatest likelihood is that by following dark energy, we're likely to develop a deeper understanding of physics.",
        "So dark energy is so interesting to us because it lies at the nexus of two incompatible theories in physics.",
        "One is quantum theory, which is physics of small objects, and the other is general relativity, which describes gravity on large scales in the universe.",
        "And dark energy requires us to use both those theories together, though they're incompatible.",
        "So by understanding dark energy, we think we may get to a deeper theory, something people refer to as quantum gravity.",
        "And I would say any time we understand physics more deeply, you know, all bets are off, we learn all kinds of interesting things that are very practical in many cases.",
        "But I don't see us specifically harnessing, you know, a bag of dark energy or a barrel of dark matter.",
        "Well, not harnessing but using it in the way that we use gravity to...",
        "If you throw up a key, it comes down, you know it's going to come down.",
        "Can we make it so if I throw it up, we know it's going away?",
        "You can send a space ship around the moon, for instance, and use the gravity of the moon.",
        "Can you use the dark energy in that way?",
        "Right, so the problem then in that scenario is dark energy is weak enough that we never even saw it until we added it up across most of the universe.",
        "So we don't see any real measurable effects of dark energy within, let's say, the solar system.",
        "And so it's very difficult to imagine the scenario where we would collect on a large scale of the universe to do something.",
        "Oh, is it phalanx?",
        "So it's so weak, that's why we're still sitting on our seat and not being pushed away because it's not strong enough around us to push us apart.",
        "OK, you only get one on now, because that was a double question."

        "Yes, go ahead.",
        "It was a good question though.",
        "Are there different theories, you know, about the nature of dark energy?",
        "And what sort of research is being done to try to distinguish between them or determine what it is?",
        "Right, there are.",
        "The three leading ideas are similar to what Einstein had described, that vacuum energy is a static property of space itself and that it has to do with space's ability to host virtual particles that appear and disappear.",
        "Another possibility is that dark energy is a kind of a field.",
        "You could think of the electric field or the magnetic field.",
        "This would be a kind of temporary forcefield that has the property of making the universe expand faster and faster.",
        "Another possibility is we have finally broken Einstein's theory of general relativity.",
        "He gave it to us in good condition, but we worked with it for so long, and in particular we've now finally tested it in a realm, at a distance that it had never been tested before, and we may have broken it.",
        "So we have a sort of whole armada of surveys that are going to be undertaken over the next 10 years to make very precise measurements, probably 100 times more precise than what we've done so far, to measure a couple of properties of dark energy - its strength and its longevity.",
        "And we will use those measurements to test them against these different possibilities.",
        "Could it be there are whole new areas of physics we don't know about?",
        "Yes.",
        "And new ways of describing the universe we haven't thought of, or we haven't figure out yet?"

        "It is.",
        "You know, we think, we think the most likely possibility is that we actually discover the nature of dark energy, but it could be embedded in the laws of physics.",
        "It could be something deeper that we find and learn about by following dark energy.",
        "And Einstein's theory of gravity, which is a geometrical design, isn't it?",
        "Does dark energy follow the geometry of that, or is it something else?",
        "Well, you can explain it in terms of Einstein's geometry as just another term affecting the curvature or bending of space, but it is also possible that it sits on what we'd say the other side of the equation, not the side that - where you collect all the matter and energy but the side where you describe the physics.",
        "And so we're very excited to try to understand on which side of the equation really this dark energy phenomenon lives.",
        "And there are real experiments you can do to figure it out?",
        "Oh yeah, absolutely.",
        "I mean, the kinds of experiments we first did in 1998 to see that it was there, we're doing those to a much greater degree with much better statistics, with five or six different techniques.",
        "People are even starting to test gravity at very small scale lengths, you know, at the sub-sub-sub-millimeter to see if gravity behaves as it should on the smallest scales.",
        "All right, Adam Riess, we're going to take a short break.",
        "He'll stay with us after the break, and you can still ask some questions.",
        "He is the 2011 Nobel Prize-winner in Physics.",
        "You can ask us questions right here in our audience.",

        "One of the things you always hear about, Adam, when scientists talk about the frontiers of science, and they try to come up with explanations, and one of them is something like: Well, maybe it's the multiverse.",

        "As an observer, I'll tell you about the challenges of the multiverse.",
        "So some of our theories of how the universe began, in a period known as inflation, which would have occurred right after the Big Bang, it is possible that there were many universes created, that they sort of bubble out, a number far too large to count, maybe 10 to the 500 universes.",
        "Billions of them.",
        "Billions, many billions.",
        "And some speculate that each of these universes could have different physical conditions, different physical properties.",
        "And so while the greatest struggle we have with dark energy, the problem is to try to understand actually why is it so small because...",
        "It should be bigger.",
        "Our quantum theory says it should be 120 orders of magnitude bigger.",
        "Wow, so you have problems: What is it, and why don't we have more of it?"
