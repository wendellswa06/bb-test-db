        "Right, and so the folks who subscribe to the multiverse view say, well, that's not really a problem because maybe this dark energy takes many different possible values in all these different universes.",
        "Most of those values are too high to allow galaxies to form, planets to form and us to be here.",
        "So those are unlucky universes.",

        "What's - what I don't really love about this is while it is possible that it's true, it doesn't follow the usual scientific method of the tight coupling between ideas and experiment in that it's very difficult to do an experiment in another universe.",

        "We may not actually have access to an experiment like that.",

        "Right.",
        "It's not - it may be nice philosophically to think about it, but if you can't come up with a way to test it, it's not a valid scientific..."

        "There are lots of planets around lots of stars at lots of separations.",
        "And so we are here because there is a good separation between the sun and the Earth, and so we have water here.",
        "That is an anthropic argument in the same sense of the multiverse except in that case you can actually say yes, you're right, we have seen lots of planets, we have seen lots of stars.",

        "We have all the prerequisites for a good understanding of why this is anthropically set.",
        "I don't feel like we're at the same point yet with this multiverse story, that we know that each universe gets a different set of physical constants and how those are distributed.",
        "So I think we have at least some more prerequisites to accomplish.",
        "The fact that we're discovering all these exoplanets now, and more, hundreds of them, that we never thought existed, doesn't that lend more credence that we don't need a multiverse to explain why we're here?",
        "There are a lot more of out there.",
        "Right, but the problem is, well, we think that within our universe, the whole universe is stuck with this same dark energy problem.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",

        "They look so different in the universe, as I said before.",
        "Dark matter is clumpy and seems to be made of small particles, and dark energy seems to be smooth and located everywhere, and so therefore they just don't seem like they're part of the same phenomenon.",
