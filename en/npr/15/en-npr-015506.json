        "My question is about dark matter, if we thought we had any testable theories or envisioned any experiments where we may be able to sort of figure out what the nature of this dark matter is.",
        "Right.",
        "We're getting very close, actually.",
        "There are direct detection experiments, where they actually try to build detectors.",

        "It's flitting through all of us.",
        "But you could produce detectors, made out of very dense materials, and locate them in mines below the surface of the Earth, where the surface of the Earth acts to filter out the ordinary background particles.",
        "And a number of experiments have started to find just a few of these dark matter particles, so few that we're still not sure; it's going to be another year or two whether we know they were just unlucky, that they had some errors, or whether they're actually there.",
        "But if it's not this year, it'll be in a couple years.",
        "How do you know it's not a neutrino flying through?",
        "Well, that's what they're very good at, is trying to figure out - they know the mass scale of neutrinos.",
        "That's very different.",
        "And so it creates different products.",
        "Also the Large Hadron Collider, which is working in CERN, is expected to produce dark matter particles as part of the collisions.",
        "And so I think we're probably within hopefully just a few years of actually directly measuring and seeing dark matter.",

        "It is the one way, maybe the only way, we could actually discover that this multiverse story is true, is if there are collisions between what they call the branes - and this is B-R-A-N-E, like a membrane, but the surfaces of the different universes.",
        "And if they collide, it would look like a giant explosion.",
