        "Sometimes I bill myself as the leading academic expert on ambient video.",

        "And the reason I can do that is I suspect I'm the only one.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Bizzocchi first started thinking about ambient video over 10 years ago when flat screen TVs were entering the market.",
        "There's a well-understood phenomenon that a lot of people have consistently left their televisions on.",
        "And I thought, well, I suspect artists are going to start making video material, much like living photographs, that people can hang on these flat panel displays and look at when they're not watching television and they're not watching home theater.",
        "Bizzocchi says he realized the fireplace version of ambient video was becoming more popular last year when he checked in on cable listings for yule logs.",
        "On Christmas Eve, there were 20 different options.",
        "Just four years ago, there were only four.",
        "But if you're cynical about people replacing the real thing with a televised version, Bizzocchi has a message for you.",
        "Bah humbug.",
        "The logic of ambient video is this: I go about my life and if there's a lull, if for a few minutes I don't know what exactly I want to do, I look at something beautiful.",
        "And then, you know, then I go back to my life.",
        "Um-hum.",
        "Reason for a crow's noise.",
        "And there were people out with the usual signs, disarm this warhead, Bush number one world terrorist, that sort of thing.",
        "But way fewer than we've seen in the past, both in Great Britain and on the continent, where the dominant mood seemed to be that, while he was not any more popular as an American president than he'd been in the past, that President Bush was no longer seen as nearly as provocative.",
        "People have, in a sense, moved on."

        "So are they looking ahead past November?",

        "They are tremendously fascinated with Barack Obama because, as an African-American, he is a contradiction of every plotline they've ever had about American culture and society.",
        "So they are fascinated with him.",
        "They don't, obviously, have as much information or as much fascination right now with John McCain.",
        "He is seen as being, to some degree, a continuation of the Bush administration's foreign policy.",
        "But there are also a number of Europeans who are aware of the points on which McCain has disagreed with the administration, especially with regards to interrogation of suspects - terrorism suspects.",
        "So are they fascinated with Obama because he's, you know, an interesting and newcomer - exotic to them?",
        "Or do they like his policies more than they like McCain's?",
        "I'm not sure they know that much about his policies, and I'm not sure that there's a great substantive flow of information about what those policies are going to be across the Atlantic or even within this country, for that matter.",
        "It's still a work in progress.",
        "But I think the average European, the average person around the world believes that Barack Obama, by nature of his background, by nature of where he grew up, by nature of his race, and also because of his identification with the Democratic party in some of the positions that the party has held in previous presidential cycles, would be more of an internationalist and would not be quite so likely to rely entirely on American military power.",
        "And turning back to President Bush, what kind of messages was he trying to send to Americans here at home as he traveled through Europe?",
        "He's looking to push a view of his administration as the long sweep of history, talking about 60 years ago, where did Europe stand, look where they are today, and suggesting that 60 years from now, people will look back on his administration and be grateful to him for suppressing terrorism and securing greater access to Middle Eastern oil.",
        "That's not necessarily how the Europeans will see it, or how Americans will see it, but that was the message.",
        "All right.",
        "NPR's senior Washington editor, Ron Elving, thank you as always.",

        "That was a war in which the levels of violence were 100 times higher than the wars today.",
