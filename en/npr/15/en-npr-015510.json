        "NPR's Linda Gradstein reports that her visit comes at a tumultuous time in Israeli domestic politics.",
        "Secretary Rice told a think tank here that there are new opportunities for peace and urged both sides to do more to help that happen.",
        "She said Israel must do more to improve daily life for the Palestinians.",
        "Greater freedom of movement is a key for Palestinians, from shopkeepers to farmers to restaurant owners and for all seeking early--easier access to their economic livelihoods.",
        "In fact, Israel today announced it will allow 10,000 Palestinian workers into Israel.",
        "But Palestinians say Israeli army checkpoints throughout the West Bank still impede their movement.",
        "In her speech, Secretary Rice hardened her tone as she talked about what Palestinians must do.",
        "And let us be very clear about one other matter.",
        "Dismantling the infrastructure of terrorism is essential for peace, because in the final analysis, no democratic government can tolerate armed parties with one foot in the realm of politics and one foot in the camp of terrorism.",
        "(Soundbite of applause)",
        "Ridding the world of polio was never going to be easy.",
        "But in Pakistan, one of three countries where the virus is still endemic, it's turning out to be even harder than many feared.",
        "The number of new cases there is rising.",
        "Anyone who takes part in the drive to vaccinate children in Pakistan risks their life.",
        "A terrible reminder of that came this past week with a deadly attack on a polio vaccination team.",
        "A caws cause.",
        "And you go even further into the past and make a broader assumption, that indeed this is the, probably, the most peaceful period in human history.",
        "Yes, the decline of war that scholars such as Joshua Goldstein have documented is one of a number of historical declines of violence.",
        "Others include the plummeting of rates of interpersonal violence, one-on-one homicides, which have fallen by about a factor of 35 since the Middle Ages in every European country for which statistics are available."

        "And yet another one is the even more recent targeting of violence on smaller scales directed against vulnerable sectors of the population like racial minorities.",
        "So we've seen an elimination of the practice of lynching in the United States, which used to take place at a rate of about 150 a year and fell to zero by 1950.",
        "Rates of rape have fallen, rates of domestic abuse.",
        "Popularity of spanking and other forms of corporal punishment have gone down.",
        "Even more recently, practices that wouldn't even have been categorized as violence in previous decades, like bullying, have now been targeted for elimination.",
        "A few years ago, bullying was just childhood, boys will be boys.",
        "Now we've brought it in under the umbrella of violence and sought to minimize it for the first time in history.",
        "Yet we always hear: the 20th century, the most violent, the bloodiest century in human history.",
        "Well, people who make that claim never cite numbers from any century other than the 20th, and as Joshua Goldstein has pointed out, the 17th century with its wars of religion, the 14th century with its Mongol invasions, many other centuries have atrocities that can hold their head high when compared against the 20th century.",
        "The annihilation of native peoples of the Americas and Australia and Africa, the Islamic and Atlantic slave trades racked up horrific death tolls.",
        "We're talking with Steven Pinker and Joshua Goldstein.",

        "I hear about the industrialized nations, the high-tech nations like Europe, all over Europe, the United States, but I don't hear anything about Africa.",
        "And I know there's been a lot of bloodshed there.",
        "Do you want to comment about that, please?",

        "Places that - you see, war is more newsworthy.",
        "It's - we think about it.",
        "It gets our attention.",
        "But in places like Sierra Leone, Liberia, and you mentioned Rwanda, where there was a terrible genocide 15 years ago, we forget about them once they are at peace, whereas the ones that are still at war, that we're afraid will go back to war, we remember those.",

        "Bruce?",
        "I guess he's left us.",
        "Which raises the question: If these are all advances, why are we doing better?",
        "And Steven Pinker, you advance several causes, one of them, and this goes back through history, is the evolution of the state.",
        "Yes, probably Hobbes got it right when he said that a leviathan, a third party with a monopoly on the use of - legitimate use of force in a territory, might be among the biggest violence reduction techniques ever invented.",
        "When you outsources your revenge to a third party, you're less likely to keep acting on the belief that you're always on the side of the angels and the other guy is always treacherous and evil, and your violence is always justified retaliation, the other guy's violence is always naked, unprovoked aggression.",
        "When you have both sides thinking that, you can get endless cycles of revenge and vendetta and blood feud.",
        "When you've got the state and the judicial system meting out the punishments, you can cap the damage after one round.",
        "Now, in the international arena, of course, we don't have a global leviathan, a world government, but Joshua Goldstein points out how the international peacekeepers, which are a kind of soft, rough equivalent, the closest that the world has to an international police force, have, contrary to impressions, been effective.",
        "Effective, Joshua Goldstein?",
        "Yes, way more effective than people credit.",
        "I think there are three big reasons for the decline of war in the international system, one of which is this shift of norms that Steven Pinker has referred to.",
        "Things like dueling or human sacrifice just aren't cool anymore.",
        "The second is the rise of prosperity and interdependence so that you don't get rich by conquering territory anymore, you get rich by trade, and war doesn't work for that.",
        "But the third, which I focus on primarily, is the rise of the United Nations and peacekeeping, which has given the international community a way to manage and reduce conflicts, not to bring about world peace in one big gulp but to go into war zones where formerly ceasefires would break down more than half of the time."

        "But over the last decades, the U.N.",
        "has gotten better at peacekeeping, has gotten more effective at peacekeeping, and it's really cheap.",
        "Yes, well, a basic principle of evolutionary biology is that organisms cooperate when they can deliver mutual benefits, reciprocal altruism.",
        "And so mechanisms that make it easier and more profitable to trade make other people more valuable alive than dead.",
        "So the average American household pays $700 every month for our military and veterans' benefits, but $2 a month for peacekeeping, so $2 versus $700, and it gets us things that our military can't get us, not to say it can do everything the military does, but $2.",
        "So we could be beefing this up a little bit, and it's quite cost-effective.",
        "The old rule of thumb used to be peacekeepers were good at keeping the peace when both sides wanted the peace kept.",
        "What are they doing better now to make more of those situations, as you say, keep the peace more often than not?",
        "Well, they've adapted in several ways, and one is that they're more robust now.",
        "So they go in with military force that if there's a spoiler trying to bring down a whole peace agreement and throw a society back into war, maybe so that some militia can get diamonds or (unintelligible) or something, the peacekeepers are willing to use force to protect civilians and to make sure that the agreement sticks.",
        "I mean, they're in Democratic Congo with attack helicopters now, which is not our idea of traditional peacekeepers being neutral and never getting involved in conflict.",
        "Perhaps the recent situation in the Ivory Coast, Cote d'Ivoire, might be an example where they intervened and, well, brought about change and made a very bad situation much better.",
        "That was an excellent example because the elections there had been - they had driven out the incumbent president, but he was holding on to power.",
        "He was beginning to slaughter civilians, and that could have gone right back to another decade of civil war.",
        "And that was a terrible war there.",

        "with French backing came in and put the rightful owner into power, so to speak, in a pretty robust way, and stabilized the society.",

        "And one of the questions that I have is whether perhaps the nature of violence in the 20th century and 21st century might be considered qualitatively different for two reasons.",
        "One is the use of mass media.",
        "In other words, we may be more aware of more violence, but perhaps, you know, as both authors are saying, this is actually a time when we have less violence compared to other centuries.",
        "On the other hand, I wanted to ask the question about the use of high technology, especially when we look at something like the Holocaust, that the Nazis were very effective in killing six million Jews in the space of a very short amount of time precisely because of the nature of technology.",
        "Could they address the issues of maybe the quantitative and qualitative nature of violence in the 20th century and how you would compare that to previous centuries?",
        "Steven Pinker, why don't you start on quality of violence.",
        "I think the technology has not been a major factor.",
        "We've seen in Rwanda that you can rack up hundreds of thousands of deaths in a genocide using nothing more high-tech than a machete.",
        "And even during the Holocaust, the majority of Jews did not die in the gas chambers but at the hands of the Einsatzgruppen, just men in trucks with guns who lined people up and then shot them in the back of the neck.",
        "Certainly we have horrific images of nuclear explosions at the end of the Second World War, but there too the number of deaths were a tiny fraction of those that died in the Second World War.",
        "And on the whole, I think the motive to kill people is a more powerful determinant of how many people get killed than the means at their disposal."
