        "Well, that's right.",
        "I agree with Linda that the media has changed our perception of war.",
        "And as we're getting more and more coverage of the world, little clashes, skirmishes in the remote parts of the world from us now appear on our televisions, if not our cell phones, and so we're more aware of them, and it seems like the world's getting more and more violent.",
        "Well, these things and much worse used to happen, and we were just completely unaware of them.",
        "So that's a big change that's contrary to the underlying trends but makes it seem as though things are getting worse and worse.",

        "Joshua Goldstein, is that a factor?",
        "Well, I think it is a factor to some extent, and there are multiple causes here.",
        "The reason it didn't make my top three list is that the recent peace is also extending to countries that are not democracies, and notably China.",
        "China has not had a military battle in 25 years, and that's a remarkable record for a country after centuries of war, civil war and revolution.",
        "And China is not a democracy.",
        "So I can't see that democracy is the full story here.",
        "There's something deeper at work here.",
        "Now, China is a country that's depending on trade for wealth and where the leaders take their legitimacy from delivering prosperity, and that prosperity is based on trading with the other countries of the world.",
        "So war is not a viable path for them to stay in power or to build up their country.",

        "Yeah, gentlemen, you made some great points, but I'd like to point out that according to the Lancet, the British medical journal, over a million Iraqi children were killed due to U.S.-backed sanctions back in the '90s.",
        "And that's not even counting the current, you know, shock-and-awe type of war that's gone on since, you know, 2003.",

        "So the statistics could change dramatically in just a matter of minutes, you know, literally, you know, 20, 30 minutes.",
        "So anyway, I think Americans, you know, they just yawned when we heard the statistics about the children dying in Iraq and earlier in the '80s about the, you know, hundreds of thousands killed by, you know, death squads, you know, backed by the CIA and so on.",
        "And we go to Vietnam and Korea.",
        "You know, we bombed every city in Korea to the ground, even towns and villages completely obliterated.",

        "He's just continued, you know, Bush's policies, you know, supporting the military industrial congressional complex, which pretty much has, you know, bought our government the same way the Wall Street bankers have.",
        "Tom, you've raised a couple of points there.",
        "One, Joshua Goldstein, your statistics are based on the deaths directly attributable to war.",
        "Would they have included, as Tom mentioned, the numbers of Iraqis who died as the indirect result of economic international sanctions on Iraq back in the 1990s up to 2003?"

        "No, that's not included.",
        "What I'm looking at is deaths of civilians and military directly from war or violence.",
        "And that's easier to measure than the idea of indirect deaths that, you know, because of the Gulf War, then we had sanctions, and then these children went hungry, and you can try to figure out how many people died.",
        "Look, a lot of people have died as an indirect result of war.",
        "There's no doubt about it.",

        "If there's a big war, and a lot of people are dying from bullets and bombs, those populations are also being displaced and malnourished and cholera epidemics begin and so forth.",
        "So these two measures, the direct and indirect, it's not that people killed indirectly are less important, but they tend to move together, and the direct deaths is a better way to measure change through time.",

        "It's like if you had cancer, and that would be terrible, but if you went to your doctor and found that the treatments were shrinking the tumors, you'd say we're on the right track, let's stay on this track.",

        "He's right, the United States is involved in more wars than ever.",
        "Yes, but it's completely misleading to say that nothing has changed since Korea.",
        "If you simply say wars exist now, wars existed then, well, that's true.",
        "But if you look at how many people get killed in the war, there's just no comparison.",
        "You plot the numbers on a graph, and they absolutely plummet.",
        "Just, if you take just American civilians - soldiers alone, we're comparing, say, 58,000 in Vietnam to something more like 5,500 in Iraq and Afghanistan combined.",

        "The same story is true if you look at the number of, say, Koreans killed and Vietnamese killed compared to the number of Iraqis and Afghanis killed.",

        "And I think the prevalence of media have given rise to virtual tribes, such as, perhaps, the entire global community, ideally, and make it harder to demonize people who may not happen to look like us or speak our language.",
        "And there is a precedent for this because the first wave of media was the rise of print and books in the 18th century, which led to some of the first humanitarian reforms like the abolition of slavery.",
        "People read fiction, like \"\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"\" or memoirs like \"\"Frederick Douglass\"\" could see what it's like to be, say, an African-American slave, and they no longer feel like a different tribe.",
        "They feel like members of your own tribe.",
