        "The pink ribbon and the pink products and everything that has come up around the cause of breast cancer, the harms are partly that the awareness itself has been redefined as visibility: visibility for the sake of visibility, visibility for the sake of fundraising, and so a deep awareness of the realities of breast cancer and where we really are in that war on breast cancer has gotten lost in that.",
        "In addition, the industry that's been created around breast cancer, which is upwards of $6 billion a year being raised in the name of the cause, that's also created a situation where any money for the sake of money, any product for the sake of any product has become the norm.",
