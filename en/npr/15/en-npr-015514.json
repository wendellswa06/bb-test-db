        "Since the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza was completed two months ago, there's been little further progress.",
        "Special US Mideast envoy James Wolfensohn met today with Israel's defense minister and a senior Palestinian security official.",
        "They had hoped to finalize an agreement over the crossings for goods and people in and out of Gaza.",
        "Israeli analysts said Secretary Rice had hoped to announcement an agreement on that issue while she was here, but Israeli officials said they were unable to complete a deal.",
        "Tomorrow, Secretary Rice meets the Israeli and Palestinian leaders separately.",
        "At the same event where Rice spoke, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon sounded an optimistic note.",
        "(Through Translator) After the death of Yasser Arafat and the election of Mahmoud Abbas as Palestinian leader and the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the Palestinian Authority has undergone a positive change.",
        "After a long period, there is an opportunity to advance the peace process and the road map.",
        "But Sharon went on to say the Palestinian Authority has done nothing to wipe out what he called the `terrorist infrastructure.'",
        "Sharon did not mention his own political future.",
        "Israeli politics was thrown into turmoil last week when the center-left Labor Party elected a new chairman, fiery trade union leader Amir Peretz.",
        "Peretz says his first priority is to pull Labor out of the current government, which would mean Sharon loses his parliamentary majority and Israel will hold early elections.",
        "Linda Gradstein, NPR News, Jerusalem.",
        "Authorities in both Great Britain and Egypt have been pursuing leads in separate terrorism investigations over the weekend.",
        "Police in England announced today they've arrested a third man in connection with the July 21st attempted bombings in London.",
        "They're also looking into links between London's bombers and terror cells in Somalia and Ethiopia.",
        "Professor Marc Sageman with the University of Pennsylvania has been studying al-Qaeda since its inception in 1988.",
        "He says connections between al-Qaeda and terrorist cells in countries around the world are indirect.",
        "I spoke with him earlier today.",
        "This whole terrorist threat has evolved because of our success in destroying the training camps and the communication between al-Qaeda central and their followers.",
        "But the social movement--a violent Islamist, born-again social movement--has increased.",
        "And so what we have now is randomly distributed attacks all over the world for free-lancers who want to make a name for themselves.",
        "And the old al-Qaeda is now in a position to retrospectively accept the gift of these free-lancers.",
        "These free-lancers, of course, do this operation in the name of al-Qaeda, and al-Qaeda then can pick and choose which one they accept.",
        "For instance, they will not accept any operation that kills children, so they rejected Beslan.",
        "And I think they rejected last week's killing of about 25 Iraqi children.",
        "What support, if any, do you think that the smaller free-lancers, if you will, get from the established networks?",
        "Well, I think that they want to be part of this whole movement, this jihad.",
        "And they get that from al-Qaeda central because they access the Web sites anonymously.",
        "And, of course, the leadership can post goals, documents, directions on this these Web sites.",
        "So the command and control is indirect through the Internet, and what they want to do is they just want to create a better world.",
        "It's very much like young people 30 years ago became Communists for similar ideals.",
        "They wanted to build a better world.",
        "They wanted to build a utopia.",
        "And they thought that joining the Communist Party would be that method.",

        "And then you have a group of drug dealers who became religious and joined them, and they, of course, were the one who had the contacts to get the dynamite to do the horrors of March 11th in Madrid.",
        "What would you say are the implications of this looser network on the entire movement of suicide bombing and terror?",
        "Well, that forces us to really fight it in two ways: One is that we actually do have to eliminate the people who are currently terrorists because we're not going to change their mind; the much harder task is to prevent the next generation from becoming terrorists.",
        "And this is very much becoming a geological warfare.",

        "Father James Kinchen says his kids inherited their parents' independence.",
        "When Jeremiah and Colby got old enough that they were out going and doing things on their own, they didn't think it was cool to hang out with Mom and Dad, so they would go camping down at the gravel pits.",
        "Like salmon fishing--they would go salmon fishing and just stay all night at a river, come home in the mornings; after we'd done got up and was having breakfast, you know, here they'd come home for breakfast."

        "Well, two men on a motorbike pulled up in front of a van.",
        "Inside the van, there was a team of polio vaccination workers.",
        "The men opened fire.",
        "They killed four of these health workers, of whom three were women.",
        "This happened when the polio vaccination team was on the final day of a drive in the city of Quetta in the Southwest in Pakistan.",
        "Polio vaccination teams do regularly get attacked like this.",
        "In the last couple of years, more than 60 health workers or their security guards have been killed.",
        "But this was the deadliest attacked of this kind for quite a while.",
        "So why is this happening?",
        "A couple of years back, the Taliban declared a ban on polio vaccination teams operating in areas where they're active.",
        "They did so after discovering that the CIA had used a fake hepatitis vaccination program to gather intelligence about Osama bin Laden.",
        "That reinforced the militants' view that these polio vaccination workers are, you know, Western agents or spies of some sort.",
        "And it also reinforced superstitions in remote parts of Pakistan that the polio vaccination drives are some sort of plot - Western plot to sterilize Muslims.",
        "So presumably, because there are these drives happening, polio is a serious problem.",
        "How significant is the rise in new cases, and what's to account for it?",
        "Well, Pakistan is the only place where polio really is significantly expanding.",
        "One reason for it is the exodus of about a million people from the mountainous tribal belt bordering Afghanistan.",
        "That happened in the summer when the Pakistani military rolled in there on a big offensive to crush the Taliban and their allies, who, for years, have been using the area as a sanctuary.",
        "The upside of it was that it meant that health workers could get access to lots of children as they came down from the mountains and administer vaccines to them.",
        "The down side was that they didn't get everybody, and lots of people have fanned out across the country taking the poliovirus with them.",
        "So if these health care workers are being targeted, some losing their lives, where's the Pakistani government in all of this?",
        "Well, it's recently announced a big, new initiative to stamp out polio.",
        "They're talking about putting in more funds.",
        "They've set up a task force.",
        "They're going to use the military to provide security for polio health workers.",
        "But, you know, they have said this kind of thing before.",
        "And the only test of this new initiative will be the results.",
        "And the recent tragedy in Pakistan involving the killing of these polio workers is a reminder of exactly how difficult, dangerous complicated the task is."
