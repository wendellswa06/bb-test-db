        "This month, West is the featured interview in Playboy magazine, where he talks about the presidency of Barack Obama, the lack of love and respect between people, especially where race is concerned, and also the sad state of academia.",
        "Cornel West joins us shortly, but we also want to hear from you today.",
        "If you'd like to talk to Cornel West about race in America and the presidency of Barack Obama, give us a call, our number is 800-989-8255.",
        "The email address is talk@npr.org.",
        "And you can join the conversation at our website.",
        "Go to npr.org, and click on TALK OF THE NATION.",

        "Cornel West, welcome back to TALK OF THE NATION.",

        "You're doing a wonderful job.",
        "Why, thank you.",

        "You talk a lot about the lack of love.",
        "You say there is a lack of available love in black America.",
        "What do you mean by that?",
        "Well, I think it's true in the society as a whole.",
        "We have a market-driven society so obsessed with buying and selling and obsessed with power and pleasure and property, it doesn't leave a whole lot of time for non-market values and non-market activity so that love and trust and justice, concern for the poor, that's being pushed to the margins, and you can see it.",
        "You can see it in terms of the obsession on Wall Street with not just profits but greed, more profit, more profit.",
        "You see it in our television culture that's obsessed with superficial spectacle.",
        "You see it even in our educational systems, where the market model becomes central.",
        "It's a matter of just gaining a skill or gaining access to a job to live in some vanilla suburb, as opposed to becoming a critical citizen concerned with public interest and common good.",
        "It's a spiritual malnutrition tied to a moral constipation, where people have a sense of what's right and what's good.",
        "It's just stuck, and they can't get it out because there's too much greed.",
        "There's too much obsession with reputation and addiction to narrow conceptions of success.",
        "And when I talk about love, I'm talking about something that's great, though, brother.",
        "I'm talking about something that will sustain you.",
        "It's like an Aretha Franklin song, brother, or a Coltrane solo or Beethoven symphony, something that grabs you to the gut and gives you a sense of what it is to be human.",
        "That's what we're more and more lacking, and it's very sad.",
        "It's a sign of a decline of an empire, my brother."

        "Indeed.",
        "Let me ask it in this way, then: Are you suggesting by your comments that black people, black folk in this country, are relating to these issues of the economy and poverty in a completely different way than everyone else?",

        "Of course, he was a Christian soldier for justice from the 25th chapter of Matthew.",
        "And so more and more black folk tend to be well-adjusted to Obama's presidency, but does that mean they're well-adjusted to injustice?",
        "Because we don't hear our president talking about the new Jim Crow, the prison-industrial complex.",
        "We don't hear our president talking about the need for high-quality jobs for everybody, giving it priority, not just giving a speech in Detroit.",
        "That's fine, but speaking to Tim Geithner, speaking to Larry Summers.",
        "When are you going to make jobs, jobs, jobs a priority rather than Wall Street, Wall Street, Wall Street a priority?",

        "Do you think at times, ever, Cornel West, that your position in academia has in any way isolated you from what I will call just the regular, day-to-day folks and the problems that regular, day-to-day folks go through?",
        "Well, I'll tell you, I had not talked to my dear brother since the Martin Luther King gathering in South Carolina, and very briefly Super Tuesday.",
        "But he did come and make a beeline to me after his speech on I think it was Thursday morning in Washington, D.C.",

        "And I hope maybe at some time we can.",
        "But it was very, it was a very ugly kind of moment, it seems to me, and that disturbs me because then it raises the question for me: Does he have a double standard for black critics as opposed to white critics?",
        "Frank Rich, Paul Krugman, Maureen Dowd, a whole host of brilliant, courageous critics say all kinds of things, and he treats them with respect.",

        "I'm sure they don't demonize him, and too much of that is going on.",

        "When it comes to our precious poor children of all colors, maybe disproportionally in percentage black and white and red, but all colors, yellow as well as white, we need to push toward integrated schools.",
