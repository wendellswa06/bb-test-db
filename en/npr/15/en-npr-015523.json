        "I mean, white people, you've got to know it (censored) you up, but what it does to black people is it (censored).",

        "Early in his career, he made appearances on the Ed Sullivan and Merv Griffin shows, but he quickly tired of having to sanitize his routine for white audiences.",
        "He was fired from one Las Vegas hotel for using obscenities during a show and walked off stage during another Vegas engagement when he refused to compromise his act.",
        "Pryor succeeded on his terms.",
        "His brand of humor was in the tradition of blue comics like Moms Mabley and Redd Foxx, but Pryor's comedy had a new twist.",
        "His routines were forged in the civil rights struggle, the black power movement and postwar urban America.",

        "You mentioned Ireland.",
        "Tell us how Ireland figures into this tax evasion strategy.",
        "So Apple worked on a deal a couple of decades ago with Ireland where Ireland promised to tax them at very low rates if they routed a lot of their transactions through companies setup in Ireland.",
        "What does that mean, routed transactions though?",
        "Well, take that iTune sale that I just mentioned, right?",
        "At some point there's a dollar that's generated or a euro or a pound.",
        "And Apple has to decide who they're going to assign that dollar to, where the company is - that they assign that dollar to on their books is going to be located.",
        "Now the dollar goes from, say, Portugal, right to New York.",
        "But Apple can say, look, we want to assign it to a company that's based in Ireland.",
        "And so technically, that dollar is assigned to Ireland.",
        "And Ireland said, we're going to give you a special tax deal.",
        "No more than 2 percent tax is on that.",
        "But it gets even slipperier from there because the U.S.",
        "has a rule that says a company is going to be taxed on where an activity occurs.",
        "So for instance, if you're going to make something in Ireland, we're going to let Ireland tax you on it.",
        "Ireland says, we're going to tax you based on where control occurs.",
        "So even if you make it in Ireland, if the guys making the decisions live in California, we're going to let the U.S.",
        "tax you on it.",
        "This is a loophole that Apple was able to take advantage of because they said to Ireland, look, control is in California, and they said to the United States, look, we're making it in Ireland.",
        "So as a result, no one should tax us.",
        "And tens of billions of dollars not only weren't taxed by anyone in the world, but Apple didn't even have to file tax returns on those revenues.",
        "They essentially kind of slipped through these loopholes in the tax code.",
        "Purposely so, presumably.",
        "Purposely - yeah.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Apple knows exactly what it's doing.",
        "And it should be said that although Apple, according to Congress, is more aggressive and more creative in doing this, they've done things that, as far as we know, no other company has done.",
        "Every company does some variation of this.",
        "Every company, particularly tech companies, try to lower their tax bill by finding loopholes that they can take advantage of because who wants to pay more taxes, right?",
        "Well, haven't, in recent months, European Union or European nations actually been trying to find ways to close loopholes because they've been upset, what, Google or Amazon, some other companies have been evading taxes in those countries, I guess?"

        "It has not created more American growth or productivity.",
