        "...but the point is abstract for another reason, which I will answer after saying quickly with Michael Steele, the question that he needs to be asked the next time you have him on is that the death penalty in Maryland--there was a big study done showing it was discriminatory, and he said that he was going to be the point man on making sure that the administration in Maryland took that up.",

        "And - but what's interesting, though, is that the challengers of the citizenship question, they made this allegation that this was indeed the true intention of the Trump administration.",
        "That's why they pushed for this question, to give Republicans and non-Hispanic white people a political advantage when redistricting comes along.",

        "This is, again, something that will be tested in the courts if it is done, if any state or locality tries to do this.",
        "Let me figure out what the argument would be, then, why it would not be constitutional.",
        "The census has something in - the Constitution has something about the census counting everyone, right?",
        "And it is presumed that that is the way that the districts would be drawn is from the census, not through some other count of some subset of people.",
        "Is that it?",
        "Well, the Constitution requires a count of every person living in the country.",
        "And there is another federal law that requires one person, one vote as a standard.",
        "And it is unclear right now exactly how the courts will rule if you were to consider that just voter-eligible citizens.",
        "OK.",

        "Appreciate the reminder you don't need to be below sea level in New Orleans to potentially be affected by a couple feet of rain.",
        "Right.",

        "R.",
