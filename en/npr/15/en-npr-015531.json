        "And in 2004, of course, we characterized the Iraq War as being a question of national security and patriotism and loyalty.",
        "And these strategies have worked for Karl Rove, as the primary political strategist for the President.",
        "They make the Democrats look like there's something they care about more than national security.",
        "Okay, but what about the Republican critics, because there are quite a few of those?",
        "That's a wrinkle they may not have entirely anticipated.",
        "Suddenly they start hearing from people like Peter Hoekstra, Saxby Chambliss, the Senator from Georgia on the Senate Intelligence Committee, saying that they're bothered about having a four-star general take over the CIA.",

        "And even if that's ultimately not the issue that this nomination turns on, it does raise question marks about whether or not these Republicans are still lock-step willing to do whatever the White House wants them to do.",

        "And he just had forgotten some conversations that he had had with some reporters.",

        "But as it stands now, Karl Rove has not been indicted and the cloud has not been dismissed over his head.",
