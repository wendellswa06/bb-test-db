        "They heated it up, they zapped it with electricity every once in a while to simulate lightning strikes.",
        "And this is really an attempt to simulate the conditions that might have been present on the very early Earth and absorbed chemical evolution that happened there and this glop(ph) - they have them in a beaker, they called it the primordial soup, and trying to recreate the primordial soup that existed when life might have begun.",
        "But in a presentation given this week at the meeting of the American Society for Cell Biology, researcher Helen Hansma suggest that maybe the soup wasn't enough.",
        "Maybe life needed a soup and a sandwich, maybe something like a flaky crust like mica.",

        "Floyd is very strong, but his team is not as strong in the mountains and they need that help, they need those riders in the group to be able to chase down the attacks that happen, to be able to pace each other so that the leader can stay as fresh as possible at the end of the race.",
        "And if you don't have that, Floyd might have to do a lot of chasing or do some extra effort and maybe not be as fresh as possible at the end of the race and eventually lose the jersey.",

        "For the first couple of decades of the Israeli occupation, from '67 until the end of the '80s, it tended to follow a quietest, non-confrontational policy towards Israel and the occupation.",

        "There was change at the end of the '80s when a lot of Palestinian Islamists began to feel that the quietest and non-confrontational policy of the Brotherhood was inappropriate and it turned towards greater militancy, Hamas was founded in that year, 1987 and since then it has grown to be a formidable rival to Fatah and the more secular PLO.",
        "And its tone changed substantially from non-confrontational to something that --",
        "Absolutely, a few years after Hamas was founded.",
        "It issued a charter in which it argued that all of Palestine was not just an Arab land, but was an Islamic endowment, a (unintelligible) for the all of the Muslims and that it would be inadmissible to give up any part of it under any circumstances.",
        "So it issued, as it were, the most uncompromising position and that marked it out as much more uncompromising than the PLO, which at the very same period, 1988, had accepted the idea of a two-state solution of the Palestinian state side by side with Israel.",
        "It differed as well in tactics because in the same period, the PLO had renounced terrorism and Hamas launched its first suicide attack in 1994.",
        "And since then, it really pioneered the use of attacks on Israeli civilians by people who killed themselves in the process."
