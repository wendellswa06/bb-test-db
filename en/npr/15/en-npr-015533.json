        "That wage is now about $16, $15.50, $16 an hour.",
        "We're going to move that over the next 24 months to $20 an hour.",
        "If you get a job at Bank of America, you'll make $41,000.",
        "The news was applauded by the Committee for Better Banks, which tries to organize bank employees, such as tellers.",
        "The committee says low-level employees like these saw their wages stagnate after the financial crisis.",
        "Bank tellers may dress like white collar workers, but a 2013 survey found that a third of them had to rely on public assistance, such as food stamps, to get by.",
        "But as the unemployment rate has fallen, banks have had more trouble finding workers, says Ben Zipperer of the Economic Policy Institute.",
        "Bank of America, like other companies - they're facing a tighter labor market.",
        "And what that means is that banks in particular are - they're compelled to raise wages to - somewhat to recruit staff.",
        "Zipperer says Bank of America may have been motivated by all the attention being paid right now to income inequality.",
        "Moynihan himself made $23 million in 2017, which was 250 times as much as the bank's median employee.",
        "That kind of income gap is proving to be more and more embarrassing for big companies.",
        "Zipperer says it's probably no coincidence that Bank of America's announcement came one day before tomorrow's big congressional hearing on holding big banks accountable.",
        "Moynihan is expected to appear alongside the heads of six other major banks, and the disparity in wages is almost certain to come up.",

        "In these final weeks before the presidential election, both President Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, are rallying their core voters to turn out on November 6.",
        "But the president may find it harder to win big among younger voters this year, as he did in 2008.",
        "A new study shows that people under 30 seem to be less interested in voting.",
        "And while those under 30 still favor President Obama by a wide margin, according to polls, those in the group who support Mitt Romney say that they are more likely to go to the polls.",
        "NPR's Sonari Glinton went to Ohio, in search of the youth vote.",

        "I'm at the student union at Bowling Green State University, in northwest Ohio.",
        "Four years ago, this student union would have been a hotbed of political activity.",
        "Now, not quite as much.",
        "I'm Mark Simone.",
        "I'm a professor of political science at Bowling Green State University.",
        "I've been here 22 years.",
        "I think that it had become a fad, almost, in '08; that people were really, really - had a sense that this was historic.",
        "I think this election, there's less sense that there's historic issues out there.",
        "And I also think that the Republican side is a little more organized than they were in '08 - at least, on our campus."

        "Yeah.",
        "Well, what is your, what is your solution - what is the solution for?",
        "What was the problem that mica solves?",
        "Mica solves the problem as how life evolved in a secure place where it had a lot of time and space to be well protected from the open ocean.",
        "Before there were cell membranes or even when there were lipid vesicles running around, but those would be fragile little things.",
        "So it gives life a really secure place to evolve and I think it makes some really interesting predictions about energy and entropy for life.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Is there any way to prove your idea?",
        "Yes, lots of experiments can be done and I'm looking forward to getting back to Santa Barbara and doing some of them and I'm looking forward to seeing what other colleagues do and hopefully collaborating with some of them.",
        "Are there any places on Earth where we might find mica and some more of the goopey(ph) things we might need to show that this might be a possibility?",
        "Well, as - mica seems to be quite old, people started worrying about that when I tell them about it and one of the places where the earliest evidence for life cells has been found is in Greenland.",
        "And they also found the common kind of mica called Biotite in the same area that they found what seems to be some of the most primitive cells.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So the mica protects and does it encourage the formation of the primordial soup here?",
        "That's what we need to find out by experiment.",
        "Is it just a nice surface?",
        "It's easier to make large molecules from small molecules if the large ones can stick to a surface.",
        "They don't wash off and get lost for one thing.",
        "And so then, some kinds of minerals make the reaction go faster.",
        "They catalyzed the reaction and so that will be an exciting area of research.",
        "Mica has potassium holding the sheets together and we all know that we need potassium ourselves.",
        "Put a lot of effort into keeping the internal potassium high and so I am particularly excited about that similarity between mica and what's inside our cells."

        "Santa Barbara.",
        "Give us some idea of the steps that would go in the soup?",
        "How would life chemically evolve there?",
        "Well, if the soup was out there with the amino acids and the simple building blocks of life, it would seep between the mica sheets, which are water-loving after the water tends to squeeze in and pull the potassium ions off the sheets.",
        "And molecules - the simple amino acids and the simple molecules could lie down on the mica sheets and fit next to each other, facilitating the connecting of little molecules into big molecules, sort of like beads on a string.",
        "And I'm really excited that the potassium ions are sitting on mica in little negatively charged spaces, one-half nanometer apart…",
        "Wow.",
        "…which is very small, but it's also the same spacing as our DNA molecules, single-stranded DNA.",
        "The different letters of the genetic code are one-half nanometer apart.",
        "And in our proteins, the amino acids when they're spread out in the simplest form in a beta sheet are one-half nanometer apart.",
        "So when you look at all the dimensions of mica and the dimensions of all these different particles that are needed, you say, wow.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "This could be like a jigsaw puzzle there.",
        "Right.",
        "And people have found - well, that could apply also to clay that has no charges on it with nice regular spacing.",
        "And so, the energy in the entropy that I see coming from mica excites me that the molecules are going to be really crowded in between these close-spaced mica sheets and then not going to be able to flop all over like in the soup or on a surface.",
        "So I think the spaces between the sheets in mica and the very large sheets of mica are an important novel things that mica's passed that other minerals don't tend to.",
        "Hmm.",
        "So it's the spaces between the sheets is one way or it's just the sandwich is looking at it the other way?"
