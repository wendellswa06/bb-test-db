        "This was about New Orleaneans coming out and seeing one of their own and seeing a man who - I'm telling you when he walks down the street, everybody notices.",
        "They may not run up to him because we're cool like that, you know, in New Orleans, but everybody knows when Trombone Shorty walks in because he is beloved here and for good reason because I'm telling you, he deserves that stage for the next 30 years."
