        "So, thanks for the endorsement, white-haired dude, and I want America to know that I'm, like, totally ready to lead.",
        "I cannot think of a presidential campaign, in my lifetime, at least, that has ever had this type of over-the-top celebrity involvement.",
        "Can any of you think of a race where you've seen this before?",
        "Well, no, I - this is Amani - I think it speaks just to the pop culture that we live in now, though.",

        "What is everybody talking about?",
        "What is everybody thinking about?",
        "So, you know, of course, Paris Hilton adds little-to-no credibility, I think, to either candidate, either way.",
        "But it's just speaking to the fact of the pop-celebrity culture that Americans embrace right now.",
        "Whether it's positive or negative, I'd say it's probably to their detriment, but that's kind of the way things are right now.",
        "Well, it certainly seems to me, sometimes, when I hear these things - and Carmen, I'd like to get your input on it - that it trivializes the whole process.",
        "We are, after all, talking about election for the president of the United States, and it seems to have become almost like a \"\"Saturday Night Live\"\" skit.",
        "Well, that Paris Hilton ad definitely cracked me up, so I think there are some \"\"SNL\"\" material there.",
        "But you know, I think that the good thing about this election is that it has brought a lot of new voters, and really encouraged people to get politically active.",
        "And so, I think in the past, presidential elections have seemed to be very dry and, you know, overly academic, and so I actually think that there may be a positive in the fact that we're seeing people like Paris Hilton, or Ludacris, jumping into the fray, because it at least shows that they're engaged.",
        "And let's face it.",
        "Not every American is a huge political junkie, who knows all the ins and outs of electoral politics, myself included.",
        "And so, it's good to have, I think, a wide variety of views represented.",
        "You know, that's an interesting point of view.",
        "My question for you, Aaron, is whether or not this is what it takes to reach the 25-and-under voting crowd?",
        "Well, if that's what it takes, then maybe the 25-and-under crowd isn't going to be reached very well.",
        "I find it hard to believe this stuff is compelling, or is going to engage even people who are young.",
        "Young doesn't mean that you're an idiot, and you know, this kind of discourse in the campaign, to me, trivializes the seriousness and gravity of the whole enterprise, and it's nerve-wracking to watch."

        "But there is this charge coming from certain portions of the media, Patrick Buchanan, for one, that the black media's bias is just overly evident.",
        "He cites, as an example, the fact that BET is going to cover the Democratic National Convention, and not even bother with the Republican Convention, because of BET's beliefs that the black audience is interested in one and not interested in the other.",
        "Let me start with you, Amani.",
        "Do you think that there is a bias in black media because of Barack Obama's presence?",
        "And if there is, what do we need to do about it?",
        "Well, I think - I'm a journalist as well, so I can sort of speak for the fact that as a journalist, and in journalism, we all have biases that are not supposed to come through.",
        "You're supposed to be fair and balanced, give equal attention to both candidates, both political parties.",
        "So, the fact that BET wouldn't cover the Republican Convention would appear to be maybe at least unfair coverage if they're only going to cover the Democratic Party.",
        "But that being said, I believe that in general a lot of blacks tend to sway towards the Democratic Party.",
        "So, if their audience - I mean, you have to look at the TV business.",
        "It's in the business of informing viewers, but also reaching out to the audience that's going to watch their coverage.",
        "You know, they kind of have to cater to their audience.",
        "If they don't believe their audience is going to watch the Republican Convention, because the majority of blacks don't favor that party, then, I mean, that's just the nature of the business.",
        "Well, do you think, Aaron, that we - a collective we, black media - do we talk about Barack Obama too much?",
        "What have you got for us this week?",
        "This is a good one, I think.",
        "You say that every week, and youre always right."

        "We went back and forth, wondering whether we should officially endorse a candidate.",
        "We ended up officially endorsing Obama, and for us, we did it because we knew that, because Obama was in this race, this presidential race, the topic of race would be covered by the media to a degree that had never really been done before.",
        "And because our blog focuses on race and pop culture, we felt that it was appropriate to expand our coverage of political issues, but specifically with the angle of exploring how race gets played out.",
        "And so, I think it's a matter of not only knowing who your audience is, but also knowing the exact editorial perspective you come from.",
        "Well, not only do we need to know who our audience is, we need to know who our leaders are, which leads me to our very next topic.",
        "A recent Gallup Poll found that 29 percent of black Americans name Barack Obama - there's that name again - as a person they would choose as their spokesman on race issues.",

        "Well, if you rely on, you know, the mainstream media, it would be Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson.",
        "I think that a lot of folks in the audience, or a lot of black folks, feel like they don't necessarily speak for all of us, and that's because, you know, we all come from different backgrounds, different perspectives.",
        "There are folks who are biracial.",
        "There are folks who are multiracial.",
        "And so it's hard to just - you know, the media likes to grab one spokesperson and let them represent, OK, this is what black people are saying, but I mean, that's in general, you know, regardless of black or white.",
        "I mean, that's how the media does it, but you can't just choose one person for a spokesperson."

        "Well, I think that the survey results were instructive, in that you had this wide variety of people that folks gave answers to about who they wanted to be spokesman.",
        "So, you had, you know, from Sharpton and Jackson, on the one end, over to Colin Powell and Obama on another end.",
        "So, I think that that's instructive that, you know, we're not a monolithic community in that respect.",
        "We do have a diversity of voices, and people can't really identify one person who really embodies all that.",
        "It was interesting to me that Obama seemed to have garnered the majority of the vote, in that - you know, clearly he's no departure from traditional liberal politics, as practiced in the black community for a long time.",
        "He is the marketing of liberal politics taken to a much higher level of effectiveness, and so it's not surprising that people look to him, more so than any of the others, as a spokesperson that they would pick.",
        "Well, you know, Carmen, what I found interesting about the list, which I have in front of me, that out of all the categories, there were only three that had double-digit percentages, Barack Obama was 29 percent of people.",
        "The question was, if you had to name one individual or leader in the U.S.",
        "to speak for you on issues of race, who would that be?",
        "Twenty-nine percent said Obama, 18 percent said others, 16 percent had no opinion at all, and all the others were like one, two, three, and four percent.",
        "That surprise you?",
        "It doesn't surprise me, and I think that the fact that this question is being asked at all is indicative of something.",
        "I mean, the headline of this article is \"\"'Black Spokesman' Title Still Up For Grabs.\"\" I look forward to the day when we see \"\"'White Spokesman' Title Still Up For Grabs\"\".",

        "So, I think the unspoken premise behind articles like these is that there is something fundamentally flawed about black people, and let's try to figure out what that is, that there's some kind of inherent dysfunction, and that they're somehow different from, quote/unquote, \"\"regular people,\"\" which in this country, tends to mean white people.",
