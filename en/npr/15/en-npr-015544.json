        "They're you could put a couple of dozen on a grain of salt, so they are like a little spec of dust.",

        "How do you know that they haven't had sex for this long?",
        "Well, there are several avenues of several kinds of answers to that.",
        "The first is that in nearly 300 years of looking through a microscope at these little animals, they were some of the first animals ever identified, when microscopes were invented - no one has ever seen a male, and there's never been any evidence of meiosis.",
        "In addition to that, these little animals have four chromosomes, but the chromosome that would have been homologous in a sexual organism have drifted apart through time so that they're no longer even homologous.",
        "So mutations have come in and have not been corrected, so the chromosomes can no longer even line up with each other, which would be which they would be able to do if they were sexual.",
        "So in other words, there is molecular evidence suggesting that these animals have not had sex and there's no physical evidence that they have no meiosis, no males.",
        "And so they are the leading candidate for what's called ancient asexuality.",
        "In other words, they've been asexual, as you said in the opening, between 30 and 50 million years.",
        "And they've done okay without male rotifers?",
        "They have not only done okay, but they've done remarkably.",
        "They have speciated.",
        "This is an entire class of organisms, and they've speciated into 400 more than 450 species in that time.",
        "Now, most organisms, when they become asexual, are extinguished so quickly they don't even have time to speciate.",
        "And they don't lead to higher taxonomic groups.",
        "But they little bdelloids have been able to speciate and to proliferate even as ancient asexuals, and all the speciation and proliferation has gone on without any sexuality."
