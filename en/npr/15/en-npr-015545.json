        "So whats the problem with not having sex?",
        "And if theyve done it so well, why do other species seem to go extinct?",
        "Well, apparently, the leading hypothesis is that any organism that stops having sex, in essence, crystallizes its genome.",
        "It becomes - the same genome gets passed generation to generation to generation.",
        "Now, every organism on the earth is afflicted by biotic enemies, especially parasites and pathogens which can evolve very, very rapidly.",
        "And any organism that stops having sex, that crystallizes its genome, very quickly gets overrun by the parasites and pathogens which afflict it.",
        "And they very quickly, through their new genetic combinations, come up with a new key to the lock that the host species had and overwhelm it and wipe it out.",
        "And this is called the - this is the Red Queen hypothesis, right?",
        "Yes.",
        "This is known as the Red Queen hypothesis because it comes from a character in Lewis Carrolls Through the Looking Glass, where the Red Queen and Alice are running.",
        "And the Alice looks around and she notices theyre not going anyplace, despite the fact that theyre running as hard as they can.",
        "And she says to the Red Queen: Whats going on here?",
        "And the Red Queen says, well, now, here, you see, in this place, it takes all of the running you can do just to stay in the same spot.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, this - one of the amazing things about this is just watching this fungus devastate these rotifers - which you end up feeling pretty sorry for by the end of this video, I think.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And the idea being that every organism on the earth has to keep reproducing sexually in order to keep up with its biotic enemies, parasites, pathogens, competitors, predators, everything that afflicts it, which are all sexual, anybody who stops - anybody who gets off the train and stops running with the Red Queen, immediate - or not immediately, but very quickly gets overwhelmed and extinguished.",
        "And yet these little bdelloid rotifers have made it.",
        "They've beat the Red Queen.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes.",

        "So - and thats what your study is about this week, right?",
        "This is what our study is about, is the question of how they do it.",
        "And for years, bdelloids have been called an evolutionary scandal because the question is: What are they doing?",
        "How do they get around this frightful problem?",
        "And one possibility would be maybe they dont have any parasites or pathogens.",
        "Maybe they just, for some reason, dont.",
        "But that is manifestly not true.",
        "We and others have discovered that there are many species of very deadly pathogens, in particular fungi, that eliminate these bdelloids.",
        "And they do it very quickly.",
        "So it isnt that they dont have any.",
        "So then thats - then the questions becomes: Well, how do they avoid this problem?",
        "And our experiment built on some knowledge of some unusual characteristics of these bdelloid rotifers.",
        "And the first is that they can undergo a physiological change which is called anhydrobiosis which is the lack of cellular water.",
        "They can dry up into a tiny, little, round ovule which is called tun(ph).",
        "And this one around the ovule has no water in it whatsoever.",
        "Like a bdelloid jerky?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Like bdelloid jerky.",
        "And not...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Glad you said that and not me, Flora.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And not only are they bdelloid jerky, but they can stay in this in this state of suspended animation with no cellular water for weeks and months and even up to nine or 10 years.",
        "And then when you rehydrate them -poof!",
        "They come back to life again at the same stage they were when they went in.",
        "So they can go into anhydrobiosis at any life stage and sit there in suspended animation, and then pop out again.",
        "And their DNA even - it breaks up into tiny, little pieces, right, when they go into this hydrated process."

        "Yes.",
        "But they have remarkable capacities for repairing DNA, and also remarkable capabilities for protecting themselves from ionizing radiation.",
        "In other words, things that would destroy DNA mostly, they are able to handle as part of this process of drying up and then being able to rehydrate.",
        "Now, what - but if they had this parasite in them when they dry up...",
        "Uh-huh.",

        "And my work is with my doctoral student Christopher Wilson, and Christopher Wilson is the lead author on this paper, and its very important to me give him full credit.",
        "But we divide this experiment where we took infected bdelloids and we then subjected them to drying for various lengths of time - one week, two weeks, three weeks, four weeks and five weeks.",
        "We then rehydrated them to see what the effect on the fungus might be.",
        "If the fungus always stay with them, then your question, Ira, would be then all of them should be wiped out as soon as they came back."

        "Well, we found out that after one week, we rehydrated them, one week of dehydration.",
        "We rehydrated them and, sure enough, the fungus came back and killed every rotifer.",
        "After two weeks, we rehydrated them, and the fungus came back and killed every rotifer.",
        "But after three weeks, there was a dramatic difference.",
        "And 60 percent of the rotifer populations came back without any fungus.",
        "And longer periods of time, 28 days and 38 - 35 days of dehydration almost completely eliminated the fungus down to where only - where 90 to 95 percent of the bdelloid populations came back fungus-free.",
        "So what is happening here is that the fungus cant stand the dehydration as long as the bdelloid can.",
        "And the bdelloid, being able to handle it longer, uncoupled of itself in time from the fungus, which simply cant survive that long a period of time without cellular water.",
        "Now, 35 days, we discovered, as I said, 95 percent of the populations were parasite-free.",
        "And in nature, these bdelloids can go much, much longer, as I was saying, weeks, months and even years in a dehydrated state, and then come back to life.",
        "And so the idea is that they can uncouple themselves from this deadly parasite and then, perhaps, move.",
        "Now, the second part of our experiment had to do with the movement.",
        "When these bdelloids dry up and become these little tuns, they are very aerodynamically capable, and they can be swept up in wind and carried all around the world.",
        "In fact, genetically similar clones have been found as far as - far out as Africa, Australia and Italy, as if they were swept around the globe in a wind and then dropped in rain onto tiny, little ephemeral pools, little droplets on moss, little, tiny pools - it's been raining a lot up here in Ithaca, and little, tiny pools are all over our back hillside.",
        "And in those little pools, the bdelloids could land and then proliferate.",
        "I'd like to say that you could catch bdelloids.",
        "If you're interested in these animals, you or any of the listeners, you can catch them by putting a wet sponge on your roof, and in the morning - or a little dish of water.",
        "In the morning, you'll have them.",
        "And you can take them out and look at them in a microscope.",
        "There they will be.",

        "Yeah.",

        "I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Flora Lichtman and Paul Sherman.",
        "Paul is a professor of animal behavior at Cornell in Ithaca.",
        "And Flora, you created - you took a video, right?",
        "But I think it's worth checking out the footage just to see how this fungus works.",
        "Yes.",
        "This is footage that Chris Wilson took, and it's very dramatic.",
        "What happens is that the fungus almost grows a tree out of the rotifer.",
        "It looks like a little branching tree.",
        "And on the tips of the tree branches are little spores, which then are shed into the water.",
        "And then the next poor rotifer, with its little wheel organ going around, eats - ingests one of these spores, and it lodges in it throat, where it immediately sporulates and then produces this awful mass of a tree-like structure to do it again and again.",
        "Now, the interesting thing for our study is that these fungi are extremely good at dispersing in water.",
        "So they're very good in water.",
        "And if you put the bdelloids in with a fungus in a water solution, the bdelloids will all be dead in about two weeks.",
        "But the fungi - the fungal spores are not very good at dispersing in air.",
        "So our second experiment involved revealing this by taking an infected source dish and putting it in a wind box, and then using little fans to blow at the rate of a light breeze in nature, blow the material around the box.",
        "And what we discover is that about 60 percent of the population - then we had source dishes, where the material could blow into.",
        "About 60 percent of the dishes ended up containing only bdelloids.",
        "The fungal spores didn't go with them in space because the fungal spores are not as aerodynamic and as capable of moving as are the bdelloids themselves.",
        "Wow.",
        "So they have this escape, both in time, they can - they can outlast the fungus in dryness, and then they can blow away to a new fungus-free place, right?",
        "Exactly.",
        "And the fungus can't follow them.",
        "See, this gets back to Ira's original point, which is the key point of the whole thing, is that the fungus can't go with them.",
        "If a bdelloid is infected, it's absolutely dead.",
        "But we're talking about - in any population, there'll be a few that aren't killed by the fungus immediately, or attacked.",
        "And those are the ones that can get out.",
        "And they get out and then dry out and stay dried out, and then they float around and land in a new place where the fungus hasn't gotten yet.",
        "The reason the fungus isn't there is it's a little ephemeral pool of water, and there's nothing for the fungus to eat.",
        "Wow.",
        "Wow.",
