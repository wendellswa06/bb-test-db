        "America has come to depend upon many of these immigrants, legal and illegal, to staff many of its industries, especially in the service sector.",
        "Lynn Goldfarb believes these workers have revived the labor movement in Los Angeles.",
        "Today's LA union members typically are Hispanic janitors, hotel workers and other service industry employees.",
        "Ethnically they're different from the Anglo airline mechanics and factory workers of the 40s, 50s, and 60s who left town when those industries did.",
        "But both of these groups were in search of the same thing: a comfortable life and a decent wage.",
        "Goldfarb's film highlights the late Miguel Contreras and his wife, Maria Elena Durazzo, both who are responsible for unionizing immigrant workers here.",

        "It's proved to be an easy transition for the new Los Angeles.",
        "Not everything else will be.",
        "But Goldfarb hopes that Americans will see her film on LA and become less anxious about change.",
        "There was a fear that they would lose the entire church.",
        "It looked - from the outside, at one point - as if the whole thing, other than the stone walls, might burn.",
        "But that's not actually what happened in the end.",
        "Indeed, especially when the spire came crashing down, caving in, and everybody held their collective breath.",
        "But France's deputy interior minister Laurent Nunez, he, yesterday, was speaking to journalists.",
        "And he laid out what the challenges are - were facing the firefighters, who, he said, were so brave and had battled the blaze.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "(Through interpreter) A handful of firefighters risked their lives to go up the towers and attack the fire from the inside, and this helped save the edifice.",
        "We only realized this morning that we came within about half an hour - or even 15 minutes - of losing it all.",
        "Wow - within half an hour of losing it all, meaning - what does he mean by that?",
        "That if these firefighters had not decided to go into the bell towers, those would not have been saved.",
        "And then, perhaps, the whole of Notre Dame would have come down.",
        "But it didn't happen.",
        "You know, with the roof punctured, the walls charred, the floors, you know, covered in this sea of ash, we're seeing what could have happened.",

        "And it's remarkable to think of people risking their lives not for other lives but for a building that is of such significance to so many - so how to repair what is left of Notre Dame.",
        "And how long it'll take - and that's what's facing not only the French authorities but, I guess, experts all over - and how they're going to do it because, of course, we're talking about a medieval cathedral here, Steve.",
        "You know, 800-plus years - although, the spire was built in the 19th century.",
        "How are they going to get this extraordinary, symbolic place of worship back to its former glory?",
        "Everybody is now focusing on that.",

        "That's right.",
        "Francis Maude - he worked on the restoration of Windsor Castle - Queen of England's - Queen of Britain's castle - following a fire that broke out in the chapel there back in '92.",
        "Have a listen.",
        "Having stabilized it, you can then move in and do - from a safe vantage point - a thorough investigation of the debris, which has fallen from the roof and from elsewhere.",
        "And within that, you may well find there are quite large chunks of material, which can be reincorporated into the rebuilt cathedral.",
        "Steve, an emotional roller coaster, though, here.",

        "That's been the process in place for more than a decade.",
        "But Barr's decision overturns that precedent.",
        "I'm a little confused here because, as I understand it, William Barr is telling immigration judges how to decide a request for bond.",
        "Why - normally, the attorney general would be separate from a judge.",
        "Why is that Barr's decision to make?",
        "Right.",
        "Immigration courts are not like criminal courts.",
        "They're part of the Department of Justice.",
