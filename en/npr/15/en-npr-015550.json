        "He was 25 years old and African-American, and he lived with his mother in the East Dallas suburb of Mesquite.",
        "The only solid information we have about him is that he served in the Army Reserve for six years after high school, until April of last year.",
        "And during that time, he did a nine-month tour of duty in Afghanistan as a private first class, which he returned from two years ago, having earned seven medals and ribbons for his service.",
        "Are there any signs that he had been planning to carry out this attack?",
        "Well, law enforcement sources tell NPR that evidence they haven't yet disclosed leads them to think that Johnson did indeed act alone.",
        "There isn't a lot to go on in terms of his motives.",
        "A neighbor is reported to have said he contacted local police six months ago saying he was upset and claimed children had stolen guns from his house.",
        "On his mother's Facebook page, there are photos of him, as well as unidentified shots of a couple of men in full army camouflage uniforms, handling weapons.",
        "But that's about as much as we have there.",
        "David, we first started to get some details about how Johnson was cornered this morning during an emotional news conference in which Dallas Police Chief David Brown spoke.",
        "What did he say?",
        "Well, this was after a peaceful march last night, and he said that his men had been attacked at the end of that march.",
        "They went looking for the source of the gunfire.",
        "They found a gunman - Johnson - on the second floor of a parking garage, and they cornered him in that parking garage.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "And we tried to negotiate for several hours.",
        "Negotiations broke down.",
        "We had an exchange of gunfire with the suspect.",
        "We saw no other option but to use our bomb robot and place a device on its extension for it to detonate where the suspect was.",
        "Chief Brown said the bomb killed Johnson.",
        "But before that happened, he said a hostage negotiator had done what he called an exceptional job getting him to talk over a period of several hours."

        "All of this has now been retracted?",
        "Well, it hasn't been retracted officially, but there has been some walking back of it.",
        "Some investigators have concluded from what they've seen of the evidence, which, as I said, has not yet been disclosed, that there are no signs of other people being involved with this.",
        "Initially, it seemed that the gunfire was coming from several directions because there was a lot of it.",
        "But apparently, they're concluding that this may have been just a lone gunman.",

        "It's funny because it's one of those issues, Danielle Belton, that's almost, like, hiding in plain sight, right, or hiding in your wallet.",
        "And it was surprisingly emotional for me when I actually thought about it because I think about when I've traveled overseas to countries where people of African descent run things and you see people of African descent on the currency, and what that has felt like to sort of think in my own country to have currency with somebody who looks like me on it, I was surprisingly emotional about it.",
        "And I just wondered, Danielle, how it struck you.",

        "I mean, who we value in our society, who we kind of elevate to these higher statuses, we put them on the money.",
        "And so to put a black woman on the money, a former slave who fought for emancipation and freedom like Harriet Tubman is a very, very powerful thing.",

        "Give us her argument.",
        "...On the 20.",
        "Well, her argument essentially boiled down to how - what money represents in our society and how black women have been historically treated in America.",
        "And she felt that putting the 20 - Tubman on the 20 wasn't progress, but it was hush money, a way to silence how black women have been treated by our society.",
        "Let me just read a paragraph from her piece.",
        "She said that (reading) specifically there's something both distasteful and ironic about putting a black woman's face on the most frequently counterfeited and most commonly traded dollar bill in this country.",
        "Haven't we been conmodified and trafficked enough?",
        "That was provocative.",
        "How do people react to that?",

        "That's only true if we're self-critical.",
        "I mean, the entire predicate for any kind of action from, you know, undoing historical wrongs like how we've treated Native American all the way to the currency in our pockets is you have to believe that you can actually have an impact.",
