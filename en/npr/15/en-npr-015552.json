        "And a conversation you recall today, the - we're not exactly sure of all the details of the story there in Florida, but it appeared that that young man was doing none of those things when he got into trouble - trouble that caused his death.",
        "Right.",
        "And that's what was so troubling to me, listening to the Zimmerman 911 call.",
        "I woke up at 6:30 on a Sunday morning, I was so troubled by it, and had to start writing because listening to that man describe what we only know from news reports - but all the news reports about Trayvon Martin are glowing; that this was a good kid who, all he did was go to the local 7-Eleven to buy a can of ice tea and Skittles, and was just feet from his relatives' home before he was killed.",
        "And to listen to that and to hear the person - to hear Zimmerman say that he looked suspicious, that he looked like he was on drugs, just tugged at my heart in a way that, you know, took me back to that time when I was 16 years old, having that conversation.",
        "I'm now 44.",
        "So this rings very true and close to heart.",
        "Do you have children of your own?",
        "I do not.",
        "Well, let's bring Leonard Pitts into the conversation.",
        "He's the syndicated columnist, and his column appeared in the Miami Herald.",
        "Nice to have you back on the program.",
        "And we're having a little trouble connecting.",
        "Leonard Pitts, are you there?",
        "Well, we're hearing you very vaguely, but we'll try to reconnect.",
        "Jonathan Capehart, you did write that the parents of African-American children, particularly sons, have to be clutching them a little closer to home today.",
        "Yes.",
        "Because, you know, as I wrote - in the blog piece that I wrote, the very first sentence is that one of the burdens of being a black male is carrying the heavy weight of other people's suspicion.",
        "Trayvon Martin was just coming from 7-Eleven, doing nothing but trying to get back home - apparently, to watch the NCAA.",
        "And because allegedly, George Zimmerman thought he was up to no good, thought that he looked suspicious, he's dead.",
        "And to, you know, look at the interviews that Trayvon Martin's mother has given over the last few days, they're dignified, but they also are interviews of a mother in pain.",
        "And the interview I saw this morning, when she asked the producers of \"\"The Today Show\"\" not to play - replay the 911 calls in her earpiece, she said that there was no doubt in her mind that the screaming for help in one of the many 911 calls, she said, that was Trayvon screaming.",
        "That was my baby screaming for help.",
        "How does that not affect anyone who has children, and especially anyone who has black, male children who then they have to send out on a Monday morning to go to school, hoping and praying that they don't meet a fate that Trayvon Martin faced?",
        "Leonard Pitts, you - I think you're with us now?"

        "No.",
        "You know, that's the point that I tried to make in my - in the column that you referenced; was that he looked at this boy, and he did not see a boy.",
        "He saw, you know, he didn't see a boy, you know, coming home from 7-Eleven.",
        "He saw a threat.",
        "He saw, I think, the sum of all his fears.",
        "The things that he saw were more reflective of, you know, what was in his head and what was in his soul, rather than were reflective of what I think Trayvon Martin was probably doing, you know, on that street, you know, walking home.",
        "It's just a total cognitive disconnect.",
        "And what's frustrating, you know, is that that disconnect is still with us 60 years after Ellison wrote \"\"The Invisible Man.",
        "That conversation that Jonathan Capehart described, of how to behave around white people, did someone talk to you about that?",
        "I've had that - I didn't have to have the discussion about how to behave around white people 'cause I grew up in South L.A.",
        "and there were no white people - with the exception of teachers and police officers.",
        "But I have had similar discussions with my kids and in particular, my sons when I was teaching them to drive.",
        "There was a specific part of the lesson which was, OK, this is how to behave when you're pulled over - not if, but when you're pulled over.",
        "And it really - you know, I really resented having to give them that lesson.",
        "They were kind of confused by it, and I resented it.",
        "Now, you know, we're 10 years and more beyond my teaching them how to drive, and they're no longer confused by it because they're stopped on a regular basis.",
        "But it was really - it really angered me and frustrated me to have to add this, you know, this particular lesson to what is otherwise a right of passage that all parents have, you know, have had to experience in teaching their kids how to drive.",
        "And we'll get some listeners involved in the conversation in just a minute.",
        "But Leonard Pitts Jr., you also wrote that we can't ignore everything that has improved over all those years since Ralph Ellison wrote \"\"The Invisible Man,\"\" yet some things haven't.",
        "Yeah, much has improved.",
        "But I think that we get in trouble - excuse me - when we believe that those improvements have, you know, brought us to - as Dr. King, you know, said in his famous speech - the promised land.",
        "I think that, you know, it's important to recognize and to honor improvement, but also important to recognize and understand that there is a long way yet to go.",
        "I just got in a contingent of 400 Marines.",
        "And if you're on the street at night, you're going to be greeted rather rudely and most probably looking down the barrel of a gun.",
        "And Jonathan Capehart, I know you've got to leave us to go to another appointment.",
        "But I did want to ask you before you go, as you think about those lessons your mother told you all those years ago - and the necessity of them still, today."
