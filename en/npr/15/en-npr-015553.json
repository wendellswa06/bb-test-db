        "It was just before he won, and this month they have been really cranking away for what is expected to be a huge fundraising month.",
        "If he only raises - only raises - 20 million dollars this month, I would say he's got a problem.",
        "But he's now spending a lot of time courting big donors.",
        "His campaign has put out a series of emails and kind of really high-pitched intense appeals to the small donors.",
        "So I think that they're going to try to make up for that this month.",
        "And also he's bringing in Hillary Clinton's former donors, which is another really deep pool of money, who are ultimately Democrats, and probably will wind up supporting him.",
