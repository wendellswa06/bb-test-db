        "We have, you know, about a quarter of the nation's bridges are at a state of disrepair that needs to be addressed.",
        "And it's - in addition to that, you have rail systems, like the Northeast Corridor, that have shelf lives.",
        "And if we don't take care of those systems, they're not going to perform for us in the next 10 or 20 years.",
        "And you look across the nation at our airports.",
        "We still have a lot of upgrading to do, not only of the airports themselves, but also our airspace through NextGen, which is an air traffic control system we're working to implement.",
        "And so across the board, we have these huge needs.",
        "And if we meet them, it's going to allow us to move goods and people much more efficiently in the future than we do today.",
        "But if we don't invest and we don't make the right choices now, we're going to be stuck.",
        "Well, let's talk about a couple of the areas that this report focuses on.",
        "One is a competition, which never would've occurred to me, to be honest - a competition between freight and passenger traffic on the roads, between trucks and cars.",
        "I mean, why would that be heating up?",
        "Well, it's heating up because both the demand for goods in this country and the demand for goods produced here around the world are increasing.",
        "We have more manufacturing activity now than we've had over the last 15 years.",
        "And we expect that to grow.",
        "We're expecting, over the next 30 years, a 60 percent increase in truck traffic on our freeways.",
        "So the bottom line is if you're stuck in traffic today and your travel time is longer than it was 10 years ago, it's likely to get worse unless we take some very important steps at the federal, state and local levels to relieve this congestion before it gets worse.",
        "Many would say that the real problem, in terms of fixing and planning ahead, is the way the federal government funds roads and a lot of transportation - the gas tax, which hasn't been raised in 20 years so now falls short of transportation funding by billions of dollars every year.",
        "So what about raising the gas tax?",
        "Do you favor that?",
        "Well, the president and I have a proposal for surface transportation - highways and transit and rail - that would use pro-growth business tax reform, taxing untaxed corporate earnings that are overseas and having those earnings come back home and being put to work for infrastructure.",
        "Although, excuse me, but that is a one-time-only fix.",
        "It's a one-time fix.",
        "But it also is a fix that doesn't increase deficits and doesn't require tax increases and allows us to basically double what the gas tax is putting into the system today.",
        "So we think it's important to make a very substantial pivot towards much greater investment."

        "It's also the Chamber of Commerce, Federal Express, big businesses that are out there, very engaged with transportation issues, saying this is really what we have to do.",
        "Well, we've said before that if Congress has other ideas, we're willing to listen to them.",
        "But I think what you are seeing in this report and what Americans are seeing every single day is that we have a chronic level of under investment in infrastructure.",
        "But I think the piece that probably hasn't gotten as much attention is how we're spending our money, how it's actually going into the system that we're going to need 30 years from now, needs to be rethought.",
        "Hopefully, this report, which doesn't purport to lay out an action plan but, in fact, tries to help laser in on what the problems we're going to face are, is a critical foundational piece of allowing that conversation to happen.",

        "They were exposed to someone who had measles either in school or day care or even the doctor's office.",
        "Dr. Erica Pan is a pediatric infectious disease specialist and heads the county's disease prevention division which tracks measles cases.",
        "We look into who might have been exposed, not only at the same time as when a person was in the room, but for up to an hour afterwards because measles, again, is so infectious and contagious that it's airborne, and it can linger in the air.",
        "And babies under the age of 1 are particularly susceptible because they haven't been vaccinated.",
        "Their immune systems aren't developed enough to benefit from the vaccine.",
        "If there was a measles case in a room of 10 infants, our presumption is that 9 out of 10 would become infected with measles.",
        "The virus causes fever, cough and a spotted body rash, but it can be so much worse.",
        "Children under 5 are more likely to get complications, including ear infections that can result in permanent hearing loss.",
        "And there can be even more tragic complications."

        "Anyone could enroll in the course, but it was specifically designed for veterans, dependents of military personnel and individuals considering a career in the armed forces.",
        "However, none of the students who enrolled were aware of this special focus.",
        "So imagine my surprise when I showed up to teach and found not a bunch of grizzled vets, but a roomful of young women, many in their late teens and early 20s, who made it very clear they weren't at all interested in the military."
