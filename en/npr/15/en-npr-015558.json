        "And one of the main thing with proximity flying, meaning jumping off a cliff with a wingsuit and trying, as opposed to fly away from the cliff, fly next to the cliff and trying to out-fly various geographical features, you have to judge the flight path way before you're actually getting there and trying to out-fly that specific feature.",
