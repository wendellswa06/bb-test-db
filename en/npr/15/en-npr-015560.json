        "But our best guess is that it reflects the same amount of light as Pluto does and that would be about 25 percent larger than Pluto, but it could be a little bit larger still, too.",
        "We're trying some more observations over the coming months that will really tell us for sure what that size is.",

        "And as everybody knows, the same amount of money will buy a larger and larger CCD on your camera.",
