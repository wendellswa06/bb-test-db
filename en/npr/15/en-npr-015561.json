        "Fans are still playing a lot of money just not to the artist.",
        "One obvious solution is just give in - price the tickets at the market rate, at the rate you're fans are paying the scalpers.",
        "But there's a danger associated with that.",
        "It has to do with the complicated psychology of fans and their relationship to musicians.",

        "She says if Taylor herself had wanted to charge her that much...",
        "If I saw it on her website for 250, I don't think - I would think that was crazy.",
        "It just seems like so much money to go to a concert.",
        "And it's - I mean, I know she's so popular, but it's just Taylor Swift.",

        "So if you're that artist, how do you keep your tickets cheap and keep them out of the hands of the scalpers?",
        "Kid Rock, it turns out, thinks a lot about this and he's come up with a couple of solutions.",
        "First of all, for scalpers to make money there needs to be more demand than supply.",
        "So Kid Rock is upping the supply - doing more shows, eight shows in Detroit alone.",
        "Another solution, for the best seats he's raising the price, making them Ticketmaster platinum seats, but he's making them paperless, so they're harder to scalp.",
        "You've got to show an ID and the credit card you bought them with to get in.",
