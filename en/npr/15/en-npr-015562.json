        "Is that you talking with your father in that clip we heard?",
        "No, that's actually my mother speaking with him.",
        "Yes.",
        "What was your father doing in Baghdad?",
        "My father had been a professor of international relations specializing in refugees.",
        "For about 25 years he was a professor at Notre Dame.",
        "And he had recently left Notre Dame and started working for other organizations.",
        "He advised NGOs such as Amnesty International and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.",
        "When he went to Baghdad, he went with his colleague Arthur Helton.",
        "They had been writing for an organization called openDemocracy.net throughout the war about the humanitarian costs of the war in Iraq.",
        "And when the war was over, they both decided to go to Baghdad and to meet people, like Sergio Vieira de Mello, head of the UN there at the time, and hopefully to meet with refugees in cells to discuss the humanitarian costs of the war.",
        "And did they get a chance to even start their project?",
        "They had actually arrived that morning, the morning before the blast, so they'd been to a couple of interviews.",
        "And they'd only just entered Sergio Vieira de Mello's office.",
        "They'd shaken hands with everybody in the room.",
        "They'd taken seats.",
        "They spread out their papers.",
        "And then the bomb blast happened.",
        "It was actually a truck full of explosives that was driven by suicide bombers that was driven into the side of the building right directly under Sergio's office.",
        "So the office, the head office, was the attack, and my father happened to be there.",
        "Margaret Loescher is the writer, producer and director of the documentary about what happened to her father subsequently.",
        "It's called \"\"Pulled from the Rubble.\"\" You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And we heard your father's first memory was when he awoke in a hospital a month later.",
        "When he found out that he was the only survivor of the people who'd been in that room, how did that affect him?",
        "He was devastated.",
        "He couldn't quite understand how, if he had survived, others hadn't, that he--I mean, I was actually in the hospital alone with him the morning that he woke up, and he had been sort of semiconscious for a few days, but he hadn't asked about what had happened.",
        "And this particular morning, he asked me.",
        "He tried to ask me what had happened, and we had a sort of garbled conversation, but basically I had to tell him that his colleague Arthur Helton had passed away, that his friend and colleague Sergio had died, and that the other people in the office had died.",
        "And I--I mean, it's hard to describe that kind of pain you go through, but I think that he feels incredibly lucky to be alive, and he is.",
        "So understanding that luck, and knowing that others died in that attack, people whose work he deeply respected, has given him a renewed sense of energy and determinism to carry on his work and to publicize the plight of refugees around the world.",
        "So it's strengthened him.",
        "He's able to recognize that.",
        "u CONAN: You were a film student at the time?",
        "I was a film student at the time, yeah.",
        "I was working on another film, and then my father went to Baghdad.",
        "And when he came back from hospital, I discussed with him the possibility of filming.",
        "I felt that I needed to make a film that was about my life now and about my father's life.",
        "I understood what had happened to him was very personal and was a family matter, but because of where it happened and why it happened, it was a very important public story to tell, as well.",
        "I wanted to--it angered me when I looked at the news and I heard about terrorist attacks one after another after another, and you hear about the death toll; you don't often hear about the people who have survived.",
        "And you don't often hear about the damage that the war on terror is causing to humanitarian organizations.",
        "It's now very dangerous to work for a humanitarian organization, and that is a very scary future."

        "Yes, I did.",

        "Yeah.",

        "Yeah.",
        "No, it's very hard to make a film about your family, in whatever circumstance.",
        "But my family is very open, and I discussed this idea with them before I did it and while I was doing it.",
