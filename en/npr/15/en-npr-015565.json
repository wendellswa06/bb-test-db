        "What do you mean?",
        "That a football player - a football player could be crowned as the best defensive player in the Southeastern Conference, which is the best college football conference in America, could be drafted into the NFL after he was filmed kissing his boyfriend upon hearing news that he was drafted and yet, could be viewed as a football player and also dispel any notion that he would be a distraction to a team.",
        "He certainly wasn't in college where his teammates knew for most of his senior year that he was in fact gay.",
        "He wasn't with the Rams, although he didn't make the team.",
        "But then the Dallas Cowboys, America's team, went out and picked him up to see if he could fit into their program.",
        "And are you convinced that he did not make those teams because he just didn't have the NFL talents on the field to be part of those teams?",
        "You know, I really am from having talked to a couple of people who were concerned about his size and his speed and the fact that he might be what they call a 'tweener, in between two positions rather than being a dominate of one position in the NFL.",
        "But I don't think we've heard the last of him, and he has a stick-to-it-iveness about him if you read his narrative.",
        "I think he'll get another shot, and I think he can bounce back.",
        "He wouldn't be the first draft pick to have to fight and claw his way into the NFL.",
        "Let me ask you about two stories that came up in the NBA.",
        "Donald Sterling, owner of the LA Clippers - racist comments...",
        "Right.",
        "...The entire country sees it.",
        "His own players are very outspoken about how they felt about that.",
        "Eric Garner dies in a chokehold on Staten Island...",
        "Right.",
        "...A very well-publicized case - unarmed black man.",
        "NBA players wear I can't breathe T-shirts to let their voices be heard.",
        "Do you see those as related, and what does that tell us about the culture?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think for the first time in a long time, we've seen athletes understand their collective strength and to empower themselves with that strength, to speak their mind about some very important issues that affect them particularly - with the Donald Sterling case and his bigoted comments that came out of his pillow talk with his paramour, and the players that played for him were sickened and disgusted by that.",
        "And in particular a player who didn't play for him, LeBron James, came out and said, if this man is associated with the NBA any longer, I'll refuse to play for it.",
        "So I think that was something that we have not seen in a long time."

        "And then you move to the I can't breathe campaign and the concern that these athletes have shown for what many in the black community like them believe are extrajudicial killings of unarmed black men by police in this country to join that protest visually with these T-shirts, which happens to be in violation of the NFL and, in the NBA, of their uniform policies.",
        "I like to see players engaged in their communities and feel a sense of empowerment.",
        "It - sports has forever been an escapist arena with the media and for the public.",
        "But for those who play it, they are still part of society.",
        "And so they don't face any fewer problematic situations than anyone else.",
        "And when you're a young black man, whether you're in Ferguson, Missouri, unemployed, trying to figure out a way to make it to community college or whether you're in the NFL or the NBA making millions of dollars and hoping that you can drive home safely and not have to worry about an encounter that you may have with a police officer, I think all of that comes together.",
        "And I think they see themselves connected to that, and I think it's important that while people watch sports to escape from it, they realize that sports is always reminding us about what is going on in society.",
        "Kevin Blackistone is a sports analyst and a visiting journalism professor at the University of Maryland.",
        "Paula McLain's novel \"\"The Paris Wife\"\" was an unexpected hit.",
        "It's written in the voice of Ernest Hemingway's first wife, Hadley Richardson, whose passionate marriage ended as her husband shot into literary stardom.",
        "The protagonist of McLain's new novel \"\"Circling The Sun\"\" is another historical figure, but very much her own woman - aviator Beryl Markham, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic from East to West, an extraordinary individual who had an extraordinary childhood.",
        "Beryl was very young when her family moved to Kenya.",
        "Her father was a racehorse trainer, British.",
        "She came to Kenya when she was only 2 years old.",
        "And then when she was 4 years old, her mother returned to England and essentially abandoned her.",
        "And that was really the principal event in Beryl's young life, and I believe it sort of created her.",
        "It created her as she later became the kind of woman who would tackle all of these fearless, incredible, daring feats.",
        "Now, you focused on this early part of her life.",
        "I think that most people might expect - well, you'd focus - you'd start off with the flying career and all of the exploits.",
        "Well, you know, Beryl herself writes so beautifully about flying in her memoir \"\"West With The Night,\"\" so I knew I didn't want to compete with that.",
        "But then the other thing that happened is when I went and researched her and started reading biography and learning about her life, what was most striking to me was that her deeply dramatic personal story is entirely left out of \"\"West With The Night.\"\" So in \"\"West With The Night,\"\" she talks about all of these sort of daring exploits, her flying.",
        "She was the first licensed female racehorse trainer in the world at age 18.",
        "And yet what she leaves out is this maternal abandonment, her father neglects her.",
        "When she was 16, her father went bankrupt and lost the horse farm that meant more to her than anything in the world and kind of propelled her into a disastrous early marriage when she wasn't even 17.",
        "And all of this is left out.",
        "And I see it as kind of having everything to do with how - who she is, you know, how she became later this incredibly fearless, adventurous woman.",
        "Having to deal with these cataclysmic losses became stitched into her identity.",
        "It created this - this strength.",
        "Well, talk about the cataclysmic losses because it wasn't just losing her mother - her mother abandoning her at a young age.",
        "No, though I do think - you know, I mean, perhaps as a writer, I'm also sort of a pop psychologist, you know?",
        "Deeply, deeply curious about how people work, why they do what they do, why they make the decisions that they make.",
        "So for me, that loss - her maternal, you know, abandonment - is huge.",
        "But it's also one of the ways that I connect to her as a writer.",
        "You know, Beryl's mother abandoned her at exactly the same age my mother abandoned me.",
        "We were both 4 when our mothers disappeared, and we were both 20 when our mothers came back into our lives and made things really interesting.",
        "The bankruptcy was another thing, too.",
        "You know, the bottom drops out.",
        "Her father loses the farm.",
        "She doesn't know what she can do to stay in the place that she loves.",
        "And so she plunges into a disastrous marriage that throws her off kilter for many, many years.",
        "What's odd reading this book or what strikes one as odd reading this book is how history seems to have forgotten Beryl Markham.",
        "This amazing book that was raved about by Hemingway came out and then was pretty much quickly forgotten.",
        "Why do you think history has - history forgot her so quickly?"

        "You know, that was my question too after reading \"\"West With The Night\"\" was where has this woman been?",
        "Why doesn't her life have the same glow, for instance, as Amelia Earhart, her contemporary, or even Charles Lindbergh?",
        "And, you know, Amelia Earhart was America's darling and Beryl Markham was a notorious woman.",
        "She wouldn't behave.",
        "I think she was too independent.",
        "She made people uncomfortable, sort of either unwilling or incapable of following the social conventions of the day and the conventions and the limitations for her gender.",

        "You know, I wrote most of \"\"The Paris Wife\"\" in a coffee shop in Cleveland.",
        "I don't have to tell you that a Starbucks in Cleveland is about as far away from a Parisian cafe as you can possibly get.",

        "You can't really visit colonial Kenya, can you?",
        "You can't really visit Paris in 1922, except in your imagination.",

        "Well, there are three main subsidies that I'd like to talk about.",
        "The first one is a tax credit for taxes paid overseas, so in international markets by the big oil companies.",

        "Well, I mean, this is the argument that you're going to hear from the oil companies, and you're going to hear it tomorrow at a hearing in the Senate Finance Committee, and what you're hearing from some Republicans.",
        "I mean, the argument is, well, if you cut our tax breaks then we'll have less incentive to drill more and have new projects in the U.S., and that will lead to fewer jobs.",
        "But on the other hand, you could also argue that this is really a drop in the bucket for the oil companies.",
        "Would ending the tax breaks affect what we pay at the pump for gasoline?",
        "Probably not.",
        "I mean, what we pay at the pump is largely due to the crude oil price, which is set in international markets.",
        "And I think that ending the tax breaks would have too small of an impact, compared to kind of global demand trends like China's expansion."
