        "I will indeed.",
        "Jim, we're going to be following the health care vote very closely this weekend and, of course, into next week.",
        "But as a man who has been around Washington off and on since the early 1970s, I'm wondering if you think the importance of this legislation is in any way being exaggerated or is this as momentous as it comes?",
        "I think this is as big an issue of domestic policy as we've seen in quite a while.",
        "You know, there is a Republican criticism of the bill that it's too momentous that is taking over by the government, one-sixth of the economy.",
        "And that's not really a fair criticism partly because so much of the health care system is already run directly by the government with Medicare and Medicaid and so on and partly because the spill steers people towards the private insurers overwhelmingly.",
        "And there's a left criticism that it doesn't do enough.",
        "But I think this actually is quite a consequential matter if it does pass mainly because it's a bill that establishes that American citizens should have medical coverage just by virtue of being here, not by being old or being poor or being veterans or working for a big company.",
        "And if the Obama administration is able to pass that, it is something that Bill Clinton was not able to do 16 years ago, and that Richard Nixon was not able to do 40 years ago.",
        "And I think it's comparable mainly to the Medicare passage 45 years ago when Lyndon Johnson had gigantic Democratic majorities."

        "They were having features on the app where you could maybe send text messages to your loved ones, you know, for years after you were dead, you know, leave different presents or geolocated little messages for people.",
        "What do you mean by a geolocated message for someone?",
        "Oh, for example, suppose you're in, you know, Central Park and all of a sudden, your phone might vibrate and it would be a text message from your, you know, dead grandmother saying, you know, your grandfather and I used to like to sit on this bench.",

        "Why don't you go sit and enjoy the view like we used to do - or something like that.",
