        "So the researchers video taped hundreds of hours of the chimps and bonobos, which revealed that these primates used over 30 distinct gestures like waving a hand, raising an arm, dabbing with the finger, reaching out.",
        "The researchers linked each gesture with the context of what was going on at the moment.",
