        "Yes.",
        "It's kind of a running joke among my readership that no character is safe.",
        "But yes, I often - a lot of times, if there's going to be an important character death in a story, it's a scene that I've known about probably from almost the beginning of my conception of the story.",
        "Because these moments, you know, as we can see just from people reacting, you know, to the character deaths in these television shows, we want to explore that.",
        "We want to find out why is this person dying, why does he have to die, and where do the surviving characters go on from here?",
        "Yeah, but here's the problem.",
        "The viewers and readers do get really attached to these characters, and having them die can be really painful.",
        "I mean, the blogosphere goes insane when one of these characters gets killed off on a TV show.",
        "But the very fact that they're reacting so passionately about this means that the story's doing its job.",
        "It sucked people in.",
        "It involved them with these characters.",

        "At some point after that, the Treasury's going to be unable to pay all of its bills.",
        "It's going to be essentially driven to a cash budget, only able to pay out what comes in in tax revenue.",
        "And quite what that means depends on whether you think the Treasury can prioritize payments.",
        "So, for example, can it pay bondholders before it pays others?",
        "Or, as many say, the systems are set up in a way that it can't actually do that.",
        "If it were unable to pay bondholders, the U.S.",
        "would be in default on its debt.",
        "And so the world's ostensibly safest financial asset, the U.S.",
        "Treasury bond, would suddenly be no longer so safe.",
        "And that could have very, very dramatic consequences.",
        "Financial markets could seize up.",
        "We could see a financial crisis already extraordinary proportions globally.",
        "As we are coming closer to that deadline, you're seeing financial markets get more and more uncertain about what's going to happen.",
        "And actually, I'm quite surprised at how little financial market reaction has been thus far.",
        "And I think it's basically because most people think the consequences would be so calamitous, these guys will come to their senses in time, and the worst will not occur."
