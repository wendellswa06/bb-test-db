        "And this music that particularly impressed him was a tune by Handel, \"\"Sarabande.\"\" And he was impressed by that, and he thought of some music from that period of the sort of Renaissance - after the Renaissance, the baroque period in Italian music follias.",
        "And follia is a style of music, but it also means - with a double L - it means madness.",
