        "House GOP leaders had planned to hold today's vote on the Boehner plan yesterday, but they held that vote over to add more spending cuts, since the Congressional Budget Office found the original plan increased the debt limit by an amount greater than its spending cuts.",
        "That plan was revised so that the debt ceiling is raised $900 billion and the spending is cut by $15 billion beyond that.",
        "Illinois freshman Republican Joe Walsh found the new figures...",
        "Encouraging.",
        "And leadership certainly moving in the right direction.",
        "Good stuff.",
        "The more we can get, the better.",
        "I'm going to wrap my arms around it all right now and see what it looks like.",
        "Are you ready to vote for it?",

        "Nor are other conservative Republicans, though it's not clear how many.",
        "Arizona Republican Senator John McCain admonished them yesterday.",
        "If conservatives defeat the Boehner plan, it'll not only undermine our House majority, it'll go far to re-electing Mr. Obama and making the entitlement state that much harder to reform.",
        "Senate Republicans are pinning their hopes on Boehner's proposal.",
        "Here's South Dakota's John Thune yesterday on the Senate floor.",
        "Tomorrow I am hopeful that the House of Representatives will pass the Boehner bill.",
        "And I'm hopeful that as soon as we receive it here in the United States Senate, we'll take it up, pass it, and send it to the president for his signature.",
        "Don't anyone ever think that we'll be left only with the Boehner plan."

        "I don't know how many more times we need to say that, but it's true.",
        "Reid has not brought up his own plan to raise the debt ceiling.",
        "It too is offset by spending cuts.",
        "But unlike Boehner's proposal, it would keep the government solvent beyond next year's elections.",
        "New York Democratic Senator Charles Schumer hopes it will be what resolves this crisis.",
        "Once the House plan is defeated and the Senate plan is the only option standing between us and default, we think Republicans will give this a long look and decide to go along.",

        "But Michael Barnett, a specialist in international politics and humanitarian intervention at George Washington University, says the decision to intervene could set a precedent.",
        "The fear is that you may, in fact, as you engage in one intervention, you create expectations down the road for future interventions.",
        "Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, says the administration is approaching each country on a case-by-case basis, and weighing the various interests.",
        "I think on all foreign policy, national security questions, there is always going to be a competition and sometimes a clash between what our principles are and then what our core interests are.",
        "When you have multiple uprisings and voices pushing for unrest in multiple countries in the Middle East, having a different approach opens up the administration, I think, to charges of hypocrisy.",
        "The administration's response to uprisings in Yemen and Bahrain has been muted.",

        "would intervene in either country, because it has too much at stake.",
        "If in Bahrain the concern is about containing Iran and maintaining, you know, a stable supply of oil out of the Gulf, in Yemen, I think, a key concern is the fight against al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.",
        "But George Washington University's Barnett says that could change.",
        "I guess I'd be willing to bet that if you found the casualty levels rise to what happened in the 1980s with tens of thousands dead, then you'd find tremendous pressure for an intervention.",
        "The Washington Institute's Scott Carpenter says it would be more complicated to intervene in Syria than Libya.",
        "Gadhafi was reviled and Libya had few allies, but Syria has some powerful allies, including Iran, and Carpenter says a military intervention there could severely disrupt the dynamics of the region.",
        "One of the strategic partnerships, if you will, of the Syrian regime has been both Hamas and Hezbollah.",
        "And with Hezbollah as a very well- armed, very well-trained force, if they would get involved in this, should there be an international intervention, I think it could spark a regional war."
