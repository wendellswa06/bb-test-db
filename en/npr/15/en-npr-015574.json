        "Well, I think that, first of all, Egypt was a very small oil producer and they used oil internally in Egypt.",
        "And I think that now the market is really starting to understand what I call the contagion effect.",
        "That the idea that somehow this was going to be contained in Tunisia and Egypt and it wasn't going to spread to other countries or that somehow, magically, it wasn't going to spread to countries that produce oil was probably a very naive image.",
        "And if you think about the history of the Middle East, you know, the Egyptian revolution of 1952 spread across the Middle East for over 10 years.",
        "I mean, Egypt had their revolution movement in the '50s.",
        "And as late '69, is when Colonel Gadhafi came to power on the heels of that same revolutionary movement.",
        "So what's happening in the Middle East today could play out for a long time, and we could be in for high oil prices for a long time.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So what other countries - if this - if what's going on now spreads to - across that whole region, what would be the, really, key countries in terms of affecting the price of oil and the price that we might have to pay eventually for gas?",
        "So starting out, there have already been disruptions of oil products exports from Libya to Europe.",
        "We're seeing that today and...",
        "Right.",
        "And we just want to say we haven't - NPR News has not yet confirmed that.",
        "But go ahead.",
        "Okay.",
        "So as that spreads, there's a possibility that you could have the same kind of unrest, say, in Algeria, which is also a big supplier of oil and natural gas to Europe.",
        "But I think the market's bigger concerns would be if it spread around the Persian Gulf.",
        "So let's say the Green Movement were to become more violent and active in Iran, you're talking about 4 million barrels a day of exports.",
        "I might give people a little bit of a history lesson.",
        "In 1978, the shah starting firing on people in the streets in Iran and the oil industry went out on strike in sympathy with the people.",
        "And that is what caused the 1979 oil crisis.",
        "We kind of don't remember.",
        "It started with oil workers going on strike.",
        "So, again, that could happen again in Iran.",
        "The Iranian government is aware of that so they put a lot of people from the Revolutionary Guard into key positions in the oil industry to try to avoid that.",
        "But my feeling is if they weren't worried about it, they wouldn't have to put the Revolutionary Guard in the oil industry.",
        "So that still remains a possible flashpoint.",
        "You know, there was one headline this morning that said, if unrest spreads, gas may hit $5.",
        "Is that just speculation?",
        "Is there any indication that that's reality or can you say that yet?",
        "Well, I think what I would say is, we're basically about to beat a $3 gasoline.",
        "And we're not to what we call the summer driving season.",
        "You know, there's typically a psychological and physical push for the price of gasoline that comes around Memorial Day."

        "So I think it's just a question of how much oil really actually gets disrupted by May.",
        "And, you know, I think the jury's still out on that.",
        "We don't really know.",
        "Will Libya's oil be disrupted in a small amount from some oil refineries?",
        "Or will all their oil fields go down, which would take us, you know, a little over a million barrels a day out of the market?",
        "Saudi Arabia might be willing to make some of that oil up.",
        "But what if Shia oil workers in Saudi Arabia, you know, made a protest or went on strike?",
        "Is that going to be disruptive?",
        "So I'm hoping that this last scenario of something spreading to Saudi Arabia is looking fairly unlikely.",
        "But if that happened, we would be in a major 1979-like crisis.",
        "What effect are speculators having on prices right now?",
        "Well, I think that speculators were already in the market, and they were already betting on sort of a $95 to $100 oil price for this year, sort of based on, you know, supply, uncertainty, growth - you know, compared to the economic rebound.",
        "And so you have this very dynamic factor, which is that the higher the price of oil goes off of this turmoil in the Middle East, the quieter the rebound's going to be, because all of us are going to be spending a little bit more money on fuel.",
        "Businesses and industry are going to be spending more money on fuel.",
        "And so therefore, businesses' ability to hire new workers is going to be somewhat restrained by the fact that they have to pay higher fuel costs.",
        "And then there's just the psychological effect.",
        "If we start to have a feeling in America that there's a crisis looming, and gasoline prices could go to $5 a barrel, that just creates like a psychological break, like I'm afraid to plunk down money on my summer vacation because I'm afraid about the economy and whether I'd lose my job.",
        "And then it becomes sort of self-fulfilling.",
        "We're talking with Amy Myers Jaffe about the price of oil.",
        "If you'd like to join us, the number is 1-800-989-8255.",

        "I'm a courier in Cleveland.",
        "I work out of my own vehicle.",
        "I take - you know, I transport various sundry things all over Cleveland and northeast Ohio.",
        "So I keep a close watch on the gas pumps every day.",
        "And, you know, the public perception is that whenever there's a rippling of crisis or even a rumor of some sort of crisis with the oil industry, the price goes up really quick, but then it's slow to come down, if it ever does.",
        "You know, as soon as there's any kind of news out of the Middle East that there's some sort of problem, they run out there and jack up the price.",
        "Like today, it actually already shot up 20 cents, from about 3.09 yesterday.",
        "It's 3.29 right now.",
        "And, you know, I'm just wondering, is that true?",
        "I mean, is that an accurate perception, that the oil companies are really quick to jack up the price, but then they make all kinds of excuses to bring it back down to what it might have been before?"

        "I look around on the Internet, and it appears that oil production - which is pumping it out of the ground, as opposed to refining it - costs about anywhere from one to $20 a barrel, that it's sold on the commodities markets for, you know, 80 to $100.",
        "And I was wondering where that money goes to, the difference in that money?",
        "Well, you know, the amount that you've cited, one to $20, is actually - it really depends where you're producing the oil.",
        "You know, if you're trying to strip little bits of oil out of the sands in Canada, it's a lot more expensive than if they're just, you know, sticking a drill down in Saudi Arabia or Iraq, where it's only a couple of dollars a barrel.",
        "The difference between the two - in economics we call that the economic rent, and where that money goes kind of depends of on who you are.",
        "So if you're a royal family in the Middle East or a corrupt government somewhere in the world, you might be skimming that money off and putting it in a bank account in Switzerland, or you might be using it to build new colleges and universities for your people.",
        "It kind of varies from country to country.",
        "Yup, that's right.",
        "Here in the United States, we have private companies that produce oil.",
        "And whatever that economic rent is, the difference between what it cost them to produce it and what they could sell to us, the consumers, that's just goes into corporate profits, basically.",
