        "I got a real quick question, and I'll take my answer off air.",
        "What would be the odds if oil ceased to be traded or bought with the dollar -like, what if the current - what's the odds that all of these countries come together and say, OK, we don't want to accept the dollar no more, or something scenario like that?",
        "Well, Saddam Hussein proposed that a few years ago before he fell from power.",
        "It's something that comes up from time to time inside OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.",
        "One of the reasons it hasn't happened, in my opinion, is that there are countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait that hold a tremendous amount of foreign investment in dollar-denominated assets.",
        "They own U.S.",
        "treasuries.",
        "They have investments here in the United States.",
        "And so they don't have any interest in weakening the dollar, because that would hurt their own economy and their foreign holdings.",
        "So I think that they have been pretty much against that idea.",
        "And it would be hard to do it without the major Arab producers like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.",
        "So that's one of the reasons it hasn't happened, is that there are lot of countries who have high-dollar holdings, and it's not in their strategic interests to switch oil off the dollar.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks for your call, Jose."

        "I'm just wondering if you can explain to me why we're paying so much for overseas oil when we have oil in our own country that costs so much less.",
        "And why, you know, are we - our gas prices are based on the overseas oil, as compared to our own oil, whose, you know, prices are so much lower?",
        "Well, the problem is we use a tremendous amount of oil here in the United States.",
        "I think this will shock you.",
        "We're about five percent of the world's population, and we use 35 percent of all road fuel manufactured in the world.",
        "So we are real gluttons when it comes to fuel use.",
        "And, indeed, there isn't enough oil under the ground in America that can be produced at any one time to meet our demand.",
        "And so we actually have to import a lot of oil from abroad, millions of barrels a day.",
        "So we use about 20 million barrels a day of oil.",
        "Of that, about 60 percent of it we're importing.",
        "And because we import and we don't have a closed market, we all pay the same global price.",
        "So whatever the price is for China and whatever the price is for Britain, that's also the price here in the United States.",
        "So everybody is paying this high price",

        "One is that you mentioned the oil sheiks in the Arabian Gulf.",
        "So we have good allies in the Arabian Gulf.",
        "And maybe Saudi Arabia will increase its production to replace the oil loss from Libya, and then, you know, this could be a non-event, right?",
        "But the reason that the market is so jittery and speculators are betting is that, you know, how do we know that, you know, there won't be protests and oil won't be disrupted say, from Iran?",
        "And that could be four million barrels a day, because there gets to be a number at which we can't actually replace the oil that's lost in the market.",
        "And we had that experience in 1979, and it caused a huge dislocation here in the United States.",
        "You all might remember, depending on your age.",
