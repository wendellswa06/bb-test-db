        "Someone who needs another doctor, either because they've moved, or their doctor is retired or they just don't like their doctor anymore, those are the people bearing the brunt of whatever access limitation we have.",
        "Ginsburg says he's also worried about something else, the increasing gap in pay between primary care doctors, like family practitioners, and internists and specialists.",
        "Particularly now, he says.",
        "We really are looking to primary care physicians to play a bigger role, to coordinate care, to manage chronic disease, and not just to do piece work.",
        "And at the same time as we're envisioning a changed role, we're making primary care much less attractive.",

        "After Franklin invented the lightning rod, which showed that lightning was a natural phenomenon and even could be controlled and defended against by man, lightning and thunder became a weapon of the people, as you see this in radical pamphlets in France.",
        "In other words, thunder and lightning toppling monarchs from their thrones, this sort of thing.",
        "So Franklin had this effect.",
        "Dudley, you said before that Franklin's type of science was curiosity-driven, not necessarily with any practical application in mind.",
        "Is that still true today?",
        "It doesn't seem like you can get funding for just curiosity-driven science research.",
        "Well, what scientists do, they get funding writing proposals and all that fill the current criteria.",
        "But then they sneak in the things that really get them excited and often open up whole new possibilities that they wouldn't have dared to put in a proposal, that wouldn't have been favorably reviewed.",
        "Well, there are lots of great products and inventions we have that just came - we didn't know what we were going to do with, did we?",
        "That's right.",
        "That's quite right.",
        "Or had in mind a different thing altogether.",
        "I mean, I remember when the laser beam was invented, they just cut razor blades with it."

        "Well, many people don't realize he retired at age 42 to devote himself entirely to experiments and the study of what was called natural philosophy, we now call science.",
        "And of course within a few years he was carried into so many social responsibilities that he couldn't personally pursue it that much more.",
        "But in the meantime, he had not done much more than fly the kite.",
        "He had done a whole series of experiments over a span of six or seven years that were described in these letters Philip mentioned to his friend in London, who read them before the Royal Society, and they greatly impressed the savants who had been so puzzled by the nature of electricity.",
        "I mean, Franklin did very fine experiments, and he interpreted them and in fact provided a lot of the vocabulary we still use in talking about electricity.",
        "Sure, such as electrician.",

        "That's right.",
        "That's right.",
        "He would have been buried next to Newton in Westminster Abbey if he had remained a loyal British subject.",
        "His reputation was that large in science.",
        "It's worth mentioning, too, and I think Professor Herschbach would agree, that what was astounding about Franklin to the European scholars was that they weren't used to important science coming from America, let alone from someone who was really a tradesman or a publisher of a newspaper, and at first they were inclined to almost disbelieve that there could be such a man.",
        "Of course, Franklin was always tickled by this, but not only Franklin, but the book he wrote, \"\"Experiments and Observation on Electricity,\"\" came as a really - like a major breakthrough, one of the most American books of the 18th century in Europe.",
        "It was translated..."

        "That's a good way to begin.",
