        "What - Franklin got the idea because he was living in London, and he went to a concert at which a man was rubbing the tops of wine glasses filled with different levels of liquid.",
        "And, of course, Franklin with his practical bent thought, well, that looks like a lot of wasted.",
        "Why not just tip them on their side, put them on a spindle and then turn the whole thing with a foot treadle?",
        "And of course that made it much easier.",
        "And the armonica caught on.",
        "It was a beautiful instrument.",
        "Mozart composed for it, and of course Franklin himself learned to play it and taught many other people how to play.",
        "As a graduate student in 1956, I heard a performance on what was intended to be an exact replica on the 18th century armonica as described in that literature.",
        "The American Academy of Arts and Science had commission the Corning glassworks to produce it.",

        "Oh, sure.",
        "The other example I can think of his using mathematics - and Professor Herschbach probably can talk about this too - is, you know, Franklin, he loved to project figures into the future and - about population and demographics...",
        "Right.",
        "...and that sort of thing.",
        "And he was incredibly accurate, actually, in predicting, for instance, the future population of the United States of America, that sort of thing.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Yes, in fact, that was a strong element of his political philosophy, is that - in a time scale that he estimated, there would be more people of English births in the colonies than in the mother country.",
        "So he had hoped, originally, to avoid a revolution, saying that in time this will take care of things.",
        "But he also used mathematics brilliantly in these magic squares.",

        "I think that's what it was called.",
        "And basically the point - that Franklin, being so famous and revered in France, was able to ask France to send Lafayette over and fight the American Revolution.",
        "Well, I think it's certainly true that Franklin was enormously popular in France.",
        "And he kind of played up - they loved him as a kind of rustic and he played that up by wearing this kind of silly beaver hat and dressing as a farmer.",
        "But yes, he was very charismatic, very beloved.",
        "And I'm sure that - he had had a very low-key style of diplomacy that worked very well."

        "But he just basically crudely one day got sick and tired of switching his glasses and took up two pair and cut them in half and glued them together and invented bifocals.",
        "And just - you know, it's indicative to me of how Ben Franklin, even though he didn't have a, you know, formal education - I mean, there he is, just basically took, you know, by the seat of the pants and invented these things.",
        "He'd also worked with the capacitors a lot too.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "There's a funny story about that, actually, which I understood, is that he - the idea for the bifocals came from his frustration, that when he would go out to a diplomatic dinner or state dinner in France, he couldn't both eat - look at the food on his plate and also see the lips of the people talking to him.",
        "And because his knowledge of French was imperfect, it was very important that he see people's lips moving.",
