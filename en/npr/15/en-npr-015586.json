        "Premier Wen will be there.",
        "He'll be speaking.",
        "There's just been a little kerfuffle between the United States and China, and it'll be an opportunity for Premier Wen to try to settle things down a bit.",
        "He probably realized that Tim Geithner submitted testimony in writing in which he said that China's manipulating currency rates, and China shot back the next day saying, no, we're not.",
        "And the United States and China need to smooth things over.",
        "Timothy Geithner will not be there, though.",
        "No.",
        "Representing Barack Obama will be a close friend and an adviser, Valerie Jarrett.",
        "She's been a mentor to Barack and Michelle Obama, a Chicago executive who's now in the White House as a senior adviser.",
        "Geithner still has not been confirmed, and it's considered a little rude to be out in public until you actually are confirmed.",
        "And with Valerie Jarrett being there, is there a feeling that if you can get her ear, you're getting the ear of the president?",
        "Yes.",
        "Anything that she can do to let people know that there's a sense from the new administration that they do have things under control - they are working hard, they have the stimulus plan working its way through Congress, and they're trying to do everything they can to get the economy going again - I think that will send a very important message.",
        "What of substance do you expect to come from this meeting?",
        "For John Cruden, the new role means coming home to a place where he worked as a career lawyer for 20 years.",
        "Cruden's been around long enough to have supervised the Exxon Valdez spill case, a record setter until the Deepwater Horizon exploded in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.",
        "That's pretty heavy.",
        "Now, you write the Romance 101 column in the Student Life newspaper at Washington University.",
        "And last week, you wrote about how to survive a turkey drop, and this comes from experience, right?",
        "Yes, very true.",
        "I was turkey dropped my freshman year.",
        "Came home for that first Thanksgiving break, and we saw each other and my boyfriend just said I can't do this anymore; the distance is too hard.",
        "And I don't mean to rub this in, but he was in high school and you were in college and he dumped you?"

        "He was.",
        "He was.",
        "He was still a senior in high school, so that one hurt even a little bit more than, I think, the regular breakup.",
        "Well, it turns out this isn't just a college phenomenon.",

        "Hey, Dan.",
        "Hey, Robert.",
        "So, what is it about Thanksgiving that makes it a common time to breakup?",
        "Well, for grownups, it's not that it's the first time you're laying eyes on each other after heading off to college.",
        "For grownups, it's the anticipation of being stuck for three or four more months.",
        "Because if you don't break up now at Thanksgiving or before Thanksgiving, you're a cad if you break up around Christmas and then there's New Year's, and you can't dump somebody right around New Year's.",
        "And then quickly after that, if you don't jump on it, is Valentine's Day.",
        "So, really, Thanksgiving is when you have to pull the trigger if you're not willing to tough it out through February.",
        "Yeah, because you would have brought them home to the family at that point for maybe Christmas or Hanukkah or something like that, and that just makes it all worse.",
        "And, God forbid, if their birthday should fall some time between November and February, then you're really stuck.",

        "So, you're turkey dropping me.",
        "I'm actually bad at the turkey drop.",
        "I had a turkey drop that was coming and I fled the state.",
        "Dan Savage, I'd probably do the same.",
        "Pure wimp are you, Robert, (unintelligible) should we be dating.",
        "So, Carly MacLeod, do you have the guts to break up with me over the radio?",
        "Show me how it's done.",

        "I can change.",
        "I mean, the distance isn't going to change, though, and that's the big thing.",
        "There's always next summer.",
        "I mean, really, we can prolong this a little bit.",
        "But think of all the stuff we'll be able to do at our different schools and different lives because of this."
