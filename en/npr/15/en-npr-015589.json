        "You add carbon dioxide to the air, burn a fire, you ride a car, something like that, and that carbon dioxide floats up to the upper atmosphere and blocks some of the light from escaping to space, so the Earth warms up a little bit.",
        "That causes water in the atmosphere to radiate more energy.",
        "So the oceans get warmer.",
        "And when you make water warmer, as everybody knows in their kitchen, more water evaporates and so the atmosphere gets more water in it.",
        "And that warms things up even more.",
        "So the net effect of all this is is that if you just put in the carbon dioxide, you get a temperature change, but all that water gives you three times more temperature change than you get with just the carbon dioxide alone.",
        "Most water doesn't linger in the atmosphere.",
        "It usually falls back to Earth in a week or so.",
