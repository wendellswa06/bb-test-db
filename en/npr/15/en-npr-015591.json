        "So there's been these two parts of my brain, and I've been wanting to combine code with sculpture for so many years and wanting to do digital fabrication of taking the code and generating the objects.",
        "Which he's done here at Autodesk.",
        "Kildall got all kinds of data about San Francisco's water systems.",
        "Among his discoveries, there are cisterns below the streets that were installed shortly after San Francisco's devastating 1906 earthquake.",
        "Killdall used the 3-D printers to create a sculpture of this underground system.",
        "It's small enough to wrap your arms around it.",
        "The cisterns looks like ivory-colored votive candles connected by a system of translucent pipes, and it's all in the shape of San Francisco's famous hills.",
        "This looks a little like \"\"Battlestar Galactica.\"\" It looks like the ship a little bit, you see (laughter)?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I would say they look kind of organic-alien.",
        "So there's an organic structure to them because they follow the topography of San Francisco so they have these natural curves and boundaries.",
        "And just as Autodesk hoped, Killdall's project challenged the software by overloading it with data.",
        "Each of these models took about 40 to 50 hours to print."
