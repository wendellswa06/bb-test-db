        "Nobody could help Bill Macumber.",
        "The man who did not admit to the crime went to jail for life.",
        "And author Barry Siegel says this was one of those cases where there wasn't enough evidence to prove Macumber's innocence.",
        "They didn't use DNA in evidence back in the time he was arrested, of course, but you could've still gone to the physical evidence now and tested it for DNA, except for the fact that all the physical evidence in Macumber's trial was ordered destroyed a few years after his conviction just as a matter of housekeeping in Maricopa County.",
        "So let's go forward 21 years later.",
        "Bill Macumber has been in prison for two decades, and by all accounts, he is a model prisoner, he is in the local Jaycees.",
        "He's sort of a legend in prison, but mostly forgotten about outside of prison.",
        "So 21 years later, what happens?",
        "Tom O'Toole was the lawyer who heard Ernest Valenzuela's confession to the murders way, way back in the 1960s.",
        "He had always been haunted by the case, always been haunted by his inability to get up and testify about what he had heard.",

        "There was still so much discrimination against African Americans.",
        "OK.",
        "There were only two African Americans on that year - my brother, and - how's this for irony?",
        "- my mother's neighbor had a brother on that ship, and he was African American.",
        "And those were the only two, and both of them went down with the ship.",
        "If your brother were here today to be able to see this, what do you think he would think?",
        "Well, he would laugh himself silly, first of all, because he was a character.",
        "And he never - it seems to me, now that I think of it, he always thought more of other people than he did of himself.",
        "And we learned today that he was not even supposed to be on the ship, that there was a death in the family of one of the sailors, and he was supposed to be on duty.",
        "So he took the place of the sailor who had a death in the family.",
        "So in essence, he gave his life for somebody else.",
        "And I guess all of us, if we had an opportunity, can ask ourselves the question and answer - would you be willing to give your life for a friend?",
        "I've been talking with Clara Osborne.",

        "Absolutely not, to be honest with you.",
        "You know, I think the poll is interesting, but I think what would have been more interesting to me is - if there was a question about how they came to acquire those beliefs because then you get into the fact that, you know, people of color, just like white Americans, are bombarded constantly by these racial stereotypes.",
        "And so we're not immune to believing this stuff.",
        "You know, black people can also internalize stereotypes about themselves.",
        "And so I think it really goes to show that, you know, racism is really a systemic structural thing that really pervades our society.",

        "I have to agree with what she just said.",
        "It - blacks, Latinos and Asians are often bombarded with the same media images of stereotypes and things of that nature that reinforce suspicious beliefs that we may have towards one another.",
        "So I agree with her a hundred percent on that.",
        "Now, when you think about this, Wayne, there are some positive things in this study, everyone acknowledged the contribution of African-Americans toward civil rights, is that enough to form a basis for understanding between the races or what would form a basis for better understanding?",
        "I think, Farai, I think what has to happen is that - and I think both your other guests make excellent points about the images and the media-driven stereotypes that we have with each other - I think what we have to do - and I noticed - I think the problem stems from immigration and a lot of people who come to this country from other countries.",
        "And I think what people who come to this country and see the African-American who was born and raised here, what we have to do or these people have to do is understand the African-American experience and be more open to what the African-American has gone through in this country, because we all have our own experiences in our countries and every country is different.",
        "So when you come to this country, you have to understand the African-American experience.",
        "And I think that's a good starting point.",
        "You cannot come with any preconceived notions based on what you heard in your country or of images that the majority population - or stereotypes of majority population has given you about the African-American who was born and raised in America."
