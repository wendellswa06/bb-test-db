        "There was, in fact, a blog post that I read online by Eisa Ulen about how she feels that in the Fort Greene neighborhood in Brooklyn, as gentrification has happened, some of the guys on the corner - who were not hurting anybody - are being called in for nuisance law.",

        "Well, I think it might be a little bit of both on that.",
        "I think, culturally, our young African-Americans have a tendency - for some odd reason which baffles me - of wanting to hang out in corners and have discussions or whatever.",

        "And I think that what we need to teach our youth to do is change their behavior if they don't want to be targeted because ultimately, people on corners, are drug dealers, as simple as that.",
        "Not all of them are not drug dealing, but unfortunately, there's a portion that is.",
