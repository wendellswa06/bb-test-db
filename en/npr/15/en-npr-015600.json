        "And then also, it would seem to me--and I'm not a rocket scientist, but--that orbital mechanics get kind of goofy up there, and if you try to tie this station still up in space, it's going to rotate and pop around and end up snapping this ribbon.",
        "I was wondering how you dealt with those problems.",
        "Well, for the high-altitude winds, if you look at the equator, first, the hurricanes, for example, do not go into that area, but those are the low-altitude.",
        "The high-altitude winds--for example, jet streams--are not present at the equator.",
        "Now there are some high-altitude winds up about 18 kilometers altitude that go up to a couple hundred miles per hour; however, if you look at those, the density of the atmosphere is down such that the total force on the ribbon is similar to a 20-mile-an-hour wind here on Earth.",
        "And we've gone through the calculations on how much that would move it, and we believe that we're still in pretty good shape with those."
