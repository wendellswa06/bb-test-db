        "If something did fly into it, what--I'm sure you might have taken into consideration what the results of that would be?",
        "I mean, not only for the airline or the thing that flew into it, but for the ribbon itself.",
        "Yes.",
        "If an airline were to hit this ribbon, what would probably happen is it would probably severely damage the airline, the aircraft, and the ribbon...",
        "Yeah.",
        "And the ribbon itself.",
        "It's conceivable that we would lose the ribbon.",
        "What would happen is a piece of ribbon below that point would fall to the ground.",
        "At least above that would essentially be pulled up and out of its orbit to a large extent.",
        "There may be some parts of it that may fall back down, burn up kind of thing in the atmosphere, similar to rockets re-entering.",
        "But most of it would actually leave its orbit.",
        "It would be a financial loss, whatever.",

        "What would that look like?",
        "Would it look like a normal little car?",
        "You know, like a box riding in an elevator and pull itself up by a motor up the ribbon?",
        "Well, the designs that we got--they're not real pretty; they're pretty much functional.",
        "It's got sort of an open truss-type frame, and it will have a large solar ray to collect energy from the laser power beaming that we'll use, and it'll have a drive system, a set of rollers, motors, and then it'll have a few electronics boxes.",
        "So the first one--there's--the climber itself doesn't look real fancy, doesn't look like a Buck Rogers kind of thing.",
        "Now if you're taking up cargo or passengers or anything like that, that would be an attachment to this climber, the payload.",
        "If you're taking up people, yes, it'd probably be a spherical cylindrical, windows obviously required kind of system.",
        "So it would look--it--probably still pretty function, not real sleek, you know, streamlined, anything like that, because none of that's actually needed for the elevator.",
        "It would move real slow through the atmosphere; no resistance or anything else once you get up into space."

        "Let's say you wanted to supply something like the space station with cargo.",
        "Well, for the space station--actually, in the elevator, going to lower-Earth orbit's more difficult for us than going to geosynchronous orbit.",
        "If you go to geosynchronous, you go up to 22,000 miles and you then let go of the ribbon, and you are in orbit.",
        "You want to move to a different position in that orbit, you can release a small amount of gas and move to a different location.",
        "If you want to go to lower-Earth orbit, you actually go up above lower-Earth orbit and then drop the payload down.",
        "You'll go into an elliptical orbit, and then it'll be caught by the station or maneuver itself to meet up with the station.",
        "You may need some small rockets to change the plane a little bit, change the orbital direction.",
        "So you may need nothing the size of the rockets that we currently use to get them from Earth into space, though.",
