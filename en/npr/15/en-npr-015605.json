        "In other words, the brain cells of the mice that were exposed to the air of Columbus, Ohio made fewer connections, and the mice had a harder time remembering things and acted depressed.",
        "Now Fonken readily admits her experiments can't say anything definitive about how air pollution affects the brains of human beings, but she says, it does get people thinking about how the dust around us can have harmful effects.",
