        "That practice worried cardiologist Michael Ho.",

        "So, Michael Ho and several colleagues of the VA Medical Centre in Denver studied records of more than 8,200 men treated at VA hospitals around the country with Plavix, also called clopidogrel.",
        "We found that patients who were on clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors had an increased risk of another hospitalization for a heart attack or unstable coronary syndrome, compared to those who are just on clopidogrel alone.",
        "Plavix plus one of these acid blockers increase the risk of returning to the hospital or dying by 25 percent in the first year-and-a-half of taking the drugs.",
        "The researchers described the study in the current issue of the Journal of The American Medical Association.",
        "By medical standards, 25 percent is not a big increase until you consider that doctors prescribe Plavix to nearly every person who has had a heart attack or stent.",
        "And in the VA study, two thirds of men on Plavix land up on an acid blocker.",
        "Still, doctors should not stop prescribing Plavix, says Steven Nissen.",
        "If you don't give Plavix to a patient with a stent in their coronaries, there is a high probability - much higher than we would accept -that they will get a clot in that stent, which will cause a heart attack or even death.",
        "And patients who've had heart attacks need that same anti-clotting benefit.",
        "Study author Michael Ho says the benefits of Plavix can still be had by limiting these particular acid blockers to a small group of patients with serious stomach problems.",
        "In other patients who don't have a clear indication, they may want to prescribe alternative stomach medication.",

        "It says to the Cardiology community, there's a potentially serious problem here, it needs attention.",
