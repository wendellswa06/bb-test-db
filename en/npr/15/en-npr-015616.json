        "U.S., Canadian and British troops do most of the fighting in Afghanistan, but U.S.",
        "Defense Secretary Robert Gates has been pressuring other NATO countries to do more.",
        "Now Britain's defense minister is saying the same thing.",
        "John Hutton will make the case when NATO discusses the future of Afghanistan in two weeks.",
        "He spoke with us yesterday from the British embassy in Washington, D.C.",
        "Well, I'm quietly optimistic that when we gather together in Strasburg, more NATO countries will be committing more resources to the campaign in Afghanistan.",
        "I mean, this is the defining conflict, I think, for NATO in this part of the 21st century, this battle against violent extremism.",
        "And Europe has got to recognize the importance of this threat.",
        "And we can contribute in a number of different ways.",
        "I mean, I'm not going to decry training of the Afghan police, the Afghan army, because these are very important functions that need to be done.",
        "But right now I think a premium attaches to the troops that are able to engage in military operations without caveats, without restrictions, and in that way able to support those of us like the U.S., Canada, Australia - many, many other nations who, as you would expect, have committed combat troops on the ground.",
        "Well, actually, not many.",
        "The burden is being borne by the U.S., Canada, Britain.",
        "Other troops - it's part of the way NATO does business that these countries are able to say, I will send troops with the caveat that they aren't sent where the fighting is.",
        "Well, I agree very strongly with what Secretary Gates has said, that we need more troops in Afghanistan with fewer caveats.",
        "But I think it's also a mistake, however, Renee, to assume that because the main portion, let's say, of French troops are in the North, that they're out of harms way.",
        "That's not true.",
        "Let's remind ourselves that French fast jets are flying out of Kandahar Air Base in support of coalition NATO forces in the southern part of Afghanistan, where the fighting is at its most intense.",
        "One of the biggest and most intractable problems in Afghanistan continues to be the poppy trade, which finances not just the drug lords but the Taliban.",
        "Britain, for years, was in charge of ending this poppy trade and really had, with all due respect, not great success.",
        "Is there a new strategy that will work?",
        "Well, I think you're quite right.",
        "Our strategy so far has not succeeded in the way that we would've liked.",
        "British forces have been very heavily involved in the south of Afghanistan very recently.",
        "And we've had significant success tracking down drugs, destroying the laboratories.",
        "It is absolutely at the top of my list of priorities, certainly in the context of the British operation, to really intercept this poisonous trade in drugs, which is helping the extremists to kill our guys on the streets there.",
        "You're suggesting that you're going after the drug labs.",
        "You're not going after the farmers who are growing the poppy?"

        "Remember, these are the local Afghans whose hearts and minds we've got to win over.",

        "For the local civilian population in Afghanistan it's about giving alternative economic choices.",
        "And that's what we've got to develop.",
        "We're speaking with British Defense Minister John Hutton.",
        "How long do you see foreign troops being in Afghanistan, and do you see an increase in the number of British troops being sent there?",
        "Well, I mean, I think NATO forces will be in Afghanistan for many years to come.",
        "It's difficult to be absolutely precise about that prediction.",
        "As for British forces are concerned, look, you know, we are the second largest contributor there, nearly 9,000 British troops.",
        "If it's necessary to reinforce that mission, we will do that.",
        "So it is possible that Britain, like the U.S., will send more troops to Afghanistan?",
        "Well, we look at this on a regular basis, and we've recently reinforced the mission there by several hundred extra troops.",
        "And we do whatever is necessary to protect British forces and help our mission in NATO succeed.",
        "British Defense Minister John Hutton, speaking to us from the British embassy in Washington, D.C.",
        "Show tunes.",
        "It's Nancy Killefer, and she had been appointed by President-elect Obama as the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget.",
        "But also, she was going to serve as the chief performance officer for the White House.",
        "Her job was to have been - in effect, to act as a watchdog, to really go through the entire budget line by line and find and root out ways to find programs that are not effectively doing what they're supposed to do.",
        "But there have been questions about, again, a tax issue that came up as early as a month ago.",
        "And for a year and a half, she failed to pay unemployment taxes in the District of Columbia for someone who worked at her home.",
        "And she, today, sent a letter to the president saying that, you know, it could be a distraction, that the confirmation could be difficult, that there'd be too much focus on this, so she has stepped aside.",
        "This is the third appointee with tax problems, the second to withdraw from an appointment.",
        "Does this say something about possible liabilities of this new administration trying to fill so many jobs so quickly?",
        "Well, it does raise some of those questions.",
        "They have been praised for the smoothness and the efficiency of the transition process.",
        "But with three, you know, high-profile people here kind of each having these problems, and you throw New Mexico Governor Richardson into the mix, it does raise some questions, and they are increasingly being asked these questions about how well they check these things out and why, in some cases, you know, if they knew about them, it didn't give them pause."

        "What will his departure mean for the Senate now?",
        "It means there is another open Senate seat, and New Hampshire's governor, a Democrat, gets to replace Gregg.",
        "And what we're hearing is that a deal has been made by which a Republican will be filled to replace Gregg.",
        "That means the Democratic majority in the Senate will not get to that filibuster-proof 60, but it also means that the seat is likely to be an open one in two years, and Democrats will have a shot at it then.",
        "You say \"\"deal.\"\" After the recent Rod Blagojevich scandal, you would think that making a deal around a Senate seat would be a little risky, no?",
        "One would think everybody would avoid such conversation.",
        "But apparently, Senator Gregg was not willing to leave his Senate seat unless he had some confidence that a Republican would replace him.",
        "His argument being, the people of New Hampshire elected a Republican, him, to that seat, so they're entitled to have a Republican fill it out.",
        "There is a difference between the Blagojevich thing.",
