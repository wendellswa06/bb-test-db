        "I think getting rid of tax subsidies for oil and gas companies also wouldn't necessarily bring prices down in the short term.",

        "And as John Boehner certainly knew when he instinctively knew that it wasn't a good idea to stand up for subsidies for companies that are making record profits, not a popular thing.",

        "Sure.",
        "And in the meantime, we recall the raucous town hall meetings of a couple of summers ago, when the then-nascent Tea Partiers tried to make their opinions felt about health care.",

        "Unidentified Man #1: Congressman, why did you vote for a budget that privatized Medicare, cut VA benefits and turn around and gave away tax cuts not to the corporations, to the highest personal rates?",
        "And that's the reason you don't worry - you're not caring about the deficits.",
        "You went and gave away all the tax cuts."

        "He needs to do better among seniors.",
        "There are many people in the Democratic Party who see the Medicare card and Social Security as kind of the way to do that.",

        "Sandoval gets to decide the date of that, and he'll probably decide that next week.",

        "The secretary of state's going to say how the election is going to run maybe as early as next week.",

        "A Democrat has never held Congressional District Two.",
        "A couple have come close, but it is a solidly Republican seat.",
        "But the Democrat thinking is that if it's a free-for-all, that is anybody can file, and 14 Republicans get in and one Democrat gets in, that there are enough Democratic votes to get what might be a small percentage that would actually win that special election."
