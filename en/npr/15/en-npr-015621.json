        "Again, it's unclear if that's how it's going to happen, but if it happens that way, there's a big advantage to Sharron Angle because she has a core of support and the potential for a Democratic upset.",
        "In the meantime, the big loser here seems to be Nevada's other congressional representative, Shelley Berkley, a Democrat.",
        "Yeah, Shelley Berkley, after months and months of - excuse me -agonizing over this, Neal, decided she was going to run, and very soon after that, it became clear Dean Heller was going to be able to run as a senator as opposed to a congressman.",
        "And she seems undaunted.",
        "She said today in Las Vegas that she doesn't think it gives Dean Heller much of an advantage.",
        "I have to believe she's just putting the best face on it because he will be able to now set up an office in Las Vegas, where he is not really well-known, and then he can essentially run his campaign or a de facto campaign of outreach from that office for the next 18 months.",
        "So it's an advantage.",
        "How much an advantage, I think that remains to be seen.",
        "And Mara Liasson, traditionally, being appointed to the remainder of a senator's term is a substantial advantage.",
        "It can be a substantial advantage, although you have to run in your own right.",
        "I guess the real kiss of death is when a governor appoints themselves.",
        "That never works out too well.",
        "But yes, it's always better to be an incumbent.",
        "Kirsten Gillibrand in New York, for example, benefited from serving out the remainder of Hillary Clinton's term.",
        "She has the unfortunate timing to run in her own right in 2010 and then have to run again in 2012, but nevertheless.",
        "Thank you.",
        "But nevertheless, she's put herself in a strong position, and I think - look, incumbency has all sorts of advantages, even in anti-incumbent years.",
        "I mean, you see that on the presidential level.",
        "You know, the Republican race hasn't even started, and President Obama is socking away the cash and setting up the mechanics of his campaign and not facing a primary opponent.",
        "So incumbents have a lot of advantages."

        "Jon Ralston, is it going to be less of an advantage, though, in a post-earmark era, where previously one of the advantages a representative or a senator could certainly do is bring home the bacon?",
        "There's still ways to bring home the bacon, Neal, and I think that the Republican caucus in the Senate will do for Dean Heller what it did not do for John Ensign during the last two years.",
        "Ensign was essentially shunned and not given any attention.",
        "I think they will try to get Heller a good committee appointment, and there will be an effort by the National Republican Senatorial Committee to make him seem like the greatest freshman senator in the history of senators.",
        "And to some extent, he'll get some benefit from that.",
        "You know, it was interesting.",
        "Nate Silver, who - the numbers guru for the New York Times, did an historical look at this, and it turns out that only about half of the senators who have been appointed in this way have actually survived at succeeding election.",
        "So it's by no means a lock, but I do think that as Mara said, being an incumbent just has tangible and intangible advantages that will help Heller in the race.",
        "And how is it transforming Nevada politics?",
        "Obviously accelerating this election cycle, but that special election for the House, well, whoever wins that, Sharron Angle possibly, is going to have to stand again come 2012, right?",
        "Yes, it's definitely created somewhat of a chaotic situation here because there are a lot of people who were thinking about running for that congressional seat but didn't think they had to make up their mind so quickly.",
        "They will have to do that now.",
        "There are constitutional officers, there are legislators, and there are others who want to run for that seat.",
        "So it's shaken up to that extent.",
        "I also think that nationally, this will be seen, whether rightly or wrongly, as a bellwether race because it is going to take place in advance of the 2012 real races.",
        "And so there will be a lot of import attached to it.",
        "Whether that's deserved or not, I don't know, but also it creates a situation here with the Senate race where there's been a lot of talk about this, Neal, that Nevada and Virginia could be the seats that determine control of the Senate."

        "And certainly we remember the Harry Reid-Sharron Angle race being so important last time.",

        "It's going to be an exciting time in Nevada.",
        "In the meantime, are some Democrats angling to possibly replace Shelley Berkley in the Las Vegas seat?",
        "What's interesting about Nevada is up until recently, it was the fastest-growing state in the country.",
        "So at one time, there was some speculation we were going to get two new congressional seats.",
        "Now with the growth having slowed down a little bit, we're going to get one.",
        "So they have to create a new district, which will also be in southern Nevada and will affect Shelley Berkley's seat.",
        "Shelley Berkley has one of the safest Democratic seats in the country, and so there are several Democrats who are interested in running there, but they're going to wait to see how the lines are redrawn, which should happen in the next month or so at the legislature, assuming that it doesn't get tied up in court.",
        "Now, Dina Titus, who was the congresswoman from the Third Congressional District here and lost in 2010 to Joe Heck, is definitely looking at Shelley Berkley's seat.",
        "She will not run against Heck again, but I think she will run for Shelley Berkley's seat, and she would probably be considered the favorite.",
        "Both of the Democratic legislative leaders up here in Carson City, the Senate majority leader Steven Horsford and the speaker John Oceguera, are also running for Congress.",
        "We have this - or are interested in running for Congress, excuse me.",
        "We have this unprecedented situation here with three of these four seats are going to be open.",

        "You've got a Democratic legislature and a Republican governor.",
        "Who gets to decide on whether those district lines are drawn in the redistricting process?",
        "The governor, in his State of the State speech a few months ago, Neal, said he will not sign a redistricting plan that is not - and he used the word fair.",
        "And, of course, fairness is in the eye of the beholder in something like this, and what he means is if he doesn't think the Republicans are going to do well with the new maps, he is not going to sign it.",
        "But how far will he go?"

        "It's going to be very, very difficult when it comes down to it for Sandoval to argue that the Republicans should have two safe seats, which essentially is what some Republicans want him to draw the line on.",
        "So there is some sense that he's going to veto it.",

        "Well, it's very interesting because Nevada essentially has three areas: the northern part of the state, the southern part of the state and then the rest is rural.",
        "And northern and southern are very urban areas.",
        "And most of the population, about three quarters of the state population, is in the south.",
        "So essentially, it should be that there are three districts in the south, and one would be a northern and rural district, which would be how the current Hellard(ph) District.",
        "There are all kinds of crazy ideas floating around, Neal.",
        "In fact, the first actual redistricting maps are going to be introduced in the legislature tomorrow, and so we will get our first look.",

        "Well, Barack Obama won the state by 12 points in 2008, Neal, but that was an unusual result.",
        "For the previous four decades, only Bill Clinton had won the state for the Democrats, and he only won Nevada because of Ross Perot being on the ballot.",
        "So this is a new phenomenon here.",
        "The Democratic machine, though, has completely changed in this state since the end of 2007 when Harry Reid used his position as Senate majority leader to get an early presidential caucus here, which revved up the Democrats and they managed to turn out more than a hundred thousand people for that caucus, registered a whole bunch of new people.",
        "And that's that registration edge that they have.",
        "So that Democratic machine, I think, still does give this state a slight edge to Barack Obama, although his numbers in this state are not good.",
        "Yet, you look at that last senatorial election and admittedly a strange election but a very badly politically damaged Harry Reid managed to squeak out a victory.",
        "He squeaked out that victory really for two reasons.",
        "The first reason we've already talked about, and that's Sharron Angle.",
        "She was a fatally flawed candidate in many, many different ways.",
        "But almost anybody, including Sharron Angle, would have beaten Harry Reid if it were not for that machine that I mentioned that the Democrats had erected in this state.",
        "And that machine will be fully operational again in 2012 to help Barack Obama.",
        "And, Mara Liasson, as the national party looks at the electoral map and they're trying to map out how they're going to do, where do they put Nevada?",
        "Nevada is a battleground state.",
        "I think that they are - the Democrats are certainly planning to fight hard for Nevada.",
        "When they look at the states that Barack Obama won last time, the only state that they say now is probably off limits for them is Indiana, and they're not saying that publicly.",
        "But all the rest, they think they're going to try again for North Carolina, try again..."
