        "And he has really outmaneuvered the Democratic legislature so far on the main budget issues.",
        "You know, he is an Hispanic, which is, you know, the fastest growing demographic in the country, and so he's been - he's been talked about as - you know, he's a young guy, he's in his late 40s - as being a person who could be put on the national ticket.",
        "I frankly don't see it, Neal.",
        "I mean, I think if they're looking for someone who fits that profile, Marco Rubio brings you a lot more potential electoral votes than our puny six here that we're about to have.",
        "And we're thrilled to have six because you used to have five, but Florida has five times as many or something.",
        "So I don't see it, although that floats up once and a while.",
