        "In terms of the balance of the court it doesn't seem to have much consequence because the man she's replacing, David Souter, really has a very similar outlook on the law to soon-to-be Justice Sotomayor, possibly with the exception of her stand on criminal issues.",
        "Because her background is really interesting as a prosecutor and a judge.",

        "What about you?",
        "You've been following this closely.",
        "Well, you know, if you look at it like - I guess I break it down to you this way: One, the argument's about reducing the cost of Medicare, the program that helps seniors, over the long run, because the trajectory is just so damning in terms of increased spending.",
        "So how do you do that?",
        "Because if you can reduce Medicare spending now, you can cover insurance for the 46 million people who don't have health insurance, which is a big issue.",
        "But to do that, then you have to squeeze the hospitals, squeeze the insurance companies, and they're fighting back.",
        "That's one set of issues.",
        "The second set of issues, I'd say, is look at how the government is trying to reengineer health care systems in general.",
        "Do a better job of delivery, do a better job of paying doctors for overall care rather than for emergency or chronic care.",
