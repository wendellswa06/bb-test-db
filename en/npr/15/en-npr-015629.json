        "They have seemed to have gone in the way of filmed war, where you did - where you also had a lot of private eyes.",
        "I think maybe because the private eye was - been in taking the uniform of a cop, you were able to portray a law enforcement person in a much more kind of ambiguous way, as more tormented and so forth.",
        "I think since cop shows themselves have gotten, since \"\"NYPD Blue,\"\" so complex, so psychologically complex, you don't need to make that shift into the private eye.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
