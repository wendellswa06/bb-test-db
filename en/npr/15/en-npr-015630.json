        "Thanks for the call, Jeff.",
        "You also write about the nature of the medium itself and obviously we're a long ways away from the days of, you know, the three big broadcast networks.",
        "And maybe if you were lucky in your market, a couple of independent stations where in a television cable world now are 500 stations and nothing on, but the Dinosaurs, the networks, still hanging on.",
        "Mr.",
        "SIEGEL Well, I think they'll always hang on, you know.",
        "There's a lot of money then and a lot of power.",
        "But they are slowly changing as well.",
        "They'll have to.",

        "Everyone's running around frightened.",
        "But there's no doubt that the screen is now central in the culture, more central than literary culture - the computer screen, the TV screen, the movie screen.",
        "And even if as things seemed to be going you're right, we will be able to hold all of culture in our palm at one point and it will still be a screen.",
        "There will still be a screen.",
        "But there is also the reality, market fragmentation, for example, you go back to radio, which of course you have competition from broadcasting with pictures in the 1950s or so.",
        "But what happened to radio, when more channels became available FM.",
        "What's market fragmentation?",
        "Every radio station decided not to compete against every other radio stations, but against the three others that were broadcasting their brands of classic rock or whatever it was.",
        "You see that happening in TV?",
        "There's certain amount of that, but, you know, if you look at everyone's talking about these things, fragmentation.",
        "It's very wise of you to bring that up because there is a book called \"\"The Long Tale,\"\" which is all about creating particularized niches.",
        "But if you look at YouTube, for example, which is a kind of TV, you know.",
        "If you look at - everyone seems to be doing their own thing, but everyone's really copying everybody else.",
        "And if you look at American Idol, what are they doing?",
        "Well, they're creating a pastiche of famous musician styles.",
        "I don't know if all these fragmentation would result in the thriving of unique taste or a new kind of conformity.",
        "I tend to watch, writes - an e-mail from Matthew(ph), I tend to watch the whole season of a series even on DVD sans commercials.",
        "Do you think that this is an important development?",
        "I guess TiVo would have to be thrown into that.",
        "Well, TiVo is something else.",
        "TiVo is absolutely disorient.",
        "TiVo almost ruined my marriage at a certain point because I kept rewinding.",
        "I couldn't - I have to hear every word, you know, I get very, very neurotic.",
        "My wife threatened to leave me.",
        "We stopped getting TiVo because of that.",
        "But the DVD development, that's an interesting thing because you can start enjoying TV almost as a solitary art, like a novel.",
        "You don't have to go to it when it's on.",
        "You don't have to be interrupted.",
        "You just buy it and you put it on the way you would open a good book.",
        "And I think that's very consequential, yeah.",
        "Was there anything for you that was - we're laughing along here - called the divorce channel?",
        "You've heard this description of, for example, ESPN Classic, where one partner turns the other and says do you mean to tell me you're watching a football game and you already know who won?"
