        "We're celebrating all things French, and so not only looking at Braille's life and the code that he invented, but also the music, the literature, and the food of the day.",
        "Can you give us just a little thumbnail biography of Braille and, as you say, his code?",
        "Well, he was born in 1809 in a little village outside of Paris, France.",
        "And by the time he was six, he had gone blind.",
        "He was lucky that he lived in the only country in the world that actually had a school for kids that were blind or visually impaired where he was exposed to the only books that had been made for the blind anywhere in the world, and those were in raised letters.",
        "Home school.",
        "Home school is it.",
        "They were very hard to learn how to use.",
        "And at some point, a man named Charles Barbier, a soldier, tested a system of writing with dots at the school.",
        "And Braille took that system, adapted it, and made it into the system that we use today - the code, as I say - basically a substitution code of using dots instead of the letters that sighted people use.",
        "Can I ask what kind of artifacts do you have in the museum?",
        "The oldest artifact we have is from 1786.",
        "It's actually the only copy that we know of, of one of those raised-letter books that was in that school for the blind in Paris.",
        "It's now common to see Braille underneath the buttons of an elevator or on the automatic teller machines.",
        "I wonder, are there some new technologies -emerging ones maybe - that might eventually make Braille obsolete?",
        "Here's the thing about Braille.",
        "Braille allows someone to actually read and write, whereas almost every other technology that we've come up with really is just kind of a complicated way of reading, not writing."

        "Why do they need to talk together?",
        "Well, first of all, as scientists, we really like to meet and talk to each other about things.",
        "And what is really interesting about this conference that we're organizing is the fact that we're bringing scientists together from various different disciplines.",
        "We're bringing together people that do (unintelligible) astrophysics, cosmologists, string theorists, people that do experiments with their labs.",
        "And the important point here is that gravity is such a force that affects phenomena in all those areas.",
        "And I think this is going to be one of the very first and very few conferences where all of us are going to be sitting in the same room discussing this very important subject.",
        "And what makes gravity so important?",
        "Well, it is, first of all, the last force in our framework of physics that we cannot really understand.",
        "I mean we understand it by itself but we cannot understand it within the context of all the other forces.",
        "We do not have yet the satisfying unifying theory that unifies gravity to, you know, other forces of (unintelligible) like for example, electromagnetism, the strong force, the weak force.",
        "This is point number one.",
        "Point number two is that over the last 10 years or so, we have seen an enormous explosion of ideas and new observations that give us some interesting clues about gravity.",
        "Now we're talking about universes with many dimensions that only gravity can see.",
        "And cosmological observations tell us that most of the gravitational fields in the universe is determined by things like dark energy and dark matter that we don't understand.",
        "So these are the two main reasons, I think, why we need to keep on talking about gravity.",
        "1-800-989-8255, if you would like to talk about gravity.",
        "We're talking about it.",
        "Of course Einstein said that gravity was a distortion of the fabric of space, right, by massive objects?",
        "Correct.",
        "So one of the problems is, how do you take a geometrical concept and move that into the quantum world which deals with gravity being carried by particles, right?",
        "Indeed.",
        "This is actually something - this is one of the main reasons why we've been having such a hard time unifying the forces, that our description of the gravitational field and our description of all the other forces are very, very different.",
        "There have been ways - there have been ideas trying to introduce ideas of the quantum world into gravity, ideas that go under the name of quantum gravity.",
        "Or trying to reproduce the quantum world using ideas of relativity.",
        "So it's like (unintelligible) warping of space-time in more than our normal dimensions.",

        "But as physicists our hope is that we will be able to find a theory that unifies all of them, and that's what drives physics to begin with.",
        "Do you think that by getting a whole bunch of scientists in a room and locking the door, you can come to some of these answers?",
        "A negative results will be important also in the sense that you can use that in order to place the other strong constraints on theories of large extra dimensions.",
        "One of our main hopes is that these theories are able to tell us why the force of gravity is so much weaker than all the other forces in the universe.",
        "This is, you know, the biggest hope that the theories will be right.",

        "However, it's going to be difficult as well, because first of all, we are using - if you can be able to say the different terminology, talking about the same phenomenon.",
        "But even more importantly, we come with different prejudices.",
        "So for example, when we all go to the same conference in (unintelligible) astrophysics and we read each other's publications, then we get to take something for granted and be willing to give up some other things.",
        "And there's something different that a cosmologist would do, and there's something different that people in the string theory would do.",

        "Correct.",
        "Are there any experiments out there that we could do to solve some of this ambiguity about just what gravity is?",
        "There are actually many different experiments and many different ideas.",

        "Let me bring up two new results that will be published this month, actually, in the Physical Review Letter, which is the premier publication of the American Physical Society.",
        "One is from the University of Washington, where they're testing ideas of universes with large extra dimensions by putting together masses at miniscule distances, about two-thousandths of an inch, and they measure the gravitational force between them.",
        "And the other paper is from the University of Arizona, from our group here, when we're testing the exact same theories - theories with (unintelligible) dimensions - by looking how fast black holes evaporate, or actually how fast black holes do not evaporate, in our galaxy.",
        "What is amazing to me, is that both of these experiments, both of these studies, produced almost identical, to within 50-percent constraints, on the properties of the theories with large extra dimensions.",
        "And this is exactly the point, that you can do very similar physics looking at the cosmos, looking at black holes in the galaxy, and looking at an experiment on the tabletop in the lab.",
        "Could it be that the particles of gravity that the quantum-gravity people are looking for - could they be - excuse me, but could they be the dark-energy part that we don't know where - you know, could gravity actually exist in the dark-energy side and peeks over here and being - so we don't know what the particles are because it's in the dark energy that we have no idea what that is?",
        "I will try to say this question a slightly different way.",
        "The point is that Einstein's theory of general relativity really has one main equation, and one side of that equation tells you how strong the gravitational field is, and the other side of that equation tells you how much matter you have that produces that gravitational field.",
        "What we do know now is that in many situations, as you said for example in the universe, those two… When we count as much as we can the matter, and when we count as much as we can the strength of the gravitational field, and we put them together, they don't sum up.",
        "They're not equal."
