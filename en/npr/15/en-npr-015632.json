        "So there's clearly a mistake somewhere.",
        "And that mistake can be either on the side that determines matter and energy - for example, we say we might have dark energy - or that mistake can be on the side that determines the force of gravity, in which case we have to change our theory of gravity and maybe talk about ideas in quantum gravity or in string theory to make that equality work out.",
        "We don't know yet, which side of the equation the mistake is, which side of the equation needs to be changed, but that's exactly what we're looking to find out.",
        "All the options are available at this point.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "When you talk to scientists, sub-atomic-particle scientists, you hear them saying oh, you know this Large Hadron Collider is going to be opening at CERN in Switzerland this - any day now.",
        "Correct.",
        "And that should answer some of these questions about gravity.",
        "Can you tell us what they mean by that?",
        "Yes, actually this is a rather (unintelligible) but extremely exciting possibility, that there is a non-zero chance if this idea of universes with large extra dimensions are correct, that in the Large Hadron Collider, these enormous (unintelligible) collisions that they're producing are going to create microscopic black holes - microscopic on the size of, you know, a subatomic particle.",
        "Now these black holes will not stay there, but they will evaporate very quickly.",
        "That evaporation is a quantum-gravity phenomenon, a quantum-gravity effect, something that the only way to understand it is by our current theories of trying to put together quantum field theories in gravity.",
        "And that evaporation will show up as a very, very unmistakable bright burst of energy.",
        "So if we understand - if we observe something like that, first of all we will observe for the first time a phenomenon that is not described by Einstein's theory of general relativity, but is predicted by some ideas of quantum gravity.",
        "And more importantly, we will have all the tools that we will need in order to try to make up, you know, theories to change the Einstein's theory of gravity, unify the series in order to produce those experimental results.",
        "It's going to be really one of the biggest revolutions in science in the last 100 years.",
        "So a negative result would be important, also, if you don't see…",
        "Oh wow, excellent."

        "If it turns out that we do not observe - I mean, not probably in the beginning, but later on when the experiments become better and more accurate - if we don't observe any of those black holes, then we will start constraining those theories a lot, and that will have some important effects, important implications, for how we can understand why gravity is so much weaker than all the other forces.",
        "Because when you think about it, your kitchen magnet is stronger than gravity.",
        "Exactly.",
        "The point here is that you can, you know, you can have a fridge magnet and put it on your fridge, and it will stay there, and you defy the force of gravity that is acted on the magnet by the entire Earth.",
        "So here you have a tiny little magnet that can overcome the gravitational force of the entire Earth.",
        "So gravity is indeed the weakest of all forces.",
        "On the other hand, when we go to really large systems like astrophysical systems, then all the other forces are either - those scales are much bigger than where the other forces act, like the strong and the weak forces, or like electromagnetism, you have the positive and the negative particles that cancel each other, and therefore you don't see any large-scale electromagnetic force.",
        "So it's really only gravity that stays.",
        "That's why cosmology and astrophysics are the main ways of testing ideas about gravity.",
        "Now the meeting in Tucson next week, is any of it open to the public so that the public might hear you guys debate?",
        "Yes.",
        "First of all, for everybody who is here and is really interested, too, and you know, can be happy listening to talks with a lot of mathematics and a lot of equations, of course they're welcome to come.",
        "But there's also going to be a public aspect of it.",
        "Professor James Peebles from Princeton University is going to give a public talk in the evening on Monday evening at the observatory here, where he's going to discuss the expanding universe and current ideas about dark energy and dark matter.",
        "And of course, that is open to the entire public.",
        "When you guys are meeting in closed session, does - how shall I put it?",
        "Do the opinions heat up at all?",
        "I mean, do you have a frank exchange of views, as they say in Washington?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I guess we are people as much as the politicians are, in the sense that in the beginning, the conference always starts happy and polite, and if we are lucky, it will end up the same way.",
        "But there are some situations, of course, where you know, as I said, prejudices are very hard to overcome sometimes, and you know, it comes for an interesting conference.",
        "It comes for an interesting discussion when things get heated up a little bit.",
        "But that's part of, you know, of human interaction, I guess."

        "Okay, thanks.",

        "That's why they feel - we assign to them a gravitational force.",
        "However, there's no exchange of gravitons between them.",
        "On the other hand, if we're talking about gravity as a quantum-field theory, then the only reason that particles interact with each other with gravitational force is because of the exchange of the gravitons.",
