        "Yes, there's a lot of discretion.",
        "The rule is very dense.",
        "It's over 800 pages.",
        "It's very detailed.",
        "And at the same time, it's really vague because it's basically up to the individual officer, as they say in the rule, to weigh the circumstances in totality.",
        "So it does leave officers a lot of discretion.",
        "Now, we've heard a lot about illegal immigration from this administration, but this whole public charge topic is about legal immigration.",
        "So how does this latest change fit into the Trump administration's broader efforts to reform legal immigration to the U.S.?",
        "The Trump administration has repeatedly asked Congress to pass a law that would restrict legal immigration, narrowing it to people who have a higher level of education, certain skills, English ability - what they term merit.",
        "Having more merit would be the main thing that would get people into the country with a green card not family ties and some of the other things in current U.S.",
        "immigration law.",
        "This rule kind of accomplishes the same thing by backdoor.",
        "It's using that same kind of merit definition that someone has to have a certain level of education, a certain income or assets, English proficiency and all these other factors in order to get into the country legally.",
        "So it really is aimed at restricting legal immigration.",
        "How do you see this new rule affecting how much people might be willing to apply for benefits going forward now, benefits like food stamps or Medicaid?",
        "Well, we've already seen evidence in surveys that have been done nationally and in stories in some cities across the country that people are stopping using benefits or not applying for them.",
        "We've seen withdraws not just from programs like food stamps and Medicaid that are listed in the rule, but also other programs that aren't, like Women, Infant, Children benefits and free lunches in schools.",
        "What people are finding is that immigrants are scared.",
        "They're worried they don't understand what this rule is or what it's going to be, and it's being implemented in a context of a lot of other attacks on immigrant populations.",
        "And already we're hearing stories as high as 15 or 20% percent of immigrants may be withdrawing from the benefits that they're eligible for.",

        "But when did you first discover this principle?",
        "Well, I became really interested in this about a decade ago when I was a reporter in Iraq.",
        "And I met a major who had been given this assignment, to stop riots from happening in a town named Kufa.",
        "So what he did is he went down, and he removed all the food vendors from the plazas in Kufa and found that by doing so, he actually broke up the patterns that would cause riots to emerge.",
        "Why, why did that work?",
        "Well, riots actually, you can't tell this from the television, but riots actually take six or seven hours to develop.",
        "What happens is a small group of troublemakers shows up and then spectators and more spectators until the crowd gets so big that it kind of draws everyone into the violence.",
        "But what this guy figured out is that by removing the kebob sellers from the plazas, when the crowd would get to a certain size, and it was 5:30 at night, and people were hungry, they'd look around for food, for dinner, and they'd get hungry, and there was no one there to sell it to them.",
        "So they'd go home."

        "I thought this was so fascinating that when I came back to the United States, I started looking into the research that was available on the science of how habits work.",
        "And what I found was that in the last decade, we've kind of lived through this golden age of understanding the neurology of habit formation.",
        "We didn't work on that kind of research before?",
        "Well, in large part it's because we finally have tools that allow us to see what's going on inside animals' heads when they have habits, right.",
        "In particular, there's a scientist named Dr. Ann Graybiel at MIT who was able to get a whole bunch of sensors into the craniums of rats to watch what was happening inside their head while they would run through these mazes.",
        "And what she found was that as the maze became more and more automatic, as the rat would run from the beginning to the chocolate faster and faster and faster, its brain would start working less and less.",
        "And from that actually came this basic insight, that every habit has three components.",
        "There's a cue, which is like a trigger for an automatic behavior to start, and then a routine and then a routine, which is the behavior itself, and then finally a reward.",
        "And the reward is how your brain learns to remember this pattern for the future.",
        "And for years when people talked about habits, they really focused on those routines, on the behaviors.",
        "But what we know from experiments now is that it's really the cues and the rewards that shape how these patterns emerge and how to change them.",
        "And so what happens between the cue and the reward is a sort of automatic pilot?",
        "That's why, for instance, when people - people can wake up in the morning, and they get into their car, and then they're at their desk at work, and they don't really remember what happened in between, right, they just showed up there.",
        "Things become automatic.",

        "Usually just one officer shows up for a call like that.",
        "It's Sunday morning.",
        "But in this case, two showed up, and that's where this case was already kind of different because she was already in their system as a potential danger to officers.",
        "You can get a sense of that when you listen to this audiotape we now have from the dash cam system on their squad cars.",
        "The two officers are talking with each other about a previous encounter involving her at this apartment."
