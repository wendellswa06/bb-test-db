        "Basically, the talks were supposed to give benefits to the poor countries of the world, the developing economies, like Brazil and India, and they were supposed to give benefits to the first world, to the U.S., to Europe, to Japan.",
        "And neither side was willing to give in before they got their benefits.",
        "And so neither side got their benefits.",
        "Neither side gave in.",

        "Finally, today, they decided to throw in the towel, at least for now.",
        "At least for now.",
        "And the issue, as I understand it, or at least one of the issues, a big one, agricultural subsidies.",
        "This was supposed to reduce tariffs to allow countries, as you mentioned, in Africa, Brazil, India, to export agricultural products more freely to the rest of the world.",
        "Simpler than that."

        "Absolutely.",
        "There was a researcher at Duke University a couple of years ago who tried to figure out how many of our daily actions were habits.",
        "And what she found is that about 40 to 45 percent of the decisions we make each day are actually habits, not really decisions.",
        "And without that, we would go nuts.",
        "Right, if you had to concentrate on backing your car out of the driveway every single time you did it, if you had to concentrate on how to get to work every morning, if when you walked into the cafeteria it was a major decision to figure out what to have for lunch that day, you wouldn't have time to invent fire and video games and all the other things that your brain kind of does while you're doing your habit.",
        "That's the magic of habits is that because our brain stops working around that behavior, it frees up mental activity for other things.",
        "So how do habits get laid down in the first place?",
        "Well, what happens is that you get exposed to this cue, you do something, and it delivers a reward.",
        "And your brain starts to learn an association between that cue and that behavior and the reward.",
        "Take for instance one of the most experiments was one that was done with monkeys, where they would put monkeys in front of monitors, and they would have them touch these colors as they appeared.",
        "And the monkey would get a drop of blackberry juice.",
        "Monkeys love blackberry juice.",
        "So the more and more you did this, the more and more the monkey would just touch the color automatically, without thinking about it.",
        "The habit would get laid down.",
        "And within that monkey's brain, what we know is that certain neural pathways are becoming thicker and thicker and thicker.",
        "It's easier for electrical currents to run down those pathways and trigger that behavior.",
        "Did the monkey continue to need to get the juice in order for the habit to live on?"

        "All the things that used to trigger reaching for a cigarette are gone.",
        "But equally what's really interesting is what your point brings up, which is that we can oftentimes that rewards are rewarding and make them so.",

        "So I would become depressed after talking with my - or become depressed after talking with my friends without realizing why I was becoming depressed.",

        "So I began to write a lot, to the point where I'd write, you know, 2,000 or 3,000 words a day, as well as having a fulltime job and keeping up everything else.",
        "And I started noticing that every time I talked to someone, or I interacted more than just saying hello, I would suddenly dwell a whole lot on whether they had thought something wrong or me or whether I had done something wrong.",
        "Joseph, were you surprised to find out that that's what was triggering your depression, that that was the cue for your depression, talking to people?"
