        "Exactly.",
        "Joseph, thanks very much for your call.",
        "So if you have successfully changed a bad habit or formed a new good one, we want to know about it.",

        "We usually don't think much about the habits that mark the hours of our days: wake up; shower; brush your teeth; put on left sock then left shoe; right sock; right shoe; fasten seatbelt; start car.",
        "But reported Charles Duhigg has learned there is actually a lot more to habits than that.",
        "They're not just thoughtless routines we perform by rote.",
        "Each one is a three-part process, and understanding that process can help us take advantage of that autopilot to our benefit.",
        "He wrote about it in \"\"The Power of Habit,\"\" a popular book that we missed talking about earlier this year.",
        "So we would like to hear from you if you have successfully broken a bad habit or formed a new good one.",
        "How'd you do it?",
        "Tell us your story.",
        "Our number is 800-989-8255.",

        "Charles Duhigg is the author of \"\"The Power Of Habit,\"\" and he's my guest here in Studio 3A.",
        "And Charles, you talk about - you talked about initially the Iraq episode, in which riots were diminished after an American commander chased away the food vendors, and the rioters had nothing to eat, that the process by which crowds would gather, and people would eat a little bit and then riot a little bit was dispelled.",
        "How often do these things actually - does this theory that's developed of cue and routine and reward apply not just to individuals but to groups in the way that you talked about in that case?",
        "That's what's actually kind of the most fascinating about a lot of the research going on right now.",
        "One of the things that we have that we've becoming more and more certain of is that there are organizational habits that function in ways very similar to individual habits.",
        "And in particular what we've learned is that some habits tend to matter more than others.",
        "In the book we tell the story of Paul O'Neill, who most people know as treasury secretary.",
        "But before that he was the CEO of Alcoa, the largest aluminum company in America and in the world.",
        "He came in and transformed that company by saying I want to focus on worker safety habits.",
        "That's all I'm going to focus on is just transforming our worker safety habits because he knew that if he could do that, it would set off a chain reaction that would change the culture throughout the company."

        "And very similarly to the cues, routines and rewards of individual habits, that's how organizational habits work, as well.",
        "There's all kinds of habits within any organization that when you think about them, no one ever writes down, nobody ever says oh, you know, this assistant is the one who can get something done, and if you go talk to this VP, you need to put your request first and not take more than four minutes of his time.",
        "These are organizational habits that emerge that savvy people understand.",
        "Why is that not just saying that a new routine was established or new regulation was put in place?",
        "Why do you put that in the framework of habit?",
        "Because I think what happens here is these patterns emerge without anyone ever necessarily thinking about them, right.",
        "I mean, take for instance there was a sort of famous study that looked at rivalries within companies.",
        "And the big question was for big companies, why don't big companies destroy themselves?",
        "Why don't rivalries for two vice presidents who are gunning for the same job, why don't they try and sabotage each other?",
        "Why don't people try to make money at their colleagues' expense?",
        "And the reason why is because these habits, organizational habits, emerge that say you can be ambitious, but if you're too ambitious, the rest of the organization will rally against you because we all understand that we're in this together.",
        "No one ever sits down and say, OK, here's the line in the sand, you go over that line, all of us are going to take you out.",
        "But there's almost an (unintelligible) habit across and organization, across thousands of people that says this is how our culture works.",

        "Interesting.",
        "...about all those days and nights.",

        "And one group of them they took out, and they explained to them the habit loop.",
        "And they said look, this is what we want you to do.",

        "And then when you come back from exercising, give yourself a small piece of chocolate.",

        "What the researchers hypothesized, though, was for most people, even though they think that they like exercise, their brain thinks that they're a liar, and they hate exercise.",
        "And so in order to make it - in order to make it automatic for them to exercise, they need to get a reward right away that they genuinely enjoy, like a piece of chocolate or a smoothie or a nice long shower.",
        "How are things complicated by actually having a physical addiction as part of a habit, say nicotine?",
        "Well, it's a really interesting question because if you look at the technical definition of addiction right now, it draws in habit dysfunctions.",
        "It's very unclear exactly where addiction begins and ends and habit starts.",
        "So nicotine's a great example, cigarettes, right.",
        "We think of cigarettes as being very addictive.",
        "And they are, they're just not addictive for very long.",
        "According to medical studies, 100 hours after you're having your last cigarette, once the nicotine's out of your blood system, you're no longer physically addicted to nicotine.",
        "But we all know people who two weeks or two months or two years after giving up cigarettes, they still have that urge to smoke every morning.",

        "So Terry, in order - that is pretty big.",
        "In order for it to work, did you just need to go through a period when you didn't have the habit, but you were making yourself do it anyway in order for the habit to be laid down?",
        "Partly yes.",
        "Also I needed to really work - I've always been an emotional eater, and I really needed to work on what I was eating and when I was eating it.",
        "So I kind of bombarded myself with a few new goals.",
        "I'm very big on setting the short-term goals to get to the big goal at the end and wanted my kids to see that also, that that's something you can do in life, and you can get the things that you want.",
        "So I also used my fitness pal, and I'm not trying to be a big advertisement for free apps, but that was very rewarding to me, kind of like the chocolate you were just talking about, because I could plug into that what exercise I had just done, and I ended up getting myself a fitness monitor, a heart rate monitor, and I could really see that working.",
        "You mentioned apps a couple of times, Terry, and I just want to - I'm cutting in so that - just before we pass that, to get to Charles, what about the use of apps and other aids?",
        "Are they helping things out?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean, they're great.",
        "Anything that you do that helps you measure and helps you recognize what's going on is great, right.",
        "So for a lot of people, an app is essentially creating a reward system.",
        "I plug in the mileage that I've done, and it shows back at me that I ran today, or I ran, you know, half a mile more than I did yesterday.",
        "Or people find each other online to go running together.",
        "What we know is that when you can find ways to tell yourself you are doing a good job, to give yourself a reward and then actually allow yourself to enjoy that reward, that is when you start creating habits.",
        "Terry, without the apps, do you think you could have done it?"
