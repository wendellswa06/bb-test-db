        "And so, today, I don't really have a problem with anger at all.",
        "Yeah, I - that's great.",
        "I mean, you know, and a huge part of what we know about how habits work is that there is - is part of it is just learning how much ability you have to change your own behaviors, right?",
        "All these things that look like they're completely impossible from the outside, that I couldn't possibly lose weight, or I couldn't possibly start running a 5k, or I couldn't possibly change my anger habits, that once you learn how much is within your own control, that that actually changes a lot of what's going on.",
        "Does it get easier?",
        "It does absolutely get easier, and we know this from study after study.",
        "You know, during the break, we were talking a little bit about mindfulness.",
        "Mindfulness is actually this kind of insight that is becoming more and more popular in medicine and psychology about trying to understand what is going on right now, sort of living in the moment, to get a little woo-woo in it.",
        "And what's important about that is that we have learned that when people become more mindful, when they start making changes in their life, it starts snowballing.",
        "So I mentioned before these keystone habits, that some habits seem to have more power than others because when they start to change, they set off a chain reaction that changes other habits in their wake.",
        "Exercise is a great example, for instance.",
        "We know that people who start exercising habitually, they tend to start eating better, and that makes sense because, you know, you feel good.",
        "But people who start exercising habitually also start using their credit cards less.",
        "On average, they start doing their dishes earlier in the day.",
        "And that's because when you - for a lot of people, exercise is a keystone habit.",
        "When you learn how to change your life through exercise, something that seems so hard and scary before, it starts causing, even on almost a subconscious level, you to start reanalyzing...",

        "And we became great friends, and then I decided that he'd be a great husband.",

        "And so it started a new habit for him and an old habit for me.",
        "You know - excuse me - one of the things that makes me think, Claire, is one of the reasons why I think this is so important is because for the last 20 or 30 years - I went to business school, and I'm a business reporter.",
        "And for the last 20 or 30 years, there's been a lot of focus, particularly when it comes to psychology or companies, on big strategic decisions, right?",

        "So what you had for lunch today does not matter, but what you have for lunch every day matters enormously for your health and for your energy, for how well you do your job.",
        "And I think that what's really important is that one of the reasons why the science is so exciting, why people are so enthusiastic about it, is because it's helping us remember that small iterative decisions we make every day - like whether we smoke or not and how that influences whether we end up marrying someone - those small decisions, they have huge impacts.",

        "And they can diminish and get smaller and smaller and smaller, but the pathway is still there.",
        "And so there's a thing that's known as the golden rule of habit change, which says if you want to change a habit, what you shouldn't do is just trying the willpower to throw it.",

        "What you should do instead is you should identify those cues in rewards and find a new behavior that corresponds to the old cue, and deliver something similar to the old reward.",

        "That is what the regional president said.",

        "The problem is, you know, have they got enough gas to be able to get into cars to go?",
