        "You know, we think of the north and the Sahara Desert as being Tuareg country, but there are many, many other tribes who live there, the biggest being the Songhai, but there are also the Bella who used to be the slaves of the Tuaregs, and other smaller ethnic groups also live in the north.",
        "They held a meeting, those living in Bamako, the capital, yesterday to say, no. We are - we don't want independence.",

        "...Jacki....of watching the Winter Olympics.",
        "So it's not cut and dried, that because this Tuareg rebel movement - and not all Tuaregs in the north - because they want the Azawad, as they call their homeland, as an independent country.",
        "It's not the whole of the north that wants to secede by any means.",
        "So that is also part of the confusion.",
        "And much of this is being blamed on the ousted president Amadou Toumani Toure, who is in hiding, and who not only the coup leaders, but many other Malians are saying, mishandled the rebellion.",
        "In what way?",
        "They say that when Malian Tuaregs where heading back from Libya where they fought for Colonel Moammar Gadhafi they were not disarmed, and that they have come back to Mali.",
        "And we're talking about hundreds of rebels, come back to army - to Mali with sophisticated weapons, so sophisticated that the Malian army - which has been weakened over the past 20 years - the Malian army did not have the wherewithal, did not have the sort of weaponry that the rebels had.",
        "That's why the soldiers say they have to get rid of the government, because they were being killed.",
        "They were trying to fight the rebellion, but they simply didn't have the resources and sometimes, they say, even food, to be able to fight the rebels.",
        "Now, many rebels are saying the Malian army is hopeless.",
        "How come they abandoned the post and abandoned the people, retreated and have been routed by the rebels - but the rebels are much better armed.",
        "There's also the issue of corruption in the higher echelons of the military and the higher - alleged corruption in the higher echelons of the government.",
        "That those who should have been concentrating and focusing on the rebellion, were too busy stuffing their pockets instead of dealing with the issues.",
        "And it's not just the rebellion, this Sahara Desert area is poorly policed and is vast.",
        "And we're told that there's trafficking of all sorts going up there, hard drugs, people trafficking, smuggling of all sorts, and that this is being perpetuated by al-Qaida allies and so on.",
        "So Mali is in a big mess at the moment.",

        "He was about to step down.",

        "I was here 21 years ago when ATT - he's known by his initials, Amadou Toumani Toure - when he came to power, himself, as a lieutenant colonel.",
        "He was a paratrooper in the parachute commando regiment.",
        "He came to power in a coup d'etat 21 years ago.",
        "He handed that power to an elected civilian government the next year, and he was lauded, hailed, by not only Africa, but the whole world as being a soldier democrat.",
        "He was then elected 10 years later, and as you say, he was meant to be stepping down during elections at the end of the month.",
        "But for those who are pro-ATT, they say he did a good job, and that's mainly people from outside: The White House, France, the former colonial power, many people who were holding Mali up as an example of a stable democracy in Africa."
