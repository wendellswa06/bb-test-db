        "Well, by definition most silks are defined as externally spun protein fibers that come from nature, from various animals in nature.",
        "Most synthetic materials in fiber form really only emulate parts of the properties of silks.",
        "Silks are quite unique in a combination of both high strength and toughness that really to date is quite difficult to match with synthetic approaches.",
        "I see.",
        "So everybody knows about spiders and silkworms, but there's other animals that make silk, right?",
        "Well, there's quite a range, everything from underwater insects that spin their housing, if you will, to stay underwater and survive and reproduce, as well as to many other organisms that spin silks.",
        "So why has silk been hard to re-create in the laboratory?",
        "The silk overall is relatively simple in its chemistry and sequence, but it's a very high-molecular-weight polymer, which makes it difficult to reproduce, and we're only just learning about some of the key domains or regions of the protein in terms of their chemistry and how that relates to the self-assembly and functional material properties that are generated from the protein.",
        "And so I think now that we're armed with that kind of information, we're finally in a position to start to better mimic some of these features with synthetic approaches.",
