        "Exactly.",

        "And, you know, what most economists would say the massive benefit that would have gone to many, many people all over the world is not going to happen now because those small groups of people were able to protect their interests.",

        "I would love to hear your views on how the breakdown of these talks will effect the ongoing campaign to end poverty in Africa, specifically if this will affect any portion of the debt relief program.",
        "This has no direct relationship to the debt relief program.",
        "But what has - a major shift that has happened in people who are advocates of Africa and hoping to bring Africa up - Bono of U2 is a major proponent of this - is the idea that trade will bring far more benefit than direct aid or debt relief, that, you know, for the last 50 years or so developed economies have been pouring money into Africa to very little effect."

        "He won, of course.",
        "What are the similarities and differences to Romney's situation?",
        "Well, in some respects it is really very similar in that Catholics were not very popular among the Protestant majority in the United States in 1960.",
        "And today, if the polls are to be believed, Mormons are not particularly popular among the large group of the American public.",
        "I think there are some differences, however.",
        "The Roman Catholic community was very large in 1960.",
        "And one of the reasons that Protestants were afraid of Catholics is because they were very numerous, but also that gave Kennedy a great resource to draw on, this large block of voters in key states.",
        "You know, fast forward to the present day.",
        "The Latter-Day Saints are actually a very small portion of the population, perhaps a little less than two percent.",
        "So they're not feared in the same way that Catholics once were by Protestants.",
        "On the other hand, outside of Utah, that's not a very large voting block that one could mobilize.",
        "Of course many Mormons have run for statewide office and a few have even run for president.",
        "Has the issue of Mormonism come up in previous election campaigns?",
        "Overall, in recent times when Mormons have been elected at the state, local and even federal level, the question of their faith has really not come up, largely because they've been elected in areas where Mormons are well known and accepted.",
        "But there have been a few occasions in recent times where it has arisen.",
        "When the former governor of Massachusetts, Governor Romney, ran for the Senate before he was elected for governor, that whole question of his faith did come up in that campaign.",
        "I think we're also in a different period in terms of presidential politics, one where there's a great deal of exposure, where we actually nominate candidates through a primary process which can be very competitive.",
        "And so the issue of a candidate's religion is much more likely to come up in this context than it did in the past or than it would at the state or local level.",
        "Let's talk about the Mormon religion and why such a large minority of Americans appears to have such great concerns about electing a Mormon."
