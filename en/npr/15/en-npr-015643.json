        "Well, you know, I think one of the reasons that we may be seeing these sort of negative views in some opinion polls regarding Mormons is because most people don't know very much about the Latter-Day Saints and the few things they do know seem exotic or perhaps even a little troubling.",
        "For instance, in many people's minds polygamy is very closely associated with Mormons.",
        "Historically that was the case, but it has not been for over 100 years.",
        "The Latter-Day Saints prohibit polygamy.",
        "But we've had some prominent television programs, there's been some news about polygamists in the West.",
        "And so a lot of people tend to identify this group about which they don't know very much else in terms of that very unusual practice.",
        "So that's one of the reasons.",
        "Another reason is that Mormons really are a distinct religious tradition, a version of Christianity that has some theological distinctives that set them apart from other Christians.",
        "And certain groups such as the Southern Baptist Convention and some evangelicals take those distinctions very, very seriously and they're very critical of these - of beliefs of the Mormon Church.",
        "So there's also some theological disputes as well.",
        "How do you think this issue is likely to emerge during the election?",
        "Well, the whole question of Governor Romney's faith of course has already come up, because people look at the strategic possibilities for his campaign.",
        "But if past primary elections are any guide, then where this is likely to come up is in a primary where Governor Romney's opponents, you know, want to compete against him.",
        "And questions about religion, because they are often so controversial, often times occur radar, behind the scenes, a whispering campaign rather than openly and, say, on television or in speeches.",
        "And it's a possibility that that kind of effort might arouse certain groups against Governor Romney, because they would have a negative view of his religion.",
        "Thanks very much.",
        "You're very welcome.",

        "Many conservative groups have not embraced Republican Donald Trump for president, yet they are still working to influence the political landscape, and that includes a group linked with the billionaire Koch brothers.",
        "It's called The LIBRE Initiative.",
        "Libre is Spanish for free, and the group is dedicated to spreading free market ideology to Latino voters who have voted for Democrats overwhelmingly in recent years.",
        "Daniel Garza, the group's leader, says it's involved in Senate races such as Nevada and Florida but not involved in the presidential race.",
        "We have not been involved in the presidential race because we feel that there's just a lack of enthusiasm for both candidates.",
        "We don't feel they're - either one is strong on the direction that they're taking with respect to reining in irresponsible spending, reducing the tax burden on people, reducing the regulatory burden who are going to effectively address the issue of Obamacare, advance school choice...",

        "Look, I have to confess, you know, if all things were equal and you had a Latina candidate going up against a non-Latino, you know, candidate - because of the lack of representation in the Senate, I would support the Latina, you know, for Senate.",

        "And on the other side, you have Joe Heck who would reduce the tax burden, the regulatory burden, who would go - who would support a balanced budget amendment, who is supportive of school choice.",

        "Yes.",

        "Now, of course, what that immigration reform is going to look like, you know, obviously it has to be debated, but we feel very confident that that issue is mitigated because of the ideas that he's expressed in the past.",

        "The hardest question - that's a hard question (laughter).",

        "And nothing could be further from the truth.",
        "Look, I give Democrats the benefit of the doubt that they are working for a better society.",
        "And I wish that those on the other side would also give those on the conservative side the same benefit of the doubt.",
        "Has anyone asked you in the Latino community how can you continue to be part of a party in which the largest number of primary voters thought Donald Trump was a pretty good candidate or a great candidate?"
