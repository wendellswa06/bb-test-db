        "Hi, gentlemen.",
        "Thanks for taking my call.",
        "Sure.",
        "Well, I have a very short question, I guess.",
        "I have a lot of vegan friends, and they refuse to use silk because it's a, you know, a kind of an animal product or comes out from insects.",
        "My question was, is there any way to extract silk naturally without actually killing off the insects?",
        "Or do the insects actually have to die in the process?",
        "Interesting.",
        "Okay.",
        "Siri, it's a great question.",
        "In the case of the silkworm, it's, in essence, an inevitable state of their molting process.",
        "So I don't know that you can actually retrieve the silk without the insect going on to the moth state and going to its normal cycle.",
        "I don't have a good answer there.",
        "For the spider, however, you can certainly collect silk, and the spider does fine.",
        "And we and others have used that technique in the lab for many, many years, and this is just called a controlled silking process.",
        "So there's no real harm to the spider in that process, and the spider continues to live further and produce more silk.",
        "Okay.",
        "I think we time for one more quick question, so let's go to Carol in Louisville, Kentucky.",
        "Carol, you're on SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "Hi.",
        "Thank you for taking my call.",
        "Sure.",
        "I'm a surgeon, and I use silk, and as you guys discussed earlier, in many areas of my field of endeavor.",
        "And one thing I've noticed is that silk is, relatively speaking, a permanent suture.",
        "That's why - that - we teach residents, as we're teaching them how to do surgery."

        "But on occasion, we'll have - patients will come in weeks, months, sometimes even years later with little silks popping through their skin.",
        "And we call them spit fistulas, where this kind of opening to the outside comes, and the silk suture works its way to the surface because the patient has rejected something about the silk, and it comes through.",
        "Has there been anything done, or are you thinking about trying to develop a silk that can be an absorbable suture?",
        "Because some of those absorbable sutures are so irritating, and silk, for whatever reason, seems to be one of the least irritating substances that I can use on skin or soft tissue.",
        "Okay, Carol, it's a good question.",

        "There's more to come on DAY TO DAY from NPR News.",
        "Carol, great question.",
        "And so what you're referring to is the silk that's been around forever, and as you probably know, it's generally termed things like black-braided silk.",
        "And that's because the silk is coated with waxes and dyes just for the reason you bring up, because if you don't do it, it would cause irritation in the human body.",
        "And so the way you avoid that but still use the good mechanical and knotting properties of silk is to coat it with waxes that prevent it from irritating the body, and therefore it becomes non-degradable.",
        "And that's how it's defined.",
        "The big breakthrough and why we're even talking today is because around 10 - a little more than 10 years ago, it was realized that if you properly purify the silk, extract out some of the components that cause that irritation, then silk doesn't need to be protected with waxes and dyes.",
        "It's perfectly compatible, and it fully degrades in the human body.",
        "And so these are the kinds of earlier studies that have propelled this new generation of biomedical materials based on silk that are really the same core protein that you're talking about, but a very different process that now leads to materials that are fully degradable in definable lifetime.",
        "OK.",
        "Dr. Kaplan, we have to leave it there.",
        "Carol, thank you for the question.",
        "That was Dr. David Kaplan.",
        "He's Stern Family Professor of Engineering and a professor and chair in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Tufts University.",
