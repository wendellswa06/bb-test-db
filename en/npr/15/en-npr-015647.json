        "Hain is point to a row of trees along a busy boulevard next to the Century City shopping mall in West L.A.",
        "It's where he slept after he emptied his 401(k).",
        "We can't get too close because of construction, but there used to be more trees there, he explains, which provided more privacy.",
        "That was about six weeks ago.",

        "It probably won't kill you, but the pain can last a long time.",
        "At this point in the story, you're probably going, chicken what?",

        "Why should we?",
        "It didn't even exist in the Western Hemisphere a year ago.",

        "Then chikungunya spread like wildfire.",
        "The virus infected large numbers of people in many areas across the Caribbean and in the other regions of Latin America.",
        "That's Doctor Roger Nasci with the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention.",
        "He says that for infectious diseases, what happen in the Caribbean usually happens to the U.S.",
        "because about half of all air travel from the Caribbean ends up in the U.S.",
        "So far this year, about 110 travelers have shown up in the U.S.",
        "with chikungunya.",
        "The good news is the disease hasn't spread beyond these travelers.",
        "The bad news is that Nasci thinks it's only about a matter of time.",
        "Right now it's - we are worried about chikungunya in the United States.",
        "In fact, we expect that over the course of the next months or years, as this virus spreads throughout the American tropics and we see more travelers coming into the U.S.",
        "- that we will see local transmission.",
        "Why?",
        "- because many parts of the U.S.",
        "have the key ingredient for spreading chikungunya, a big black and white striped mosquito.",
        "Yeah, that's the Asian tiger mosquito that people notice when it's there because it bites during the daytime when people are out trying to enjoy their backyards, and they're very aggressive and very noticeable because the populations can be large.",
        "Nasci says there's no need to worry about chikungunya for this 4th of July weekend.",
        "For you to catch it here, you would have to be next to somebody who just brought the virus back to the U.S.",
        "Then a mosquito that bites them would also have to bite you.",
        "With only about 100 cases reported so far, the risk of this happening is very low.",
        "But if you're still worried, Nasci says there's an easy way to cut your risk further.",
        "These mosquitoes - they live in the water in your flowerpot reservoir, the kids toy that's outback that collects the rainwater or the water from your sprinklers, that tire or that bucket.",
        "So if you eliminate those containers, you're going to reduce the number of mosquitoes in your - near your residence, which is going to reduce your risk.",
        "And if the virus does get a foothold here in the U.S., Nasci thinks the outbreaks will likely be small and limited only to summer months.",
        "Even in Florida, mosquito populations go down during the winter.",
        "And, he says, there's something else Americans have going for them."
