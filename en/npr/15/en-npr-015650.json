        "The revelation comes in the wake of news that the DOJ is suing Bank of America for defrauding investors in mortgage-backed securities.",
        "Well, Ed, you know, that's a good point.",
        "But I think there are about five reasons for this, and it's interesting that you played the clip of the Negro League player, because, ironically, it was integration of baseball that has led to the point that we're at now, in that, you know, what the Negro League baseball--that was a cultural institution and the Negro League baseball basically served until about, you know, maybe the mid-'50s, as a funnel, as a pipeline, where a lot of young black kids from, you know, the country, the city, whatever, would migrate to Negro League baseball in large numbers.",
        "They had teams--you know, the whole set-up.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And then what would happen is that you had a huge pool of talent that would flow into major-league baseball, you know, at various minor-league levels.",
        "Once you began to--once you wiped out Negro League baseball--it's like wiping out, you know, like historically black colleges or something, a huge reservoir, a huge magnet of talent was eliminated, a huge pool was eliminated.",
        "And so that was--so integration was a big deal in terms of the power structure, in terms of major-league baseball, but in terms of supplying major-league baseball with a steady stream of African-American players, it was--it sort of led us to the place we are now.",
        "So that's the--sort of a major historic reason.",
        "Mr.",
        "Solomon, I know major-league baseball has a number of programs--incentive programs--to get African-Americans, particularly young African-Americans, involved and interested in baseball again.",

        "Well, like anything else, we have put our--Bill is correct.",
        "We have focused a lot right now on academies we've built in the Dominican Republic and various countries in Latin America.",
        "So right now when we sign players, about 40 percent of the players we sign in pro ball tend to be from Latin American countries.",
        "So what we've decided to do, to turn the tide of this declining number of black Americans that play our game, are to establish programs here in the United States, mostly in urban areas, in an effort to increase our participation in those communities, and then get more talent and more players into our industry.",
        "Bill Rhoden, what's the social implication and the social importance of blacks playing baseball?",
        "Obviously, with the historical reference to Jackie Robinson and all that he did, not only in baseball but for major-league sports, in general, we know that.",
        "But beyond that, what's the importance today?",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "Unfortunately, Ed, it's beginning to lose importance.",
        "You know, what Jackie Robinson meant to major-league baseball and young African-American kids in the '40s, and into the '50s, doesn't mean the same thing now.",
        "There are some kids who don't really even know who Jackie Robinson is.",
        "But one thing I like to say, Ed, in terms of why this is happening, I think Mr. Solomon is correct in terms of having to, you know, offset that by these great programs.",
        "But I think there's some structural things there.",
        "First of all, you're not going to cut into the NBA, NFL.",
        "The conveyor belt systems in those sports, they're too well-entrenched through colleges, specifically through colleges, to ever really catch up.",
        "But also, one of the things that the--that major-league baseball has is its minor-league system.",
        "Minor-league system, I think, plays a tremendous role in putting--keeping things they way they're--maintaining a certain status quo.",
        "You know, the NBA, until this year, didn't have a minor-league system.",
        "The NFL didn't have a minor-league system, so it was talent-driven.",
        "So you would--you could come, in the NBA's case, right from high school, right to the pros, you know, NFL after two years, there was no middle man.",
        "There was no minor-league system.",
        "In baseball, you've got this minor-league system, which serves as sort of a filtering sort of, you know, device, you know, if you will.",
        "So before you even get to the pros, you've got to go to the A ball, AA, AAA, which sort of could filter out, quote, unquote, \"\"head cases,\"\" personality probl--you know, so before you even get to the major leagues, if you're a young African-American player, there are about two, three or four levels of hoops that you've got to pass through to get to the big time.",
        "And a lot of things can happen between the time you get in and the time you get out.",
        "Mr.",
        "Solomon, you buy that?",
        "Well, I really don't buy that.",
        "What I will tell you is that baseball is more of a collection of skills, I think, than many--the other major sports, therefore, we have found that the average college players needs about three and a half years of continued baseball training before he can make it to the majors.",
        "And high school players need about four years, or four and a half years, of that same type of training.",
        "I don't think it's a filtering-out process as much as it is a chance for them to hone their skills, to be able to play at the major-league level.",
        "What I will say, though, is if you look at minor-league baseball, we still don't bring in a lot of African-American players at the minor-league level even.",
        "I told you, we right now sign--about 40 percent of our signees are from Latin America.",
        "And the reason for that is because we put programs--we have 30 baseball academies in the Dominican Republic and another 15 in Venezuela.",
        "And so it's not surprising that we have that--we have a large number of Dominicans and Venezuelans coming into our league every year.",
        "If we do the same things in urban areas, bring baseball back to the inner city--we have a program called the RBI Program, Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities, and we serve about 120 communities across the country, and these urban areas serve about 120,000 kids annually.",
        "In this last draft, we had 31 RBI graduates that were drafted into professional baseball.",
        "Five were in the first round, including the first pick overall in the draft.",
        "OK.",
        "Well, Will, meet Phil Jacknis.",
        "All right, Phil and Jacki.",
        "Today's puzzle is called O-U.",
        "Every answer is a compound word or familiar two-word phrase in which the first word has a long O for its vowel sound and the second word has a long U.",
        "For example, if I said traditional Christmas entree, you would say roast goose."

        "But we saw that change in the NBA where kids just stopped going to college, and that was the filtering system, if you will, the honing of skills system, if you will, for the NBA.",
