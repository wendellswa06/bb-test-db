        "Now, from the South, I was following the ground assault.",
        "Ground troops from the French and Malian armies moved up, and have seized the airport.",
        "So the situation at the moment, Renee, is that the French - with their allies - are controlling the outskirts of the city.",
        "They've set up checkpoints on various access roads.",
        "Now, when you were traveling towards Timbuktu with those French troops, what did you see along the way?",
        "There were a few things that we noticed.",
        "First of all was the very enthusiastic welcome to the advancing French forces.",
        "Certainly up until now, we've been moving through largely black African territory, and the Malian government army is essentially a black army.",
        "It will be interesting to see how that changes as this advance moves further north and we start to move into a more mixed population.",
        "There has, over the centuries, been a lot of mistrust between the black Africans and the fairer-skinned Africans.",
        "And I think that there could be some apprehension among some parts of the population.",
        "Certainly, the Malian army has been accused by Human Rights Watch, and others, of human rights violations.",
        "Now, the other interesting thing that we've noticed was that each town we went through, there were no signs of fighting.",
        "And the local people we spoke to said that the rebels - these jihadist fighters - had simply fled when they heard the French were coming.",
        "And I think that gives some idea of how it's going to be difficult for the French and their Malian allies to really secure this part of Mali on a long-term basis, bearing in mind the ability of these fighters simply to disappear over borders from which potentially, in the future, they could re - come back.",
        "Well, you've really pointed to something that one might be thinking about now.",
        "And that was the French, you know - it had been a colonial power in Mali; it was invited in by the government - a rather weak government - to help push out these Islamist militants that had taken over all this territory.",
        "But the French do not plan to stay, I gather."

        "I think you can fill it with lots of really good things.",
        "So she doesn't feel an emptiness without religion.",
