        "Even in the longer term, it's going to be a pretty small hit on the world oil market.",
        "And so the price reductions we'd see, even five or 10 years from now, from the additional oil would be very, very small.",
        "Obama made the same point this week in Grand Rapids, Iowa, where he said McCain's plan is backed by the same oil interests that helped shape energy policy under President Bush.",
        "Although it won't save you dollars at the pump, I have to say that it has helped raise campaign dollars.",

        "Even in Florida, where voters have been fiercely protective of their shoreline, 60 percent now support more offshore drilling.",
        "Offshore drilling is much more acceptable than it used to be, and it's obvious because of four-dollar gasoline.",
        "Peter Brown, who helps run the Quinnipiac poll, say Americans' frustration with high gas prices gives McCain an opening to address what has been one of his biggest problems.",
        "His biggest problem is that Americans think that Barack Obama is better able to fix the economy.",
        "The potential for the energy issue to give Senator McCain an opportunity to convince Americans that he does know how to fix the economy is very real.",
        "It could very much change the dynamic of this race."
