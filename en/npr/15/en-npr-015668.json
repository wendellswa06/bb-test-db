        "What are some other interesting uses of discarded materials to make this work?",
        "As engineers, we'll spend a lot of time thinking about how we affix antennas to different locations, some of the funny ways that people have figured out how to affix these antennas - 'cause you want them to be as high as possible is to take rectangular oil cans and lash them sideways, using this weird, cantilever rope-knot system that I've never seen before.",
        "You don't expect to see these jerry cans just sticking out of things like telephone poles or power poles, or just the sides of fences.",
        "And then this weird-looking antenna.",
        "It's made out of plywood and chicken wire and it often has plastic bags wrapped around it.",
        "But the weird thing is, you get high-speed Internet off of the stuff.",
        "Now, if I understand this, somebody has satellite Internet connection into Jalalabad.",
        "In effect, all of this is extending access to that to everybody else around the city, fair enough?",
        "Yeah.",
        "We have a fab lab in a suburb of Jalalabad, and we since moved it to the center of Jalalabad.",
        "We had this really high-speed Internet connection and people said, we want to do some kind of project where we also have the benefit of all of these capabilities but spread out in the places where we actually live and work and actually hang out.",
        "Do you find that at the various fab labs that MIT has established around the world, that people in very different places share their solutions and find them applicable?",
        "Or are the conditions really quite unique to one place, as opposed to another, and not so transferable?",
        "Now, that's one of the coolest, most super-exciting things about the fab lab, is most everything that everyone wants to do comes down to just a few basic ideas.",
        "We're going on eight years of having fab labs all around the world.",
        "And despite having not the same language and all different kinds of technical and knowledge backgrounds, we're really able to share and build on projects that everyone else has done.",
        "Well, Amy Sun, thank you very much for talking with us about it.",
        "My pleasure."
