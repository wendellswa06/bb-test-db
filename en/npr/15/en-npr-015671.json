        "For example, if you have a camera viewing a street corner that's sensitive and you want to know if someone's loitering on that street corner or abandons a package on that street corner, the camera can alert the authorities of that event.",
        "Rehayem says cameras can be programmed to alert authorities to just about any activity deemed suspicious.",
