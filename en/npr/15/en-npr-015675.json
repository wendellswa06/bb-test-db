        "Oh, Frank Lloyd Wright.",

        "And so, as long as she was alive, one couldn't, you know, you couldn't write the book, but it was just my dumb luck that I came along with the idea a couple of years after she had died and I was able to get some very frank interviews with the people around Frank Lloyd Wright.",
        "You once wrote, Meryle, that a really successful biographer walks a tight rope between admiring her subject and looking with sympathy on her subject's failings.",
        "In this case, in writing about Frank Lloyd Wright, you were writing about someone that you didn't really admire, you never, in the end, came to like him much.",

        "I'm basing that on you actually say in the book that…",
