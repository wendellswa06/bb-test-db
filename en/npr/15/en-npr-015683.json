        "And it turns out that Bernie Sanders seems to be posing a real threat to Hillary Clinton.",

        "They're actually telling us to--and I hate to use the word--but `dumb down' our tests, do a less-rigorous test, sort of pull back on the high standards that we've had for 20 years.",
        "And I don't think that that is what our citizenry in general would want us to do.",
        "But federal officials say the testing requirements in No Child Left Behind are aimed directly at states like Connecticut, where despite educational success there's a huge achievement gap between rich and poor, white and minority students.",
        "Education Department spokesperson Susan Aspey.",
        "It's unfortunate that the state has chosen to address their achievement gap with a lawsuit that takes attention away from their neediest students.",
        "No Child Left Behind, at its heart, is designed to close the achievement gap and raise student achievement for all students regardless of race or income or background.",
        "And Aspey says the federal government has provided more than enough funding to pay for the additional testing.",
        "The funds have been provided for testing by the federal government, but it appears the state wants to keep the funds without using them as intended and, in other words, their actions would leave half of its students behind.",
        "In May, Connecticut's Legislature passed a bill authorizing the lawsuit.",
        "Despite some misgivings, Republican Governor Jodi Rell signed it and won strong support from teachers at a union conference last week."

        "In New Haven, where nearly 70 percent of the students live at or near the poverty level, the local costs of No Child Left Behind will be another $10 million.",

        "He will also bring to the floor a bill that defunds the president's executive action on immigration.",
        "And that bill does not address DHS funding at all.",
        "It's a way of decoupling the immigration fight from funding for Homeland Security, presumably to avoid a shutdown of DHS.",
        "But Senate Democrats are now saying what they first want is a guarantee that this clean bill will pass the House before they go along with any of this plan.",

        "Now, Juana Summers, you're on the House side, so what does the immigration fight have to do with DHS, and how did we get to this point?",
        "Here is how we got here.",
        "And it's actually something that dates all the way back to December of last year.",
        "If you remember, that is when Congress passed a massive spending bill that funded almost all of the government through September of this year except, you guessed it, the Department of Homeland Security.",
        "Republican leaders split that department's funding off from the rest of the government because they wanted more leverage to challenge the president on immigration when the new Congress began in January - and of course, Republicans having control of both chambers.",
        "But now Republicans have control, and it's still not clear how this stalemate will resolve.",
        "And also, Senator McConnell did vow that there would be no government shutdowns under a Republican Senate.",
