        "He also says he prays that Mr. Obama will be tough on African dictators and asked him to speak out against tyranny in Africa.",
        "So, what's been the reaction to the Archbishop's comments?",
        "The reaction is obviously I think been positive.",
        "I think the only criticism is that for TransAfrica Forum and for some of our partners, we wish that he'd asked the United States government to apologize to the people of both Ethiopia and Somalia for supporting the Ethiopian invasion and occupation of Somalia, which had a disastrous impact on Somalis across the region of the Horn of Africa.",
        "What is the significance of this request, though, for President Obama coming from Tutu?",
        "I think that Desmond Tutu obviously being a wonderful internationally-known, humanitarian, peacemaker, statesman - this kind of request shows the great mantle that President Obama actually has to take up, that people across the globe are looking to him to help the U.S.",
        "right itself, to move from an environment of the last seven to eight years of militarization and bilateral responses to a new place of multilateral engagement, of being not just a leader, but a real partner with people across the globe, and helping them to solve solutions to their own problems.",
        "One last thing on this, it would seem as if this has ratcheted it up sort of, the foreign policy give and take, because if the President - Obama, I mean, does not come forth with - come forward with an apology, that sets up a chain of other events potentially.",
        "This is true, I mean - but the president is in a really difficult situation.",

        "and our ability to say that we are the leaders who run humanitarian efforts, and global good governance is one that needs to be addressed.",
        "But to apologize for Iraq when we're still with many troops on the ground, and we have - there's no solution in sight to the problems that ail that country, I think would be maybe a nice gesture, but what really I think the president needs to be doing is finding a real Iraq policy that gets U.S.",
        "troops out of Iraq, and lets the Iraqi country go back to Iraqis and have them govern themselves.",
        "All right, Roxanne.",
        "Let's move on to another topic, on to the Horn of Africa where last week more than 300 clerics and clan elders gathered in the capital city Mogadishu to demand African Union peacekeepers leave Somalia within 120 days.",
        "Just days later, Somali Islamist insurgents killed 11 AU peace keepers from Burundi in an attack on an AU military base, and today continued fighting has left at least 15 people dead, 60 others wounded.",
        "And against this backdrop you have Burundian and Ugandan AU peacekeepers said to be the only foreign troops still in the city, although there are some conflicting information about whether or not the Ethiopian troops are still there as well.",
        "My question to you is who is in control?",
        "Well, I think right now it's hard to say.",
        "I think it's easiest to say who's not in control and that's the Somali people.",
        "And they are the people who are mobilizing their clerics, mobilizing different factions - both armed and unarmed Somalis to actually say that we want to take control of our country.",
        "One of the things that I think, and all of us debate about what's happening in Somali and the Horn of Africa, and that conversation is missing, that under the Islamist court unions, Somalis actually felt on a local level quite secure and peaceful.",
        "On a regional level, on an international level, and the national level, the government was in shambles, but on a local level where people actually live and work and feed their children, they felt at peace.",
        "And since then as Somalia has been trying to actually - to resolve its national, international role, it's regional role even, in the Horn of Africa, Somalis have suffered.",
        "And so what they see is that, you know, the presence of foreign troops actually is just an exasperation of their problems."
