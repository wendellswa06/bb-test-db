        "So the young grad is looking to go out on job interviews.",
        "You have some tips for the job interview.",
        "Can you tell me about that?",
        "Well, it starts with the resume.",
        "You have to decide what you want to say on your resume.",
        "And before you write the resume, I think it's important to see what kind of job are we talking about here.",
        "There are jobs that actually are for LGBT people - jobs that are advocacy jobs, for instance, lobbying jobs, jobs in gay organizations - where having membership and leadership roles in gay organizations would be helpful and almost necessary to get those jobs.",
        "If you're looking for a job in an organization and you're not sure, then you might want to decide, do you wish to come out as part of the interview process?",
        "And again, that's something that's very personal.",
        "There are some students who say, well, I wouldn't want to work anywhere where I would have to be closeted, and so I want to put it on my resume.",
        "That's fine.",
        "That's their decision to do that.",
        "Others say, I'm not sure that I want to put it on my resume and have a person screening in human resources, perhaps eliminate my resume prior to even getting a chance to introduce myself to the organization.",
        "You say on your website that a lot of people decide not to bring this up during the interview.",
        "They may wait 'til they get the job, when they might feel more leverage.",
        "That's right.",
        "But you also say that someone should be prepared to answer questions in an interview, depending on what's on the resume.",
        "Well, if all their activities - if all your extracurricular activities are in LGBT organizations, it's hard to erase that from your background, because that's a way you can demonstrate that you have shown leadership, organized meetings, managed a budget, things like that."

        "She's been at it for weeks, tamping down the expectations that were so high for her earlier, especially in Iowa where she was assumed to be winning.",
        "So we can expect her to keep hammering away at electability, asking people to be realistic about who they put in the Oval Office.",
        "And hey, you know, with respect to that endorsement by The Des Moines Register, they have gone with underdogs pretty consistently among the Democrats - John Edwards, Bill Bradley, Paul Simon.",
        "And the pattern's been that those candidates then do better than they were expected to before the endorsement of the Register, so let's bear that in mind.",
        "It's probably a net-plus for Hillary.",
        "On the other side of the question, speaking about The Des Moines Register, Marco Rubio was the Republican that The Des Moines Register endorsed.",

        "But how is that affecting him at this point?",

        "She is the very popular freshman senator from Iowa, Republican.",

        "So Rubio is in there to go three, two, one - third place in Iowa, second in New Hampshire and then a big leap to win South Carolina.",
        "That might be a bridge too far, but that's the plan.",
        "So is Marco Rubio, the Florida senator, emerging as the hope of the establishment?",
        "Or is there another candidate that they like and seem to be rallying behind?",
        "The establishment hasn't been able to make up its mind.",
        "But in New Hampshire, the guy who's rising fastest is John Kasich.",
        "And he spent more money in New Hampshire than anyone but Jeb Bush, and in his case - Kasich's case - that money is actually seeming (laughter) to do him some good.",
        "He's a good fit for the Granite State conservatives, and we expect to see him battling Rubio and Cruz for the second place spot there in New Hampshire, especially if Rubio doesn't get the momentum out of Iowa that he's hoping for.",
