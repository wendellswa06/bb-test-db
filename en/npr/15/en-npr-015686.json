        "Well, you know, I think I discovered very quickly, in 1978, that there was no way I could be out and be successful in a career.",
        "It was still a reason that law-enforcement officers were not hired, that they were let go from jobs if they came out - not in every agency, but in most.",
        "And that was the career that I wanted.",
        "So in some ways, it did become second nature, and I just remained hidden.",

        "Well, certainly the employment protection that was added in California - I don't remember exactly which year.",
