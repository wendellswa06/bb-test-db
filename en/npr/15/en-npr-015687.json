        "Yeah, that was 1991.",
        "It was a big deal because we were tired of hiding, and you can't be yourself.",
        "It's not a matter of forcing it in someone's face.",
        "When you're in a job that has - everyone's sharing their family and their stories and their vacations, you feel left out, and it's not a good idea to lie about anything.",
        "So why can't we be ourselves?",
        "So that's why we decided to do it.",
        "I later became promoted to engineer, also became promoted to fire captain, and retired a fire captain in 2008.",
        "So I don't think it hindered my promotional abilities, and San Diego Fire Department was, I think, ahead of their time, and they were really supportive of us.",
        "All right, well, Trisha, thank you so much.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "Beverly Kopf, you have co-produced a documentary on Chely Wright, who got a lot of attention earlier this summer.",

        "But you have your own you're also a lesbian.",
        "Is that right?",
        "Yes, that's right.",
        "And maybe we should just share right here your experiences on the job.",
        "Well, it's been fascinating listening to other people talk about, you know, coming out in the workplace because it is - there's always a risk.",
        "It's your livelihood.",
        "It's your job.",
        "And so I agree with Patricia.",

        "I - when I was hired to be the head writer of \"\"The View,\"\" when we first went on the air...",
        "That's a talk show on ABC.",
        "The ABC talk show, Barbara Walters, and the other executive producer and I made the decision in the interview that I needed to come out because there was no way that I could do my job and help, you know, bring women into the national conversation and create a voice for the show if I was hiding who I was.",
        "So I did that, and that worked out really well.",
        "I have to say it had its challenges, but the rewards and the kinds of issues that we were able to address, I think - was very successful.",
        "In terms of Chely Wright, and this is a documentary that we have been we've been following her for two and a half years through this process, which has been incredibly difficult for someone in country music to come out as openly gay.",
        "It's never been done by a commercial, successful artist.",
        "And what my partner, Bobbie Birleffi, and I discovered, is that there's a reason for that.",
        "And you know, when Patricia was talking about job skills, when you are in the public eye, when you are a celebrity - as Chely is - one of your main jobs is to get people to like you.",
        "You know, that's how you survive.",
        "It's your talent, and it's your likeability.",
        "So when your fan base is conservative, Bible Belt, heartland, military, you -you know, the decision to come out is enormously risky and challenging.",
        "And what kinds of reactions did you document, I mean, among fans and also within the country music industry?",
        "Yes, yes.",

        "But what I can tell you is that, you know, we talk about don't ask, don't tell in the military, and there's a way that that exists in country music and other segments of the entertainment field as well.",
        "You know, people would just want you to go up and do your thing.",
        "They don't want to know, you know.",
        "And they, sometimes they need to really understand what compels a person to come out, to come out of hiding.",
        "And I what makes this to me - and to Bobbie - so extraordinary was a celebrity, someone in the public eye willing to reveal to us her process of hiding, and why she hid, and the terror that she felt in coming out.",
        "And to answer your question, Jennifer, she may have lost a good part of her fan base as a result of this.",
        "And just one other thing about, you know, being in the public eye, you it takes a lot of courage to be willing and, you know, even though people think in the entertainment industry, oh, it's so easy now, you know, it's no big deal, it is a big deal.",
        "And it's a political act.",
        "And you know, it's really an extraordinarily courageous thing for anyone to do.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, as we said, it's not just those in the public eye who really grapple with this.",
        "Let's bring in Jay(ph), who's in San Francisco, California.",

        "...two of my co-workers - or rather, supervisors were lesbians, and we were out to each other.",

        "Yeah, I'm a delivery driver.",

        "Well, again this was back in 2004, so a lot of change from 1978 and I think, you know, looking back on it now, maybe I waited too long.",

        "No, I actually came out to a student.",
        "It was a student in a class who I got a feel for might be gay, and was asking a lot of questions about some of the other work that I do, with hate-crimes prevention work.",
        "And the long story in a short version is, we ended up sitting down, and I just felt that that was the person I could tell, and it just sort of happened.",
        "And everything worked out very well.",
        "It was pretty risky, you know, looking back on it now, but it went very well.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And I think, you know, we talked earlier in the show about the importance of it being a very individual decision, and I totally agree with that.",
        "I think each individual persons circumstances are unique, but its about finding that one person who you can trust, that one person who you know will support you, and starting there.",
        "Its not about throwing a big coming-out party or making a huge announcement.",
        "And maybe it is, as someone suggested, putting a picture of your partner on your desk, or simply engaging in the conversation Monday morning with what did you do on your weekend, and not lying.",
