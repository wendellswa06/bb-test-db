        "Now, Ive really tried to put the people around me first.",
        "And I told each of them that because I came out to each of them separately, and really said if you had any questions, if you have any concerns and I really tried to play down what I was doing, you know?",
        "I really tried to fit in.",
        "But over the roughly 11 years I worked with that organization, I rarely got any negative feedback or heard anything behind my back that a lot of people knew, because I did it so quickly.",

        "Well, its part of her story that she took some time off and actually did not stay with the same music label when she was having her hits in country music, and went instead to an independent label, Vanguard EMI.",
        "And so shes really positioning herself now as a singer-songwriter.",
        "Her latest album is definitely in that genre of singer-songwriter.",
        "And also, she was able to get a book deal with Random House.",
        "And so she came to New York to write her book because she felt that she couldnt really connect to that deeper story that she was telling in the Nashville atmosphere.",
        "So she has a lot of contact still with Nashville, but its not through her, you know, through her label...",

        "I was teaching in the Midwest, in a very conservative school district.",
        "And teaching is one field that definitely it really depends on what district youre in, and what area.",
        "There was another teacher not too far from where I taught, who actually did not come out of work, but he had a union ceremony that somebody from school found out about somehow and word got out and there - the religious conservatives in the area mounted a huge campaign to get him fired.",
        "They sent out some - one person paid for DVDs to be made and mailed to every parent in the district.",

        "They've had wonderfully, horribly bouts of violence, people being kicked out of their homes, they've had, you know, rising food crises, and they just cannot survive.",

        "And they are united with religion and with an international framework, but they're really trying to secure things on a local level, and I think that's very indicative of where Somalia is.",
        "You know, every week on Africa Update, we talk about things coming out of Africa and often times the conversation is like what we've just had with Somalia, and it's very troubling would be the world that I would use.",
