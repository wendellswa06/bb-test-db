        "I understand you were personally involved in drafting Hong Kong's mini Constitution after the handover to Beijing.",
        "What is the rule for when the Chinese military can intervene in Hong Kong?",
        "When the idea was first announced, there are two important conditions.",
        "The first is that we must have democratic elections, all right?",
        "The other one is that China must not intervene.",
        "If Hong Kong government does not request such assistance, it is not proper for the Beijing authorities to think that it is desirable to deploy their troops in Hong Kong and therefore use them.",
        "They can intervene only if the Hong Kong government finds it necessary to have the assistance of the garrison, which is already stationed in Hong Kong.",
        "Do you think that the leadership of Hong Kong can decide independent of what Beijing wants whether military intervention is necessary?",
        "You know, I heard you reporting this last night on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.",
        "The mayor of Sadr City - this is the neighborhood of the Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr - and the mayor saying he's going to try to cooperate with people.",
        "But you know, months ago, back in October, Iraq's national security adviser told me in an interview that the Sadr militia had signed a disarmament agreement.",
        "So we've always had a set of community standards that the public can see that explain, for instance, no harassment, no bullying, no terror propaganda.",
        "But now we're actually explaining how we define those terms for our review teams and how we enforce those policies.",
        "She says users want more openness, which is an understatement.",
        "The company is under unprecedented pressure.",
        "It's been roiled by two years of questions - which news did it promote during the last election?",
        "How widely did it share users' data?",
        "- and more.",
        "Now it is revealing definitions used by internal monitors who check up on complaints about posts around the world, like, what exactly constitutes a genuine death threat?",
        "If it names a person, location or weapon, that should come down.",
        "Or what exactly amounts to hate speech?",
        "Where we have drawn the line is that we will allow attacks or negative commentary about institutions or countries or religions, but we don't allow attacks against people.",
        "So if somebody is criticizing or attacking all members of a religion, that's where we would draw the line.",
        "I wonder if one of the gray areas there might be someone who criticizes Islam but in an extreme way that somebody might argue is inciting people against Muslims."

        "We do try to allow as much speech as possible about institutions, religions, countries, and we know sometimes that might make people uncomfortable.",

        "You can unfollow pages, you can unfollow people, and you can block people that you don't want to communicate with.",
        "How are you thinking about the environment as the 2018 election approaches and, of course, there will once again be lots of political speech on Facebook?",
        "Well, we know there are a lot of very serious issues, and it's important to get them right.",
        "We're focused on combating fake news.",
        "We're also focused on providing increased transparency into political advertisements and pages that have political content.",
        "And we're also investing a lot in our technical tools that help keep inauthentic accounts off the site.",
        "Are you already going after fake accounts in that larger, more specific way in the United States here in 2018?",
        "Yes.",
        "The tools that we have developed to more effectively catch fake accounts - they've improved a lot, and we are using them globally.",
        "We now are able to stop more than a million fake accounts at the time of creation every day.",
        "The publication of its internal standards is another signal that Facebook is having to acknowledge that it is effectively a publisher.",
        "It wants to find itself as a technology company, just a platform for other people's speech, but the founder, Mark Zuckerberg, now accepts some responsibility for what is posted.",
        "Facebook was embarrassed when a famous old Vietnam War photo was mistakenly censored and then put back up.",
        "It's also had to tussle with authoritarian governments like Russia and Turkey that demand some posts be taken down.",
        "Just last weekend, Sri Lankan officials complained to The New York Times that Facebook was not responsive enough to complaints of hate speech.",
        "Monika Bickert says that when pressured by governments, the company at least tries to keep up speech that meets its standards.",
        "What does this announcement suggest about the power your company has?",
        "I think what it suggests is that we really want to respond to what the community wants.",
        "What we're hearing is that they want more clarity, and they want to know how we enforce these rules.",
        "That's why we're doing this.",
        "And we're actually hopeful that this is going to spark a conversation.",
        "But this is also a reminder, you've got this enormous fire hose of speech, maybe the world's largest fire hose of speech, and you can turn that fire hose on or off.",
        "It's your choice.",
        "I want to be very clear that when we make these policies, we don't do it in a vacuum.",
        "This is not my team sitting in a room in California saying, these will be the policies.",
        "Every time we adjust a policy, we have external input from experts around the world."

        "Earlier today, a bomb exploded at the Friday morning pet market in Baghdad; this one day after Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki told parliament there will be no safe haven for terrorists.",
        "The White House praised that comment.",

        "Not yet.",
        "More troops have arrived in Baghdad, but they're not out on the streets yet.",

        "They're leery of their dedication.",
        "Is there any sense that Prime Minister Maliki has kind of gotten somewhere with his comments to parliament yesterday?",
        "Well, he certainly got a vote in support of the new security plan, which includes the additional American troops, which after a pretty turbulent session in parliament yesterday was remarkable.",
        "I mean you had Sunni politicians and Shiite politicians all accusing each other of terrorists, with Maliki jumping in into the fray as well.",
        "It really underscored the ongoing suspicion at best amongst the sects.",
        "But it looks like there is more than just verbiage going on, because in the last few weeks, Iraqi and U.S.",
        "troops have rolled up more than 600 Sadr militiamen, including some key commanders.",

        "Therefore, the chief executive, who is supposed to defend Hong Kong's rights and rule of law and everything, is now completely beholden to Beijing.",

        "Well, that, of course, is the question.",
