        "And they are then programmed for every job description that the company posts.",
        "So they're programmed with, for instance, keywords that they will scan for.",
        "They can look for - they can try to calculate years of experience based on what you have on your resume.",
        "They can look for the names of schools you attended, things like that.",
        "Now, based on the information that the system picks up, it will then score and rank the candidates so that the recruiter can then go into the system, open up, you know, a particular job opening, and they'll see, you know, maybe the 200 applications that they've received for that job, but they're scored and ranked, and they can look at, you know, the top 25, the top 50, however many resumes they want to look at.",
        "So why do they need to do this?",
        "I mean, how many applicants are these companies getting?",
        "A lot.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Even relatively small companies that I spoke to that, you know, post a job on Monster, they might get 400 resumes for a single opening.",
        "And I spoke to Starbucks, and they get 7.6 million job applications every year for about 65,000 openings.",
        "So as you can see, the numbers are enormous, and it's because of how technology has changed job searching.",
        "People now can go to the big job boards, like CareerBuilder or Monster, find thousands of listings, or they can go directly to a company's website.",
        "Often, the company has its own careers page, and people can apply through that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Now, you mentioned that there are some keywords, for instance, that they would look for.",
        "What - do you know what they are, like what are some of these keywords?",
        "Well, they're not standardized for every job.",
        "You know, it depends on the job that you're looking for.",
        "So if you're applying to be a sales manager, the system is going to look for words like sales and manage.",
        "If you're applying to be a statistician, it will have that word, although one expert I spoke to said there's a good chance that if you call yourself a numerical modeler on your resume, it is not going to pick that up even if that is basically being a statistician.",
        "So, you know, the system - the point that was made to me over and over again are that the systems are only as good as the people who programmed them.",
        "So a company needs to do a very good job of making the keywords that they enter narrow enough to make the recruiters' job easier but also broad enough to capture the qualified candidates."

        "people and recruiters I spoke to said that, you know, they're sure that they do as well.",
        "It's because, you know, people who were trained on how to write a resume may be 10 years ago.",
        "We're often told to use creative descriptions, use active verbs.",
        "You know, they were told to kind of stand out in that way with the assumption that a human being was going to be the first - yeah - the frontline of looking at your resume.",
        "They weren't trained to write a resume that a machine was going to be looking at first.",
        "And so, you know, unless you sort of game the system to a certain extend by basically mimicking the job descriptions very closely.",
        "And then there are few other things that you might be able to do to, sort of, increase your chances of getting through the machine.",
        "You know, there are a lot of people who are probably getting kicked out of these systems who are very qualified.",
        "I mean, I spoke to a number of job seekers who said, I don't even know if these jobs exists, you know, where they spend an hour, really, customizing their resume for a job, and then they never hear a word back.",

        "We're talking with Lauren Weber of The Wall Street Journal about resumes and software that can send your resumes straight into a black hole from which it will never return.",
        "And we're wondering, what people have done to get around this kind of thing, what they've done to get noticed by employers, knowing that there are so many people out there looking for jobs.",

        "We're at 800-989-8255, if you would like to join the conversation.",
        "I'm wondering, you mentioned in an article you wrote about this, Lauren, that even the order of the words or the order in which you put down information can have an affect on whether it gets bumped out or whether they'll take a look at it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Again, it really depends on how the system has been programmed.",
        "One expert I spoke to said, sometimes these systems are just too stupid to catch everything.",
        "In other words, if they have been programmed to only look for a certain order of things, like first you name the company, then you have the years that you work there, and then you have your title.",
        "If it's not programmed broadly enough to be able to pull out that information, no matter where it is on the resume or how it's presented or formatted, then, you know, again, you might be end up in the black hole or end at the bottom of the ranking system.",
        "And so some of the advice that people gave was, you know, make your formatting as simple as possible, as clean as possible.",
        "You don't want to get cute with graphics or anything like that could confuse the system.",
        "Now, we've been asking people to call in and tell us what they have done to get noticed, or how they've gotten a company to give an interview, for instance.",
        "Again, you can call 800-989-8255.",
        "But we have an email here from Daniel(ph) in Georgia, who says: I use words from the job description and requirement.",
        "So he goes to the job description and deliberately takes out words that he sees there, figuring that that would, you know, that would work with this.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That is really the trick.",
        "I mean, unfortunately, again, you just want to not try to be creative at all.",
        "You want to mimic the job description pretty closely.",
        "But actually, the key words that can work might even go beyond that.",
        "For instance, if a company has a very strong culture, let's say it's a company with a professed commitment to environmental values or something like that, that might not be part of the job description for what you're applying for, but it might - they might have programmed key words like..."
