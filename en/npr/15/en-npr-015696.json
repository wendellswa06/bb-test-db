        "Baseball teams are really owned by the community and the fan base, and so forth.",
        "With that said, I've been a baseball fan and lover of the game since, really, as long as I can remember.",

        "Of course, their success rate identifying great young men and women and supporting them so that they graduate from college is phenomenal, to the high 90 percentile.",

        "So I learn to visualize in my mind, say, a house, my own home, someplace I'm very familiar with, and as I'm trying to remember numbers or images that have nothing whatever to do with my house, I mentally park them in places, associate them with very vivid images that I have in my mind.",
