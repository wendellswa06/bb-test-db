        "Well, after a year of preparation, working out, improving your memory, you go to the U.S.",

        "People make math errors, people transcribe their Social Security wrong, people don't sign the check that they send to the government.",
        "The best thing people can do is electronically file a return.",
        "Therefore, they'll be using software, they will have the math done for them, it'll double check to make sure all the information is there.",
        "The information will get to us, will get straight into our computers.",
        "And if you're getting a refund, like most Americans do, that refund will come to you quicker.",
        "And I'm just beginning to worry about - I sensed a couple of certified envelopes offered later today and I'm wondering if I got the right check or the right envelope.",
        "Oh, yes, that's another common thing.",
        "By the way, IRS has what they call the Free File Alliance.",
        "You can find it on their Web site.",
        "And that they figure that more than 80 percent of the population that files can actually get their returns done free electronically using the members of the Free File Alliance.",
        "So, you know, you may want to try that.",
        "And if you go to the Free File Alliance Web site, you can probably even get your extension filed online for free and get the electronic receipt.",
        "So, again, that's just available to anybody for free as the Web site?",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, you know, some people may not qualify.",
        "There are probably about 15 members of the Free File Alliance.",
        "They have different income levels.",
        "I think there's an income level of about 56,000 on the general Free File Alliance."

        "But if you pass through that a little bit, IRS has their own forms that you can file - fill in and file directly.",

        "But anybody at all can use that.",

        "Oh, God, yes.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "Yeah, you don't have the math errors.",
        "If you transpose the Social Security number, your return is going to get rejected so you can fix it.",
        "The other thing that happens when you file electronically is - believe it or not, a lot of people are having their refunds grabbed by IRS, which is the master collection agency for the country.",
        "They'll collect for states, for Social Security and student loans.",
        "You're going to get a code and information when you file electronically that tells you if IRS is going to grab all or part of your refund.",

        "Could be, but I don't think so.",
