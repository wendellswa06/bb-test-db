        "So I was a contributor to his African - I mean, to his \"\"Dictionary of American Negro Biography\"\", and I was always very interested in this idea of biography and the individual in history.",
        "When Professor Gates asked me to work with him, he and I both drew up a long list of names that we looked in the \"\"American National Biography\"\" for and couldn't find many, many names that appeared in the \"\"Dictionary of American Negro Biography\"\" that Rayford Logan and Michael Winston had coedited.",
        "And the truth of the matter was that many of the names in the \"\"Dictionary of American Negro Biography\"\" were very prominent names in the nation.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Another person you met as a child was Carter Woodson.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And he is of course a famous educator himself.",
        "Bur nevertheless, isn't there a quote by him?",
        "I drive past a wall here in Washington, D.C.",
        "with a quotation from Carter Woodson on it almost everyday.",
        "And it says, we don't need separate African-American history, we need American history to incorporate African-Americans fairly without bias.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Yes, that's a good quote.",
        "But he had so many wonderful quotes.",
        "And one of his quotes - because it was used in my home all the time - was that we work to refute the lie that the negro has no past, that he has made no contribution to American history, and that he has no past worth respecting.",
        "I think he devoted his life to identifying what the African-American contribution was.",
        "So in order to do that, obviously, he had to understand where black people fit into the larger American narrative, but at the same time he had to pay explicitly attention to the contributions that black people played not only within the larger nation, but within their own community.",
        "You know, Neal, you can't inform the shape of the center unless you explore and explicate the margins.",
        "And that's what Carter Woodson did.",
        "I mean, after all he was trained at Harvard.",
        "The second African-American to get a Ph.D. in history in 1912 after the great W.E.B.",
        "Du Bois.",
        "But he went on to found Negro History Week, which became Negro History Month, which became Black History Month, which became Afro-American History Month.",
        "And now, it's African-American History Month.",
        "I think in 20 years, Neal, it's going to be Neo-Nubian History Month."

        "But remember, you founded the association for the study of Negro life in history as it was called then, so he was very explicit about studying the contributions of black people themselves.",
        "And one of the issues that we faced in doing this project was the idea that maybe what we should do is to just really try to augment the American Negro Biography - I mean, the \"\"American National Biography\"\"…",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "…with African-American names.",
        "Just populate it with African-American names.",
        "But what we realized is that we discovered thousands upon thousands of names, and it didn't - it just wouldn't have been feasible to take so many thousand names and put in into the American Negro - into the \"\"American National Biography.\"\" We would have been overrepresented as a population within that.",
        "Lisa, thanks very much for the call, appreciate it.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "The other thing is that all of these names that we've published - mm-hmm, excuse me - all these biographies that we published will be online through Oxford University Press, which also publishes the \"\"American National Biography,\"\" and the British version, which is called \"\"The Dictionary of National Biography.\"\" So then - and in the digital world, there is a seamlessness - a seamless relationship among the collections.",
        "So that each one is separate.",
        "The British is a separate.",
        "the American biography is a separate.",
        "the African-American biography is a separate only because you organized them that way.",
        "As soon as you push another button, they're all integrated.",
        "So it's like having your cake and eating it, too.",
        "That's the good thing about working with Oxford University Press.",
        "In fact, Oxford has started the African-American Studies Center, which is the largest online database in history of over a dozen major black reference works including the \"\"Africana Encyclopedia,\"\" which Kwame Anthony and Appiah - Kwame Anthony Appiah and I edited just a few years ago.",
        "So we are integrating all of these 4,080 African-Americans into the larger database of important biographies of British and American lives.",
        "But we also are making them accessible separately because there was a vacuum of these names."
