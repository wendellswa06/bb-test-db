        "And when you're in a big stream that's about two feet deep, even though with a GPS, you're not going to get out of there for a couple of days because of the way they have to crawl.",
        "And that's what kind of got me thinking, maybe they aren't just holding their breath when the water gets high, but that they're actually able to go under the water, as well as stay above it.",
        "And that's actually what makes them truly remarkable.",
        "Yeah, I was going to ask.",
        "I mean, what's the difference between this caterpillar and like a frog that can live on land or in water or, you know, a damselfly or certain nymphs?",

        "So - or the lack thereof.",
        "A damselfly as a nymph, has to be underwater.",
        "If you take it out of the water, it's going to literally suffocate like a fish and die.",
        "Conversely, a frog likes to take a dip.",
        "But if you put a frog in a tank and put a glass over it, most of them will die eventually.",
        "You know, some of them can last a little bit longer than others, but they need air, they have lungs.",
        "And these caterpillars have refused to commit one way or the other, or for some reason, been able to evolve a way to avoid being just underwater or just on land.",
        "And they're able to hang out on dry rocks, graze algae and lichen happily, and then as it happens frequently in Hawaii, we get heavy rain and the streams will rise several feet.",
        "And if you're a little caterpillar, you've got to hang on.",
        "You can't just swim to the surface when the water is raging like that."

        "Absolutely, yeah.",
        "We call them the torture experiment.",
        "And we'd get a 10-gallon tank - and I did this several years ago because I really just couldn't believe it.",

        "And they really just didn't seem to care.",

        "And he did.",

        "Well, all insects - that's a great question.",
        "All insects have a, sort of a different way of breathing than the lung and gill thing that vertebrates use.",
        "They have spiracles all along the sides of their body.",
        "So if you wanted to suffocate an insect, you couldn't put your hand over its mouth.",
        "It wouldn't work, because it's literally breathing through holes that are regularly spaced along the entire body.",
        "And it has what you would call, I guess, a direct respiration system, which is trachea and little tracheoles, which in humans would be something like capillaries and blood vessels, that get smaller and smaller, and literally put almost every cell or every other cell in the insect's body in contact with the atmosphere to exchange gas.",
        "So that's the game plan when you're above water.",
        "When you're below water, insects will develop gills that increase their service area for gas exchange or specialized other structures that help them mediate that gas exchange between the water and their bodies and their metabolic needs.",

        "I can tell you what they don't do, because we keep looking for evidence of gills.",

        "We've looked for modifications that would suggest something that they were doing and we haven't found it.",
        "And so I've come to, sort of, the last gasp, which is they're probably breathing directly through their skin.",
        "What...",

        "Right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And there is some precedence for gas exchange through the skin in other animals, but to be wholly dependent on that, that's kind of a different story.",
        "We do have a little bit of evidence for that, which is maybe anecdotal.",
        "And that is the first time I collected these caterpillars in the water, I put them in a tub with a little rock on it in my apartment and I went out for the afternoon.",
        "And the next day, I noticed a horrible smell and all the caterpillars had died.",
        "And I realized that this was a tub of still water.",
        "And what it turns out is, is that these caterpillars need water with very high level of dissolved oxygen.",
