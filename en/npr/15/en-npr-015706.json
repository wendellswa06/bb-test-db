        "Yeah.",
        "And these shells, right?",
        "Exactly.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And maybe the best way to think about it is something like a hermit crab.",
        "These caterpillars spin a silk case that they hide out in.",
        "And they just peak out their head and their first six legs and crawl along with those while using the abdomen to hold the case in place.",
        "So, yeah, they're quite conveniently packaged to cruise around underwater.",
        "But I don't think that that case is the secret to their success because the 12 species that we've identified in that paper are part of a much bigger group with probably well over 400 species, most of which overwhelmingly are terrestrial.",
        "So they all carry cases, these guys are diving with the cases but other ones can't do that."

        "But all of them also have sister species, that is cone cases, bugle cases and burrito cases that don't dive, that can't go underwater.",
        "So it has to be something more than just the case that they have that lets them go underwater.",

        "This group that includes these aquatic caterpillars also has a bunch of other wacky species in it that are also hyposmocoma, one of them attacks and eats snails.",
        "And so there's a bunch of species that do that that are all related.",
        "But Hawaii is the only place so far on the planet that has a caterpillar that attacks snails.",
        "There's another one that bores into rotting wood and eats rotting wood.",
        "So these guys have really become - each species has developed into a different, sort of, niche, if you will, and they've become a jack-of-all-trades.",
        "Hmm.",
