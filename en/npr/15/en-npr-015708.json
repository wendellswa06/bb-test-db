        "They refused to let the so-called morning-after pill be sold without a prescription before hearing the recommendation of their own scientists.",
        "Those FDA scientists concluded the drug, known as Plan B, is safe for over-the-counter use.",

        "Our pharmacists are required to get our guests' prescriptions filled.",
        "In the rare event a pharmacist beliefs conflict with filling a guest prescription for the emergency contraceptive Plan B, our policy requires that our pharmacist take responsibility for ensuring that that prescription gets filled in a timely, respectful manner, either by another Target pharmacist or at a different nearby pharmacy.",
        "What if there isn't another pharmacy nearby?",
        "Most Targets are in metropolitan, suburban or urban areas, so, you know, there's very likely to be another pharmacy very close by.",
        "Well, that's not good enough for pro-choice groups like Planned Parenthood who say Target's policy is still too onerous.",
        "The effectiveness of Plan B declines the longer a woman has to wait to take it, and so they say having to wait to go elsewhere is unacceptable.",
        "Planned Parenthood has been waging a campaign to get stores to clarify their policies about pharmacist refusals.",
        "On its Web site, the group gives companies a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down rating.",

        "Karen Pearl is the interim president of Planned Parenthood.",
        "We have worked with a lot of pharmacists who understand that there may be somebody in their store who does not want to fill a prescription, but each of them--Kmart, CVS, Costco--have come forward and worked out a plan for a woman to get her prescription filled in-store without delay.",
        "And we wonder why Target can't do the same.",
        "You know, this is basic health care for women.",
        "And corporations should be standing behind the women who've come into their store who want access to birth control.",
