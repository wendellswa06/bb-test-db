        "Yeah.",
        "Actually, it's pretty close.",
        "It's surprising.",
        "The results are - if you look at age groups, for instance, age 18 to 29, about 30 percent favor, 51 percent oppose; and ages 30 and older, it's 30 and 52 percent respectively.",
        "So in the services, they are vary somewhat by service, I should say.",
        "You see the greatest number of folks who favor repeal in the Navy followed closely by the Air Force, the greatest opposition, pardon me, in the Marine Corps and then the Army.",
        "Over 30, by definition, you're either a senior noncom or an officer?",
        "I don't know if by definition, but you're pretty close to it, sure.",
        "Pretty close to it.",
        "And that's our readership - I mean, our readership is basically midgrade NCOs and noncommissioned officers and officers.",
        "So is a scientifically conducted poll or was this a poll of your readership?",
        "This is a poll of our readership.",
        "I see, so its - okay.",
        "That's - that makes a - I guess, could make a difference in terms of how you measure the overall military, but nevertheless pretty interesting.",
        "So was there a question that if ordered would you implement this policy?",
        "The - well, that question was that asked?",
        "What I could tell you is that, first of, anecdotally, without question, everyone I talked to, you know, focus groups and in one-on-one interviews said absolutely.",
        "I mean, even folks who are diametrically opposed to having gays in the military said, hey, you know - as one lieutenant colonel told me, a Marine lieutenant colonel, he says, either you're all in or not..."

        "So everybody would be asked if they were a homosexual, and if they were they would not be allowed to serve in frontline units?",
