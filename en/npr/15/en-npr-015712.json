        "Why is that important to you?",
        "I think it's important, well, not only for me but I think it's really important for warriors and veterans like myself to be able to know that we can still do the same things we did before or new things that we never tried before.",

        "Lost this one just below the knee, and this one was blown off around the knee cap, then I lost the rest of leg and my hipbone to infections.",
        "Does learning how to ride a bike all over again this way mean something to everything else you've got ahead of you?",
        "Yeah, it's a chance to start over, just learning the same things you used to learn but in a different way.",
        "Still be able to do everything you could do before."

        "Target says the company must allow pharmacists to refuse to prescribe the drug under the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for their employees' religious beliefs.",
        "But Target's religious accommodation applies only to this one drug, says spokeswoman Lena Michaud.",
        "Because we understand some people perceive this drug differently and some people believe that it conflicts with their religious belief.",
        "But that's not the only drug the conflicts with people's religious beliefs.",
        "Possibly not, but this is the one that we've kind of carved out, and I'm not going to go into the detail behind the decision-making process around this, but I can simply confirm that this only applies to Plan B, and that we will still ensure that every Plan B prescription that comes to our store does get filled, even if in rare instances it's by a different pharmacy.",
        "Many states are considering legislation on the matter, but only eight have formal laws: four states explicitly ordering pharmacists to fill every prescription and four letting pharmacists opt out if they have religious or moral objections.",
        "And as to why now, why have pharmacists' refusals been in the news recently?",
        "Well, one women's rights lawyer says that with all the controversy over the FDA refusing to allow Plan B to be sold over the counter, more people are now aware of the drug.",
        "More women now know there is such a thing as the morning-after pill, and so they're asking for it, and the more women ask, the more conflicts there are with pharmacists who don't want to dispense it.",

        "It's been a long and decidedly nasty campaign that could end 12 years of Republican control in Congress, which would mean that Democrats would control the agenda in one or both Houses: name the chairs of powerful committees, decided which bills come up for votes and when, call witnesses to appear at hearings and hold the power to subpoena those reluctant to testify."

        "So the polls seem to be all over the place, although more seem to be indicating a tightening - at least good news, for the Republicans.",
        "And that tends to be the way elections mostly go, except when they don't.",
        "Well, I would kind of think that at the end, you know, given the fact that this has not been a good year for the Republican Party, certainly with the War in Iraq and President Bush's stewardship of it, I would think that undecided voters may, at the end, say look, you know, let's try something new.",
        "We've seen what it's been like the last two, four or six years, going back to the beginning of the Bush administration, maybe it's time for something different."
