        "Well, I don't know about safely, but certainly Conrad Burns, who is the lawmaker who has taken - the Republican lawmaker who has taken more money from Jack Abramoff, the convicted lobbyist, than any other member of Congress, was certainly trailing the Democratic nominee, Jon Tester.",
        "But the latest polls show that - and the Republicans have been hammering Tester as a taxer and spender who will, you know, raise your taxes, and it seems to have made a difference.",
        "I'm not convinced that Burns hangs on.",
        "There has been a Democratic trend in Montana.",
        "Tester's been a pretty good candidate, but again that race has certainly narrowed.",
        "And so - also fascinating the other way is Virginia, the fact that that may be dead even.",
        "You know, this was a George Allen gimme for the longest time.",
        "Then, you know, things that he said, the missteps that he made, made it much closer.",
        "But he has not been able, apparently, to regain his footing, and it's really, really close coming into the final days.",
        "And New Jersey, which again some thought might be a Republican opportunity to take away a Democratic seat, that also looks like it's - at least according to the opinion polls - going to stay in Democratic hands.",
        "In a normal year, Tom Kean, Jr., would have a very good chance of winning the seat, even though it's been over 30 years since the Republicans won a seat, a Senate seat, in New Jersey.",
        "But the fact is Bob Menendez, the appointed Democratic incumbent, has much more money.",
        "But most important, he has the issue of Iraq.",
        "Iraq is extremely unpopular everywhere in the country, especially in New Jersey, and it's helping Menendez.",
        "We're going to check in on one of those key Senate races now.",

        "It wouldn't affect her waitressing wages directly, but Claire McCaskill, the Democrat in this Senate race, is very much four-square behind the minimum wage, and that's important to Margaret.",
        "Jim Talent, the Republican, never really said where he stands on this issue.",
        "Another voter here, Gloria Ewell(ph), also an independent voter - she was saying that using the word change quite a bit, as you're hearing Democrats say the word change quite a bit in the weekend news shows - that she wants to see a different direction in Iraq and hopes to see a different type of U.S.",
        "Senate that'll give this country a different direction there.",
        "And I just wanted to bring Ken Rudin in here.",
        "The previous election -two years ago, Republicans thought that putting the question of gay marriage on the ballot in a lot of states would bring out their supporters.",
        "Democrats hope this time, by putting issues like minimum wage and stem-cell research on the ballot in some states, they might do the same with their base.",
        "Right, and Missouri's a perfect example for that, because as Steve knows, you know, the stem-cell research issues on the ballot - Claire McCaskill, the Democratic nominee, has been four-square for it from Day One, and Jim Talent has waffled on it a little bit.",
        "Ultimately, he came out against it, but there seems to be some kind of hesitation in his dealing with that issue.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "And I wanted to ask you, Steve Kraske, both sides trying to motivate their base supporters to get out and cast their ballots tomorrow.",
        "Are they splitting left and right here?",
        "You know, it's not clear yet exactly how they're going to split, Neal, in a race this close.",
        "The polls don't pick up these sliver changes in a race like this.",
        "But just to jump off of what Ken was just saying, you hear the phrase stem-cell research almost as often in Missouri these days as you hear about the war in Iraq, that voters are very much in tune with where McCaskill and Talent stand on stem-cells.",
        "And that's a pivotal issue in this state because as Ken just said, it is a constitutional amendment ballot initiative that's gotten just huge attention here.",
        "As much money spent in advertising on stem-cell research in Missouri as on the candidates for the U.S.",
        "Senate themselves.",
        "Just absolutely amazing campaign."

        "Any predictions again on the McCaskill/Talent race?",

        "But what's more important that I don't understand is why there's been so much concentration on the president in a congressional election when the leadership of the Congress has, you know, things like the Mark Foley incident and nobody really says anything about that, and Tom Delay, and they don't say anything about that.",
        "But then they're concentrating on comments that John Kerry made and, you know, who the president is and isn't supporting.",
        "It would seem to me they need to really be careful with - especially the Mark Foley incident - because according to the way I read the law, that could even be child abuse.",
        "And I think they really need to look at those types of issues.",
        "Just to clarify, Jim Web, the Democrat there, and George Allen, the incumbent Republican.",
