        "Charlie Bass the Republican incumbent.",
        "Correct.",
        "And I'm just wondering if you could comment on the race here in New Hampshire - very, very tight race and I just wanted to know your thoughts.",
        "Well, this is another good example of what's happened to the Republican Party.",
        "Two years ago Bass beat Hodes by 20 points.",
        "And this year - the last time I looked at a poll, Hodes had a five-point lead in the polls.",
        "My gut tells me that Bass holds on, but again, New Hampshire's become a more and more trendy Democrat.",
        "You have a very popular Democratic governor, John Lynch, who will win overwhelmingly tomorrow.",
        "And really, Bass is considered pretty vulnerable.",
        "And he's not - you know, he's not an ideologue, he's not an ultraconservative.",
        "He's a mainstream Republican, but maybe that's not good enough to survive in the Northeast anymore.",
        "He just tends to vote with the president, you know, at every turn, and I think that that's probably his biggest downfall, unfortunately.",
        "That could be a tough race - a close race.",
        "Ted Robbins is our correspondent based in Arizona, where he's been following that state's closest races, and Ted joins us now from NPR's office in Tucson.",
        "Nice to have you on the program, Ted."

        "What are you hearing from people on the ground there?",
        "Well, I am smack-dab in the center of that district right now.",
        "If the stars aligned, Randy Graff could win, and mainly because his supporters are - I mean, the saying is that they would crawl on glass to vote for him.",
        "They are - they're his core voters on that one particular issue.",
        "But his opponent , Gabriel Gifford, is a fairly moderate Democrat and this is a fairly moderate district and all the polls show her up about ten percent - ten points rather.",
        "And I think she's going to take the district.",
        "And basically what you hear around here is that Graff is either a one-issue candidate, which is exactly how his opponent wanted to paint her - or paint him, the other way around - getting my genders mixed.",
        "Or you just basically hear that he's too conservative for the district.",
        "There's also…",
        "In other words, the race was decided in the Republican primary.",
        "Where Ken, I remember you reporting to us, a Republican candidate who people thought could win in the general but it turned out he could not win the Republican primary.",
        "Right.",
        "I don't think we pointed this out that this is a Republican district.",
        "Jim Colby, who is retiring, refused to endorse the Republican candidate, right Ted?",
        "Yep, it's - it's about 39 percent Republican, 34 percent Democrat - so it's sort of a classis swing district and 27 percent independent - so…",
        "You know, let… Jim Colby is always - and let's not stop now - identified as the only openly gay Republican in Congress.",
        "And he may, in fact, be retiring just so he doesn't have to hear that anymore."

        "And they'll be decided, I suspect, in the Phoenix area, where the majority of voters are.",
        "And those are to deny bail to illegal immigrants or undocumented immigrants who are accused of serious crime; to deny punitive damages to any undocumented immigrant who brings civil suit; to deny in-state tuition to any undocumented immigrants who are residents; and to make English the official and only language on the ballot.",
        "And the only one of those that seems to be even close is the in-state tuition.",

        "It's fascinating.",
        "I mean, there has virtually no money spent on it, and it's way lower profile than four years - two years ago, rather, when the proposition 200 to deny certain benefits to illegal immigrants passed about 54 to 46.",
        "Hm.",
        "There was a time when Democrats thought John Kyl - the Republican incumbent senator in Arizona - might be vulnerable.",
        "How is that looking?",
        "The polls that I see have Kyl up anywhere from five to 13 points.",
        "And I think - well, now, Jim Pederson - who is a real estate developer and former head of the state Democratic Party - is running against Kyl.",
        "And I think if he has any chance at all, it's because people are voting against John Kyl, not for Jim Pederson.",

        "He's brought in Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, anybody he could - all the big Democratic guns.",
        "And he has spent 8 to $10 million of his own money on the race.",
        "And basically, they both spent to same - they both have the same amount of money, about $12 million.",
        "The difference is Jim Pederson has money, John Kyl has friends with money."
