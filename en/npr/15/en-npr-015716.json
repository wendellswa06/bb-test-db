        "The married Jim Gibbons denies it.",
        "He said he was just trying to help her, he wasn't trying to do anything to her.",

        "Republicans are in trouble there.",
        "You know, we talk about historically Republicans' areas on Nevada, and that's true, but you have Jim Gibbons' House seat, which he's giving up, which is hotly contested.",
        "You have John Porter, the Republican Congressman in the 3rd District, hotly contested.",
        "You know, and the Republican Party has never been crazy about Jim Gibbons running for governor too.",
        "The departing Republican governor, Kenny Guinn, plainly doesn't like him.",

        "So I think nationally people have been looking at this state as being a toss up.",
        "Of late it's been considered maybe it's going to go in the Republican column.",

        "Well, there are a lot of issues that have come to importance when you're talking to the voters.",
        "People have certainly brought up the war in Iraq, and Harold Ford certainly talks about that quite a bit.",
        "But the fact of the matter is, Harold Ford has run as a moderate and on some very sort of hot button - some issues that people might consider traditionally Republican values issues - Ford has been not easy to pin down as a liberal.",
        "He voted for the war in Iraq, he votes for - supports bans on gay marriage, extending tax cuts.",
        "And so you're in a situation where both candidates have some similar ideas on - or some similar stances on some key topics and that leaves the personal.",

        "He's got a family with a lot of sort of political scandal in the history, even though they're a big political dynasty in Memphis.",
        "And you've been hearing a lot of conversation about how much each man prays per day, or them talking about their faith constantly.",
        "There's a lot of negative ads sort of attacking each other's - or specifically Harold Ford's - character.",
