        "Yeah, he's on the ropes.",
        "A lot of polls have showed the challenger, Bob Casey, running ahead, like all year.",
        "Even at this late date, I think that the latest poll I saw still showed Casey up by about eight points.",

        "And, you know, people like him in Pennsylvania.",
        "He's very popular statewide and polls show him running away with the reelection race.",
        "Ken Rudin, any chance for Rick Santorum?",
        "No.",
        "Joe is exactly right.",
        "Whether it's been one point or by 20 points, Santorum has trailed all year.",
        "No Republican senator has been defeated in Pennsylvania in 50 years, but Santorum has never caught on, and it looks like more and more Republicans are going for Bob Casey, who's a far less effective campaigner.",
        "Santorum is a better campaigner, has more money, but it's not the right year, and the issues are not on his side."

        "I don't know if more - I mean, numerically, there's always more people who vote, but this year, all around the country, the primary turnout was really abysmal.",
