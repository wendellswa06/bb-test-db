        "Thousands of soldiers were already killed by insurgents.",
        "And the corpses of many more civilians and insurgents littered the deserts of Mesopotamia.",
        "The war was expensive, and the government that had sent the army to the Middle East now faced a crushing debt.",
        "Its economy was floundering.",
        "Elsewhere in the known world, that same army, stretched to its limits, struggled to provide enough manpower to keep a lid on three other rebellions.",
        "The year was 117 A.D., and the exotic, young man who was about to assume the leadership of the Roman Empire wasn't born in the capital city, but in modern-day Spain.",
        "His name was Hadrian.",
        "And the empire he inherited from his predecessor, Trajan, was militarily, economically, and diplomatically in a precarious position.",
        "At the time, Roman legions were fighting rebellions from the western corner of North Africa all the way to the Tigris River.",
        "The people who lived under Rome's sphere of influence in places like Gaul and along the Danube complained that their grievances weren't being heard.",
        "And they accused Rome's leaders of arrogance.",
        "And so Emperor Hadrian, faced with challenges at home and abroad, decided to do three things.",
        "The first decision was to withdraw his legions from Mesopotamia.",
        "He decided to shrink and then to consolidate the borders of the empire.",
        "The next was to shift money from that war in the east to deal with the public debts.",
        "He even found some extra cash to boost the economy with a massive public infrastructure project, things like repairing aqueducts, roads, and bridges.",
        "And finally, Hadrian did what few of his predecessors would even consider.",
        "He went on a road trip and visited nearly every corner of the empire.",
        "He knew that for Rome to bolster its influence, it had to show at least some respect for the nations so affected by its power.",
        "So Hadrian also increased foreign aid, and he started a program of nation building throughout the empire.",
        "And by and large, it worked.",
        "Now, judging by modern-day standards, Hadrian was also brutal.",
        "He crushed a Jewish rebellion, killing thousands, and very nearly abolished the Jewish faith.",
        "He saw the Jews as a threat to the stability of his empire.",

        "And for me, that really opened up something.",
        "And we fairly quickly came to the understanding that we both saw science and art as knowledge generation fields and not as…",
        "Yeah.",

        "So they're large oils, sort of 9 by 9 feet.",
        "And they're about structures in science.",
        "And that's what I'm interested in, rather than representing molecules or, you know, double helixes or things like that.",

        "And, Lynn, tell us about your DNA portrait.",
        "How did you come up with that idea?",
        "And, Lynn, what do you - and what do they look like, these portraits?",
        "Well, the first thing that we do if I would do your portrait, Ira, is I would give you a lab kit - and I use the genographic lab kit, which is, like you said, buccal swabs, the cells from the inside of your cheek.",
        "And you would choose to do your Y chromosome or your mitochondrial, male or female, and you'd send that into the lab.",
        "And it's confidential.",
        "But I would help track the number for you.",
        "And the day that that comes back, then I put into one of my images.",
        "And I've developed several images.",
        "I'm a digital artist.",
        "So while I'm waiting for those lab results, I'm doing some pencil sketches of your face, if I would do your face, and getting my composition just right.",
        "And then that comes into the computer.",
        "And I essentially redraw because I do vector graphics, and I add a lot of color, transparencies, layers, it gets very complex on the screen.",
        "The output, though, is from my really big Giclee printer - on 100 percent rag paper.",
        "So they're really nice, large images, usually.",
        "And I print on silk as well.",
        "So like I said, I'd pick up that data online with your Y chromosome information, say, if you want to do your father's line.",
        "And that goes in a landscape with your face.",
