        "Yeah.",
        "I used to be with interiors and landscapes.",
        "And now they're - you would call them abstract.",
        "And - but I think that the continuity is that I've always been interested in place, and place as a complex notion that brings together physical place but also cultural place, the rhythms of the culture that you live in, the history that - and the rhythm of that history.",
        "And so, you know, I was doing this place of - this house in France, which was sort of an invented home for me, and then the place of New York through the World Trade Center.",

        "And I realized a couple of years after I had met Todd that what I was moving into was the place of science, and through that, the place of contemporary society - because I think science is a revealer of a contemporary worldview, and that I think there's a new worldview that has been in the shaping - new is maybe the wrong term, but has been in the shaping for, say, 100 years, that started, really, in mathematics and in physics and now has been sweeping through our society and is really creating new challenges for understanding.",

        "So the project of the artist in residency is actually how to, in some way, make the burdens too permeable to science, I mean, to art…",
        "Right.",
        "…so that you don't just have an artist in residence.",
        "You have speakers.",

        "Oh, very much so.",

        "This is the century for the life sciences.",
        "And it's been 55 years now, we've had the structure of DNA.",

        "And when we come as artists and talk about - you know, I remember having a discussion with Eric Landers(ph) and I finished by saying, you know, I think I can help you represent contemporary reality better and therefore make better science.",
        "He said, of course.",
        "You know, I thought he was going to say I was crazy, but he completely understood where I was coming from.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And so I would encourage you to contact artists, or if you have an inclination to as a maker - I mean, because as artists we're makers.",
