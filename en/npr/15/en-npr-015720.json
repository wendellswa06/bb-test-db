        "Yeah.",

        "And that's where, I think, there's some exploration to do in this place of interface in trying to - I think it's not only that they can communicate.",
        "It's that it's absolutely vital at the moment that science and art communicate in order to understand.",
        "We're entering a very complex place.",
        "You know, we're looking at - I think the shift has been that we're entering a time in which we're looking at complexity and trying to understand the world from the perspective of complexity.",
        "And that means evolving new sets of tools and evolving our representational system to deal with these new challenges.",
        "How do you represent complex networks?",
        "How do you represent n-dimensional space?",
        "And you know, in the same way that the perspectival system as we know it evolved at a particular time in the Quattrocentro to sort of accompany its time, you know, with the rise of bourgeoisie and the kind of shift of power structure and the rise of Protestantism.",
        "So you have the system that came all of a sudden instead of having something mediated by hierarchy, you have all of a sudden representation as this picture plane that comes between you and infinity.",
        "And it's Protestantism, right?",
        "You have a direct relationship to God.",
        "And now we are in a time where we're trying to evolve a new system of understanding.",
        "And some of the old - I mean, we always understand the new through old tools, and we have to evolve those tools.",
        "And I think this meeting of science and art is one of the contemporary attempts to evolve these new tools.",
        "Any final comments about that, Lynn?"
