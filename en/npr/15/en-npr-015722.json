        "Yeah, and we should say that NPR hasn't independently confirmed these reports.",
        "But what they're saying is that he was wiretapped going back well before the presidential campaign, related to work that he had done in the - in Ukraine, but that it also continued even after the election.",
        "What this really tells us that we know for sure is that Paul Manafort is in the crosshairs of this investigation being led by Robert Mueller.",
        "And, you know, the Trump administration has already tried to distance itself from Manafort with the president saying, you know, he was a good guy, but he only worked on the campaign briefly.",

        "But a senior aide who briefed reporters says an argument we can expect to hear from President Trump is that nations putting their own interests first will find a need for global cooperation to counter some of the world's most pressing issues.",
