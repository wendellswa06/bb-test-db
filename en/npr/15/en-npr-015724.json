        "Just out Poydras Street from the modest New Orleans Legal Assistance offices, the prominent law firm Adams and Reese has offices in the top floors of the Shell Building, the tallest building in the city.",
        "There's a grand view from the boardroom on 45th floor.",
        "Real estate lawyer Malcolm Meyer points out neighborhoods below.",
        "And you have the Upper Ninth Ward, Lower Ninth Ward, and all of that flooded, and that's where a lot of heirship property showed up.",
        "Heirship property is a legal term for land handed down informally and owned by multiple heirs.",
        "Before Katrina, Mayer thought it was a largely a rural phenomenon, common among poor farmers who died without a written will.",
        "They just let everybody know that the eldest son would get this piece, the other son would get this, the daughter and son-in-law would get that, and they would divide the land up that way and it was acceptable to everybody.",
        "After Katrina hit, Meyer was shocked at how pervasive the phenomenon was even in the city, and he came to a couple of conclusions - one, that the pattern of informal property transfer was depriving poor and low-income people of some of the economic power of their most important asset.",
        "Coincidentally, at the time of the storm Meyer had been reading a book by a Peruvian economist, Hernando de Soto, which described how the lack of title to property hurts many of the world's poor.",
        "For instance, it deprives them of collateral to borrow money at low interest rates to invest and improve their economic situation.",
        "Meyer realized that was exactly the situation for as many as 20,000 New Orleanians.",
        "They're deprived because then the asset that we're talking about can only provide a roof over your head.",
        "But then once that roof was blown away, the asset couldn't even do that.",
        "After thinking about it further, Meyer, who wrote the definitive textbook on Louisiana real estate law, began to believe that legally transferring title is far more complicated and costly than it ought to be.",
        "I can take out a life insurance policy, and by signing and filling out a blank and just signing at the bottom I can leave $1 million dollar life insurance policy to my wife, to one child and not another, but I cannot leave a $50,000 house in the same fashion just by a quick notation like that.",
        "Instead, transferring the title to a $50,000 house, about the value of many homes in the poorer sections of New Orleans, could cost $5,000, 10 percent of the value of the property.",
        "Meyer, working with Louisiana Appleseed, a legal aid nonprofit, managed just this spring to get the state legislature to agree to examine the issue.",
        "Help is not likely to come soon enough for people like Alice Cousin, who are currently struggling to clear their titles, get their Road Home money, and rebuild their lives.",

        "For some Native Americans, the new year is a time to give their children traditional tribal names.",
        "Commentator Harlan McKosato(ph) recalls his own name and the pride it instilled in him many years ago.",
        "Just a little more than a century ago, many Native Americans were still using our traditional tribal names, which consisted of just one name, not a first, middle and last name like we carry today.",
        "For instance, my great-great grandfather's name was McKosato, which means `sounds like a fox' in our tribal language.",
        "This name was given to all our family since he was the head of household at the time when the US Department of War conducted a census on Native Americans in the late 1800s and provided us with surnames.",
        "My family has kept this custom of providing a traditional tribal name to our children.",
        "For my family, it's not really a matter of if you're going to give your child an Indian name but when.",
        "It's comparable to the way traditional Jewish families give their children Hebrew names.",
        "This tribal name that we were given is different than our legal name and it is not used in public.",
        "My young son's legal name is Nicon(ph); it means `friend' in our tribal language.",
        "His mother and I chose that name because we wanted his legal name to reflect his Native American heritage.",

        "A lot of people were involved with who killed this car.",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "Well, we thought, you know, you look at the story of what happened, and when this all went down, those of us who were driving these cars, we kept waiting for like the big expose in the New Yorker or something like this to do the story.",
        "And it just didn't happen.",
        "And so when I began filming, it became quite apparent that there were many suspects in the death of this car and, of course, the car being a metaphor for bigger issues.",

        "But certainly the automobile industry and the oil industry felt the most threatened by this car.",
        "I mean, the short story of the whole story is that California had a huge air pollution problem, especially in urban areas like Los Angeles, where I live.",
        "In fact, that's why I got a car because I thought, oh well, maybe I'll just do my bit.",
        "With a plug-in car, you just plug it in at night and you never go to the service station.",
        "And the amount of pollution you create at a power plant is much less than what you get out of your tailpipe from gasoline.",

        "And what I don't think they anticipated was how advanced and how great these cars were.",
        "And those of us who got to drive them very quickly got used to like plugging in the car in the garage and zipping around Los Angeles or San Francisco and the places where these cars were available and feeling like we were in the 21st century.",
        "And the industries that were most impacted by these innovations came down pretty hard and said, California, you can't have a law like this.",
        "This is wrong and this is unfair and so forth.",
        "So they dismantled this law.",
        "And that's the short story of what happened.",

        "You know, we're not making anymore?",

        "Well, the official reason is that consumers just weren't interested in these cars, that they put them on the market and they never sold them.",
        "So folks that wanted to buy them couldn't buy them.",
        "But they said they were only able to lease, in GM's case, 800 of these cars."

        "I know.",
        "It's amazing.",
        "Well, one of the factors is that the federal government passed a big spending bill, essentially, and gave the car companies one and a half billion dollars as partnership for a new generation of vehicles.",
        "And they came up with hybrid cars.",
        "But when the administration changed, the American automakers walked away from these programs.",
        "And the Japanese were so nervous about this program and possible competition that they went ahead and developed hybrid cars on their own.",

        "And the big irony is that essentially we're importing technology that was largely developed in the U.S.",
