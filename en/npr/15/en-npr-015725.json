        "How are electric vehicles holding up from the onslaught of the hybrid cars?",
        "Well, they're actually - the hybrid will - I mean, I think probably Chris will agree with this, it will, in the end, actually make, bring back a resurgence.",
        "And maybe the best - I like to describe it as a resurrection, you know?",
        "Chris' movie sort of describes the untimely death, birth and death and I call it, you know, eventual resurrection of the electric vehicle, because the technology that the car makers are putting into these vehicles, what we're going to see is an increasing reliance on more and more electrical power and less and less on the gasoline power that'll drive the car.",
        "Hm-hmm.",
        "So as they, as they're able to mass produce the electric drive motors, as they're able to mass produce the controllers, as they're able to mass produce the battery packs, all that eventually gets us closer and closer to a pure battery electric vehicle.",
        "So I kind of see the, you know, the hybrid cars actually being a boon in the end to this transition."

        "And there are 40 people in this class being taught by a couple of instructors, one from the San Diego area and one from up in Turlock, who are teaching these 40 people, including - there was a woman there, a local teacher, how to convert a Volkswagen Cabriolet Rabbit into an electric drive.",

        "I'm actually an engineer who works for a certain company, who's familiar with the EV1 but didn't actually work on that program.",
        "But you say that the technology was all affluent and what not, but I would just like to point out there's a reason that General Motors only offered the EV1s for sale in California, and specifically that reason was that the battery technology, ultimately, at the time and still currently, is very, very limited, and that in colder climates, the range could, on the full charge, could actually depreciate to less than 20 miles.",
        "So to say that, you know, it was the perfect solution, it was very limited relative to IC engines and their capabilities.",
        "Well, it's an excellent question, and I think Bill can speak to this a little bit.",
        "But I'll just say this, and, you know, the idea of any one car, whether it's an electric car or a gas car for the matter being the only car you can get in the marketplace is very limiting.",
        "And my real feeling at the end of having this amazing experience with my electric car was that, why are these not even an option in the marketplace?",
        "They might not work everywhere for every person, but this should definitely be part of the mix.",
        "And as far as batteries go, you know, the average American drives 29 miles a day, and those lead-acid batteries, which were the first ones which you're absolutely right, in those cars could only take the EV1 for example, about 60 miles.",
        "Well it turns out, as a commuter car that could work for a lot of people.",
        "It certainly worked for me.",
        "And thanks to advances with nickel metal batteries that Stan Ovshinsky did, which are now the batteries that are in all the Priuses and hybrids, those cars can go 100 miles.",
        "So suddenly you have a much bigger potential market.",
        "And when you start looking at lithium batteries, which are what we use in our laptops and our cell phones, ranges on electric cars go up from there.",
        "And Bill, you probably know more about his than me, what...",
        "Well, yeah, one of the - a couple of the issues we're facing with this particular thing is we've got - I see kind of two issues here.",
        "First of all, the technology question and the expectations question.",
        "You know, on the expectation side, we always sort of have this view that we, you know, that perfection is the enemy of the good here in that we all want this car that will operate in all weather, all conditions, go 500 miles on a two minute charge, and that's, I, we'd all like to have that.",
        "But in reality, when you get right down to it, as Chris pointed out, we only do 20 to 25, you know, maybe 30 miles on an average, a day.",
        "Now of course there are the people that drive, you know, I spoke to one out in California there, he said, well, I drive 65 miles a day.",
        "That would be pressing the range of, you know, current lead-acid battery technology.",
        "But there's some really kind of exciting stuff, you know, coming over the horizon.",
        "And you know, and whether we're talking about using hydrogen in a fuel cell to, you know, to power the electric drive, or whether we're talking flywheels to, you know, act as a storage medium, and there's all kinds of things that we're looking at, but when you come right down to it, we were talking about these people converting their electric cars.",
        "There are people who live in Canada who have converted their cars, run on these lead-acid batteries, and have no problem driving around in the wintertime.",
        "So you know, to say that this is the limiting factor, in effect, you know, really isn't.",
        "There are ways we can get around it.",
        "Yes, cold impacts the battery technology, but you know, the engineers and scientists are aware of all these issues and certainly are working that direction.",
        "So...",
        "And you know, what people don't really talk about, often enough I guess, this year its beginning to change, are the limitations of a gasoline powered car.",
        "I mean this really is impacting everything, you know, whether on a planetary level or just the places we live.",
        "So hopefully the information can get out there and we can get a real mix in the marketplace.",
        "And the murder mystery that, you know, we put together was to kind of like get people fired up about these issues and get them turned on to some of the things going on."
