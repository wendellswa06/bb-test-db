        "And I went to a wonderful screening.",
        "Audiences are so fired up, and when I get to do a question and answer, it's amazing how much people know and how much people don't know.",
        "And I hope if this, you know, this thing catches fire from here and, you know, reaches other places in the country - not just as an electric car story, but as a story about what it's going to take to get us into the 21st century is the way I like to think about it, especially in respect to, like, use of foreign oil.",

        "And even, you know, getting gas mileage up from 24 to 12 miles per gallon are all the results of laws.",
        "And sometimes when you have big industry involved you need big laws to push industry down the right road.",

        "...before I could possibly get it.",
        "And it just seems to me, now that I live in Tulsa, which is kind of the Bible Belt, if you will, that it seems that the whole nation, every time some new technology like this comes out that can really impact the environment in a positive way or help out with cost of living, cost of driving, it seems like it just, it gets thwarted by some mythical way."

        "You've got this grass roots initiative by several companies to expand the battery pack currently available in the Prius, which is sort of the initial target vehicle.",
        "That'll give people the ability to operate, you know, 20 to 30 miles in electric only range, and that translates into 100 to 150 miles per gallon of, you know, gasoline equivalent.",
