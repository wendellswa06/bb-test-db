        "Well, Michael Seifert was an SS corporal, a guard at two prison camps, actually: the first one in Fossoli di Carpi, and the second in Bolzano, located in northern Italy.",
        "These were actually transit points for - mostly for Jews, for some Italian resistance fighters and others deemed undesirable, a transit point prior to training them off to usually Auschwitz or Treblinka.",

        "Well, that's the question, isn't it?",
        "The original Israeli air strikes in retrospect, as we go back and analyze where they landed, were against the supply lines that Syria and Iran were using to bring the rockets up to firing - to the firing point.",
        "Before the war they bragged that they had thousands of rockets already stockpiled.",
        "So they either stopped firing today because they're trying to appear to be the international good guys, or they really maybe starting to run low on certain types of rockets.",
        "I'm not as concerned about continuing Katyusha barrages - of course, I don't have to be there under them - as I am the possibility that they're going to start bringing in longer and longer range rockets, which makes Israel's security problem much harder.",
        "And the point of the rockets, themselves militarily insignificant.",
        "They don't hit - they're un-aimed and they hit where they hit.",

        "Killebrew, you say this is a deliberate tactic by the weaker party in this conflict, to put its weapons in the midst of civilians in part to protect those weapons from attack, or at least if they're going to be attacked, to make collateral damage civilian casualties an element of every air strike.",
        "It seems that there's kind of this gray area, and the IAF is getting away with, oops, we tried, but you know, we've made some mistakes.",

        "It's worth noting that when this started, one of the very hopeful signs that everyone was kind of self-congratulatory about was that the moderate Arab states in the Middle East were actually quietly supporting Israel and acknowledged that Israel had a right to do what it was trying to do against Hezbollah, which they fear is an arm of Iran.",

        "A bridge, for example, is both a thing that civilians use to cross over rivers, but also important choke points on supply lines.",
        "If you look at the pattern of Israeli air strikes, they're on bridges across rivers or bridges across gorges that are supply lines running up to Damascus through the Beqaa Valley, and then, of course, across the Litani River in south Lebanon.",
        "The other things they've hit, airports - we think, we hope, Hezbollah offices in south Lebanon are either, we think, Hezbollah targets or dual use targets.",
