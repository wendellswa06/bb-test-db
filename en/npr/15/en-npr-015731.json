        "This is TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "I'm Neal Conan in Washington.",
        "A steady stream of civilians trapped in southern Lebanon moved north today on foot, in trucks, and in cars, taking advantage of what may be a brief stop in most Israeli air strikes.",
        "We're talking about the tactics and strategies used in the fighting between Hezbollah and Israel.",
        "Our guests are Robert Killebrew, a retired colonel, now a consultant who writes and speaks on military affairs.",
        "Also, John Arquilla, professor of defense analysis at the Naval Post-Graduate School.",
        "If you'd like to join us, 800-989- 8255, 800-989-talk.",
        "E-mail is talk@npr.org.",
        "John Arquilla, I'd like you to expand a little bit on what you were talking about in terms of net warfare.",
        "Compared to the familiar military hierarchy, the pyramid that we're all familiar with, how does net warfare compare?",
        "Well, where a traditional who sees a stream of orders coming from a general right down to the private soldier at the bottom of the hierarchy, our network is much flatter.",
        "There are very few commands, perhaps Hassan Nasrallah gave a ceasefire order over the radio, and that's why they're not shooting today.",
        "But there are very few orders.",
        "Instead, there's a general goal, such as bombard Israel or engage IDF forces in south Lebanon.",
        "But the small units basically decide for themselves what they are going to do, and we've been seeing this now for a decade.",
        "The Chechnyans fought this way in their 1994 to '96 war against the Russians.",
        "And in small little groups, they were able to drive one of the world's better militaries out of Chechnya.",
        "Of course, the Russians came back and got better at this.",
        "So I'm kind of confused about the coverage in terms of that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "John Arquilla, certainly what can sometimes look on one side like selective targeting and restraint, on the receiving end can look like indiscriminate bombing.",
        "We see in Iraq right now the same sort of thing.",
        "There's not one field general leading the operations, but rather the small groups with lots of authority to decide what they are going to do.",
        "And even we are pretty good at this when we put our minds to it.",
        "In Afghanistan, late in 2001, we had just 11 A teams, about 1,100 of our special operations forces in Afghanistan and working closely with air power.",
        "They were able to drive the Taliban and al-Qaida from power in just a few weeks.",
        "And even today, we work still in small groups in the country.",
        "And with a very tiny garrison compared to Iraq, the situation in Afghanistan is far better.",
        "So net warfare is coming along.",
        "I'm pleased occasionally to hear Secretary Rumsfeld say, you know, we're in net wars now, and we have to get good at that.",
        "And I think a lot of folks are paying great attention to this",
        "Unfortunately, the Israelis seem to be caught in a time loop here where they thing strategic bombardment can still actually work.",
        "And what they're doing is taking a hammer to a ball of quicksilver with this bombing all over Lebanon."

        "Let's get a caller on.",
        "This is Mike, Mike calling us from Detroit.",
        "Yeah, I'd like to make a point about the Katyusha rockets.",
        "From what I've read and been able to find on the net, the Katyusha rocket is totally mobile.",
        "They're fired from the back of a truck, or the small ones can actually be handled by a couple of men.",
        "They're set up.",
        "They're fired.",
        "The people that shoot the rockets leave.",
        "So when Israel talks that they are targeting a launch site, it seems ridiculous to me.",
        "When they've spotted a launch site and then hours later they bomb the site, whoever shot that rocket off was gone 30 seconds after they shot it.",
        "Exactly so.",
        "The Hezbollah strategy is kind of shoot and scoot.",
        "You're quite right.",
        "A large number of what they have can fit on the back of a truck.",
        "The Katyusha's a perfect weapon for a network to fight with, and a lot of these weapons are in caches sprinkled all over southern Lebanon.",
        "So the fire teams just moved to them, fire, move to the next.",
        "That's why it's very, very hard to engage them.",
        "And in fact this is the other big difference between traditional war and network warfare, is that it's no longer mass on mass, force on force.",
        "It's a game of hiders/finders.",
        "And so this depends on intelligence.",
        "And frankly, I'm sad to see the Israelis decided to stay with strategic bombing and to pull back their ground forces.",
        "They needed to be using small teams of ground forces to identify these fire teams moving here and there.",
        "And they have advantage and night vision and other technologies that would allow them to engage.",
        "And it's a puzzling military choice.",
        "But as Robert noted earlier, their chief of staff is an air officer who's probably more inclined to believe in the efficacy of strategic bombing.",
        "And, Col.",
        "Killebrew, to be fair, there are more complicated launchers for the longer range missiles that Israel - at least according to what it claims -has targeted effectively.",
        "Sure, that's right.",
        "And I will say, and I appreciate John's comment.",
        "He knows I'm an infantryman.",
        "I kind of listen to those comments with a touch of doubt.",
        "To be fair to the Israelis, they actually have deployed special forces teams of the type that John is talking about throughout the region.",
        "But as the caller said, trying to hit a Katyusha site is the hardest military problem you can give a conventional force.",
        "We were dodging Katyushas in Vietnam and had the same problem.",
        "The guys would fire them, and then 30 seconds later it would be off the launch site and gone.",
        "By the time your counter battery fire comes down - which can actually be very rapid - the people who fired the rocket are over the hill.",
        "I'll mention that there was an interview with the U.N.",
        "commander in Lebanon the other day who complained that Hezbollah is pulling up to his front gate outside the U.N.",
        "compound - the main U.N.",
        "compound - firing off rockets severally, and then waiting a little while and then beating feet so the Israeli response would come down on the U.N.",
        "compound instead of where the Hezbollah was.",
        "But they can be defeated.",
        "Not easily and not uniformly.",
        "And one way - as John said - one way to do it is have spotters on the ground overlooking probable launch sites, and then when somebody shows up and starts to unlimber a missile, you'd call down fire on them before they can get it off the tube.",
        "It's a hard military problem, but it does have solutions."

        "Thanks very much for the call, Mike.",
        "Joining us now to discuss Israel's military tactics and overall strategy is Ambassador James Dobbins, director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at the Rand Corporation, formerly U.S.",
        "Ambassador to the European community.",
        "He is with us now from the studios at Rand in Pentagon City in Virginia.",
        "Nice to have you on the program today.",
        "Thank you.",
        "A pleasure.",
        "Do you agree that Israel was trying to apply a strategic bombing campaign to a situation that's inappropriate to it?",
        "Well, I think that the Israeli government was under pressure from its public - understandably enough - to do something and do something dramatic in response to the attacks that had been suffered.",
        "And it didn't really have any very good choices.",
        "And it shows what it thought was the least bad choice - an air campaign, which would avoid becoming bogged down as they did a decade ago in southern Lebanon.",
        "The bad choice turned out to be just that, a bad choice.",
        "But at least in domestic political terms, probably better than doing nothing.",
        "And yet we've seen - as Col.",
        "Killebrew was talking about a few minutes ago - public opinion, with the increase in civilian casualties, swing very much behind Hezbollah.",

        "That's right.",
        "Public opinion everywhere but in the United States and Israel has swung behind Hezbollah, in part because of the civilian casualties.",
        "And in part because of an underlying sympathy with the Palestinian cause in the ongoing Palestinian/Israeli dispute over control and sovereignty of the West Bank and Gaza.",

        "Chuck's calling us from San Francisco.",
        "Yeah, thanks a lot.",
        "Sure.",
        "And although I'm from San Francisco, I wouldn't necessarily quibble with characterizing Hezbollah as - among other things - a terrorist organization.",
        "But what my question is, is if Hezbollah is this new kind of entity, a loose network with a diverse sources of support -united I guess primarily by a shared ideology - is it possible to defeat an ideology militarily?",
        "It seems that you can't really kill an idea and public opinion - which you guys just said has swung towards Hezbollah -I would say is really what sustains a terrorist movement or ideology.",
        "Ambassador Dobbins?",
        "Well, I think that military force to the extent it's used has to be used in pursuit of a political objective if it's going to be successful in a circumstance like this.",
        "And that's, I think, where both American and Israeli policy might be faulted, that there doesn't seem to be an achievable political objective toward which this military force is being applied.",
        "John Arquilla, I wonder if I can get your thoughts on that?",
        "It's a wonderful question about the role of ideology and the power of networks.",
        "And unfortunately, the Israeli military response has only fed the narrative, the story that Hezbollah tells about how they are freedom fighters against an oppressive Israeli military machine.",
        "And I think part of the way to fight that would have been - as we were talking earlier - for the Israelis to use their focused special tactics observers and to fight in a way that used air power specifically in conjunction with small units on the ground - in other words, building their own military network to fight that network.",
        "And then we wouldn't have all this collateral damage all over Lebanon, and world opinion wouldn't have been swayed.",
        "So they could've done well, and the Israelis could've also done good, had they taken a more networked approach to this war, instead of thinking that the spirit of Curtis LeMay - the old Air Force general -still reigns supreme, and they could win with shock and awe.",
        "Because the only people shocked are those who are appalled at the dead civilians in Lebanon."

        "Col.",
        "Killebrew, let me bring you in on this.",
        "And let me ask you also, in the past Israel's military strategy has included the idea of deterring its potential opponents by using tremendous amounts of force in every conflict to demonstrate that they ought to think twice, three times, four times, before doing it again.",
        "Is that one of the messages they're trying to send, do you think?",
        "That's absolutely one.",
        "I'll give you two reactions, Neal.",
        "The first is, I would not characterize what the Israeli air force did in the beginning as strategic bombardment.",
        "To me, what the Israeli air force was trying to do was to seal off south Lebanon from reinforcement or re-supply from Iran through Syria.",
        "And that is a reasonable adjunct to a ground campaign or could stand alone in the mistaken idea that air power alone could solve something like this.",
        "I agree with John that they could've thought it perhaps militarily smarter, but I would add that south Lebanon - as it was when this started - was an armed camp.",
        "It was not empty space like Afghanistan tended to be.",
        "So small teams put in there alone with little support would've been, I think, very quickly rolled up.",
        "On the subject of ideology, the caller is exactly correct.",
        "Military power cannot kill ideas.",
        "The only way you kill an idea or overcome an idea is with a better idea.",
        "Generally speaking, the radicals throughout the Middle East - and I might add that in the past year, we've seen a turn away from pragmatism, vis-à- vis, the Palestinian/Israeli question and the whole issue being put into the hand of radicals, and Hamas, now Hezbollah, al-Qaida and other groups - the networks, as James called them.",
        "We have seen these people who are dedicated to the idea of the destruction of Israel in the name of their religion.",
        "Overcoming that idea is going to take us probably a generation or two once we find out what the better idea is.",
        "Until then, all military power can do is keep these people at bay.",
        "And some have suggested that Lebanon's fragile prosperity after all those years of civil war that was just building up, smashing that is not generally a way to win hearts and minds.",
        "The victim in this war is Lebanon, there's no question about it.",
        "But I do not think - and I'm not particularly an Israeli supporter - but we should not expect Israel to sit still and allow armed attacks on its territory to be mounted from Lebanon.",
