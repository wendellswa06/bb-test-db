        "Hi, Neal, how are you?",
        "I just wanted to ask where do you draw the line between strategic bombardment and hitting hard military targets - or in this case, I guess Hezbollah targets - and collective punishment, such as destroying sewage treatment, blowing up power stations, hitting the boardwalk, destroying a lighthouse that was a tourist attraction that had been rebuilt since the last time the Israelis destroyed it?",
        "Jonathan Capehart of The Washington Post, Aisha Harris of Brow Beat, Slate's culture blog.",
        "Thanks to you both.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Well, and it is.",
        "The attempt to try to get the Lebanese to work against Hezbollah by knocking out bridges, port facilities, cratering runways hundreds of miles from the scene of battle - these are all classic elements of strategic bombing, which, by the way in about a 90-year history, has almost never worked.",
        "It just beggars the imagination that military people keep coming back to the idea of winning by strategic bombing alone.",
        "Even dropping bridges not too far from the battle zone is ultimately strategic in nature, because it aims at supplies for the longer term.",
        "What I've suggested is that Israeli air power needed to be used in a far more focused way in support of small teams operating in the south, which as Robert noted earlier, were there.",
        "And I don't think they could've been rolled up at all.",
        "In fact, if Hezbollah tried to concentrate against them, then Israeli air power would've decimated them.",
        "Which is what happened when we toppled the Taliban five years ago.",
        "Every time they tried to mass against our few forces, they were killed by the hundreds by a few aircraft.",
        "So the concept of operations is out there.",
        "The Israelis are reluctant to adopt it.",
        "Frankly, our own military still debates whether this Afghan model can or should be used again.",
        "And if you will, there's kind of war of ideas about the idea of war going on, which will be the subject of my next book.",
        "And I think that debate needs to be resolved favorably, or we're going to see one war after another that kills mostly civilians.",
        "Well, the Taliban had something to defend.",
        "They were the regime in power.",
        "Hezbollah doesn't look like it's trying to necessarily defend any targets.",

        "Well, they are indeed massing against - every time the Israelis made a ground push, they massed against it.",
        "And I, for the life of me, I don't know why the Israelis have stopped engaging them.",
        "This campaign should be focused on Hezbollah fighters.",
        "Of course they try to defend that territory.",
        "And in fact, they drove the Israelis out of southern Lebanon six years ago, which in my view is part of the reason for the ferocity of the Israeli response this time - is a little bit of payback for having been driven out.",
        "As Robert said, Hezbollah is one of the top militaries in the Middle East.",
        "That's an amazing thing to say about a network, not a nation.",
        "And that's the era we're moving into.",
        "And so the Israelis are, I think, rightly trying to degrade the power of this network, but they're doing it in the wrong way.",
        "Yet also is but isn't an element of the state.",
        "And you were talking about these light Katyusha rockets that are easily moved and not expensive, yet they were also firing fairly sophisticated Chinese-made cruise missile at Israeli warships.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think even these small networks are going to have access to increasingly accurate, farther-ranging weapons, and that's yet another reason why small groups are going to be more and more powerful in the future.",
        "And that's why Rumsfeld and I have suggested that net war is the wave of the future.",
        "Thank goodness the American military at least has something called a net war command now, where we try to think about some of these issues.",
        "But that's the age of warfare coming upon us.",
        "All wars are time portals.",

        "If the Israelis were so good with their photography of what they're able to destroy, you would think they would have proof.",
        "I wonder whether any your reporters have said photographs of this kind of action or so on - I really find this to be Israeli disinformation and part of their campaign.",
        "Because it covers up, it gives them an excuse for whenever they have these accidental bombings of these places where children and women are hiding, and where people live and in their homes."

        "And they have this, it seems to me, the Israelis have a strategy very similar to terrorism, where they're able to use their overwhelming force to bomb indiscriminately and to really - it's so similar to the terrorism that they accuse of others of doing, where they themselves are...",

        "That should be a clue to the Israelis that strategic bombing isn't the best thing to do.",
        "It's certainly in the Israeli interest to play up those instances.",
        "But let's look at the real ground action in this war.",
        "When Israeli forces crossed the border into southern Lebanon, there weren't a lot of civilians in the way.",
        "Hezbollah came right at them, gave them a hard fight, and the Israelis decided that they didn't want any more of this.",
        "And I think that was their biggest mistake in terms of generalship in this war.",
        "They had an opportunity - Hezbollah was willing to come out and fight, and the Israelis fell back and instead are relying once again on bombing.",
        "And the sad news is we're going to end up with a war where 90 percent of the casualties are civilians, when in fact they had the chance to really right down Hezbollah power in direct fighting.",
        "And I think they should've.",
        "Ambassador Dobbins, evidence that Hezbollah headquarters - such as they are - equipment and military equipment are interspersed with civilians?",
        "Well, I think that it's logical to assume that Hezbollah would do that, because it would clearly be in their interest.",
        "And it's logical to assume that the Israelis are not intentionally targeting civilian populations, because it wouldn't be in their interest.",
        "So absent, you know, convincing documentary evidence to the contrary, I think it's reasonable to assume that Hezbollah is concealing some of its activities in a civilian population, and that the Israelis are legitimately trying to hit military targets and simply causing a good deal with collateral damage.",
        "On the other hand, the Israel targets of a strategic nature - if you will - elsewhere in Lebanon, where there's clearly no Hezbollah presence are more problematic, if you will, because they appear to be designed to put pressure on Lebanon - which, after all, is guilty if only by omission rather than commission for the attacks on Israel.",

        "Good afternoon.",
        "It seems to me that Hezbollah is more than just a terrorist group, and that's what I'm getting from you guys.",
        "If most of the world or a good deal of the world now supports Lebanon and Hezbollah, and Hezbollah are Lebanese, essentially - there might be some others in there, but they are essentially Lebanese - I don't get this.",
        "But, you know, while you guys seem to be taking mostly the side of Israel - for one thing, I'd like to know what Hezbollah could do to increase its efficacy.",
        "What military strategy should they take to keep Israel - or get Israel out of Lebanon?",
        "Because Israel has been in Lebanon (unintelligible) times, as well as the other surrounding Arab nations.",

        "What do both sides need to feel victorious in this?",
        "And start with you, John Arquilla.",
        "Well, I think Hezbollah wins if the Israelis stop the bombing and don't have forces in Lebanon at the end of this.",
        "And they have been doing, for them, the right operational thing, which is engaging Israeli forces and continuing their scoot-and-shoot bombardment.",
        "They've managed over a couple of weeks to maintain about the same level of fire, although their accuracy went down.",
        "I think the best the Israelis can hope for right now, they have to stop this broader strategic bombing and focus their air power more closely on engagements on the ground to the extent to which the fighting continues.",
        "But I believe the collateral damage to date is going to put an enormous political pressure on the United States to bring an end to this.",
        "And so the best solution would be a kind of cordon sanitaire created in the south of Lebanon with troops patrolling it and some efforts made in the future to try to prevent a re-supply of Hezbollah forces.",
        "Ambassador Dobbins?",
        "Well, I think at this stage one would have to say that Hezbollah is fully gaining its objectives, which are on the one hand punish Israel, on the other hand to garner additional sympathy and international support and to thereby isolate Israel and the United States."
