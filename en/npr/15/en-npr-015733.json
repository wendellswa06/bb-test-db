        "Now, the Israelis weren't willing to do that in the beginning, which is what sparked the attacks into Lebanon and then the attacks into Israel, but that's probably the only basis on which this is going to be concluded.",

        "Explain that thinking there.",
        "Honestly, I tend not to hitchhike with a sign partly because I've got that guitar in my hands, and I'm playing it and then just stick out my thumb when a car passes.",

        "But it opened its doors so wide that amongst the Jewish refugees that were seeking shelter in Canada after the war came many, many alleged Nazi war criminals.",
        "It is estimated upwards to maybe 5,000 Nazi war criminals came into Canada.",
        "The sad story is that for 30 years, Canada virtually did nothing.",
        "Unlike United States, which took action through its Office of Special Investigations, we did nothing until 1984, where a special commission was set up to identify some of these alleged Nazi war criminals.",
        "To this day, we have a very, very sad record.",
        "Mr.",
        "Seifert is only one of maybe three or four that Canada has taken action against.",
        "The rest lived their lives very comfortably.",
        "But he was identified living in Vancouver, British Columbia as a train worker.",
        "He was, at first, tried under Canada's immigrations laws, which are quite specific.",
        "And it was difficult to obtain the kind of information that was needed to strip him of his Canadian citizenship and, therefore, that case got lost.",
        "However, shortly thereafter, the Italian courts, the military courts finally asked for an extradition of Mr. Seifert.",
        "They, indeed, had all the information.",
        "And for those that don't think Mr. Seifert had fair justice here in Canada, if only the - some of the victims of the Holocaust had a 10th of the justice Mr. Seifert had, they would be alive today.",
        "He was tried in the lower court in terms of the extradition - well, first, he had an extradition hearing.",
        "That hearing then went to the lower court appeal, and then it went to the middle and high court appeal.",
        "It went to the Supreme of Court of B.C., and then it went to the Supreme Court of Canada.",
        "That's why it took so long to finally extradite Mr. Seifert in 2008.",
        "Some people would say, after all that time - indeed, some people have said, researchers say - after all that time, these allegations amount to no more than gossip and innuendo, allegations, that there's little real proof."
