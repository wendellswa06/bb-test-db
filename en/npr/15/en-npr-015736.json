        "Thank you, Neal.",
        "And you were particularly interested in that quote.",
        "I was.",
        "When I heard that quote, as I wrote today, I burst out laughing.",
        "It was startling to hear, and I also thought, wow, I can't believe he had the nerve to say it.",
        "And I thought this because in that one comment, as Aisha alluded to, he said a lot about race in America.",
        "You know, there was no need for an explanation because we all know what he's talking about.",
        "We all knew what he meant.",
        "And given the nefarious stereotypes of black men in America, you know, we knew that there was some kernel of truth to it.",
        "And if you don't think that that's case, and then I'm glad you played the clip, you could hear the people with their knowing laughter in the background after he said what he said.",
        "It was comical that folks knew what he was getting at.",
        "And interesting the - I don't know if the reporter was being yelled at by a producer in his ears to wrap it up.",
        "But the reporter seemed to want to get out of there pretty quickly.",
        "Yes, because, you know, race is a touchy subject.",
        "And on live television, I think that reporter probably decided - because they'd already been on the air.",
        "This interview was going on for a while, and I think he probably thought, you know what, let's just cut it here before it gets any more dicey.",
        "But it was a startling comment, a terrific comment, a very telling comment from Mr. Ramsey.",
        "Aisha Harris, I wanted to ask you about it.",
        "A brave thing to say because it's one of those things everybody knows but doesn't say out loud?",
        "Right.",
        "It was a very astute observation.",
        "It kind of felt like, to me, Kanye West's version of, like, I - but George Bush doesn't care about black people and that whole, like, oh, we got to cut now.",
        "This can't happen on live television, except it was much more perceptive than West's statement.",
        "And he, kind of, said it in a way, it's like, yeah, yeah, like, it was kind of funny to him, but a bitter irony.",
        "When I was watching it, I was very shocked.",
        "I felt the same way as Jonathan did.",
        "And it just - it also felt like a Dave Chappelle skit or something, except real life.",
        "It felt - this was real.",
        "It's funny.",
        "You laugh about it at first, then you're like, well, he has a point.",
        "There's this history of fear of the black male and the black male with a white woman or white girl, and I think that does play into it.",
        "And he's much smarter than I think, than the means that kind of brush over that or completely ignore it, give him.",
        "Jonathan Capehart, what do you think is behind those video manipulations, the samplings and the autotunes of Mr. Ramsey?"

        "Well, the story begins a few years ago.",
        "There's this literature professor who studies 19th century British novels, specifically Jane Austen.",
        "Her name is Natalie Phillips.",
        "She works at Michigan State University.",
        "Well, you know, I think what Aisha's been talking about is very good observation.",
        "I mean, we now have four examples of hilarious black people in television, news interviews performing, being characters, I think, you know, being themselves.",
        "Like Aisha, I have relatives who speak just like Mr. Ramsey, or Antoine Dodson or Sweet Brown.",
        "But I think for us, while it might seem commonplace, daresay normal, I think for a majority of folks who are seeing these folks for the first time, it can be a little jarring.",
        "Look, personally speaking, the first time I saw Antoine Dodson, I laughed.",
        "The first time I saw Sweet Brown, I laughed.",
        "When I watched the Charles Ramsey interview, I laughed and then I gasped.",
        "But with each one, though, after the laughter stops and you listen to exactly what they're saying, particularly Antoine Dodson and Charles Ramsey, you focus in on who are these people and what is their character.",
        "As Aisha pointed out, Antoine Dodson was saving his sister from being raped by an intruder.",
        "Charles Ramsey, you know, didn't even think about his own safety when he heard someone screaming for help and thought said out loud, I thought it was a domestic violence situation.",
        "Most people would turn away.",
        "Most people would say this is none of my business.",
        "I shouldn't get involved, and yet both of these people got involved.",
        "And, you know, clearly, coming from tough circumstances, certainly tough circumstances that I'm living in right now, but who are people who are trying to live their lives and live their lives the best way they can in difficult circumstances and still being able to do so with their heads held high and being very proud of themselves and who they are.",
        "Jonathan Capehart is an opinion writer for The Washington Post.",
        "Also with us, Aisha Harris, an assistant for Brow Beat, that's Slate's culture blog.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And in a sense, Aisha Harris, are - is what's going an example of mainstream's culture in a minstrel show and taking these comments as some - almost as alien.",
        "Yes.",
        "I think that is a big part of it.",
        "I think it's important to note that I do think, in some ways, that class does play a big part in this.",
        "All of them are lower class, undereducated, perhaps.",
        "And that's what we get, that's what see here, that's what take in.",
        "And there are plenty of examples of people of all ethnicities acting as eyewitnesses, saying crazy things.",
        "It doesn't matter who, like - there was recently a homeless hitchhiker or someone.",
        "He was white and he had a mean of smash, smash, smash.",
        "He apparently saves a woman from a racist attacker.",
        "And so that that was pretty big, and that was got around a lot just like Antoine Dodson.",
        "But he's the only example I can think that has the same kind of omnipresence in all of culture as the black people that we've seen over the last few years.",
        "I mean, Sweet Brown is in a commercial.",
        "Antoine Dodson also capitalized and appeared in several other videos that went viral; does, like, cameos.",
        "So I think the fact that - it's not just a fact that the news might pick out these certain black people, I think, that there are many examples of everyone of all races.",
        "But I also think that the ones that are getting the most popular and the most play are the ones that are black.",
        "And I do think that's an inherent need to see - and unconscious, perhaps - need to see black people perform."

        "There is, however, all us, we reporters do this.",

        "And I developed a very easy formula for finding the most animated people.",
        "Look for the people in the funny hats.",

        "Here's an email from Brody in Boise: Do you think the success and fame brought to people you mentioned, and Joe the Plumber, have made people try to perform during these interviews.",
        "Well, I certainly think so.",
        "I mean, certainly, since Antoine Dodson and the success he has had with that - remember, he was living in the projects and - I believe it was in Alabama, and he - because of the success of the autotunes, video and everything else, he was able to move his family out of the project.",
        "So I think - certainly, there might be some folks who are motivated to try to do the same thing.",
        "And this from Claudia: Mr. Ramsey's statement, I knew something was wrong when the little, pretty white girl ran into a black man's arms was intended to be funny.",

        "The man should receive a medal for his heroism and a lucrative contract for stand-up comedy.",

        "Right, right.",
        "Although there was, as we've also learned, another person who apparently had a role in this story.",
        "But I think because he's not as flamboyant and he speaks minimal English, he hasn't gotten nearly as much coverage as Ramsey.",
        "But yeah, I mean, I think his point about race was supposed to be funny.",
        "But in the - again, the Dave Chappelle, Richard Pryor kind of way, like, yeah, you're laughing at this.",
        "But also you have to step back and also pause and be like, but that's kind of true.",
        "More funny peculiar than funny ha-ha - or maybe a little bit of both.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And this from Lemur: Anyone who makes fun of the hero ,Charles Ramsey, are the same kind of people who'd make fun of different cultures or laugh at racial jokes.",

        "They're extremely short staffed.",
        "And even before what happened, they were extremely short staffed, and they had extremely minimal medicines and supplies, and they were never really equipped for such a scale of dealing with casualties and wounded people and stuff like that."
