        "If you want to talk about people, not governments, you'll find that the vast majority of Arabs in the Middle East and wherever else, they do support - not Hamas as an ideology or whatever, they support a people surrounded in a very small piece of land besieged, not allowed to leave, travel, import goods.",
        "That is what they support.",

        "Well, it's coming from the Unit 3 reactor, which is one of the three reactors that melted down at the plant.",
        "But nobody knows exactly where in Unit 3 it's coming from, because the reactor is just too radioactive to get near.",
        "Now, there's a fear that it could come be coming from inside the reactor vessel itself, where the melted down fuel is, and that some of that fuel is heating up again.",
        "Maybe there's a hotspot.",
        "There's a small chance that the nuclear reactions could have restarted.",
        "Likely that might be happening?",
        "No, no. It's very unlikely.",
        "Fortunately, TEPCO, the company that owns the plant, has been monitoring the reactor very closely.",
        "And all the indications are that this is not a result of any new nuclear reactions inside the reactor vessel.",
        "Their best guess is it's been rainy and humid in Fukushima, and they think that rain is falling onto the outside of the vessel that holds all this nuclear fuel.",
        "That outside is still hot.",
        "It's still 104 degrees Fahrenheit.",
        "And so that could be causing the rain to come up as steam.",

        "But one concern has also been just the groundwater possibly being contaminated around the plant.",

        "For a long time now, it's been clear that there's been radiation still coming out of the plant into the Pacific Ocean.",
        "This plant is right on the coast, which is how it struck by a tsunami.",
        "Until now, TEPCO has claimed that this is a result of some residual radiation from the initial accident.",
        "But they drilled some test wells, and they're now admitting that the groundwater around the plant is contaminated with radioactivity.",
        "And this is a big admission for the company.",

        "It's just soaked into the ground.",
        "What we do know is that it probably is being dispersed out into the ocean.",
        "And while it's creating a local problem around the plant - and there's already a lot of radioactivity out in the seabed there - it's unlikely to pose any sort of a major risk at this stage.",
        "And I guess one question is: What is the company going to do about this groundwater problem?",
        "Well, I mean, there's a limited number of things it can do, because, obviously, it can't, you know, there are broken pipes in the plant.",
        "The plant itself is damaged, and water is flowing into the plant all the time, partially to keep it cool, partially just brown water flowing into the basement.",
        "So they can't really stop the water.",
        "What they could do is try and stop it from going in the ocean.",
        "So they're putting in some chemicals into the soil to try to harden it, make it less permeable to water.",

        "Eventually, they're hoping to put a huge, 30-foot-deep steel wall into the ground that will literally serve as sort of a barrier for that water from getting into the sea.",
        "But that's going to take a year.",
        "That sounds like an elaborate process.",

        "That's right.",
        "And, I mean, these are issues that TEPCO's going to be wrestling with for decades.",
