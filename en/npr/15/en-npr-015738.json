        "I'm joining now by NPR news analyst Juan Williams, and Juan, the New York Times says that this financial crisis has basically transformed the presidential race in wiping away practically every other issue, and that this is going to define the campaign from here on out.",
        "Both senators are running as outsiders and saying it's Washington that needs to be fixed, and which candidate is benefiting most from this crisis?",
        "Well, right now, what you're singing in the poll numbers is that while McCain had gotten a bump post-convention, Barack Obama has come back in the midst of this economic storm.",
        "And so, several of the tracking polls now show him - it's still with a margin of error - but with Barack Obama is taking a slight lead again, and I think that's directly tied to the notion of economic instability.",
        "So, what - in the short term, it looks as if what it's done is even things out, but in the long term, what you're talking about - who's most likely to benefit - that's a little less clear.",
        "It is clear that voters by, I think, it's two to one feel that Democrats - they'd prefer to have a Democrat handling the economy at this time.",
        "There's this question that's so interesting, I think, to a lot of the political strategists.",
        "They say, you know, typically Americans, when there's a real crisis, tend to think of Republicans as the ones who manage Wall Street, manage big corporations, manage business.",
        "And so, will they, if they think things are going to crater, go back to the Republicans, in fitting with that line of thinking?",
        "But then you also see that in some polls, Americans are looking toward the government to do more than it's done, perhaps, to do more in terms of regulation.",
        "Without a doubt, there's a sense that Wall Street went way over the line here.",
        "And I'm in Arkansas as I'm talking to you today, and I must tell you that, just in talking to people all around this state, and especially the political leaders, I'm surprised - Republican or Democrat - how angry people are at Wall Street, and how much they have a sense that Wall Street was involved in, you know, a gambling game with their money and has disappointed the country.",
        "So, regulation, I think, is part of this, but if Obama or McCain starts talking about heavy regulations, I think there's going to be a very quick backlash.",
        "Looking back over the week, which candidate has the advantage?",
        "Which candidate actually kind of captured this anger that you're talking about, that the voters are feeling?",
        "Well, I think without a doubt it's Barack Obama who captured the anger, because Barack Obama talked about the need for some regulation and also about the idea that the average person in the country is dealing with kitchen-table issues, ranging from healthcare to, you know, paying for retirement.",
        "John McCain make a huge misstep this week when he said that he thought the fundamentals of the U.S.",
        "economy were strong.",
        "His campaign immediately issued statements, got him in all sorts of TV stations, to say that he didn't mean quite that.",
        "But it was the wrong language at the wrong time, and he has since said, of course, we're in some sort of crisis.",
        "So, I think that if you're looking at how things are playing in the short run, advantage Obama.",
        "And what about the tone of the race?",
        "It seems to me that it's gotten a lot harsher.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, it's interesting.",
        "You know, there's a study down this week that found that, in fact, Senator Obama's ads have been far more negative over the last month than Senator McCain's.",
        "Now, when you say you pick up this negative tone in the campaign, I think what you're really also, you know, honing in on is the idea that we've only got about 50 days to go before Election Day, and in fact, in many parts of the country, you're going to have early voting.",
        "So, it's a very compact timeframe.",
        "I think people are so anxious about this election, and we have so many crises on our hands - from economic crisis to concern over the state of the war, not only in Iraq, but Afghanistan - that there is a sense of urgency beyond what we are accustomed to in politics, and that's why things have become so sharp."
