        "Now, Phillips is someone who's interested in interdisciplinary work.",
        "And so she teamed up with a bunch of neuroscientists at Stanford University to conduct this experiment where she had volunteers read a chapter of \"\"Mansfield Park.\"\" But she had the volunteers read the novel in two different ways.",
        "She had them first read the novel in this very casual way that you might to at a bookstore while you're browsing - skipping paragraphs, skipping sections.",
        "Checking Twitter on your phone.",
        "Checking Twitter, making sure you're updated.",
        "And then she had them read it in a very sustained and close manner, in a very focused way.",
        "And when she talked to a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist said, look, you're probably not going to see very much difference in the brain between these two types of reading.",
        "Everyone told me to expect these really, really minute and subtle effects, because everyone was going to be doing the same thing.",
        "And they were just going to be doing it in two different ways.",
        "That's what people expected, but what?",
        "So she started to find some really interesting things about the brain imaging.",
        "And, you know, I should say that we're fairly early in the study.",
        "The study hasn't been completed.",
        "But what she expected was if the difference between casual reading and closed reading is attention - in one case, you're paying attention, in one case, you're not - then the difference in the brain - areas of the brain that control attention should be heightened in one situation.",
        "What we found was actually something else entirely.",
        "What's been taking us by surprise in our early data analysis is how much the whole brain - global activations across a number of different regions - seems to be transforming and shifting between the pleasure and the close reading.",
        "So wait a minute.",
        "She is saying that when you are really absorbed in a book for a sustained period of time in a sustained way it engages your entire brain, which is what allows you to think that you could keep reading even as the house burned down.",
        "It looks like that.",
        "I mean, so if we step back for a second and think about brain imaging, a lot of brain imaging results are intuitively obvious.",
        "But in this situation, I think what's striking is that it wasn't just the part of the brain that focuses on attention that was different in the close reading."

        "OK.",
        "So what are the implications for us in this world where there are constant distractions, from television to e-mail to everything else?",
        "Well, I think what the study is showing, Steve, is that reading with you're your mind is not half as good as reading with your full focused mind.",
