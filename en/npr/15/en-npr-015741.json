        "People wanted a claim to water but often lived too far away from a river for the riparian doctrine to make any sense.",
        "So the prior appropriations doctrine was devised.",

        "It allocates rights based on who started using the water first.",
        "So if you're first in time, you are first in rights.",
        "And historically, it was based on a permitting process where you go and say, like, you know, you ask for the permit first so you became the first user.",
        "But then there's been a shift saying, you know, not first use strictly based on who asked for the permit first, but who was actually there first.",
        "And so the Indians or the Indian tribes who were there first, you know, may not have asked for a permit, but there's recognition now that they were the first users of water so they get that first appropriation.",
        "Prior appropriation has sparked controversy in Oregon.",
        "This week, water regulators ordered ranchers near the headwaters of the Klamath River in Southern Oregon to shut down their irrigation pumps.",
