        "And they will have an assembly in which they will vote on proposals, usually that meaning when they will leave the next morning, what route they will take.",

        "And they voted to not accept it.",
        "I spoke with migrants who just simply said their goal is to reach the United States.",

        "They're probably - they're moving about 40 miles a day, some days more, some days less.",
        "But that's still putting them probably late November at the earliest that they would get to the border at Tijuana.",
