        "We did a lot of the construction in the '20s - 1920s through the 1940s.",
        "Since those dams were constructed, demands on the water stored behind them in reservoirs has changed.",
        "That's certainly the case for the Chattahoochee River.",
        "It flows from the Georgia mountains through metro Atlanta, down Alabama, through Florida and then into the Gulf of Mexico.",
        "And as metro Atlantic expands, the city sucks more water out of the Lake Lanier Reservoir on the Chattahoochee, which means people living downstream in Alabama and Florida have less.",
        "And since the Army Corps of Engineers operates the four federal dams on this river, the Corps is right in the middle of the conflict.",
        "Operation orders come from Congress.",
        "They decide what the Army Corps should do based on compacts worked out between the three states.",
        "But, says General Walsh...",
        "In this case, the Congress did put a compact together, and they did work for, I think, five to eight years to see if they can work through that.",
        "The states couldn't and have been bringing lawsuits against the Corps of Engineers and other federal agencies to prevent us from updating the water control plan until they come to some agreement.",

        "It really began when the Corps of Engineers, which operates the dams that control the lakes above Atlanta, started to think about revising how it was going to manage those dams.",
        "And, of course, that means there's going to be a difference in how much water goes downstream.",
        "And so Georgia's neighboring states - Alabama and Florida - were paying very close attention.",
        "And ultimately, all of that ended up in court.",
        "And the court battle went on for literally over 22 years."

        "These river basins are not following political boundaries.",
        "And they flow from one state to another and from one community to another, and there's a lot of tension over how much water is going to be available for everybody to do all the things that we need to do with these rivers.",

        "The Flint River is a companion river to the Chattahoochee, and it's basically been put in a permanent state of man-made drought because of all of the water withdrawals that happen from that river.",

        "Are there any lessons for water resource management that the rest of the country can learn from what's been going on with the Chattahoochee as an example?",

        "I think we really need to start thinking about how we're growing, where we're growing and whether there's enough water available to sustain that growth.",
        "And that's not something that we have been used to doing in the past.",
        "It's been much more opportunistic, and the water supply issue has been more of an afterthought than a forethought.",
        "And so I think one lesson is just to put good management policies in place on the front end so that you're not trying to play catch-up.",
        "That is something that will ultimately guarantee good, sustainable economic growth as well as better environmental health for these river systems.",
        "That's Gil Rogers of the Southern Environmental Law Center.",
        "Two rivers on opposite sides of the country - the Chattahoochee and the Klamath - may provide lessons for the inevitable and growing dispute over how we manage our most precious resource: water."
