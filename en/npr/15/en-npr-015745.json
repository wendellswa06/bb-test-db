        "Well, hello Elijah.",
        "I'm wondering - you comment it's mostly guys who set out like that, and I think you're right.",

        "…you are prey.",
        "Well, that's absolutely true, but I have to say having just finished this tour, I've developed a somewhat nuanced position, because - and I'm really not exaggerating here - every single reading I've done, more women than men have come up to tell me their hitchhiking stories.",
        "Interesting.",
        "So I'm beginning to realize, you know, I'm staying that the myth that I grew up with is of young guys setting out to seek their fortune.",
        "But the fact is, I have no idea whether there really are that many more men than women hitchhiking, because women get rides so quickly that you wouldn't see them out there.",
        "That's a good point.",
        "Like everybody else, I judge who's out there by who I see standing by the highway, which is to say, the failures.",

        "You know, nobody ever comments on that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's one of the greatest feelings on earth.",

        "And this guy, he had scar tissue all in his face, and I began to witness to him and he just started crying.",
        "And I had a horseshoe cross on, and I gave it to him, and, you know, put him out where he could catch his next ride and everything, and it was just a wonderful experience.",

        "I actually, my longest ride on the trip I wrote about was a woman truck driver.",
        "So, I, you know, the big difference you see is legal differences.",

        "And that, obviously, can make it a lot easier.",
        "You know, but, honestly, in the old days - you know, I started hitchhiking in the ‘70s - and for awhile, when I hitchhiked in Montana I constantly got rides from women and never got rides from women anywhere else outside of Massachusetts.",
        "But when I say constantly, you know, I'm talking probably a total of five rides.",

        "Yeah.",
        "One of the things I found fascinating about your book was the distinction you drew between hitchhikers and those other knights of the road, the hobos - who, men who often ride the rails.",
        "Sure.",
        "It's a very, very different experience, and a very, very different culture, because riding the rails can be social.",
        "I mean, I was just talking - I, in fact, just picked up a hitchhiker last week.",
        "And he was saying he was about to make a trip on the trains and he was taking a bunch of friends with him.",
        "And you just can't do that when you hitchhike.",
        "So that hoboing has a whole culture.",
        "They have songs, they camp together, they live together, and hitchhikers don't do that.",

        "Yeah, well, that's from the 1920s.",
        "That used to be how they divided things up - ‘20s or ‘30s - and you see that quote over and over again.",
        "And hitchhikers have always sort of been apart from that, because frankly, an awful lot of hitchhikers - I mean, if you're going to jump on the trains, first of all you have to know trains, and second of all you have to be willing to be absolutely filthy and not associate with regular people until you get cleaned up.",
        "Most hitchhikers through the years have been, you know, regular, ordinary people who just happen to need a ride for a minute.",
        "The number of real long-range hitchhikers is just a small fraction of people who've actually, you know, hitchhiked now and then.",

        "Yes, I had a couple points.",
        "I wanted to agree with him about how people will invite you into their car, and it's usually is not because they're just filling kind, they want to give you a ride.",
        "They want to share your experience.",
        "And once you get in their car a lot of times, it kind of grows and now you're both on this journey.",
        "And my experience was not so much of getting picked up by the wrong person.",
        "It was, nine times out of ten I was not getting a ride because they thought I was the wrong person.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And I really felt - I was hitchhiking in the mid-90s, and you could just tell that it wasn't the same, it wasn't the cliché that I thought it was once I got into it.",
        "It was a much different.",
        "It was a lot more, it wasn't as - I think it was more cold now than it used to be in the ‘70s when it was more accepted.",
        "And now, it kind of is a risk.",
        "People are very hesitant.",
        "Like you said, we live in a paranoid America now.",

        "And I'm carrying a guitar and I have a big smile on my face.",
        "And I'm not a big burley guy.",
        "I mean, I'm six-feet tall, but I'm reasonably slim.",
        "So, you know, I look less dangerous than a lot of people.",
        "And I'm white.",
        "You know, if I were black or younger or bigger, it would undoubtedly be a very different experience.",
        "I am a big burley guy, and I once spent three and a half days at the same exit in Redding, California."
