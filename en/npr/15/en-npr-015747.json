        "She's got kids ranging from college age to sixth grade, and she's been able to enroll them in school and so - in that way at least, life is getting back to normal.",
        "What about the infrastructure down there, Farai, and all that goes on in just trying to logistically get around the town.",
        "I understand that things as simple as street signs aren't even up, so it's sometimes hard to even navigate your way there.",
        "It is.",
        "I mean sometimes - you know, a lot of times myself and this time producer Devon Robbins(ph) were down there.",
        "And I'd say, what was that?",
        "Because on one side, the side we were driving on, there'd be no sign but sometimes there'd be a sign facing the other direction, so she'd have to turn around in the seat and try to look over her shoulder and she'd be like, oh yeah, that was our street, we missed it.",
        "We did a lot of U-turns.",
        "And what really struck me the most is that the electricity goes off, the water goes off or there's no water.",

        "Yeah.",

        "It's a clearing house for virtually every international banking transaction.",

        "SWIFT is an international means of transmitting financial information about financial transactions between banks and financial institutions around the world.",
        "It's nothing more than a gateway to passing information from one institution to another.",
        "And what kind of information does it have?",
        "It has information about financial transactions.",
        "So if I wanted to send money from my bank in London to your bank in - I guess you're in Los Angeles, I think, aren't you?",
        "I would just ask my bank to send specific sum of money to your bank and as long as I had the coordinates of your bank, they would send the message from my bank, which would go to my correspondent bank in New York and my correspondent bank in New York would connect to your correspondent bank in New York.",
        "And they in turn would then pass that message on to your bank wherever you happened to be.",
        "And does it give any information, any identifying information as to who is sending this?",
        "And where the person is?",
        "Yes, the amount of information that is in the message depends entirely on the person making the remittance.",
        "The SWIFT requirements are quite detailed.",
        "They like to have as much information as possible about the person making the remittance, and - well, in the sense of obviously name the account from which it's coming, the account to which it's going, and the amount of money that's being transferred and the currency that it's being transferred in.",
        "Now, what does happen sometimes is that you don't always have to fill up every single field in the form because as long as you have the basic information in the instructions form then the transaction will still go through.",
        "And so could SWIFT be a pretty effective tool in trying to uncover terrorist financing?",
        "Well, it's a very difficult question.",
        "Insofar as any investigation looking for terrorist financing is concerned, it's going to be an effective use of investigator's time.",
        "One of the things I think we have to recognize is that, you know, terrorists, generally speaking, are very efficient organizations and they generally tend not to use names and identifiable features which would necessarily automatically track back to a government agency.",
        "So what you - you would still need to be able to have knowledge of the names or the aliases under which these people were operating in order to be able to identify any transactions that are taking place.",
        "And as the Los Angeles Times noted today, al-Qaida is using a less formal means of transferring money, not even going through the SWIFT program.",
        "There are many forms of transmitting money which don't have to use the SWIFT system.",
        "SWIFT is a legitimate and genuine source of investigation for any investigator and certainly would be something which I would be shocked and horrified if I discovered that the U.S.",
        "government had not used that avenue of investigation.",
        "But I don't believe it will necessarily give them all the answers they're looking for."

        "A little further to the west was another Shia area but much more of a militant zone, where the militias of the rebel cleric Moqtada al-Sadr posed demonstration.",
        "Yet they too voted.",
        "Most interestingly, though, was an area right to the west of the city, nestled close to the largest American military base in the country at Baghdad Airport.",

        "Where Zarqawi and his al-Qaeda forces very much have had the upper hand in the command and control of the insurgency thanks to money and their fierce zealotry, we've watched as we've seen the balance shift back in the favor of the Iraqi nationalists--that's the Baath Party--and more moderate Iraqi Islamists.",
        "They now can say, `We want to engage in this political process.",
        "It's been part of their intention since day one to track bullets and ballots strategy, very classic guerrilla style.",
        "They've told Zarqawi, `We're participating.",
        "You must stand back.",
        "So just like we saw in the October referendum there when they participated as nationalists, they forced Zarqawi to stand off and there was no suicide bombings on that day, nor today."

        "Well, there's been enormous concerns about the integrity of these voting processes, both from the original January 30 election, again on the referendum day in October, and I'm sure there's much more yet to emerge from today in terms of allegations.",

        "Security was fairly tight, although the interesting thing about it here in Fallujah is that it was provided almost entirely, at the polling stations at least, by the Iraqi police.",

        "And the other thing they want, very clearly, just about everyone we talked to, was for US troops to withdraw from their cities and eventually to withdraw from Iraq entirely.",
        "And the only difference was--among voters was the timetable for that.",
        "Some wanted it to happen immediately; others said, you know, not right away because the security situation doesn't warrant a complete withdrawal, but we do want it eventually.",

        "Absolutely.",

        "The Sunnis are still a small minority of Iraq's population; some estimates place them under 20 percent of the population as a whole.",
        "So even if they do elect representatives in proportion of their share of the population, it's not entirely clear that they'll be able to enact much of an agenda once they get through a legislature.",
        "And the concern, I guess, is that once these people who have boycotted politics and are now participating--if they're disillusioned by the fact that their representatives aren't able to bring about the changes that they want to see, the question then becomes whether or not they will stay and sort of embrace in the political process or turn to other means of resistance.",
