        "It's still very much in evidence.",
        "There are mosques with shattered minarettess, houses that look like the roofs have been caved in by bombs, and plenty of the city certainly has not yet been rebuilt.",
        "And local leaders say that they think it will be at least another several years and hundreds more millions of dollars before the fully rebuilt city will be realized.",

        "It was pretty quiet.",
        "There was no violence to speak of.",
        "There was a pretty good turnout to the polls.",
        "Southern Iraq, as you know, is a largely Shiite area, and the Shiites here are very anxious to ensure that they select the Shiite religious list to head the next government, to be the largest party in the next parliament, so that they can select a prime minister.",
        "The Shiites, of course, were oppressed viciously for many years under the Saddam Hussein regime, and they're anxious for their day in the spotlight.",
        "and they considered today the day to ensure that, at least for the next four years.",
        "The Shia-dominated alliance, while they were largely in control of the temporary parliament elected last January, along with their allies from Kurdistan, at this point is the alliance as strong as it used to be?"

        "The alliance is probably not going to get quite the same proportion of seats that it had in the temporary government, only because--or mainly because the Sunnis have decided to join this election and has watered down the proportions a little bit.",

        "It's not monolithic by any stretch of the imagination.",
        "The secular candidates had hoped that secretly, once voters were in the ballots--in the voting booth down here, they would reject the religious candidates and vote for non-religious, secular candidates.",
        "But there's no indication that that's occurred, at least from the exit polls and from the conversations I've had with people down here.",
        "The secular candidates and others who fear the domination of this religious Shiite alliance raised the specter of Iraq or at least oil-rich southern Iraq becoming more and more like Iran.",
        "And, in fact, if you move around Basra, as I did today, you see scenes that look a lot like Iran.",
        "All the women are in the black hijabs; liquor stores have been forcibly closed down; students who were dancing at a picnic recently by themselves, by the way, were set upon and beaten by religious enforcers.",
        "So this is the sort of vision that alarms some people--many people in Iraq and certainly was not the vision that the Americans had when they invaded this country.",
