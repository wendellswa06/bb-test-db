        "They knew they would split the audience; he appealed to the same audience, and so they sat around and they argued, and in the end, DreamWorks went with its movie on Christmas, and Miramax had no choice but to yield even though its numbers were slightly better.",

        "troops to begin withdrawing from Afghanistan.",
        "Administration officials stress the pace of withdrawals will be based on conditions on the ground.",
        "But the suggestion of a U.S.",
        "pullout gives Pakistan and opportunity to exert more influence in Afghanistan, says Munoz.",
        "In the past they've tried to do that by supporting the Taliban, but I think that there's a strong element within the Pakistani government that says well, we can have even more influence in Afghanistan if we become involved in the peace process - and we help channel it and we help dictate the terms.",
        "Bill Roggio, a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and the editor of The Long War Journal website, says Karzai is also hedging his bets.",
        "I think he's really acting based on what he's seeing from the United States, the lack of support or the lack of long-term commitment.",

        "isn't going to be the powerbroker in a couple of years, if he thinks that going to be the Taliban, that's the one he's going to try and cut a deal with."
