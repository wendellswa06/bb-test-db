        "They were the PG-rated \"\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\"\" and the R-rated \"\"The Wedding Crashers.\"\" Both of these movies targeted very different audiences, and that's done on purpose.",
        "Movie studios have worked out a system so that they don't open similar movies on the same weekend, thereby splitting their audience.",
        "Here to explain the system is Edward Jay Epstein.",

        "And, Edward, tell us about this system.",
        "Do the studio heads just get together and divvy up the calendar?",
        "They basically use the same information, and let me say, this is perfectly legal and above board.",
        "They all subscribe to a research service called NRG, and this research service--it stands for National Research Group--collects information, does telephone polls, divides the audience in different groups, see which groups are being appealed to, looks at movies that could open on the same weekend and issues a competitive positioning report.",
        "This report then goes to the studio distribution heads.",
        "They look at it and they see, `Oh, if we open our movie on this weekend, we're going to split the audience with a rival.",
        "It's that simple.",
        "But would they actually need this fancy research?",
        "Couldn't you pretty much get that \"\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\"\" would appeal to the family audience?",
        "Well, here's the brilliant thing: All six studios get the same data, see the same numbers and thus, they know that if they're second, they'd better do something, such as open on another weekend.",
        "It makes it a lot easier than each company acting independently.",
        "So let's take an example, the movies \"\"War of the Worlds,\"\" \"\"Batman Begins\"\" and \"\"Fantastic Four,\"\" all similar, big-budget action movies, but only one opened on the coveted July 4 weekend, and that was \"\"War of the Worlds.\"\" So how did that beat out the other two?",
        "Well, when they looked at the NRG competitive positioning reports and the telephone tracking studies, \"\"War of the Worlds\"\" won in every category.",
        "Batman Begins\"\" came in second and the \"\"Fantastic Four\"\" appealed only to young teen-agers.",
        "So they now knew that if they all opened on the Fourth of July weekend, \"\"War of the Worlds\"\" would win hands down, and they would look terrible.",
        "So \"\"Batman Begins\"\" moved earlier while \"\"Fantastic Four\"\" moved later.",
        "So all three came in first on their respective weekend, and all three could advertise themselves as America's number one movie."
