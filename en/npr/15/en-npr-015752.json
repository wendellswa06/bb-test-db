        "A lot of investors just don't think it's been well-managed.",
        "And that really intensified this fall when Citigroup's merger with Wachovia fell apart, and since then, its stock has just been plummeting.",
        "It was down to below $4 a share on Friday.",
        "And when a company share price falls that much, it has a lot of trouble raising money.",

        "We're talking with NPR's Jim Zarroli about the federal government plan to send another $20 billion to Citigroup.",
        "And Jim, I think some people may be asking a question about fairness, because you said, this is a company that some investors think has been poorly managed, and yet now there's been $45 billion plus loan guarantees and another benefits sent to Citigroup, which is a good deal larger than the amount that the entire auto industry was asking for last week, and they were rejected."
