        "Pat Roberts, Republican from Kansas, gave a passionate defense of this program on the Senate floor recently.",
        "Simply, crop insurance allows producers a way to manage risk so they can continue to provide a stable and secure food supply, and pass their operations on to their children.",
        "And if that isn't a success story of the partnership between government, private industry and America's farmers, I really don't know what is.",
        "Sounds reasonable.",
        "It's a floor - we don't want to see farmers go out of business because of one disastrous when there's a drought or a flood.",
        "Well, yes and no, but not everybody is convinced that this is the perfect partnership between government and farmers because these insurance policies don't work the way traditional insurance works.",
        "It's not like your car insurance or your home insurance.",
        "With crop insurance, a farmer buys a policy but doesn't have to pay the premium.",
        "It turns out we do.",
        "Taxpayers pick up about 60 percent of the cost.",
        "In essence, we're subsidizing the cost of buying insurance.",
        "And we, the taxpayer, also pick up a lot of the administrative and operating fees.",
        "On top of this, farmers don't just get a pay-out if they lose their crop due bad weather, they also can make claims when prices of their crops dip.",
        "So essentially, by insuring against significant price drops, farmers can lock in a guaranteed price.",
        "And critics say, this in essence takes away much of the risk of farming.",
        "Well, has this actually happened, though?",
        "Have farmers actually gotten payouts for losses of the kind that Allison just described, Dan?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Actually, last year was a really good example of this.",
        "You'll remember there was a big drought across the Midwest.",
        "The corn and soybean harvest went way down.",
        "As a result, prices went way up.",
        "And here's the thing.",
        "Corn and soybean farmers got to pocket the extra income by selling their crop at those high prices.",
        "And they also got big insurance payouts because of the low yield.",
        "Many of them made more money in that drought year than they would have made in a year with normal rainfall.",
        "And a good chunk of that extra income came from the federal government, through crop insurance.",
        "A lot of people say that is not what the program should be doing, it's a waste of taxpayer money."

        "Allison, other ramifications of this?",
        "Well, one criticism is that with so much of a price guarantee, farmers take risks they normally wouldn't take if it were purely a market-driven economy.",
        "I spoke to Scott Faber of the Environmental Working Group, an organization that is pushing for reform of crop insurance.",
        "When the government is guaranteeing you 85 percent of your income, it suddenly makes a whole lot more sense to farm in places that might flood or might have low soil moisture, might not have been practical to farm if you simply had your own skin in the game.",
        "So basically he's saying farming in wetland area or other environmentally sensitive lands, that crop insurance as structured now, encourages this.",
        "So what's happening now?",
        "Are members of Congress listening to critics or listening to the farmers?",
        "Who seems to be gaining?",
        "Well, there are critics who say if the government is in this business - and probably there's a good reason for there to be crop insurance - it should just be a bare bones kind of insurance that would keep farmers from going under in a bad year.",
        "Maybe make up, say, 70 percent of their income.",
        "But actually, what's happening now is that crop insurance is about to get bigger.",
        "Both the House and the Senate Agriculture Committees are adding a sort of whole new program on top of crop insurance to make these insurance programs even more generous.",
        "And at the same time, Food Stamps and other nutrition assistance programs are being cut significantly.",
        "So the question critics such as Taxpayers for Common Sense are asking is this, at a time that the farm economy is quite strong, land prices are near record high, crop prices are strong: Does it make sense to subsidize farmers to this extent, especially the biggest, wealthiest players in agribusiness?",
        "That's NPR's Allison Aubrey and Dan Charles.",
        "Thanks to both of you."

        "No operating room tech, no nurses.",
        "That's what we're looking at.",

        "That's a story for a different day.",
        "Brown's talking about Florida's courts, which are in a budget crisis - one that could require employee furloughs and fewer support personnel for already overworked judges.",
        "The problem, says Judge Brown, is that the courts are funded through filing fees, and in recent years most of those filing fees have come from foreclosures, which have temporarily slowed down in Florida.",
        "Because the foreclosure filings have stopped, because of what has gone on in that industry, the filing fees have substantially been reduced.",
        "Florida's Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles Canady recently appealed to the legislature and to Governor Rick Scott for help.",
        "Canady asked them to approve a plan to cover a $72 million budget shortfall projected for the state courts between now and June 30.",
        "Without the money, Canady says, court functions across the state will be disrupted.",
        "The criminal cases would have to receive priority, so the civil cases would be subjected to the disruption.",
        "And that would be very bad for our economy and bad for the citizens of Florida.",
        "Chief Judge in the 11th Circuit Joel Brown says the proposed cuts raise a basic question about the intent of the governor and the legislature.",
        "It's a question of willingness, frankly, to fund an independent third branch of government - fully."

        "The work is treacherous because the bottom is filled with camping gear and the contents of RVs that were ripped apart by the water, their guts spewing down the river for miles.",

        "There's one place we just went, and there's what's left of, like, a trailer house, probably 30 foot long.",
