        "In each and every case, correctional authorities seem surprised or seem, indeed, outraged that prisoners would eventually explode in frustration that their needs aren't being met.",
        "And so it is really time that we learn the lesson of Vaughn, but also Attica in '71 and many prisons before that.",
        "It seems as though these are actually relatively rare.",
        "Is that true or is it that we just don't find out about them?",
        "It's so hard to know.",
        "One of the most remarkable things is that prisons are public institutions, and yet the public is given very, very little information about what goes on inside of them.",
        "For example, a few weeks ago, there was a lockdown at the Attica prison.",
        "And the public was just told that there had been some inmate fights, but we know enough about Attica to know that conditions there (unintelligible) been terrible and to know that the prisoners very likely were engaging in some sort of protest there as well.",
        "So we don't really know because every time the state officials get to tell us what happened, and there's no means to corroborate it.",
        "And when you say that conditions are terrible, could you give us a sense of what it is that you're talking about?",
        "So even more so than when there was a rash of uprisings in the '60s, prisons now are even more overcrowded, prisoners serve much more solitary confinement.",
        "This particular facility in Delaware, incidentally, is notorious for that.",
        "They are punished through food, kept locked up for 23 hours a day.",
        "A jury says if you've committed a crime, you might serve time.",
        "But this is beyond the being removed from society.",
        "Do you know anything more about the prison that you could tell us that might have led to this particular incident?",
        "I do know that it's a facility that was actually built in '71, but was expanded pretty dramatically in 1996, not coincidentally with funding from this very notorious now violent crime bill that was passed with the Clinton administration.",
        "And so it was a facility like many around the country that just grew and grew and grew and, indeed, began eventually to hold way too many people in too small of a space and, indeed, you know, creating a situation that was very, very dangerous for corrections officers and prisoners alike.",
        "That's Heather Ann Thompson.",

        "She's author of the book \"\"Blood In The Water: The Attica Prison Uprising Of 1971 And Its Legacy.\"\" We reached her via Skype from Detroit.",
        "Professor Thompson, thanks so much for speaking with us.",
        "Thank you so much.",
        "And now for another political story in the news this week - on Thursday, President Bill Clinton announced that the Clinton Foundation would no longer accept foreign and corporate contributions if Hillary Clinton wins in November.",

        "KATY O'DONNELL: So this is coming from the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, which brought a lawsuit against the State Department over various transparency issues, but they got these emails in court, I think, at the end of last month.",
        "Fourty-four of the emails in the latest cache that they released were related to Clinton and had not been turned over.",
        "The emails that are raising questions about the foundation are, you know, an email from a foundation official seeking access for this major donor.",
        "And then there are a few recommendations for jobs.",
        "But it's that kind of special access given to somebody who gave a lot of money that raises questions and presents problems for ethicists.",
        "So before becoming secretary of state in 2009, Hillary Clinton agreed to separate her activities at the State Department from those at the Clinton Foundation.",
        "Why has this issue resurfaced now?",
        "O'DONNELL: Well, first of all, the agreement that they signed in 2009, I mean, you know, is very specific.",
        "And there's - it's not clear that the actual agreement has been broken in a legal sense, but there have been lapses.",
        "So when they said that they would disclose all of their donors, for instance, that actually didn't happen.",
        "So given that she did promise this firewall the last time that she went into government, and the firewall proved to be sort of permeable, there are many concerns that their promises for more transparency, etc. should she become president would not really hold up.",
        "Well, Renee, we visited a number of polling places around the city, from some very upscale neighborhoods to one that was just outside the big slum called Cité Soleil.",
        "And that's where we saw some things that definitely wouldn't pass muster in the United States.",
        "For one thing, polling stations opened quite late, and that may have just discouraged some people from voting.",
        "Polls were supposed to open at about six in the morning, and many of them were delayed for anywhere from two to four hours.",
        "The head of the European Unions Observer Mission, Johan Van Hecke, he's a Belgian, told us that part of the problem with this particular polling station was that it had no electricity, and the election workers were unable to get set up in the dark.",
        "He said also that the workers were simply overwhelmed by the sheer number of people who showed up so early.",
        "One big problem I saw was that there was no plan for crowd control, so people were packed into a big, sort of unfinished concrete building.",
        "There were no lines.",
        "People were forced to try to line themselves up, and there was a lot of pushing and shoving, and after waiting for hours, they might get to the head of the line and find that their name weren't on the list.",
        "The crowds also meant that there was no place where people could secretly mark their ballots.",
        "I mean, we could clearly see how people were voting from where we stood.",
        "And we met at least one election worker who was openly partisan.",
        "He was a young man who was watching the ballot boxes and said he was counting on the victory of former president Rene Preval.",
        "Remind us just briefly why Cité Soleil would be so important?",
        "And I also happen to gather that folks there had complained about the location of their polling places right from the beginning.",
        "They were worried.",
        "Yes, they did.",
        "Cité Soleil is controlled by armed gangs, or that is the U.N.",
