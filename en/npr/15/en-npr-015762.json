        "Like a lot of people in the music business, Rosenthal puts the blame on rampant online piracy.",
        "Here's the music of Steve Roach, an artist on Rosenthal's label.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF STEVE ROACH SONG)",
        "He's pretty much lived his life to create art.",
        "He is really dedicated to it.",
        "He puts a lot of time into his work, and also money into the studio to have the best possible album.",
        "And according to Rosenthal, Roach's albums regularly sold 50,000 to 60,000 copies.",
        "That was before the days of massive file sharing on the internet.",
        "Now a quick search on Google will take you to sites where you can download a copy of Roach's music for free.",
        "And here's where Rosenthal gets angry about copyright law - Google is not responsible for taking down links to the pirated song unless Roach or his label let Google know it's there.",
        "Producer Rosenthal says it's tough to play internet detective for all the artists on his label, especially since every time one illegal link gets taken down, another one pops up.",
        "And it's a really unreasonable expectation that I would have the time to chase people all day when I should be running a business and making music.",
        "The problem, says Rosenthal, is the safe harbor provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.",
        "It was written when Congress was revising the copyright laws in 1998 to account for the growing presence of the internet.",
        "It was a system designed for a different age.",
        "It's like traffic rules for carriages with horses, and you have autonomous cars now.",
        "Jim Burger is a copyright attorney who represented several tech companies when the law was being drafted.",
        "In 1998, Google had just been founded and there was no YouTube.",
        "The concern that Congress clearly had in mind was it did not want to throttle or chill innovation and expansion of the internet.",
        "And they didn't want the overhang of copyright lawsuits.",
        "Of course, now Google is one of the most valuable companies in the world.",
        "That's why producer Rosenthal and many other artists think Google and other internet giants should be made legally responsible for finding unauthorized files and taking them down."

        "And if they were really on the side of the creators, they would do something about that.",

        "Artists can register their songs with Google's Content ID, which locates uploads of their music, and artists can run ads over the video.",

        "We send the majority of advertising revenue associated with our content out to rights holders.",
        "So we're actually seeing this become a very serious, real economic revenue stream.",
        "Serious to the tune of $2 billion paid out since YouTube launched Content ID a decade ago.",
        "One billion of that has come in the last two years.",
        "But according to the Recording Industry Association of America, last year revenue from Google-YouTube went up 17 percent while the number of plays on YouTube went up over 100 percent.",
        "And Content ID doesn't work for Google search, which artists say continues to bring up links to sites that list pirated versions of their songs.",

        "Looking back on his boyhood in a black township, Archbishop Tutu remembers an urchin with a fondness for marbles and comic books, which led me to ask: Did you like going to church as a child?",
