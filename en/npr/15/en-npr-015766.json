        "The delicacy made of goose or duck livers - the standard practice is to fatten them by force feeding - has been banned in the state since 2012 thanks to a state law passed back in 2004.",
        "The decision to lift the ban wasn't a judgment about whether the practice is animal cruelty or not.",
        "It has to do with state versus federal jurisdiction over food products.",
        "After the ban went into effect in 2012, it was challenged by a group of foie gras producers in Canada and New York and a group of three restaurants, including Hot's Kitchen here in Hermosa Beach.",
        "Lawyer Michael Tenenbaum represented all three plaintiffs.",
        "There are certain culinary hubs around the country.",
        "California happens to have a lot of them - LA, San Francisco, Napa.",
        "And so this was about 25 percent of the market for my Canadian clients and about 20 to 25 percent of the market for Hudson Valley in New York.",
        "So there was a huge economic impact when the ban went into effect.",
        "And we're now going to hopefully see the restoration of all this - these sales."

        "And so Frank and Bill Watson came up with a theory that local vigilantes, perhaps with the blessing of the contractor Phillip Duffy, simply came into the forest and killed all the workers, believing it was the only way to keep the cholera from spreading.",
