        "We're hoping - the hope to find them alive has dwindled quite a bit.",
        "And we're hoping that we can find where they're at so they can recover them and not have to leave them in there and just seal the mine off.",
        "Of course we're hoping that they can - a miracle will happen and they can find them alive, but it's very dim."

        "And if they barricaded themselves off, which they're taught to do, they could have sealed in some good air.",

        "They've gotten a lot better, and they also charge a lot faster now.",
        "One of the issues with rechargeables in the past was that you really had to think ahead and recharge them ahead of time, and it could take all night to do it, and also the pricing.",
        "And we've seen both of those things resolve to some degree.",
        "Energizer has a set of batteries that can charge in 15 minutes.",
        "And Duracell has even more instant gratification.",
        "All of their rechargeables now come pre-charged.",
        "You just load them out of the box, put them in your devices, and you're good to go.",
        "Well, let's talk about what might very well be a popular tech gift where you could use some of those batteries and a gift that might have broken the bank last year but seems to have gotten much less expensive this year.",
        "I'm talking about digital picture frames.",
        "I seem to see these things everywhere I go.",
        "Right.",

        "Kodak's EasyShare line of picture frames tends to get really good reviews and the prices start at only $50.",
        "Some of them even have Wi-Fi built in, so you can stream photos from your computer or from an online service like Picasa or Flickr.",
        "And you want a picture frame that has at least 640 by 480 pixel resolution.",
        "Otherwise, your photos might be little grainy.",
        "Digital picture frames are a wonderful way to preserve family memories when you've already got those memories on your computer.",
        "But we've got a lot of listeners who are writing in and asking for help saving their old VHS home movies, transferring those so that they're also stored in their computer.",
        "Any help for those folks?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, we've all got old media lying around.",
        "We've got vinyl albums or VHS tapes or cassettes, but a lot of us don't even have the devices to be able to play them anymore.",
        "So, there are companies like Ion Audio that put out devices that allow you to interface that old media with your new computer.",
        "They have a line of turntables, cassette decks, even VCRs that can plug into a computer.",
        "Transfer all of that old information and convert it into digital files.",
        "They usually cost between 100 and 200 dollars, and they usually come with the software to convert it as well."

        "There was a big drop-off as Congress kind of tightened the laws, but quarter by quarter, bankruptcy filings are on the rise.",
