        "That's right, we've moved into a phase, if you will, of the counterterrorism war, more than decade old now, that the president is trying to redefine.",
        "He's not just reiterating the policy that we've had, but he is trying to adjust it to a world in which al-Qaida is a different kind of threat.",
        "He's saying it's still a threat, there are still many people who want to kill as many Americans as they possibly can, as the president said, but it is a different kind of organization.",
        "It's much more diffuse.",
        "It doesn't have the same centrality, it doesn't have the same effectiveness that it had at its peak, and we need to adjust the way we fight it, and we also need to adjust the way we fight it because of the negative effects that the war itself has had on the United States internally, on our image around the world, on our standing in Muslim countries in particular, and because of the divisiveness of the issue within our own domestic self-conception.",
        "And Dina Temple-Raston, he also called for changes in the way those threats are addressed, in particular on the principal use of the principal weapon in counterterrorism operations, the armed, unmanned aircraft known as drones.",
        "Known as drones, the first time that we've seen a really comprehensive explanation of the way they're used, the way that they actually make decisions, and in particular we heard for the first time from the president an explanation of why Americans have been targeted by the drone program and that in the future he says that the threshold for targeting people is going to be higher."
