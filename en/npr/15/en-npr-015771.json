        "How on earth did a country go from communism to oligarchy so fast?",
        "Lukas Alpert, who covers foreign investment for The Wall Street Journal, says to understand, you have to go back to the collapse of communist Russia 23 years ago.",
        "What happened right after the fall of the Soviet Union was the government needed to privatize quite dramatically and quite quickly because they needed revenue, and they were looking to just unload everything that they owned, which was everything.",
        "So many of the most prime factories and mines and very valuable sort of entities ended up in the hands of a few people who either had access to a lot of capital or had political clout.",
        "And these people ended up with these companies for very little money, and these companies generate billions of dollars a year in revenue.",
        "So they became very rich very quickly.",
        "And it's held that way since the end of the Soviet Union.",
        "Now, people talk about a wealth disparity in this country, but it's nothing compared to what you describe.",
        "Can you give people a sense of the disparity there, you know, between these super rich people you're describing and the average Russian?",
        "Well, according to the report, which was put out by Credit Suisse, basically 93.7 percent of the Russian population has wealth that's measured at less than $10,000.",
        "So that's almost the entire population.",
        "And then you have the, you know, the group that is worth more than a million dollars is literally .1 percent of the population.",
        "So you have 110 people who, according to Forbes, billionaires, and some of them go up to 18 billion, 17 billion.",
        "And you add them up, and that actually adds up to a substantial chunk of the overall wealth of the country, which is $1.2 trillion.",
        "And how does that compare with the rest of the world?",
        "Is any country even close to that?",
        "The difference here is you're not talking about people who have infiltrated the country and gotten a hold of lethal weapons of one kind or another, even if that's an improvised weapon such as an airplane in the 9/11 instance.",
        "You're talking about people who have really become part of American society.",
        "They have been here for so long and been here under legitimate circumstances, and they have in a very real sense Americanized or so seemed to have done.",
        "And these people, of course, are much more difficult to detect.",
        "They are in a sense almost, if you will, homegrown, even if they were not necessarily born in the United States.",
        "And therefore, it is more of a criminal matter, if you will, but it's still terrorism.",
        "It is both.",
        "There's a kind of hybridization, if you will, of motivation."

        "The first is that he's willing to consider some sort of military commission in the United States.",
        "And the second is that he'll be lifting a moratorium that basically has made it - it was his own moratorium, a presidential order, that made it...",
        "He put the blame on Congress, but...",
        "Well, there were two.",
        "There's the blame on Congress for not being able to transfer detainees into this country and elsewhere, but he also - there are people who are already cleared from Yemen, 56 people from Yemen, and he made clear that that's going to be a key group that he's going to look at and review and possibly send home.",
        "So that's a big step too, given that there are over 100 detainees at Guantanamo right now who are on a hunger strike precisely because they said they felt they were forgotten.",
        "He spoke with some passion on the issue - ask yourself if this is an America we want to see 10 or 20 years from now, holding people outside of our country without charge.",
        "He was not the only one who spoke with passion.",
        "There was a heckler who spoke at length from the audience.",

        "Yeah, well, each person basically indicates what candidate they like best of all on the ballot.",

        "But there are situations where you've got more than two strong candidates out there and then you get into all these votes splitting and spoilers, and you can often have a situation where the most popular candidate doesn't win.",
        "So a lot of people - like theorists who have looked into this - say that there really are fairer ways to vote, and we should be looking into that.",

        "How do you fundamentally define fairness?",
        "What does fairness mean to you?",
        "It's really that everyone's vote should count exactly the way they want it to count.",

        "But what they got in Florida, they tipped the vote from Gore to Bush and they got a conservative president.",

        "Both Barack Obama and John McCain have been promoting a system known as instant runoff voting.",
        "And this is a system where you rank the candidates, like 1,2,3.",
        "And if you vote for one of these third party candidates who has no chance of winning, your ballot would actually count for the major party candidate you've ranked higher.",
        "So if you like Nader but you ranked Obama second, your vote would count towards Obama.",
        "Robert, what do you think about this?",

        "Well let me put it this way.",
        "Back in 1991, older Americans, those over 55, were about eight percent of all the people filing for bankruptcy.",
        "Today, they're about 25 percent of those filing for bankruptcy.",
        "It's been a real shift in the demographics.",

        "The median age in bankruptcy has increased in the same time period by about seven years.",
        "So what about the baby boom.",
        "I mean, wouldn't you expect more bankruptcy filings at these ages because there are just more people at that age?",
        "Oh, we've already done those adjustments and already accounted for the fact that the boomers are a big group.",
        "If I weren't accounting for the boomers as a big group, you'd be reporting some staggering numbers.",
        "As it is, I think these numbers show an increased vulnerability among older Americans that we simply hadn't seen 10 or 15 years ago.",
        "So why, why are they more vulnerable to bankruptcy?",
        "Well, they're more vulnerable, in part, because they are financially weakened before they get to be older Americans.",
        "More people are carrying more debt in their 40s and 50s.",
        "They face more job layoffs, and so the strategy, much like the story you just told, for many Americans to survive financially is that they don't quit working, if they can help it, or they formally retire and then go back and get another job.",
        "That helps them survive for a while, but for a large portion of the people we see in bankruptcy, among older Americans, it's often job loss.",
        "That is, they lost the full-time or part-time job that they had been using to supplement their incomes, sometimes because the company cut back, or they got fired, and sometimes because of their health.",
        "As one woman in our sample, just one of the many stories that came through, she said I was working, and my doctor told me I couldn't stand on my feet for the long hours required at the fast-food restaurant where she was working 25 hours a week, and so she finally had to give that up, and when she gave that up, she couldn't afford her prescription medication.",
        "She really couldn't afford the barest living expenses, so she put them on credit cards, and it just crushed her.",
        "I understand that also in your study, you found that credit, and especially sub-prime mortgages, play a role in this increase in older people filing for bankruptcy."
