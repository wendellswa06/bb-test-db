        "And that's how they learned that Seale had kidnapped the two young men, taken them into a forest near Natchez, beaten them bloody, put them in the back of a car and then driven them to the river and drowned them alive, because of suspicion that they were part of a plan for militant blacks to come down the Mississippi and launch an offensive against the Klan.",

        "And so prosecutors, even in the face of that, argued that the passage of time was necessary for them to get evidence and testimony that was previously unavailable from a very secret society - the KKK.",

        "A federal judge okayed that request for some polls, mainly in Cleveland.",
        "How does this kind of wrangling reflect not necessarily anything about paper ballots versus electronic, but whether or not governments are making a commitment to allowing enough people to enter the process simply by staffing and issues like that?",
        "Well, it certainly diminishes the public confidence in the voting system when they literally should stand up in line at seven o'clock in the morning, and when the doors open, the poll workers do not know how to work the machines.",
        "And that also speaks to when the county commissioners out there and the borough managers out there are screaming for more help from the federal government.",
        "And that's the main reason why the federal government passed the Help America Vote Act back in 2001, after the 2000 presidential fiasco, so that this would never happen again."
