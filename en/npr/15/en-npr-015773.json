        "Do you see an issue where we're going to face some big challenges?",
        "Yes, especially when you have record turnout.",
        "And anytime you have record turnout, the system simply - unfortunately - cannot handle the volume of people that are standing in line and voting, and that's when a lot of irregularities happen.",
        "That's when a lot of mass confusion happens.",
        "If you take a look at the primaries overall this year, and when you look at where Senator Obama's doing so well, where he's over-performing in some states - ironically, I looked at this last night in preparation for this segment - is that when - typically, that's when there's a lot of mass confusion."
