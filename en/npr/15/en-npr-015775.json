        "The Center provides career counseling, resume seminars and many job fairs, and for former New Orleans resident and 20-year hospital administrator Judy Truvea the last place she expected to be more than six months after the storm.",
        "If I thought I would have had a job, you know, like, even as a receptionist in medical records.",
        "That's what I was trying to get.",
        "A file clerk.",
        "A simple position.",
        "I'm not applying for no management position.",
        "I just want a job.",
        "Now in her early 50's, Truvea says employers are rejecting her as over-qualified for entry-level positions and are scared off by her former salary.",
        "At times, she says, it feels like her evacuee status isn't evoking much goodwill.",
        "Now, I figure if I chose to relocate and apply for work, well, that's a different situation.",
        "Maybe they would have handled it different.",
        "But like, due to the circumstances, it should be even easier for me to find employment, because I didn't choose to relocate here.",
        "I was forced to.",
        "They often don't have the social networks to tap into their new cities.",
        "And over the last three months, Smith says many employers are more likely to feel that hurricane evacuees need to move on.",
        "Some of the concerns that I've heard have simply go back to, well, are individuals ready to work?",
        "Are there other things that would get in the way of them being able to accept and hold down employment?",
        "And Smith says employers raise concerns about everything from whether job applicants have consistent childcare and transportation to whether or not they're still traveling back and forth to the Gulf Coast.",
        "And these are issues that are still facing nearly all of Smith's clients, who've run the gamut from former attorneys and college professors to construction and restaurant workers, like Sam Caruso(ph).",
        "I worked at quite a few different restaurants in New Orleans.",
        "And there's not nearly, the service industry, not nearly nothing like it is in New Orleans.",
        "Clients like Caruso, who worked in popular New Orleans industries like tourism, or even oil production, are having to make big adjustments, says Smith.",
        "For instance, once a bartender, Caruso's now making much less money as a sales clerk at an electronics store.",
        "In the meantime, he's had to send his fiancÃÂ©e and two children back to Louisiana to stay with relatives, and he's already in debt to his landlord.",
        "I mean it's almost like it's, I feel more overwhelmed.",
        "There's just so many other things, you know, as time goes on, there's more things that you have to do.",
        "And I mean, I'll tell you what, it's like something new pops up every day."

        "Paulin learned music from his father, an accordion player, and from his uncle who played trombone.",
        "And he passed on his love of music to many of his 13 children, at least six of whom played with his band.",
        "The service for the man who raised his trumpet in so many traditional New Orleans jazz funerals is sure to be well attended.",

        "Methane?",
        "Why methane?",
        "Well, methane is a greenhouse gas and it's 23 times more powerful than carbon dioxide, which means that it's much more efficient at trapping heat.",
        "So it feeds into a loop of global warming.",
        "And what Katey Walter is saying is that methane is being released from lakes in the far north - in Alaska, Siberia, other places - at a far greater rate than anybody has estimated.",
        "So as bad as the projections for global warming are now, if you factor in increased methane emissions, it could be a whole lot worse.",
        "Now, Katey Walter is one of the first people to calculate just how much methane is bubbling out of lakes.",
        "And it seems fitting to me, Michele, that somebody as bubbly as Katey Walter is studying bubbles.",

        "Katey Walter teaches at the University of Alaska there.",
        "And she takes me down a grassy hill to see a large lake that's recently formed.",
        "It's formed because as the temperature rises, the permafrost, the permanently frozen ground, is thawing.",
        "And about 10 years ago, I used to ride my bike past here everyday on my way home, and this was solid ground.",
        "It was forest.",
        "This is a dramatic difference.",
        "As far as you can see out here, it's just water, dead trees and methane bubbles.",
        "Those dead or dying trees - birch, spruce and aspen - are tilting into the lake at crazy angles.",
        "And there's a name for this now, they call it a drunken forest.",
        "As the permafrost thaws, bacteria feed on the carbon stored underground and burp it out as methane."
