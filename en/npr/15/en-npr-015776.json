        "Oh absolutely.",
        "I'm very honored.",
        "And the statement you made earlier, is it better than never, you know, when you first enter the NFL - at least when I first came into the NFL - I never thought about the Hall of Fame.",
        "I came into the NFL: number one was to do my very best and to help out my family, and to help the Dallas Cowboys win football games.",
        "And as things progressed and awards and accolades began to come my way and so forth, it was only until the news reporters began to look at the accomplishments that I had made in the National Football League, and start saying to me that, you know, you should be in the Hall of Fame.",
        "And I said to myself, you know, I don't see any reason why I shouldn't be there.",
        "Let me bring Stephen Perry in, because…",
        "I'd like to, if I may, comment on the question you asked first that better late than never is the right answer.",
        "But to put it in perspective as to how special it is for Harry and Rayfield and their colleagues to be elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, there are only 235 members elected.",
        "Of that 235, 202 are players.",
        "The others were other kinds of contributors, owners and coaches.",
        "And there have been 18,000 players in the NFL.",
        "So when you whittle down to 202 players out of over 18,000, it really says that these gentlemen are indeed the best of the best.",
        "It does sometimes take a while to sort through, but I think the final analysis for them to have been selected, it just says this is truly a special recognition for people who obviously were great contributors to the game of professional football.",
        "Do you think - and I want to put this to Harry and to Rayfield first, and then to you second, Stephen - do you think guys that because the media votes on who gets into the Hall and who doesn't, do you look back over your career, and do you wonder whether or not how you behaved with them had anything to do with whether or not you got in?",
        "Well - this is Harry - I'd always been media friendly, especially being here in the New York area.",
        "You know, if - and I was a captain 10 of my 13 seasons - so whether we won or not, regardless how I felt, I always had to cooperate.",
        "And I felt it was my duty to cooperate with the media.",
        "So I really don't think that played a role.",
        "I think there are some people who might be considered for the Hall of Fame who some members of the media might look back and say, well, he wasn't a good person, or he didn't want to do this or that.",
        "And I hope that's not the case, but I can see very clearly where some members of the media could come to the table with that bias.",
        "I think, what my feeling is, I would love to see current members of the Hall of Fame be placed on that selection committee, to be a part of the process.",
        "A couple of years ago I wrote a letter to the Hall of Fame and asked them to remove my name from consideration, because I didn't want to have to go through the process.",
        "I had nothing - I had no problem with the Hall of Fame, but the way that the process was conducted, I had a problem with that.",
        "And I saw what it was doing to other guys much like me.",
        "And I didn't have a problem with falling on the sword and drawing attention to the process.",
        "But I hope at some point down the road that there will be former players who are Hall of Fame members who will be included to make a judgment.",
        "Because, if you've never played the game, it's very difficult to judge someone in their abilities."

        "Do you feel that way, Rayfield?",
        "Well, very, very similar, you know, to what Harry's just said.",
        "You know, as one of the co-captains for the Dallas Cowboys for about nine years out of my 13 years career, we've had to respect and be close to the media.",
        "And as Harry has said, you know, I would, it would be certainly interesting to see if there were members of the Hall of Fame, players, be involved in the process itself.",
        "Because a lot of us do not know exactly what the process, the details of the process is.",
        "And, you know, in that process alone - I remember being up two years ago, and making it to the final six along with Bob Hayes.",
        "And I know that you can put six in, but the election process decided to take it down to four.",
        "You know, I was out and so was Bob Hayes, was out.",
        "And the situation that kind of disturbed me a little bit about the process was that I was asked to go to Houston, you know, for the event, just in case, you know, I was elected for the Hall.",
        "And I went on my own expenses and so forth, and, you know, after the process was completed, I did not receive a phone call from anyone to let me know that - Rayfield, I'm sorry, you did not make it this time, you know, hopefully you'll make it next time.",
        "Audie Cornish, NPR News, Nashville.",
        "I think it was the lack of the respect that players that reached the final 15 or reached the final 10, you know, should receive at least a phone call, you know, from someone to say that, I'm sorry you didn't make it.",
        "You know, maybe, you know, you'll make it next time.",
        "Well, Stephen Perry you said that the process is something - obviously there's no way to make it perfect, but is there a way to improve it or is there a way to address some of the things that have been mentioned so far.",
        "Well, I certainly hope so.",
        "Like any process, we should never get to the point where we think it is perfect or can't be improved.",
        "And I think some improvements have been made, and some of the observations that Harry and Rayfield are making ought to be food for thought to make additional improvements.",
        "One thing is that the process, to my mind, begins with the selection of people who are on the selection committee who bring professionalism and integrity to their role.",
        "I mean, they really show focus on the accomplishments of the individual on the field.",
        "And if they had an interaction with a player off the field that, you know, they didn't think was what it might be, that's not a factor.",
        "And so part of their professionalism is to be objective.",
        "Now being human, it's difficult, I'm sure.",
        "But the fact is that being a great citizen off the field doesn't help you get into the Hall of Fame, or being not such a great citizen off the field.",
        "The selection process can be approved."

        "You know, Rayfield, I believe, made mention of the fact that after he wasn't selected in a previous year, he wasn't notified.",
        "There's no good excuse for that.",
        "Another element of the process that has been improved is that now we do have the selectors consult with members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.",
        "So I think that helps.",
        "I doubt that we'll ever get to the point where every single individual who views the process will say, okay, now it's perfect.",
        "I think there will always be some level of imperfection.",
        "But we keep striving to squeeze that out.",
        "Let me ask you guys who played about your careers, and how you look back on them.",
        "Starting with you, Harry, because you were inside linebacker, played with Lawrence Taylor, and you just, you're outstanding, obviously, as a player.",
        "And it's certainly deserving of going into the Hall of Fame.",
        "But as you look back on your career, what stands out for you, or what do you remember most about Harry Carson, the player?",
        "This is what people always say, you played with Lawrence Taylor.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And I think, you know, the thing that really stands out in my mind, and I had a press conference last month with some of my old coaches, and Marty Schottenheimer came in.",
        "People know him now for being the head coach of the San Diego Chargers, but he was a linebacker coach and defensive coordinator with the Giants back in 1976.",
        "And Marty drafted me to play a position that I'd never played before.",
        "I was asked to play a position which was considered the quarterback of the defense.",
        "And at that time, the position was primarily reserved for white guys who were deemed to be more intelligent, or whatever you want to call it.",
        "And so I was able to master that position and play at a high level for 13 seasons.",
        "And then go on to be captain and be respected by my teammates - not so much for what I did on the field.",
        "I mean, what I did on the field was good stuff.",
        "But as a leader, that's the thing that I appreciate more than anything else, their respect that I've gotten from them because of me caring for them as a leader, as a captain, even today.",
        "You know Rayfield as a right tackle, Big Cat, I think they called you.",
        "Six time Pro-Bowler, all-decade team of the ‘70s, five Super Bowl appearances, two wins.",
        "What do you look back most fondly of over your career?",
        "You know my mind has taken me back so many times, you know, since this process has taken place.",
        "And you know, I even go back to the point where Gil Brandt first drafted me out of Fort Valley State College down in South Georgia.",
        "And, you know, I really didn't even want to play football, I wanted to play basketball is what I really wanted to play.",
        "When they, when Gil Brandt me drafted me they drafted me as a tight end, and after playing tight end for two years, Coach Landry called me into his office and said, Rayfield, he said, we're going to move you to offensive tackle.",
        "And, you know, so I looked at him and I said, coach, if you believe that I can best help this football team by moving to this position I've never played before in my life, I'll give it everything I have."

        "And I end up having basically to humble myself to play that position, because I'd always been a player in sports to deal with the ball, whether or not it was catching a pass as tight end for a touchdown, or scoring points, or dunking the ball on the basketball court.",
        "So after watching films of some of the greatest offensive lineman, tackles, that I thought played the game.",
        "St.",
        "Louis had two offensive linemen, like McMillan and Reynolds, you know, and I started watching these guys because I was tired of being knocked around in practice.",
        "And so I said, well, you know, it's just like basketball, and it came to me.",
        "You know, if I was defending a guy playing basketball, then the object of the game as a defender was t stay between him and the basket.",
        "And you do that by shuffling your feet very quickly.",

        "And the defensive end that I've got to block, he's got to be the guy that's dribbling the ball.",
        "That's exactly what formed in my mind, and I went out to practice the next day and I started doing that, and shuffling my feet real quick, and it was really interesting for that.",
        "And to have the first opportunity to start at right tackle was really an experience, because I had to block against the most feared defensive end to ever play the game, I think, in the national Football League, and he's a Hall of Famer himself, and that was in David Deacon Jones.",
        "That's for sure.",
        "This is the 60th Anniversary of the integration of the National Football League.",
        "Now African-Americans of course were playing pro-football before then.",
        "Fritz Pollard comes to mind, as one, but it wasn't until 1946 that Kenny Washington and Woody Strode and Bill Willis and Marion Motley broke the color line, as it were, for the NFL.",
        "Well, you're certainly correct, and there's a lot to be said about the aftermath of that historic event - how the game has developed in terms of the participation of African-Americans in all aspects of the game.",
        "And so part of what we want to do is not only recognize Bill Willis as the only living survivor of that foursome, at the Hall of Fame during the halftime, but also let people realize, or reflect upon, all that has occurred in terms of the improvement of the game, and indeed the improvement of our society as a result of this.",
        "You know, one of the purposes of the pro football Hall of Fame is to celebrate and to honor the achievements of the greatest players who've ever played the game.",
        "And as it turns out, many of those players have been African-American.",
        "And the game of sports, particularly in this case, team sports, the game, or the entertainment industry and the military, I think, are examples where, when people were judged on their capability and their talents to achieve results, then everyone involved realized that race shouldn't be a factor.",
        "And football that certainly has been the case there.",
        "So we want to acknowledge Bill Willis.",
        "He has already been acknowledged with letters of commendation from the Ohio House and Ohio Senate, but now he will receive a Senate Resolution from the U.S.",
        "Senate and a similar resolution from the U.S.",
        "House of Representatives.",
        "And I'm sure Bill would say that as he receives that accolade, it won't be just Bill Willis that is being recognized, but it'll be every other African-American or minority who has not only excelled in the game of football or sports, but who have excelled in life using some of our Hall of Famers, including Harry and Rayfield as role models and inspiration for what they have achieved.",
        "Let me just say, gentlemen, our time is running out.",
