        "You could have fireballs that shoot into the air as tall as spruce tress, or this spring, such a large flame of methane exploded in my face because I didn't do it in a very smart way that it knocked me over backwards and I saw my hair had singed and broken off and was burning in the snow in front of me, and all my eyebrows were singed.",
        "So you do have to be careful.",
