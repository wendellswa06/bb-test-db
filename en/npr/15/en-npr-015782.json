        "In the early 19th century, essayists like Charles Lamb and William Hazlett wrote what they called familiar essays that were about them but also about a subject that is - Lamb, for example, wrote about tailors and drunkards and annoying relatives, familiar subjects that he knew well and that his readers knew well too.",

        "It's sort of like eating your coffee grounds raw as Balzac often did rather than filtering them into somewhat more refined brew.",
