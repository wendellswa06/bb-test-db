        "Yeah, the challenge was to draw a square that's four boxes by four boxes a side, containing altogether 16 small boxes and that results in 18 lines across, down and diagonally.",
        "And the object was to place markers in 10 of the boxes so that as many of these lines as possible have either two or four markers each.",
        "And the question was: what is the maximum number of lines that can have either two or four markers?",
        "Well, the answer is 16 lines.",
        "There is one way of doing it, not counting rotations and reflections.",
        "You can read all about this, including the rotations and reflections on our website, npr.org/puzzle.",
