        "And so Alphonso Jackson, in his Houston Chronicle editorial, let the plan out of the bag.",
        "He says it would not be majority black again, which means that he intends to leave many citizens in permanent exile.",
        "He says the Ninth Ward should not be rebuilt again.",
        "Well, these positions are coming from the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, so they take on certain credence.",
        "And there's a conflict, therefore, between the federal government's plan and the local government's plan.",
        "Reverend, he also has suggested that black leaders, including yourself, are doing nothing but stirring up racial animosity with comments like this."
