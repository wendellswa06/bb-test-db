        "I'm at the two shelters in Detroit yesterday, where people are anxious to come home.",
        "They can't afford to get back home, and while there are good jobs now for cleanup taking place, they have been, in fact, given under-prevailing wage, under-prevailing wage rates to exploited workers from maquiladoras.",

        "Well, first, let me say that that's a perfect description of the familiar essayist.",
        "The familiar essayist, for example, in the 19th century, didn't write just unfamiliar subject.",
        "He wrote as if he were familiar with the reader instead of lecturing to, you know, a giant audience of a thousand.",
