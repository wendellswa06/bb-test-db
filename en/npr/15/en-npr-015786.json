        "Just east of San Francisco Bay, the world's most powerful laser sits in a quiet suburb just waiting to be switched on.",
        "This is a project that has been decades in the making, and this is a really big laser.",
        "It was built with one purpose in mind, to blast, for just billionths of a second, a target the size of a pea filled with hydrogen with 500-trillion watts of power.",
        "The hope is to recreate the extreme pressures and temperatures that you find inside stars, like our sun, where hydrogen atoms fuse together to make helium and give off loads of energy in the nuclear fusion process.",
        "But not all scientists are optimistic or even cautiously optimistic that the lab is capable of creating this star fusion on Earth.",
        "Every year, it seems, fusion energy is just 30 years away, and I remember visiting an experimental laser-fusion device called Shiva about 30 years ago, in 1978, at the same laboratory.",
        "That was dismantled a little bit later, and then it was upgraded to another one called Nova, and so on and so on, and these experiments have been going on for years.",
        "(Through Translator) Our village chief broadcast an announcement.",
        "He said that if there was mismanagement or if there were any more outbreaks in their areas, officials would lose their jobs.",
        "At midafternoon, Lio goes out to check on his chickens.",
        "(Soundbite of chickens)",
        "The ground in his yard is covered with white lime used as disinfectant.",
        "Lio says he's vaccinated his birds three times this month.",
        "It's part of the Chinese government's ambitious drive to vaccinate all of the country's fowl, more than 14 billion birds in all.",
        "The government has also shut down live poultry markets in favor of chicken processing plants.",
        "Noureddin Mona is the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's representative in China.",
        "He speaks highly of the government's commitment.",
        "Really, they are on the right track in terms of following the international standards.",
        "But the problem is here in China, which must be recognized--that applying the biosecurity measures is really difficult.",
        "Why?",
        "First of all, 60 percent of the poultry here in China is really operated by small-scale farmers in the rural areas."

        "Sure.",
        "Now, Elizabeth, I understand these variations can be explained by something called zone pricing.",
        "Help us understand that.",
        "That's a system that's used nationwide, and probably worldwide, and it's primarily in the control of the oil companies.",

        "We have fewer players.",
        "We don't think of there being a milk cartel or some other commodity like that.",
        "But we know oil, for example, is largely controlled by an oil cartel.",
        "You could argue that this is a form of redlining.",
        "Is this legal?",
        "It's very legal, at least according to the courts so far.",
        "They have determined, in economic studies, that it is ambiguous as to whether there's an overall benefit or an overall hurt to consumers.",
        "There are some areas, of course, that pay extra for their gasoline, and there are some areas that might bet a better deal, for example, somewhere around a Costco.",
        "And so they have determined that either the discrepancy is so fleeting that you cannot build a case of price discrimination, or it is ambiguous because some benefit and some lose.",
        "Elizabeth, I have one last question for you.",
        "The price that's set by the gas company, do the dealers have to follow that?",
        "Is there any way that they can--if the guy across the street is selling gas for 10 cents cheaper, he has no play in the price.",
        "Well, he does have some control, but what would happen is his profit would be squeezed.",
        "Say, the guy across the street is charging $2 a gallon.",
        "He might be getting his gasoline for $1.80 a gallon from the--say, it's Shell.",
        "And the guy across the street is Chevron, and he's paying $1.95 for his fuel.",
        "If he puts his price at $2, he's only making 5 cents a gallon.",
        "More than likely, he'll say, `I have to pay for my employees and my property taxes and all the other things, and I need an 8-cent profit to do that,' so he might keep his price 8 cents above the wholesale price and suffer the loss of business because of that.",
        "And does this mean that gas stations have to look for profit in other ways, selling milk and Twinkies and a hot cup of coffee?",
        "Yes, indeed.",
        "The days are long gone when dealers make very much money on gasoline."
