        "And he's running for the chairman spot, and sent out goody bags, you now, kind of to win delegates.",
        "And in that goody bag, there was a CD that had different things, and it had this song on there, that Puff - the \"\"Obama, the Magic Negro.\"\" So, yeah, the controversy started all over again.",
        "And then you had Ken Blackwell, who's one of the few black, high-profile Republicans in GOP, defending him, and Michael Steele was being wishy-washy, in my opinion.",
        "Both good friends, but disappointed in both, and I took a whack at him on my blog, and some others have as well.",
        "It just - it has to stop.",
        "As it suggests, this shows insensitivity.",
        "You know, satire is satire, but there's one thing for a satirist to do it.",
        "It's another thing for a candidate for the RNC to distribute it.",
        "Look, we all have a sense of humor.",
        "President-elect Obama has a sense of humor, but there's a line now.",
        "He is the new president-elect of the United States.",
        "He's going to take office here shortly, and I don't think it's good for the other major political party, who would be chairman, hurling about things like that and particularly making light of it.",
        "Negro is a term that we use when my grandparents were coming up, and it was a degrading term, and we went from colored, you know, to Negro to black to, you know - we've had all these, you know, originations that have gone now to African-American.",
        "And you know, I just think that it's insensitive.",
        "It's rude.",
        "And this comes after an election in which you said the McCain campaign virtually conceded the black vote.",
        "Look, anyone of us who are political observers for any long period of time know that Barack Obama was going to do exceptionally well with the black vote.",
        "The Democrats get 90 to 91 percent vote.",
        "Both Gore and Kerry got 90 to 91 percent, which is bad, in it, for us.",
        "And then, you know, with Obama's historic candidacy, you knew more African-Americans were going to drive in that direction.",
        "I'm one of them, and I didn't vote for him because he's African-American.",
        "I actually - while I don't agree with probably 50 percent of what Barack Obama's for, I was more impressed with him as a candidate, as a motivator, as a leader.",
        "and that's why I decided to vote for him.",
        "And you would then have some in the Republican Party saying, you and General Powell are not real Republicans and maybe ought to make way for those who are.",
        "Well, as I pointed out in my article - and you know that all articles are edited and cut down ,and I didn't choose the title \"\"It's My Party; I Don't Feel Part of It.\"\" I would have chosen another title.",
        "but it was OK.",
        "Look, if they go back to the history of the GOP, people like Colin Powell and myself are much more Republican than are this new conservative bunch.",
        "I believe that the GOP is big enough to have conservatives in it.",
        "The problem is conservatives don't feel that way about moderates like me and others.",
        "They want it to be a conservative party, and it's not a conservative party, and it shouldn't be.",
        "It can have a conservative constituency in it, as a moderate, a liberal libertarian does the Democrat Party.",

        "I was really upset about it.",

        "So you see the elite of India coming in there.",
        "What's so ironic about it is right across the street, they have the Bay of India, a big tourist location.",
        "And you see maybe - you know, I go jogging in the morning around there - maybe three blocks away, there is a huge slum, really close.",

        "And the other thing that I thought was sad is that there is a big navy base, a military base, that's probably two blocks away.",

        "You're one of a very elite group of people.",
        "That is, people who have been fortunate enough to be able to see many parts of the world.",

        "Some people are too afraid, or just find it, you know, too jarring to go from, you know, what can be a kind of bubble to the streets.",
        "So when you left and you saw the slum, how did it make you - how did it make you feel as a traveler?",
        "But also, how do you think people perceived you as a black man, who clearly was not from the area, who was of more means?",
        "Do you ever try to put yourself in other people's head and say, I wonder what they see when they see me?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, first answer is, first time I went to India was like in 1997, and I have not complained about anything in my life since that trip.",
        "Because I've not seen poverty - and I haven't been to Africa but in other third world countries.",
        "So that led to a really strong impression on me.",
        "I found in general, countries - I hope I say this the right way - that people have darker skin, there was almost kind of affinity towards me, that they thought it was kind of cool.",
        "Because most of the people they saw at these fine hotels, or being driven around, did not look like that.",
        "That's not to say I look like an Indian per se, but there kind of was a curiosity.",
        "Wow, there's a dark-skinned person.",
        "So I found that in Indonesia, in the Philippines, in Brazil and Venezuela, in places like that that people were kind of - it's kind of like they're curious.",
        "Having said that, the rest of the world looks at us as Americans, and there's a clear distinction.",
        "So I have been saying that if you have an American passport, American Express Card, you're, you know, just like anyone else.",
        "And often where we travel in business - we being African-Americans - we're often with white colleagues.",
        "And so we're viewed as Americans and we're treated as Americans.",

        "Cheryl, listening to this conversation we've had so far, from your perspective, you're taking people from Loyola Marymount to the Ghana study abroad program.",
        "And these are students.",
        "What do they find interesting about how they're perceived?",
        "They go through, I would say, several layers of shock, but they come away with a closer, deeper connection to their African cultural heritage.",
        "When they first go, they're not sure exactly what to expect and how they're going to be received.",
        "And all the stereotypes about, you know, what Africa is like and what Africa is about, they received, you know, heavy doses of through American education.",
        "And then they also hear the stereotypes that Africans don't like them, won't talk to them, won't be interested in them, etc.",
        "They get there, and then they find that people have an image of them that is cast in the light of American media and rap music and the presumption of wealth.",
        "So they have to kind of weave their way through all of that before they can actually have real encounters, human-to-human, heart-to-heart, soul-to-soul connections.",
        "And then when they get to that, there is a recognition of a cultural connection to folks.",
        "There's also a layer of shock with the skin color issue.",
        "So lighter-skinned African-Americans are seen as white by folks, particularly when you leave out of the urban centers.",
        "And that is a true, shocking experience for the students, because - well, for many reasons I won't go into now.",
        "But…",
        "Well, I hate to interrupt you, but I want to invite both of you back on to talk more about this.",

        "And we know--for instance, one my source, a doctor, pathologist in Andijan, she counted herself 500 bodies, just only men.",
        "And the government people--as Karimov said, `We did not shoot women and children.",
