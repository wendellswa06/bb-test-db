        "And it was a really polluted place, and it had just won the prize from the Indian government for most...",
        "What place was that?",
        "Oh, it's called Kanpur, a city of a couple million people, I think, about halfway down the Ganges.",
        "It had been named most polluted city by the Indian government that year, and - which is a real prize in India.",
        "And, you know, it lived up to the reputation.",
        "It has all kinds of heavy metals and toxic waste in the river.",
        "There's feces on the river bank.",

        "And I couldn't - it made no sense at first.",
        "And so I thought about that for a long time: What was it about Kanpur, clearly a really gross place, that was so compelling and so fun?",
        "I'm going to admit it was fun.",
        "And it's not about denying the problems that Kanpur had.",

        "I don't know what these places look like or feel like or taste like, not that I'm really trying to taste Chernobyl.",
        "You did spill a little water on you from one of the polluted Indian rivers.",
        "I was...",
        "And I did catch a fish out of an oil spill, and we did grill that up, and it was extremely tasty.",
        "But it just, it started to really eat on me that, you know, I think - I have engineers and scientists in my family.",
        "I've always been very kind of, like, a science fan I guess you could say.",
        "And it started to really annoy me that I talk about these things and care about these things, but I've never seen them for myself.",
        "So that was a big part of it."

        "You went to the Oil Sands Mining in Northern Alberta in Canada; Port Arthur, Texas.",
        "What was the attraction in Port Arthur, Texas?",
        "Well, Port Arthur is a really poor city on the Texas gulf Coast, right near Louisiana.",
        "And it's just surrounded by refineries, huge refineries.",
        "I think of it as the refinery capital of North America.",
        "And so there's all kinds of things in the air, but it's also really interesting historically because right around there is where the first gusher came in about 110 years ago.",
        "And it's - like it's basically the birthplace of big oil because the glut that came out of the land there really led people to start thinking about using oil mainly as a fuel for automobiles, and it's really sort of the place where our petroleum civilization really started.",
        "So, you know, and everyone loves to hate Port Arthur because it's really poor, it's really ugly.",
        "There's a lot of deserted buildings.",
        "Nevertheless, the people you meet who are there, who are dealing with living on the fenceline of a refinery, who maybe work in refineries, are really compelling, and they have a really compelling take on sort of the tradeoff.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Obviously, they're still driving cars, and a lot of the environmental - the environmental activist I hung out there most with, a guy called Hilton Kelly, on the one hand he's really trying to fight the refineries and force them to operate more cleanly.",
        "On the other hand, he just wants them to give more jobs to the community.",
        "And so, that kind of, sort of, paradox you find much more strongly there."
