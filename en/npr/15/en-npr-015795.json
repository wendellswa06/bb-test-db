        "I think people really respond to the fact that I was - responded that I was interested.",
        "And, you know, I don't like the way that really polluted places, sort of, epicenters of pollution are used as sort of horror stories just to make us feel like, sort of, motivate us by making us feel guilty or horrible.",
        "That's OK.",
        "But a real sort of disgust gets attached to those places.",

        "This is the city that only exists in city form because of the oil sands industry.",
        "And there are just, you know, just 45 minutes north of Fort McMurray - well, first of all, everyone in Fort McMurray either works for the oil sands industry or works for someone who works for the oil sands industry.",
        "And just 45 minutes, an hour north of Fort McMurray, there are what amount to a series of artificial grand canyons that are being - that are just incredible strip-mine pits because this is a sand - sort of a sticky tar sand, and the main way they're retrieving it right now is to dig it out of the ground, these huge deep pits.",
        "Wow.",
        "And so it's one of the most visually spectacular things you'll ever see.",

        "It is - yeah.",
        "Is it the pollution from the mines - in the mines themselves or what seeps out or escapes...",
        "Well, there's a lot of question - well, first of all, there's a lot of stuff.",
        "You - in order to get - separate the petroleum from the sand, you basically need to boil it in huge vats of water with - using incredible amounts of energy.",
        "And the leftover water is kept in these tailings ponds, which are basically giant toxic lakes.",
        "And a little while, maybe a year or so before I was up there, a flock of ducks had landed in one of these lakes and they just all died.",
        "And this became a national issue in Canada.",
        "There was a huge lawsuit.",
        "The prime minister got involved because the oil - it sort of crystallized and symbolized, you know, the cost of this kind of mining.",
        "And then also, you just have an incredible amount of energy used to get that energy.",
        "It's much less efficient than just letting oil shoot out of the ground.",
        "And so, you know, all that natural gas that gets burned to process the oil sand, it's a huge energy cost.",
        "And so from a climate point of view, it's really sort of the biggest thing that people - or maybe tied for the biggest thing that people object to about oil sands.",
        "So there's a CO2 given off?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I put it in the book and I still can't believe it.",
        "So I went and looked it up again.",
        "Fort McMurray, I believe, has about twice the CO2 emissions of Los Angeles.",
        "And there's only, I think, something like 100,000 people, 140,000 people living in Fort McMurray.",
        "But because of all that fuel that's used in the industry, they give off something like - I don't know - it's something like 44 million tons of CO2.",
        "Twice what...",
        "A guy in Fort McMurray had said, you know, we give off the same as Los Angeles, and I thought that guy is totally exaggerating.",
        "That's not right.",
        "You know, put it in here.",
        "I'll mark it to fact-check it.",
        "I went, in fact-checked it and he was wrong.",
        "It was twice as much."
