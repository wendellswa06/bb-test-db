        "What strikes you?",
        "You know, I thought it was very interesting that he talked about the voters in 2020 being the ones who get to ultimately decide about this report.",
        "I think that is largely keeping in line with what we're hearing from a lot of Democrats talking about voters making a political decision, not Congress making a political decision about impeachment.",
        "And I think that we're going to see that message evolve over time.",
        "And it might be something really difficult for Democrats to handle among themselves, as some parts of their progressive wing push for impeachment or other, you know, very aggressive moves by Congress.",
        "Right, in some cases, campaigned on it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That is - it has already been something that has split Democrats, and I can imagine that that will continue to happen after this report.",
        "We're talking with Kelsey Snell right now because we are continuing our coverage of the redacted Mueller report released today.",
        "Back to you, Kelsey Snell.",
        "So what are Democrats saying on the Hill as they are digesting this report?",
        "And we should say - right - we're talking a couple hundred pages, so people are theoretically still reading.",
        "Yes.",
        "And we are getting a lot of statements from people saying that they are still reading and that they may be withholding judgment about some parts of this.",
        "But a lot of the reaction from Democrats is more or less what we would expect.",
        "They say they have evidence and reason to keep investigating President Trump and his associates.",
        "And they say this report really bolsters that.",
        "One notable trend is that they are really focusing on whether or not Attorney General Barr misled them with his original characterization of the Mueller report.",

        "Now, he is not alone in this either.",
        "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, released a joint statement where they said the differences are stark between what Attorney General Barr said on obstruction and what special counsel Mueller said on obstruction.",
        "And they said that as they continue to review the report that they believe that Barr presented a conclusion that did not represent what Mueller found.",
        "And they're giving a really strong impression that they're going to take a hard-line tack.",
        "But again, they're not talking about impeachment.",
        "They're not talking about specific steps.",
        "So it's really not clear yet how this is going to manifest.",

        "I assume that the report didn't really change much of that for them today.",
        "Right.",
        "And they also fall into this two camps of saying - some people saying that they are still reading it and then a group of people who are responding in the way that we would expect from Republicans.",
        "The ones who are speaking up are defending the president.",
        "There - some are saying that he's been fully vindicated.",

        "What did the recording tell you about the ship's final hours?",
        "The recording actually gave us 26 hours of bridge audio data that we used to kind of recreate the last day of the vessel's voyage."

        "And do you hear anybody saying, we shouldn't be going in this direction; there's a hurricane out there?",

        "Several crew members were voicing concerns very early on from the voyage data recorder started recording.",
        "And what does the captain say?",

        "Obviously we know what happened in the end, so we know that that was not the right calculation.",
        "Was it a reasonable - I mean, based on experience, was it a reasonable calculation by the captain, or was it an unreasonable one?",
        "Well, the board determined that, especially with an erratic storm like Hurricane Joaquin was, that it was imprudent to make that decision.",
        "The ship, El Faro, was a steam ship from the 1970s, and the report found problems with its safety protocols.",
        "Is this accident shining a light on the practice of grandfathering, meaning that old ships - this would be an old ship - don't have to meet modern safety standards unless they undergo a major reconstruction?",
        "Shouldn't old ships be precisely the ships that need to be updated?",
        "That's the board's determination, that there has been some grandfathering.",
