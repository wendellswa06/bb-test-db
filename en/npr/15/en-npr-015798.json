        "There's more of a strain on an attacking force in terms of coordination and communications and whatnot than Hezbollah has to show.",
        "The old formula used to be that an attacking force needed an advantage of three to one in order to enjoy success, but this is not an old time conflict.",
        "No.",
        "And I think we've gotten away from three to one starting in about 1960, actually.",
        "This is going to be a tough fight for the Israelis.",
        "Hezbollah not only has the advantage of ground, Hezbollah has done two very, very threatening things.",
        "The first is they are bringing in rockets now, although with some difficulty.",
        "But, you know, in the face of Israeli interdictions into their supply lines, they're bringing in rockets of increasing range.",
        "If what we're seeing now and beyond now is an escalation in the range of rockets, then all of Lebanon can become a launching pad.",
        "And that makes the Israelis' problem much, much harder.",
        "And it looks as if - again, the decision not to fire rockets today seemed like a decision rather than that they were forced to do it.",
        "So they apparently have the ability to launch 100 rockets a day for -well, for how long?",
        "Well, that's the question, isn't it?",
        "The original Israeli air strikes in retrospect, as we go back and analyze where they landed, were against the supply lines that Syria and Iran were using to bring the rockets up to firing - to the firing point.",
        "Before the war they bragged that they had thousands of rockets already stockpiled.",
        "So they either stopped firing today because they're trying to appear to be the international good guys, or they really maybe starting to run low on certain types of rockets.",
        "I'm not as concerned about continuing Katyusha barrages - of course, I don't have to be there under them - as I am the possibility that they're going to start bringing in longer and longer range rockets, which makes Israel's security problem much harder.",
        "And the point of the rockets, themselves militarily insignificant.",
        "They don't hit - they're un-aimed and they hit where they hit.",
        "And their point seems to be to bring Israeli ground forces into contact with Hezbollah.",
        "Where, as Mr. Nasrallah says, they can bleed them.",
        "And to strike the Israeli civil population in Haifa and wherever they can reach.",
        "There's been some talk about proportionality.",
        "The question of proportionality really is more in method than body count.",
        "And Hezbollah has been deliberately targeting civilian populations with these rockets since the beginning of the fight and before.",
        "Whatever you say about the Israelis - and I certainly agree that the loss of civilian lives has been horrendous - the Israelis are making an effort to strike military targets.",
        "Which brings me to my second point about Hezbollah that really is worth watching.",
        "They have, apparently with great planning and precision, cynically and long planted their weapons systems amid civilian populations and even inside or next to the U.N.",
        "positions to cause the kind of international backlash that you see now developing against the Israelis.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Even the professors at San Francisco State University and the University of San Francisco have long spoken in San Francisco calling this Hezbollah a social welfare organization.",
