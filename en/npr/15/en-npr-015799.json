        "Col.",
        "Killebrew, you say this is a deliberate tactic by the weaker party in this conflict, to put its weapons in the midst of civilians in part to protect those weapons from attack, or at least if they're going to be attacked, to make collateral damage civilian casualties an element of every air strike.",
        "Collateral damage is the name of the game.",
        "When the Israeli general said this was going to be a asymmetric war, I don't think he realized that the true asymmetry was going to be to force Israel to attack targets that would cause civilian deaths and cause this kind of backlash.",
        "It's worth noting that when this started, one of the very hopeful signs that everyone was kind of self-congratulatory about was that the moderate Arab states in the Middle East were actually quietly supporting Israel and acknowledged that Israel had a right to do what it was trying to do against Hezbollah, which they fear is an arm of Iran.",
        "But by now, public opinion - with civilian deaths - public opinion has swung decisively the other way, both in the region and around the world.",
        "It's a propaganda coup for Hezbollah.",
        "Bill, thanks very much for the call.",
        "What about some of the other targets, though, that Israel is hitting: infrastructure, bridges, electrical generating plants, things like that.",
        "Why are they hitting those?",
        "In the military lexicon, we call those dual use targets.",
        "A bridge, for example, is both a thing that civilians use to cross over rivers, but also important choke points on supply lines.",
        "If you look at the pattern of Israeli air strikes, they're on bridges across rivers or bridges across gorges that are supply lines running up to Damascus through the Beqaa Valley, and then, of course, across the Litani River in south Lebanon.",
        "The other things they've hit, airports - we think, we hope, Hezbollah offices in south Lebanon are either, we think, Hezbollah targets or dual use targets.",
        "I need to say, Neal, right up front, this kind of war is terribly punishing for civilians.",
        "All war is terribly punishing for civilians.",
        "And all wars that I know of but one, more civilians have died than military people.",
        "We don't have an hour by hour playback on the types of targets the Israelis are hitting.",
        "From what I've seen, I'm satisfied they're trying to be as precise as they can be, and their technology matches ours.",
        "But they also are laboring under the Hezbollah tactic of putting civilians near Hezbollah targets and they're just not going to be able to avoid civilian casualties.",
        "We're going to be talking more about the humanitarian effects of this war tomorrow on the program, but joining us now to talk more about how Hezbollah is fighting this conflict is John Arquilla, a professor of defense analysis at the Naval Post-Graduate School in Monterey, California.",
        "His latest book is The Reagan Imprint: Ideas in American Foreign Policy from the Collapse of Communism to the War on Terror.",

        "You call it net warfare.",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Well, about 15 years ago, my colleague from Rand, David Ronfeldt and I came up with the notion that networks were becoming more powerful - loose groups of people driven by a similar ideology who were disbursed, distributed, but still able to coordinate their actions.",
        "And we suggested that terrorist groups like Hezbollah and a small, then pretty unknown group al-Qaida were actually pretty good at this, and they were going to give nations a run for their money.",
        "And so in a piece called The Advent of Net War 10 years ago, we suggested that the first great war between nations and networks would be coming along soon.",
        "And, of course, we've been in that since 2001.",
        "Hezbollah, as a network, has been on the sidelines.",
        "But I think with the pressure on the Gaza Strip and the pressure on Iran and the civil war in Iraq, they're coming off the sidelines and entering this war as an ally to some of the networks opposed to us.",

        "John Arquilla, I'd like you to expand a little bit on what you were talking about in terms of net warfare.",
        "Compared to the familiar military hierarchy, the pyramid that we're all familiar with, how does net warfare compare?",
        "Again, if you'd like to join the conversation, 800-989-8255.",
        "E-mail is talk@npr.org.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Well, where a traditional who sees a stream of orders coming from a general right down to the private soldier at the bottom of the hierarchy, our network is much flatter.",
        "There are very few commands, perhaps Hassan Nasrallah gave a ceasefire order over the radio, and that's why they're not shooting today.",
        "But there are very few orders.",
        "Instead, there's a general goal, such as bombard Israel or engage IDF forces in south Lebanon.",
        "But the small units basically decide for themselves what they are going to do, and we've been seeing this now for a decade.",
        "The Chechnyans fought this way in their 1994 to '96 war against the Russians.",
        "And in small little groups, they were able to drive one of the world's better militaries out of Chechnya.",
        "Of course, the Russians came back and got better at this.",
        "We see in Iraq right now the same sort of thing.",
        "There's not one field general leading the operations, but rather the small groups with lots of authority to decide what they are going to do.",
        "And even we are pretty good at this when we put our minds to it.",
        "In Afghanistan, late in 2001, we had just 11 A teams, about 1,100 of our special operations forces in Afghanistan and working closely with air power.",
        "They were able to drive the Taliban and al-Qaida from power in just a few weeks.",
        "And even today, we work still in small groups in the country.",
        "And with a very tiny garrison compared to Iraq, the situation in Afghanistan is far better.",
        "So net warfare is coming along.",
        "I'm pleased occasionally to hear Secretary Rumsfeld say, you know, we're in net wars now, and we have to get good at that.",
        "And I think a lot of folks are paying great attention to this",
        "Unfortunately, the Israelis seem to be caught in a time loop here where they thing strategic bombardment can still actually work.",
        "And what they're doing is taking a hammer to a ball of quicksilver with this bombing all over Lebanon.",
        "Let's get a caller on.",
        "This is Mike, Mike calling us from Detroit.",
        "Yeah, I'd like to make a point about the Katyusha rockets.",
        "From what I've read and been able to find on the net, the Katyusha rocket is totally mobile.",
        "They're fired from the back of a truck, or the small ones can actually be handled by a couple of men.",
        "They're set up.",
        "They're fired.",
        "The people that shoot the rockets leave.",
        "So when Israel talks that they are targeting a launch site, it seems ridiculous to me.",
        "When they've spotted a launch site and then hours later they bomb the site, whoever shot that rocket off was gone 30 seconds after they shot it."

        "Exactly so.",
        "The Hezbollah strategy is kind of shoot and scoot.",
        "You're quite right.",
        "A large number of what they have can fit on the back of a truck.",
        "The Katyusha's a perfect weapon for a network to fight with, and a lot of these weapons are in caches sprinkled all over southern Lebanon.",
        "So the fire teams just moved to them, fire, move to the next.",
        "That's why it's very, very hard to engage them.",
        "And in fact this is the other big difference between traditional war and network warfare, is that it's no longer mass on mass, force on force.",
        "It's a game of hiders/finders.",
        "And so this depends on intelligence.",
        "And frankly, I'm sad to see the Israelis decided to stay with strategic bombing and to pull back their ground forces.",
        "They needed to be using small teams of ground forces to identify these fire teams moving here and there.",
        "And they have advantage and night vision and other technologies that would allow them to engage.",
        "And it's a puzzling military choice.",
        "But as Robert noted earlier, their chief of staff is an air officer who's probably more inclined to believe in the efficacy of strategic bombing.",
        "And, Col.",
        "Killebrew, to be fair, there are more complicated launchers for the longer range missiles that Israel - at least according to what it claims -has targeted effectively.",

        "He knows I'm an infantryman.",
        "I kind of listen to those comments with a touch of doubt.",
        "To be fair to the Israelis, they actually have deployed special forces teams of the type that John is talking about throughout the region.",
        "But as the caller said, trying to hit a Katyusha site is the hardest military problem you can give a conventional force.",
        "We were dodging Katyushas in Vietnam and had the same problem.",
        "The guys would fire them, and then 30 seconds later it would be off the launch site and gone.",
        "By the time your counter battery fire comes down - which can actually be very rapid - the people who fired the rocket are over the hill.",
        "I'll mention that there was an interview with the U.N.",
        "commander in Lebanon the other day who complained that Hezbollah is pulling up to his front gate outside the U.N.",
        "compound - the main U.N.",
        "compound - firing off rockets severally, and then waiting a little while and then beating feet so the Israeli response would come down on the U.N.",
        "compound instead of where the Hezbollah was.",
        "But they can be defeated.",
        "Not easily and not uniformly.",
        "And one way - as John said - one way to do it is have spotters on the ground overlooking probable launch sites, and then when somebody shows up and starts to unlimber a missile, you'd call down fire on them before they can get it off the tube.",
        "It's a hard military problem, but it does have solutions.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Mike.",
        "Joining us now to discuss Israel's military tactics and overall strategy is Ambassador James Dobbins, director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at the Rand Corporation, formerly U.S.",
        "Ambassador to the European community.",
