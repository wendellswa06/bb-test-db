        "Sure.",
        "And although I'm from San Francisco, I wouldn't necessarily quibble with characterizing Hezbollah as - among other things - a terrorist organization.",
        "But what my question is, is if Hezbollah is this new kind of entity, a loose network with a diverse sources of support -united I guess primarily by a shared ideology - is it possible to defeat an ideology militarily?",
        "It seems that you can't really kill an idea and public opinion - which you guys just said has swung towards Hezbollah -I would say is really what sustains a terrorist movement or ideology.",
        "Ambassador Dobbins?",
        "Well, I think that military force to the extent it's used has to be used in pursuit of a political objective if it's going to be successful in a circumstance like this.",
        "And that's, I think, where both American and Israeli policy might be faulted, that there doesn't seem to be an achievable political objective toward which this military force is being applied.",
        "John Arquilla, I wonder if I can get your thoughts on that?",
        "It's a wonderful question about the role of ideology and the power of networks.",
        "And unfortunately, the Israeli military response has only fed the narrative, the story that Hezbollah tells about how they are freedom fighters against an oppressive Israeli military machine.",
        "And I think part of the way to fight that would have been - as we were talking earlier - for the Israelis to use their focused special tactics observers and to fight in a way that used air power specifically in conjunction with small units on the ground - in other words, building their own military network to fight that network.",
        "And then we wouldn't have all this collateral damage all over Lebanon, and world opinion wouldn't have been swayed.",
        "So they could've done well, and the Israelis could've also done good, had they taken a more networked approach to this war, instead of thinking that the spirit of Curtis LeMay - the old Air Force general -still reigns supreme, and they could win with shock and awe.",
        "Because the only people shocked are those who are appalled at the dead civilians in Lebanon.",
        "Col.",
        "Killebrew, let me bring you in on this.",
        "And let me ask you also, in the past Israel's military strategy has included the idea of deterring its potential opponents by using tremendous amounts of force in every conflict to demonstrate that they ought to think twice, three times, four times, before doing it again.",
        "Is that one of the messages they're trying to send, do you think?",
        "That's absolutely one.",
        "I'll give you two reactions, Neal.",
        "The first is, I would not characterize what the Israeli air force did in the beginning as strategic bombardment.",
        "To me, what the Israeli air force was trying to do was to seal off south Lebanon from reinforcement or re-supply from Iran through Syria.",
        "And that is a reasonable adjunct to a ground campaign or could stand alone in the mistaken idea that air power alone could solve something like this.",
        "I agree with John that they could've thought it perhaps militarily smarter, but I would add that south Lebanon - as it was when this started - was an armed camp.",
        "It was not empty space like Afghanistan tended to be.",
        "So small teams put in there alone with little support would've been, I think, very quickly rolled up."

        "On the subject of ideology, the caller is exactly correct.",
        "Military power cannot kill ideas.",
        "The only way you kill an idea or overcome an idea is with a better idea.",
        "Generally speaking, the radicals throughout the Middle East - and I might add that in the past year, we've seen a turn away from pragmatism, vis-à- vis, the Palestinian/Israeli question and the whole issue being put into the hand of radicals, and Hamas, now Hezbollah, al-Qaida and other groups - the networks, as James called them.",
        "We have seen these people who are dedicated to the idea of the destruction of Israel in the name of their religion.",
        "Overcoming that idea is going to take us probably a generation or two once we find out what the better idea is.",
        "Until then, all military power can do is keep these people at bay.",
        "And some have suggested that Lebanon's fragile prosperity after all those years of civil war that was just building up, smashing that is not generally a way to win hearts and minds.",
        "The victim in this war is Lebanon, there's no question about it.",
        "But I do not think - and I'm not particularly an Israeli supporter - but we should not expect Israel to sit still and allow armed attacks on its territory to be mounted from Lebanon.",
        "Col.",
        "Killebrew, thanks very much for being with us today.",
        "Appreciate your time.",
        "Sir.",
        "Dave is on the line.",
        "Dave calling us from Greensboro, North Carolina.",
        "Hi, Neal, how are you?",
        "I just wanted to ask where do you draw the line between strategic bombardment and hitting hard military targets - or in this case, I guess Hezbollah targets - and collective punishment, such as destroying sewage treatment, blowing up power stations, hitting the boardwalk, destroying a lighthouse that was a tourist attraction that had been rebuilt since the last time the Israelis destroyed it?",
        "It seems that there's kind of this gray area, and the IAF is getting away with, oops, we tried, but you know, we've made some mistakes.",
        "A lot of these targets don't seem to be collateral damage, however.",
        "They've been hit in isolated areas.",
        "There's no secondary target near it.",
        "So I'm kind of confused about the coverage in terms of that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "John Arquilla, certainly what can sometimes look on one side like selective targeting and restraint, on the receiving end can look like indiscriminate bombing."

        "Well, and it is.",
        "The attempt to try to get the Lebanese to work against Hezbollah by knocking out bridges, port facilities, cratering runways hundreds of miles from the scene of battle - these are all classic elements of strategic bombing, which, by the way in about a 90-year history, has almost never worked.",
        "It just beggars the imagination that military people keep coming back to the idea of winning by strategic bombing alone.",
        "Even dropping bridges not too far from the battle zone is ultimately strategic in nature, because it aims at supplies for the longer term.",
        "What I've suggested is that Israeli air power needed to be used in a far more focused way in support of small teams operating in the south, which as Robert noted earlier, were there.",
        "And I don't think they could've been rolled up at all.",
        "In fact, if Hezbollah tried to concentrate against them, then Israeli air power would've decimated them.",
        "Which is what happened when we toppled the Taliban five years ago.",
        "Every time they tried to mass against our few forces, they were killed by the hundreds by a few aircraft.",
        "So the concept of operations is out there.",
        "The Israelis are reluctant to adopt it.",
        "Frankly, our own military still debates whether this Afghan model can or should be used again.",
        "And if you will, there's kind of war of ideas about the idea of war going on, which will be the subject of my next book.",
        "And I think that debate needs to be resolved favorably, or we're going to see one war after another that kills mostly civilians.",
        "Well, the Taliban had something to defend.",
        "They were the regime in power.",
        "Hezbollah doesn't look like it's trying to necessarily defend any targets.",
        "Nothing to mass - it's not massing against anything.",
        "Well, they are indeed massing against - every time the Israelis made a ground push, they massed against it.",
        "And I, for the life of me, I don't know why the Israelis have stopped engaging them.",
        "This campaign should be focused on Hezbollah fighters.",
        "Of course they try to defend that territory.",
        "And in fact, they drove the Israelis out of southern Lebanon six years ago, which in my view is part of the reason for the ferocity of the Israeli response this time - is a little bit of payback for having been driven out.",
        "As Robert said, Hezbollah is one of the top militaries in the Middle East.",
        "That's an amazing thing to say about a network, not a nation.",
        "And that's the era we're moving into.",
        "And so the Israelis are, I think, rightly trying to degrade the power of this network, but they're doing it in the wrong way.",
        "Yet also is but isn't an element of the state.",
        "And you were talking about these light Katyusha rockets that are easily moved and not expensive, yet they were also firing fairly sophisticated Chinese-made cruise missile at Israeli warships."

        "Yeah.",
        "I think even these small networks are going to have access to increasingly accurate, farther-ranging weapons, and that's yet another reason why small groups are going to be more and more powerful in the future.",
        "And that's why Rumsfeld and I have suggested that net war is the wave of the future.",
        "Thank goodness the American military at least has something called a net war command now, where we try to think about some of these issues.",

        "Because it covers up, it gives them an excuse for whenever they have these accidental bombings of these places where children and women are hiding, and where people live and in their homes.",
        "And they have this, it seems to me, the Israelis have a strategy very similar to terrorism, where they're able to use their overwhelming force to bomb indiscriminately and to really - it's so similar to the terrorism that they accuse of others of doing, where they themselves are...",
