        "Well, I think certainly there is some interspersing of Hezbollah among civilians.",
        "As Mao Zedong said about guerilla war, you must swim in the sea of the people.",
        "So naturally, some of that occurs.",
        "That should be a clue to the Israelis that strategic bombing isn't the best thing to do.",
        "It's certainly in the Israeli interest to play up those instances.",
        "But let's look at the real ground action in this war.",
        "When Israeli forces crossed the border into southern Lebanon, there weren't a lot of civilians in the way.",
        "Hezbollah came right at them, gave them a hard fight, and the Israelis decided that they didn't want any more of this.",
        "And I think that was their biggest mistake in terms of generalship in this war.",
        "They had an opportunity - Hezbollah was willing to come out and fight, and the Israelis fell back and instead are relying once again on bombing.",
        "And the sad news is we're going to end up with a war where 90 percent of the casualties are civilians, when in fact they had the chance to really right down Hezbollah power in direct fighting.",
        "And I think they should've.",
        "Ambassador Dobbins, evidence that Hezbollah headquarters - such as they are - equipment and military equipment are interspersed with civilians?",
        "Well, I think that it's logical to assume that Hezbollah would do that, because it would clearly be in their interest.",
        "And it's logical to assume that the Israelis are not intentionally targeting civilian populations, because it wouldn't be in their interest.",
        "So absent, you know, convincing documentary evidence to the contrary, I think it's reasonable to assume that Hezbollah is concealing some of its activities in a civilian population, and that the Israelis are legitimately trying to hit military targets and simply causing a good deal with collateral damage.",
        "On the other hand, the Israel targets of a strategic nature - if you will - elsewhere in Lebanon, where there's clearly no Hezbollah presence are more problematic, if you will, because they appear to be designed to put pressure on Lebanon - which, after all, is guilty if only by omission rather than commission for the attacks on Israel.",
        "Chris, thanks very much.",
        "And let's get one last caller in.",
        "This is Barry, Barry calling from Atlanta.",

        "It seems to me that Hezbollah is more than just a terrorist group, and that's what I'm getting from you guys.",
        "If most of the world or a good deal of the world now supports Lebanon and Hezbollah, and Hezbollah are Lebanese, essentially - there might be some others in there, but they are essentially Lebanese - I don't get this.",
        "But, you know, while you guys seem to be taking mostly the side of Israel - for one thing, I'd like to know what Hezbollah could do to increase its efficacy.",
        "What military strategy should they take to keep Israel - or get Israel out of Lebanon?",
        "Because Israel has been in Lebanon (unintelligible) times, as well as the other surrounding Arab nations.",
        "Well, let me broaden that question since you're the last caller, Barry.",
        "What do both sides need to feel victorious in this?",
        "And start with you, John Arquilla.",
        "Well, I think Hezbollah wins if the Israelis stop the bombing and don't have forces in Lebanon at the end of this.",
        "And they have been doing, for them, the right operational thing, which is engaging Israeli forces and continuing their scoot-and-shoot bombardment.",
        "They've managed over a couple of weeks to maintain about the same level of fire, although their accuracy went down.",
        "I think the best the Israelis can hope for right now, they have to stop this broader strategic bombing and focus their air power more closely on engagements on the ground to the extent to which the fighting continues.",
        "But I believe the collateral damage to date is going to put an enormous political pressure on the United States to bring an end to this.",
        "And so the best solution would be a kind of cordon sanitaire created in the south of Lebanon with troops patrolling it and some efforts made in the future to try to prevent a re-supply of Hezbollah forces.",
        "Ambassador Dobbins?",
        "Well, I think at this stage one would have to say that Hezbollah is fully gaining its objectives, which are on the one hand punish Israel, on the other hand to garner additional sympathy and international support and to thereby isolate Israel and the United States.",

        "And Israel is, at this stage at least, completely failing its objectives, which are to severely weaken Hezbollah if not eliminate it altogether as a military threat.",
        "Now, the war's not over.",
        "It could be concluded - it'll probably be concluded eventually on the same grounds as it could've been concluded at the beginning, which is a cease-fire and an exchange of prisoners.",
        "Now, the Israelis weren't willing to do that in the beginning, which is what sparked the attacks into Lebanon and then the attacks into Israel, but that's probably the only basis on which this is going to be concluded.",
        "Barry, thanks for the call, and thanks to our guests.",

        "He's become--in his 30s, he became a serious Christian fundamentalist, and he also had a period in his life where he struggled with alcohol and a period where he describes himself as kind of lost, when he first got to Washington, kind of overwhelmed by the scene there.",
