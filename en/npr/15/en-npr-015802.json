        "Well, Bernanke's role is to manage U.S.",
        "monetary policy - what does money cost, bank regulations, all that stuff.",
        "So frankly he doesn't have very many arrows in his quiver yet left.",
        "He's got - I think we're down to, you know, under one percent for the federal funds rate.",
        "So there's not a lot of pontificating around interest rates that Bernanke can do.",
        "He ought to be of greater voice around the stimulus especially around as you - strategy, the bad bank strategy you mentioned.",
        "I believe that what he's doing really is letting the Obama economic team get their feet wet.",
        "Very, very soon we ought to be hearing that he and the Treasury secretary have met.",
        "He's not an Alan Greenspan.",
        "If you think back to 1992 when Clinton was elected, Greenspan immediately jumped out there and was almost a jockeying between Greenspan and Clinton.",
        "And Greenspan made it clear, hey, I'm the money guy, I'm in charge of this, guys.",
        "And he, you know, he went to the White House, he had very long meeting with Clinton.",
        "It's been written about by - it's been written about it, you know, the Washington Post reporter has written extensively about that meeting, Carl F - Bernstein.",
        "Bernstein.",
        "Yeah, he's written about that.",
        "So, you know, Greenspan was much more one to position himself as aggressive.",
        "If we think about Bernanke, Bernanke has been in the role now for under two years or about two years.",
        "I wouldn't say that he hasn't gotten his feet wet, but I would say that he doesn't have the aggression than Greenspan had and in many ways that's good.",
        "But you're certainly right that his name, we aren't hearing from him.",
        "But I would expect it would be discordant if within the next couple of weeks as the Obama economic team comes together, it would be discordant if we did not see some photos of Bernanke going to the White House sitting with a Treasury secretary, sitting with Summers, and doing some of that.",
        "If he hasn't done something like that in the next two years - two weeks, he's very much abdicating his role.",
        "Let's talk about what some of the states are trying to do.",
        "You know that the president went to the Midwest today to try to pitch his stimulus plan.",
        "Out here in California though things are as bad as they are any place in the country, if not worse, and as result of that California is one of those places where the unemployment rate is higher than the national average.",
        "And there is a new system here now called Furlough Fridays.",
        "The governor has ordered state workers to take every other Friday off without pay.",
        "It's already affected the DMV, the Office of Emergency Services.",
        "Is this going to be spreading around the country, do you think?",
        "Well, the furlough is a way of keeping people in their jobs and giving them a pay cut.",
        "So, if you take two days off a month, that's a 10 percent out of - an average of 20 working days in a month, that's a 10 percent roughly pay cut.",
        "And what he's doing is spreading the pain around rather than to say, let's cut x number of jobs, which is, you know, cut x number of hours.",
        "This is consistent with the trend that we see nationally, that the number of hours worked per week is down, just a touch, not much, but just a touch.",
        "And I do expect that cities are going to - cities and states are going to have to be imaginative.",
        "Here in North Carolina, the public universities, blessedly not the private ones, but the public have had to take a seven percent cut, which means my neighbors at North Carolina A&T and my neighbors at UNC Greensboro are having to cut at least a hundred jobs in each case.",
        "So, you know, rather than to have to physically cut jobs, you know, keep people employed.",
        "So it's not a bad idea.",
        "It's uncomfortable obviously for everyone, but it's a way to share the pain.",
        "Let's bring the conversation to a close with this.",
        "We're seeing pictures today of people standing in lines in Chicago, in Atlanta, trying to get a few jobs that are being offered.",
        "You're at a university, and it's coming up on the spring when people will be graduating, some with degrees in business, et cetera.",
        "Really briefly, Dr. Malveaux, what are you telling your graduates about what they should do with a job market as dismal as this one is?",
        "As dismal as a job market is, people are being hired every day.",
        "I mean, you still have some turn in the labor market, so people are being hired.",
        "I tell my students be prepared.",
        "Have that resume, make sure it's perfect, absolutely perfect, and that goes for everyone.",
        "Use your network, network like crazy, and follow up with people as quickly as you can.",
        "Standing outside is one way to get a job but, you know, making telephone calls inside is another.",
        "Be wary of the Internet.",
        "A lot of people are, you know, trying to find jobs on the Internet and they're putting out a lot of their personal information, you know, social security numbers and other things.",
        "And that's just an invitation for some crazy desperate people to do identity theft.",
        "So be careful about what you put out there, but be as forceful as you can and get back to people as professional as you can.",
        "Get back to people as quickly as you can.",
        "If people offer you interviews at inconvenient times, too bad, just do it because these jobs are hard to come by.",
        "They are there, but they're hard to come by."

        "What about the timing of this?",
        "You know, it seems - why are these being given licenses right now?",
        "Well, it's actually been in development for quite some time, and Southern Company has been making tremendous progress on early site preparation.",
        "But to move forward, to begin pouring concrete for the foundations of these reactors, they did need to have the construction license in place.",
        "And now it is.",
        "So the construction will start to ramp-up quickly from here.",
        "Is this significant?",
        "Well, it is quite significant.",
        "As you noted, these are the first new reactors to start construction in the United States in three decades.",
        "And the experience that will come from building these new reactors will be very important in informing decisions going forward about the role that nuclear energy should play because, of course, the cost of constructing reactors is the most important economic consideration.",
        "Once built, the fuel and operations costs are very, very affordable.",
        "And what is the bill on this one?",
        "Well, these I think are close to $10 billion, and given the fact that they will produce very, very large amounts of electricity, the electricity they produce ends up being affordable.",
        "But of course the construction cost is quite large.",
        "The fuel operations and maintenance will be on the order of about 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.",
        "So it's really the construction costs that are the important issue.",
        "We talked about track record a little bit.",
        "Isn't the idea that these will be up and running by 2016 a bit optimistic given the track record of building nuclear reactors?"

        "Well, certainly the track record in the past has been rather poor, and that's why people will be looking at these two new plants very closely.",
        "Now, their sister plants essentially carbon copies to a set of about six reactors of the same type that are under construction in China, and those reactors are on-schedule, on-budget.",
        "The construction methods for these new reactors that Westinghouse is building is completely different from the old ones.",
        "They're actually factory pre-fabricated and assembled at the site rather than being essentially built in place at the site.",
        "And I guess it is good to have the - the Chinese have a bit of a head start on these.",
        "So you can send a team over to watch what's going on.",
        "Yes, indeed.",
        "In fact, Southern has had a large number of people over in China observing the construction, as have Westinghouse and Shaw.",
        "And the fact that these are of similar design because one of the criticisms of the American nuclear industry is that you have so many different designs by different companies that you can't really standardize anything.",
        "That's correct.",
        "The existing plants that we have, each one was unique, and it was recognized afterwards, given the poor experience in constructing them, that standardization would be important, not only that but when they started the construction on those plants, typically the detail design would only be about 40 percent complete.",
        "And to issue a combined license, the NRC requires essentially 100 percent completion of design.",
        "So you know exactly what it is you're going to build in advance of starting construction.",
        "And people believe that should be very helpful in the construction of these new plants.",
        "There was one dissenting votes for these licenses at the NRC, but it was the chairman, was it not, who...",
        "That is correct, and I think that the key issue here is that we know that these new plant designs, because they incorporate passive safety features, and they do not require any electrical power to remove heat after they shut down, would not be subject to the direct set of problems that the plants in Fukushima had.",
        "But people also recognize that it's important to review and scrub these designs to make sure that there's no additional lessons from Fukushima that might make changes.",
        "And I think that the area of disagreement here related to the timing for getting that done in terms of issuing a construction license versus when those issues need to be looked at closely."

        "But it will happen for these plants, and of course anything that can be learned from Fukushima will be integrated into the design operation of these new plants.",
        "If there's a design change, will they put a new - an amendment, an amended design to it if...",
        "Indeed, I can expect that they would, although what we've learned from Fukushima is that the most important thing to have is the capability to bring in and hook up portable equipment to restore key safety functions like water injection.",
        "And so most of the things that we're doing in response to Fukushima do not involve major plant modifications but rather installing or bringing in additional equipment of a portable nature and also upgrading instrumentation, neither of which are major plant modifications.",
        "Are these any of the - what they're talking about, the generation four nuclear reactors?",
        "No, these are still water-cooled reactors, and I think utilities are most comfortable with this type of reactor technology for this interim period because they have an enormous amount of experience with how well the fuels work and the reliability of the systems.",
        "So it's my expectation that we'll see generation four designs with further improvements moving into commercial deployment, probably 15, 20 years will be necessary to get to that point.",
        "And so there's not going to be every 15, 20 years, we'll see another 15, 20 years because these things keep getting pushed into the future, you know.",
        "It's like fusion.",
        "It's always 30 years away no matter what yea it is, but...",
        "Well, thanks so much for being with us today, Nina.",
        "One of the interesting things here is this is actual concrete and steel that's being put in place.",
        "So these are new plants.",
        "But as I'd mentioned before, the experience gained from building these plants will be quite important.",
        "In the near term, people are also very interested in developing smaller reactors, called SMRs, that would use the same fuel and coolant because we think that the financing and deployment of smaller reactors will be easier, and that will make it easier to get further development to occur.",
        "But we need to remember that all technologies improve over time, and so if you take a look at automobiles, for example, you could go back to the Model T and the Model A, and I would say that the plants that are running today in the United States might be considered to be Model T's.",
        "If these Westinghouse plants are the Model A's, then it'll be quite interesting to see where we are in 40 to 50 years in terms of further major advances in the technology."
