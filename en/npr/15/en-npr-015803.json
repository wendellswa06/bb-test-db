        "One of the problems with the Japanese disaster was that the - there were those pools for the spent rods and losing water out of them, aside the fact of having the reactor not able to cool itself down.",
        "What's the situation with these new reactors and where the fuel rods are kept?",
        "That's correct.",
        "And so another major issue of Fukushima was the lack of instrumentation to measure the amount of water in those pools.",
        "Fukushima also had a storage pool that looks much closer to the design of the storage pools at the - in the Westinghouse type of reactors.",
        "It was a centralized pool in a separate building.",
        "And it, along with drycast storage at the site, performed just fine.",
        "So the types of spent fuel pools that the pressurized water reactors like the AP1000 have, are much more robust and easy to get access to if you do have accidents or natural disasters.",
        "And so I think we can expect that the safety of the fuel storage in AP1000s will be similar to that of the centralized pools at Fukushima, which perform just fine.",
        "It was in-reactor pools in high elevation and those boiling-water reactors that proved to be problematic.",
        "Give us a quick little lesson in how the passive system works that you helped design.",
        "What does it - how does it kick in and work?",
        "Well, the key thing with the passive systems is that once you shut down a reactor, and the types of reactors that we build in the Western countries will shut down automatically, they have negative temperature feedback.",
        "So once the fission reaction is shut down, one still continues to produce heat.",
        "It's a relatively small fraction of the total power, but if you don't remove this heat reliably, then the fuel can overheat, become damaged and drive off radioactive material.",
        "And in the existing plants, one uses pumps and heat exchangers to circulate water into the reactor to remove this heat.",
        "In these new plant designs like the AP1000, the heat is removed purely by buoyancy-driven processes, that is gravity-driven flows, taking advantage of the fact that hot fluid wants to move up, and cold fluid wants to move down.",
        "And so in the AP1000, there's actually multiple different passive mechanisms by which you can get heat out of the core.",
        "One is over into a large pool of water that sits inside containment.",
        "And then you can also depressurize the reactor, and then evaporation of water will cool the core.",
        "It'll condense on the walls, it'll run back down again, and the heat ultimately gets sent out to the atmosphere.",
        "Yeah, it runs without power, in other words."

        "That's correct, no electrical power needed.",
        "And what about safety from let's say errant airplane attacks or crashes into the building or even into the area where the rods are stored?",
        "Yes, that's also something that we considered in our - is considered in the design of these reactors.",
        "And the containment building and structures around the reactors has been designed to sustain that type of airplane crash without allowing parts of the airplane to get inside the reactor building and while preserving the integrity of all the equipment that's inside the building.",
        "And so these types of external events are considered in the design, and the designs are capable of sustaining them.",
        "And as far as the nuclear waste that comes out, what happens to it?",
        "Well, we're in the process, actually, of hopefully getting a new set of policies for nuclear waste.",
        "One of the things that I've been able to do over the last two years is to serve on a blue-ribbon commission that was formed by the Obama administration that was - that has looked at the policy framework that we have for managing spent fuel and high-level waste.",
        "And there's really serious problems with that policy framework that has contributed to the long lack of progress in developing solutions for management and disposal of spent fuel and high-level waste.",
        "And probably the most important thing that we can do to get to workable solutions will be to act on the recommendations that the blue-ribbon commission has made.",
        "We'll get back to you on that, Dr. Peterson, thank you for joining with us.",

        "Most of the players on the current Steelers were on that Super Bowl team, whereas the Arizona Cardinals only have six players who ever played in a Super Bowl.",
