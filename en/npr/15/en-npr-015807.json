        "Give us a call, 800-989-8255.",
        "Email us, talk@npr.org.",
        "Michael Sallah, we have to report, obviously you're looking in this case for abuses and for a lack of oversight.",
        "There must be facilities that are - are models in Florida.",
        "One of these facilities we looked at, Neal, that actually - we looked at a place called, was called Rosalie Manor.",
        "It's in Pinellas County.",
        "It was a place that was, quite frankly, at one time a hellhole.",
        "It had a lot of death.",
        "It had a lot of fights, a lot drug-dealing.",
        "And we found an owner who turned it around.",
        "He managed to get in there, roll up his sleeves and start carefully screening the people going in, cleaning the facility, really reaching out to them as an administrator should.",
        "And it became a model for - and quite frankly, while he has small issues and minor issues here and there, no place is perfect, he showed that you could turn a bad place around and what you could do.",
        "He renamed it, repainted it, brought in new staff, and it became quite a place that the regulators now say is doing the right thing.",
        "So it's the conscientiousness of the owner.",
        "It all starts at the top, how are you going to run these places that, quite frankly, are now the signature homes of Florida.",
        "There are more of these than there are nursing homes.",
        "This is where most people are going.",
        "They're living longer.",
        "So they've become very, very important entities here in the Sunshine State.",
        "And we'll more calls in just a second, but the lack of regulation yes, it can lead - and the lack of inspection and the lack of enforcement - those can lead to - and you describe instances of people who seem to regard themselves as petty gods almost, who ran these facilities.",
        "But is it possible that that also makes it open to experimentation, to trying new things that might be restricted if this industry were strictly regulated?",
        "Well, I think that what happens is, when you let somebody go, as long as they're allowed to keep going, they're going to continue to take things to the limits.",
        "And that's why at a lot of these facilities where there are people with mental illness, they're now resorting to tying them up, they're resorting to putting them in isolation chambers, or they're looking at doping them up with these powerful tranquilizers without doctors' orders."

        "I first spoke to a nursing home administrator who recommended this facility.",

        "So they stopped giving him the Seroquil.",

        "So I called back, and when I called back about fixing(ph) his liquids, they stopped giving him fluids during the day and only gave him (unintelligible) water with his meals.",
        "He developed explosive diarrhea and then from that he got a urinary tract infection.",
        "So two weeks after we put him in there, we went to pick him up.",
        "Instead of taking him home, we had to take him to a hospital in an ambulance, where he died six days later.",

        "Yes.",

        "There was one case that you cited, Michael Sallah, one of the few cases where you could get actual documentation, because a lawsuit was brought, and you wonder why more cases aren't taken to court for things like wrongful death, civil cases.",
        "Well, I think part of the problem there, Neal, is that we sign arbitration agreements when you come into these facilities.",
        "So you subject yourself pretty much to an arbitrator's decision.",
        "And also in Florida they did tort reform in 2001.",
        "So they capped the kinds of damages that you can get in these arbitrations, and most facilities only have to carry a $25,000 surety bond or insurance.",
        "That doesn't go very far, and you can deplete that in one year with one case, and then there's nothing left for the rest of that year.",
        "So I think what you're finding is - we're certainly not advocates of any type of, where, you know, one could have a field day with lawsuits.",
        "But for a long time there, the lawyers were, you know, unfortunately, were the civil regulators in many ways, and they were ensuring that these homes could feel the consequences where they felt it most, in their pocketbook.",
        "When that's not a part of the equation, I think that's certainly one of the reasons why there's a there's some of the problems that we found down here.",
        "Kenny Malone, let me ask you: When you try to hold people accountable, when you go to talk to them about these problems, administrators, and you talked to state regulators and the people who are in charge, I wonder, how did they respond?",
        "We did one confrontation interview in particular that was interesting, the case that we discussed earlier, of Aurora Navis.",
        "You know, three of us packed into a car and drove from facility to facility trying to find out where she was.",
        "And you know, when we finally got a hold of her, I mean, it's just so tricky because there are so many layers to these things that when we asked her why, you know, why were there no locks on the doors, why were there no locks on the gates, and we - she says, well, the firefighters came and told me to take them off.",
        "And, you know, I checked that later, and it's true.",
        "You can't lock people in the facility.",
        "But the Miami-Dad fire inspectors never said don't have locks on the doors.",
        "They said, you know, have specific locks, locks that are double-knobbed to help prevent Alzheimer's patients from wandering out."

        "It was passed in the mid-'90s under the late Governor Lawton Chiles.",
        "And unfortunately, this law is not used.",
        "And in many of the counties we found the prosecutors weren't even well-attuned or even familiar with the law.",
        "So of 70 cases that we found where there was rampant abuse and/or neglect in a death case, they only prosecuted two people.",
        "Both of them got probation, and one of them had the charges expunged from her record.",
        "So even in the cases of where they altered records and they were caught, they could have filed criminal charges, but in one case, I remember interviewing the prosecutor, he said it was just a civil matter.",

        "It's all a matter of the profit motive.",
        "And facilities hold people in the facilities much longer than they should be.",
        "Now, we're talking about assisted living, but there are various other levels of care that are available to people.",
