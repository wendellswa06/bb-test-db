        "The - and the governor has not responded.",
        "However, the leader - some of the leadership of the Florida Senate announced - led by State Senator Ronda Storms, and - a Republican, and State Senator Nan Rich, a Democrat, had launched an interim project which is an initiative to basically make improvements in the law.",
        "Again, that was Saundra Toby-Heath and Alicia Heath-Toby, and they've been kind enough to come back to talk with us here at NEWS & NOTES about their change of heart.",
        "My pleasure.",
        "So they've already pledged that they're going to look at raising the credentials of ALF administrators, increasing the inspections of the facilities, and they're looking at - perhaps even looking at heightening some of the penalties."

        "Well this is certainly, certainly a major question that's out there.",
        "I mean, we're happy to see that an investigation over the interim will be conducted, but it's very hard to tell.",

        "It's a pretty big deal I believe, particularly for those who might be caught in the donut hole of the Medicare prescription drug plan.",
        "And when you consider that communities that are served by Wal-Mart, I think it will have an impact on the marketplace.",
        "Now I don't think it will have a dramatic impact on health disparities because, you know, one has to go to the doctor first, and it's the lack of insurance that keeps the person from going to the doctor to get the prescription.",
        "But it is a good step in the right direction.",
        "We just heard from Bill Simon of Wal-Mart and he too mentioned this donut hole.",
        "Can you explain what that is?",

        "Now those with the lowest incomes are going to be protected.",
        "But the middle-income group will end up having to pay a hundred percent until they reach a much higher threshold for drug expenses.",
        "So for those, being able to access generic drugs at that kind of discount will probably be beneficial.",
        "Dr.",
        "Puckrein, how important are the drugs that are being offered to the African-American community?",
        "Are these drugs that are used very often by African-American and other ethnic communities or is that sort of not taking into account in the choice of drugs that are offered as this $4 generics?",
        "Well, generic drugs are actually a mixed bag when it comes to the minority community.",
        "The problem really starts very early when they will brand a drug, meaning they were under patent.",
        "The problem that we have is there are not a lot of minorities in the clinical trials that lead to these drugs.",
        "So whether the drug becomes a generic, what you then have is health plans, in the (unintelligible) of dollars, make these drugs available as the first choice."

        "And it doesn't take into account that, you know, drug's variability, that these drugs may not be as effective in certain populations.",
        "And you end up with what's called step therapy: The patients are asked to fail on that medication before they're offered maybe a branded drug, which could be more expensive.",
        "Now along those lines, generics reportedly accounted for 57 percent of all the prescriptions sold in the United States and 13 percent of sales.",
        "That's according to a health care information company called IMS Health.",
        "I guess the disparity between the 57 percent of prescriptions and the 13 percent of sales is about price.",

        "And that even beyond that that our rights will extend to the federal rights that marriage grants us.",
        "So we haven't had a change of heart.",
        "We've just done -kind of done the thing that will kind of secure all of what we've worked for together in the last 18 years.",
        "So that's really what we did it for and why we did it.",
        "Well, as you say, you've been together for 18 years.",
        "So, tell me how important this whole idea of equal language means to you?",
        "You say you will keep fighting for that.",
        "Well, for us, civil union is a big question mark.",
        "We don't really know what that's going to look like.",
