        "In most instances, gentle heat is what the egg loves.",
        "And when you cook them very slowly over very gentle heat, the curds form.",
        "And as you stir, the rest of the egg sort of warms, but doesn't fully cook, and becomes sort of a sauce for the curds.",
        "So it should be a creamy and delicious and delicate preparation."
