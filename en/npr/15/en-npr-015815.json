        "He'd heard this story, and he'd heard that story about Mr. Deveaux, and he sent me this message with that quote from Macbeth saying, I wonder what Mr. Deveaux would think about this quote.",
        "Because he kind of predicted my future, and he was right, but then I turned it around and got into acting.",
        "So that little speech that Banquo has in \"\"Macbeth\"\" always kind of resonates with me, you know?",

        "Without pipelines to move it underground, increased traffic on the rails has resulted in more derailments across the country.",
        "In January, a derailment in Philadelphia left six tanker cars full of oil intact, but leaning across the tracks of a bridge that spans a river and a busy interstate.",
        "Lindemer says the federal government and the rail industry are busy playing catch-up to make moving all this oil safer.",
        "This shale resource, both oil and gas, has been developed so quickly, so we're on a pretty steep learning curve in order to make the distribution system compatible with the new resources.",
        "Lindemer says building a natural gas pipeline will come with its own set of regulatory and social challenges.",
        "Getting permits will take time.",

        "But it now looks more and more likely that their big getaway plan was to, you know, get help from this one prison worker, Joyce Mitchell.",
        "She allegedly helped the men escape, and authorities now say they think she just got cold feet and backed out of the deal.",
