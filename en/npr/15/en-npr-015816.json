        "Thank you so much for having me.",
        "And do you think that President Obama is going to agree with your structure and pick a woman?",
        "Certainly the - but - from the inside the White House in the scuttle, but I think that I'm hearing pretty much everywhere is that it's very, very likely that Obama will tap a woman this time.",
        "And given that, who do you think is at the top of the list?",
        "You know, I have to say, I think the accusations have more credibility than the denial.",
        "I think it would be best if Roy would just step aside.",
        "All right, folks.",
        "I said during the tease into this segment that the Democrats seemingly have found some life.",
        "We saw a very interesting session, a closed-door session, an unusual session, that went on in the Senate yesterday, forced by the Democrats to face the question of looking at the intelligence used by the Bush administration that ran up to the war in Iraq, and accusing Republicans of ignoring the issue.",
        "Democratic leader Harry Reid has been very strong over the course of the last couple of weeks, quite frankly, raising his visibility.",
        "George Curry, are we finally seeing signs of life from the Democratic Party on a national level to get in the ring and fight Republicans?",
        "Well, we see a pause there, and I was wondering about that before.",
        "But the question is, how long will it last?",
        "I mean, the Republicans were adamant about this.",
        "They are upset.",
        "In fact, the majority leader, Frist, say he can't trust Henry Reid, the minority leader, anymore, and he won't be able to trust him for the next year and a half.",
        "And this is really setting the stage for a real confrontation over the Supreme Court confirmation hearing.",
        "But they certainly showed some signs--it hadn't been done in 25 years--and basically been rolling over and playing dead up to now.",
        "Yvonne, what of the common man who takes a look at Washington, DC?",
        "I was in Washington last week and talked to a number of people on the Hill, and old-school political heads who suggested they've not seen this kind of partisanship and partisan bickering in Washington for a long, long time.",
        "Many are even suggesting they've never seen it this bad.",
        "Well, I think that is what a lot of people are saying.",
        "In the past, certainly, people who could have come from different sides of the aisle and during the day had those debates and arguments, but later on, they did socialize; they did have relationships that also allowed them to make the compromises that were necessary within the political realm.",
        "Right now we have two warring factions and, unfortunately, whether or not the Democrats have a pulse is almost irrelevant, because they don't have the votes, so if we continue on this path, we're going to get no business done or, rather, even less business than we're normally accustomed to.",
        "I also think that it is interesting that the Republicans always seem to raise the issue of civility when they are on the defensive.",
        "They seem to not particularly have that same stance when they are the ones who are pushing their policies or pushing agendas that the other side of the aisle is not in agreement with.",
        "So I think that was very interesting."

        "Pedro Noguera, what of the comments that we heard from many Republicans, operatives as well as senators, who suggested that this is nothing but a political `stunt,' if you will, I believe was the word used by some, that Democrats are just trying to gain attention but have no real want to figure out what, in fact, was the intelligence used and utilized by the president?",
        "Well, that might very well be the case.",
        "It looks like political theater from the outside, but the main point is the issue that's being raised about the intelligence, the way intelligence was used to take the country to war, about the leaks of the names of the CIA operatives by the administration.",
        "I think it's important for the Democrats not to let that issue go away, and it's clear that Bush is trying to change the conversation with the appointment of the new--or at least his nominee for the Supreme Court, but we can't allow the violations that have occurred in national security, that have been obviously perpetrated by the vice president, at least him, if not Karl Rove as well, to just go under--be swept under the rug.",
        "Yvonne, when I said that the Democrats would have...",
        "George Curry, there are a lot of Democrats who are going to suggest, George, that this intelligence was the same intelligence that they utilized; more of them than not voted for this war, initially.",
        "They did, but the point was that they need to go back and review what went wrong and how it was all messed up, and that was the whole point here.",
        "And it's been almost a year, and Republicans basically do not like bad news, and so they've been sitting on this.",
        "And so the Democrats forced their hand.",
        "Well, my earlier point, Yvonne, was that...",
        "Well, nobody likes bad news politically, on either side of the aisle.",
        "Yeah, I know, but they just not--they go to great extremes to suppress it.",
        "My earlier point with Yvonne was, yeah, they need to have a pause, they need to have an alternative, and they've showed no signs of it.",
        "And even here, I don't know how long this will last.",
        "I'll be surprised if it does, because they have not shown--Democrats have not shown much backbone.",
        "You're exactly right.",
        "And I also think that what is important is that we've had all this information from the very beginning.",
        "Anybody who's been following this news has seen the Republican or the Bush spin, however you want to term it.",
        "But whether we talk about the links to Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda or the lack of link--we can talk about Valerie Plame and all of that, but that information has been out there.",
        "So the Democrats have not been particularly effective in keeping on point and keeping this in front of the public eye and keeping some heat on these issues.",
        "So we're acting like this--the indictment of Scooter Libby is like some big deal, but the information has been there.",
        "All right, Pedro Noguera, here's the $64,000 question: With all of what Democrats are doing--and we talked to Juan Williams and Ron Walters at the beginning of the week, and this is something that is being talked about, obviously, in Washington, particularly by those of the Democratic slant, and that is whether we're going to see the, quote, \"\"nuclear option\"\"--that's the language that the media likes to use today--to halt this Supreme Court nominee.",
        "Mr. Alito is someone that those on the far left clearly see as detrimental to the court.",
        "Should Democrats, as they gear up to make this noise, get ready to dig their heels in and make this the fight they want to put front and center?"

        "The Democratic Party's got to do the same thing with the moderate Republicans.",
        "They're going to have to make the case that this nominee is so extreme and so outside the mainstream that even the moderate Republicans, like the two senators in Maine and several others, cannot support him.",
        "If they can do that, they have a chance of not only blocking the nominee and, therefore, not having to use the filibuster, but also swaying public opinion.",
        "But I think to do that, they really have to expose why this particular nominee is unacceptable to the mainstream.",
        "And I think the problem they're going to have with this is they confirmed the man before, I think by a 100 percent vote, and so you can't say, `Oh, he was all right then,' and suddenly with--now he has experience he's going to be terrible.",
        "Sure, he has a record now, and people are certainly attacking it, but you can't say he's so inept or unqualified when you voted for him before.",
        "All right.",
        "And I would--I'm sorry.",

        "Well, it's interesting to me how we hear now about Harriet Miers being unqualified--and I'm not going to argue whether or not she was qualified or not, but certainly we've had others sit on the bench that did not have what we're calling this constitutional background before.",
        "It would not have been unheard of.",
        "And we did not, interestingly enough, even get an opportunity to hear for ourselves what this woman may or may not know by means of constitutional law and history, etc.",

        "She seemed like she--from what I understood and what I read, she was a great litigator, corporate litigator.",
        "She had done some other work, but there was no record and Bush was not going to release what she had done in the White House.",

        "It says that the American family is in complete transformation, that, increasingly, large numbers of children are not born or raised in families with two parents.",
        "Less than 50 percent of households have a mother and father at home, because we have a very high divorce rate.",
        "And so I think, while it is troubling and certainly something that we need to pay attention to, I think the larger issue is: Why are so many Americans choosing not to marry, or when they do marry, choosing not to stay together?",
        "And then, therefore, what are the implications for children?",

        "That whole Harriet-and-Ozzie fantasy has not existed for decades.",
        "And we have to be honest about that.",

        "There are resources there, plus there are societal supports there.",
        "So there's not the whole same conversation about the detriment to the child that we're seeing here.",
        "So we really have to get on--reconcile these two visions, the reality vs. the mythology that we like to keep promoting.",
        "But, Pedro, the interesting point is what you raised.",
        "I think a decade or so ago there was the question of the idea of the split of the nuclear family.",
        "This number looks at the babies being born without the existence of the nuclear family up front.",
        "That's right.",
        "And I think that that's the question that we need to try to get at: Why is it that greater and greater number of women are choosing to have children on their own?",
        "And why aren't the men involved in the picture with raising kids?",
        "And, you know, I don't think this is something that you can legislation.",
        "You can't legislate whether or not people get married.",
        "But as Yvonne pointed out, you can, as a nation, address the consequences of these kinds of decisions, and they do have implications for child care, for after-school care and child welfare generally.",
