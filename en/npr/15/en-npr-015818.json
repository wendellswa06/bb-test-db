        "The other, I think, candidates that are at the top of the top of the list, of the short list, are probably Judge Diane Wood for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.",
        "Obama knew her in Chicago.",
        "And she's known as a really bright light, very, very smart capable jurist.",
        "And Elena Kagan, who, formerly the dean of Harvard Law School, who, again, reputed to be both brilliant and has just been named and confirmed as the first woman solicitor general of the United States.",
        "So that's probably the short list.",
        "And you used an interesting word there in talking about Elena Kagan -confirmed.",
        "She's just gone through the confirmation process and that's obviously going to be a little bit more rigorous if she's nominated to be the next justice of the United States Supreme Court.",
        "Nevertheless, the background checks have been done.",
        "Right.",
        "Although, I will say this looked to be - if you'd asked a couple months ago - this looked like it was going to be a cake walk for Kagan.",
        "And she actually had a fairly rough confirmation hearing for the SG post.",
        "There was some real controversy about a position she took about the don't ask, don't tell policy in the military and a brief she signed on, while she was dean of Harvard Law School, not wanting military recruiters to be able to recruit at Harvard Law School because of that policy, even though a lot, a lot, a lot of academics signed onto that brief.",
        "She took enormous amount of heat at her confirmation for that and other things.",
        "Yet, if that heat is coming from the right, if you will, by the time this confirmation vote comes, I think everybody anticipates there will be 60 Democrats in the United States Senate."

        "And that raises this very interesting strategic question for him, which is, should he therefore put the sort of liberal Scalia, a leftwing bomb-thrower who can really counterbalance a court that I think has become, at least intellectually endures, prudentially, quite dominated by the right wing of the court, or should he just put someone who's moderate and confirmable and not too offensive.",

        "And the three women you mentioned right off the top of your head, well, I'm not sure they would accept the word monastery, but nevertheless…",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Certainly, Elena Kagan, then, fits the profile, because she's had no judicial experience, which is something that she's going to, again, take heat from.",
        "I think that some of the other interesting candidates who would fit Senator Leahy's qualification are people like Jennifer Granholm, who's been - whose name has been (unintelligible) about a lot this week.",
        "I think, again, with this thought that it'd be really nice to have a Supreme Court that isn't comprised solely of people who were either academics or judges in a prior life.",
