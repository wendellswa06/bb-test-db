        "He did lose his job, but it took a year for that to happen.",
        "Our reporting began in January 2002.",
        "In December 2002, almost a year later, he resigned.",
        "For a while, he was at a convent in Maryland.",
        "But then in 2004, Pope John Paul II appointed him an archpriest, a high priest, of a prominent church in Rome.",
        "It was called the St. Mary Major Basilica.",
        "And the job was ceremonial mostly but very prestigious, and many victims view that as a promotion.",

        "If I remember correctly, he was about to be deposed by the district attorney's office in Boston.",
        "The noose was starting to tighten a little bit, and he just left the country.",
        "He was deposed by a number of civil attorneys who were representing victims, but never were criminal charges brought.",
        "There was talk of whether maybe there could be racketeering charges, but ultimately, he escaped criminal prosecution.",
        "And many people feel that he really was never held accountable enough for what he did.",
        "And, you know, he repeatedly insisted that he had never tried to shift the problem from one place to another.",
        "But I think very clearly he did and for reasons that I still don't think I entirely understand, he was primarily concerned with protecting the church, protecting the priests.",
        "And I think he minimized the impact on the victims and the families.",
        "What did it tell you that instead of being stuffed into some back office somewhere in Vatican City he was made the archpriest of a pontifical basilica - as you mention, a tremendous honor.",
        "The Church of Santa Maria Maggiore is one of the pope's own churches in Rome.",
        "Did this send a message that they didn't think that he was damaged goods?",
        "It certainly seems to have, and I think to this day I'm not quite sure that the Vatican, the Catholic Church, the individual priests within the church, really understand the impact of clergy sex abuse.",
        "Keep in mind that this is often the very first sexual experience these kids ever had.",
        "They were often little boys.",
        "It was not only an adult but a priest who was so revered.",
        "And it made it difficult for them ever to have stable relationships again, often - especially intimate ones.",
        "It's so typical for there to be stories of depression and drug use and alcoholism and anger.",
        "And I don't know if the church understands that it was more than just a harmless misbehavior by their priest.",

        "And in this year's greetings, he denounced the cancer of cliques and how Vatican bureaucrats can become corrupted by ambition and vanity.",
        "Many in the Vatican believe this criticism that's so public is damaging because it reinforces on the outside a very negative image of the church.",
