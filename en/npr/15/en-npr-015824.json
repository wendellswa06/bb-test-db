        "So here's a situation that anybody who's been a freelancer in the last 10 years has faced: you need that precious Wi-Fi at the coffee shop, but how many cappuccinos do you have to buy to justify sitting there all day?",
        "And finally, someone saw an opportunity there, right?",
        "So for those who are not shameless, like you and me, and are willing just to buy one and sit there for eight hours, there's now a new option called pay-as-you-go cafes, where instead of paying for the coffee, you actually just pay for the amount of time you're there.",
        "Some of the spots are only literally a nickel a minute, so about $3 an hour.",
        "But it's taken off in Europe as well as South America.",
        "It's great because, I mean, if you've been in that situation, as I have, you're doing this constant, like, moral math in your head.",
        "Well, it's not too crowded, so I can hang around a bit longer or do I need to have a second one to justify my spot or - it's surprising nobody thought about this before.",
        "One of the places called Urban Station has been around since 2009.",
        "And the other place called Ziferblat, which now you can enjoy in London, among other places, really got its start in Russia.",
        "But a lot of young people and a lot of just freelancers in general are finding this makes all the sense in the world.",
