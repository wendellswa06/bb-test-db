        "Jane, what did it feel like?",
        "Well, it felt like nothing I'd ever felt before 'cause I've actually never been in an earthquake before.",
        "So I was - I'm staying in a high-rise hotel on a high floor.",
        "And then all of a sudden, the closet started to shake.",
        "And it was nighttime.",
        "And so with my heart in my throat, I walked over and flung open the closet to see if there was something inside and that's when the floors and the walls started to shake.",
        "And it actually swayed.",
        "So if you live here or have spent a lot of time here, you know what it's like when buildings shake because of bombings.",

        "Why would there be so many casualties in Iran?",
        "Well, part of it is the way that the houses are built and part of it is the communities in Iran.",
        "So the center of this was near Halabja, which is close to the Iranian border.",
        "It's actually about 150 miles from here.",

        "That was what the majority of casualties were caused by.",
        "What are Iranian authorities doing so far as you've been able to learn?",
        "Right.",
        "They are scrambling to try to get help there, but it's difficult because it is a mountainous region.",
        "And the quake also triggered landslides, so it's not so easy to get there.",
        "They've mobilized the army and they're trying to get relief.",
        "And they say, 70,000 people are out there and it's the start of winter and they don't have shelter.",
        "So they're really scrambling to get aid to there."

        "And if you're a cynic, you might be asking: what's the use of predicting the hurricane season when last year's prediction was such a bust?",
        "Well, joining us now to give us his predictions for this season, tell us weather conditions are right for really severe storms and explain why hurricane prediction is not an exact science, is my guest, Gerry Bell, the lead seasonal hurricane forecaster for the NOAA Climate Prediction Center at the National Weather Service in Camp Springs, Maryland.",

        "May we know - you sat here about a year ago and you said almost the same thing.",
        "Yes, we did.",
        "There's a big difference this year.",
        "We - since this current active hurricane era began in 1995, there have only been three seasons that were not above normal; all were El Nino years.",
        "Last year, we had a rapidly developing El Nino during the summer months that was simply not predicted.",
        "And as a result, we fortunately got a reduction in the activity that we needed from these past several very heavy seasons.",
        "But this year, El Nino isn't in the cards at all.",
        "In fact, its counterpart, La Nina, is quite likely.",
        "And unfortunately, La Nina, in the presence of an active of hurricane era, is known to produce very high levels of hurricane activity.",
        "What does La Nina do to encourage or help hurricanes develop?",
        "La Nina acts to reduce the wind shear over the tropical Atlantic.",
        "The wind shear refers to how the winds change as you go up through the atmosphere.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It turns out hurricanes require that the wind shear be quite low, that the winds be relatively uniform as you go up through the atmosphere.",
        "La Nina produces that.",
        "Those - already the wind shear is going to lower because we're in this active hurricane era that's favoring reduced wind shear.",
        "So you've got a combination of climate factors that are acting together this year, whereas last year, like I said, unfortunately, the El Nino came up.",
        "El Nino increases the wind shear and it was able to at least bring the activity down into a near-normal range.",
        "But we don't expect that this year.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number if you want to talk about the hurricanes.",

        "You know, maybe they said last year, hey, you know, you guys predicted this; it didn't happen.",
        "That's always the real danger, isn't?",
        "That is.",
        "The seasonal hurricane forecasts are normally highly confident forecasts.",
        "Last year was the first - last August was the first time we ever over-predicted the activity.",
        "And one year is different than the next.",
        "As I said, last year, we failed to predict El Nino.",
        "This year, El Nino is not in the cards, so it's a completely different physical situation."

        "So there's no rational basis whatsoever for concluding that because the forecast was wrong last year, it will be wrong this year.",
        "Generally, what we found is since we begun these hurricane outlooks in 1998 that they're highly accurate and normally highly confident forecasts.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Give us some of the clues that make you think that it's going to be overly active this year.",
        "Well, there's three main factors.",
        "The first one is the wind and air pressure patterns that have been in place since 1995, and we know those support an active hurricane era.",
        "Even last year, although the activity was reduced, these same conditions were still in place.",
        "So last year was no indicator that this current active era has ended.",
        "In fact, this active era has not ended.",
        "These conditions - we've seen them before.",
        "We saw them in the 1950s and '60s when there was the previous active hurricane era.",
        "And we saw opposite conditions during the '70s, '80s and early '90s, which as you probably recall, was quite a below normal hurricane era.",
        "The second major factor is ongoing warmer Atlantic Ocean temperatures.",
        "They've been quite warm now since 2003.",
        "Ongoing warmer water is consistent with more activity.",
        "And the third one is the possibility of a La Nina episode.",
        "But even if La Nina doesn't develop, just the ongoing active era and the warmer water is sufficient to produce above normal season.",
        "It's a very confusing process now.",
        "There's new terminology, obviously, that leads people astray.",
        "You start hearing the word lumens instead of wattage.",

        "Now he's preparing to lay out how to pay for his agenda.",
        "The president will submit his budget request to Congress tomorrow, and with us to talk about it is NPR News analyst Juan Williams.",
        "Good morning, Juan.",
        "Good morning, Liane.",
        "What do you see as the contentious issues in the budget?",
        "In other words, which proposals do you think he'll get the most pushback on from either party?",
        "Well, the big argument is about the spending freeze.",
        "The spending freeze would affect about 17 percent of this budget.",
        "But, you know, 17 percent, that's about $450 billion out of a $3.5 trillion budget.",
        "And so the impact really falls on what the president calls discretionary spending.",
        "So that's everything that's not military, everything that's not Medicare or Medicaid -the entitlements."
