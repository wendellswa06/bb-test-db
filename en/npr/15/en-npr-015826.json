        "And there's lots of pushback, surprisingly, coming from the left that says in a time of economic difficulty the government needs to invest in spending and that President Obama is simply echoing a Republican point of view that would have it said that the problem is discretionary spending as opposed to some of these entitlements and military spending, which have been, of course, the primary source of budget increases over the years.",
        "Are both sides of the aisle on board with the president's proposed three-year federal spending freeze on these domestic programs?",
        "You know what?",
        "If you talk to the Republicans right now, they are debating whether or not they want to join in.",
        "Although a member, Senator John McCain, formerly President Obama's rival for the presidency, had proposed just this idea, and President Bush had enforced it during the last few years of his presidency.",
        "But Republicans right now are wondering if things such as - included in the budget - a small business tax cut really are effective at this point in terms of advancing hiring.",
        "And so they have to take a very careful position there, but it's fully articulated yet.",
        "President Obama's reportedly factoring in cap and trade revenue into his budget, but the members of the Senate say it's unlikely that a comprehensive cap and trade climate law will pass this year, so the president must be aware of this.",
        "So, what's his strategy?",
        "Put pressure on the Republicans.",
        "Put pressure on the Senate.",
        "Make it clear that part of restraining not only federal budget costs, but also in terms of business costs in the United States.",
        "That having an effective cap and trade program in place would help to limit spending in this country.",
        "And so that's part of a political argument that's going to be quite clear when you look at the budget, because the budget just doesn't add up if you take out that cap and trade proposal.",

        "How's that going to play out among members of his own party, and do you think the White House is pushing defense in hopes of getting something in exchange from the Republicans?",
        "Well, I think that's exactly right, Liane.",
        "I think that's the right analysis there.",
        "That, you see, not only it's interesting, it's not only nuclear weapons stockpiles, but even in the State of the Union talking about advancing nuclear energy production in this country.",
        "President Obama taxed right at times.",
        "And the hope there is that he will, one, impress the American people with his dedication to defense, that he's not weak on defense - the common complaint about left-leaning democratic senators and presidents, but that also that he will make it clear that what he intends to do here is to boost the notion of U.S.",

        "That's where I think I don't know that he made much in the way of inroads.",
