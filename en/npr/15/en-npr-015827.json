        "A third factor was that Atlantic Ocean temperatures were record warm.",
        "That was contributing to the strength.",
        "And the fourth one was the pressure patterns over the Western Atlantic in Southeastern U.S.",
        "We had a big, very persistent, high-pressure ridge in the upper atmosphere during much of the season.",
        "And that, of course, favors low wind shear - and just again very favorable.",
        "So it was really a combination of four main factors that contributed to that record season.",
        "Fortunately, we haven't seen that combination very often, but we did get it in 2005.",

        "I'm - live here in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and I was listening to a show with the new director of the National Weather Service and his comments on NOAA and how the satellite - it needs much repair - that does a lot of the forecasting.",
        "And NOAA is planning on spending - I think it was $100 million - on your centennial celebration, and he was asking if they could, you know, pick those funds and really do the much-needed repairs on the satellite.",
        "So do you use that as one of your important tools in forecasting?",
        "Well, I believe the number that NOAA was spending was $4 million, but again I'm - not $100 million, that's insane.",

        "Well, I'm not involved with that.",

        "That information is mainly used by the Hurricane Center, and I'm not really able to speak on what NOAA is doing or not doing.",
        "I know they're - in hearing some conversations that they're - they've been aware the satellite has been going to go for many years, and they've got plans that they developed over many, many years, but I don't know the details on that.",
        "I think he said it may even be on its last leg, if I'm understanding correctly.",
        "It's on backup power.",
        "It's apparently not on its last leg, but I'm not really able to speak on those issues.",

        "Good question.",

        "I don't think we can really say ahead of time whether there was going to be any changes in the weather patterns, if we have more hurricanes.",
        "So I wouldn't expect much in the way of, say, changes in the normal patterns of thunderstorm activity and so on.",

        "However, sometimes when the flow patterns do set up, you may have a large-scale jet-string pattern that not only, let's say, may produce certain type of conditions in the Midwest and downstream, it's also affecting the hurricane activity.",
        "That certainly - we see that type of thing, but there's too many different scenarios to really pinpoint anything at this time.",

        "The global warming impacts on Atlantic hurricanes' long-term transits are very important issue.",
        "Another very important issue is these long-term patterns that last for 25, 35, 40 years at a time and give us these active and inactive hurricane eras.",
        "We're developing a suite of climate models right now, not only within NOAA but the science community in general, to better handle these - all of these climate processes in hopes that I think one day we will be able to say, for instance, how much global warming is contributing in a given season versus these multi-decadal patterns, but I don't believe we're there yet.",
