        "It certainly has been my impression that a lot of airlines have been outsourcing maintenance to save costs over the last few years.",

        "Do they hold it to the lady who's got a child in hand back in seat 21-E or, as we found out with Southwest Airlines, is the allegiance of the inspectors more toward the airline itself?",
        "That's what got all out of skew, and what happened, Scott, is that FAA seems to have overreacted somewhat, especially in the case of American Airlines.",
        "I think a lot of people who fly frequently are left with the impression that the airlines must have no place to cut back now.",
        "I mean, you know, you get three midget pretzels and a pygmy soft drink on an eight-hour flight now.",
        "What's left to cut?",
        "Nothing.",
        "The airlines right now are in the process of trying to get people to pay not via credit card but by other payment methods so they can avoid the credit card fees.",
        "They've cut down on personnel and put in kiosks.",
        "They have cut down on food.",
        "Now they are beginning to charge, most of them, for a second bag.",
        "You're down to the bone.",
        "But what you can't afford to cut into is the margin of safety, and understand I've lost two relatives on commercial airline flights, so this is more than an academic observation on my part.",
        "I don't think they are cutting into the safety.",
        "Why do U.S.",
        "airlines operate some of the oldest jets?",
        "That's a very good question.",
        "You go overseas right now, and more of the orders for the new Boeing and Airbus aircraft, aside from some of the low-cost carriers like Virgin America over here and AirTran and Southwest, the major airlines in this country, for the most part, have not been ordering new aircraft."

        "It's a very complex equation - our demand for satisfaction and for preferences.",
        "And I think on one hand, you can make a light source be acceptable; in other words, you won't trip or fall, you can find your way in the dark.",
