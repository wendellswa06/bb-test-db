        "First, are incandescent bulbs banned, and what did the recently passed spending bill do to the light bulb conversion?",
        "Let's start at the beginning.",
        "Consumers can continue to buy incandescents.",
        "The only requirement is that all new bulbs need to use less energy.",
        "So they took the old incandescent, changed the guts of it; so there's a new filament and a halogen gas inside that makes incandescents use 28 percent less energy than they used to.",
        "As for the most recent bill, it took away funding for enforcement of conversion?",
        "Yes.",
        "The standards are still in place; merely, the Department of Energy isn't allowed to spend money to enforce the standards.",
        "The good news is all the big lighting companies - like G.E., Philips and Osram - have completely switched over and are making these energy-saving bulbs.",

        "Yeah.",
        "The great news is there's an energy-saving bulb for every socket.",
        "CFLs continue to be your lowest-cost energy-saving bulb.",
        "Some of the issues remaining with CFLs is they don't dim, and it takes a little while for the light to come on.",
        "LEDs have solved that problem, and they're the perfect bulb for most applications.",
        "The only concern is LEDs still cost a lot, but their price is coming down really fast.",
        "For outdoor lighting, which would you recommend?",
        "CFLs will not turn on if you live in a very cold climate and have the lamp outside.",
        "So the porch light in New Hampshire in the middle of winter won't turn on, or won't reach full brightness.",
        "So in that case, you definitely want the LED.",
        "You can also put an energy-saving incandescent there as well.",
        "That will work just fine.",
        "It will just use a lot more power.",
        "Here's a question we've heard from several people.",
        "I have some sockets on lamps where it says don't use anything more than a 60-watt bulb.",
        "But if I use an LED or a CFL, which uses far fewer watts than that, can I have one, say a 23-watt CFL that generates more light than I was getting from the 60-watt incandescent?",
        "Yes.",
        "Many fixtures have a power rating.",
        "It's a safety rating.",
        "Do not put more than a 60-watt or 100-watt bulb into this socket.",
        "As long as you stay below that, you're fine from a safety point of view.",
        "If you want to bump up to a brighter light bulb, you can pick, let's say, a 23-watt CLF and that will give off as much light as the old 100-watt bulb did.",
        "One of our Facebook visitors wrote this: I don't understand color temperature.",
        "Daylight, which was a description of a bulb, made walking down my hallway to the bathroom feel like walking into a jail.",
        "How do we determine, before buying, whether the light from the bulb is good - not too harsh, bright enough and sufficiently diffuse?",
        "This is a complicated one.",
        "Lamp companies market their bulbs as either warm, which means it has a yellowish-white light; and that's what people are used to.",
        "There are other bulbs that are marketed as cool or daylight, and those have a bluish-white look.",
        "Some people hate that, and some people love it; it's a very personal choice here.",
        "What we recommend is, people choose one of each and if in doubt, pick the one that's marketed as warm or soft white light.",
        "Noah Horowitz, thanks for talking with us about light bulbs.",
        "My pleasure.",
