        "When we talk about whether immigrants are taking these jobs, that's really premised on an idea that the pie stays the same size...",

        "They rent apartments, or they buy houses.",
        "They buy gasoline and food and participate in our economy in these other ways.",

        "Simpson trial was going to be televised, were you pleased, or were you concerned?",
        "Concerned - we couldn't oppose it.",
        "It's the judge's determination; it's his decision to make.",
        "And it's also the extension of the right to a public trial.",
        "Part of the right to a public trial is the right of the public to know what's going on in a courtroom, and to hold all of the parties accountable.",
        "Even though you could be - and I was - concerned about the impact right from the start, it seemed as though it was something that had a nobler purpose.",
        "What's the biggest difference - would you say - as you prepare your case, when you realize that a trial is going to be broadcast?",
        "It doesn't really change the way you prepare a case.",
        "What you worry about more is the impact on witnesses, and on jurors.",
        "The spotlight created by these kind of high-profile cases can induce certain people to come forward who are not really witnesses, but want the spotlight - what I call faux witnesses.",
        "On the other hand, it can also dissuade people who are legitimate witnesses, but don't want the spotlight.",
        "And it may cause them to minimize whatever they have to offer, in terms of evidence and testimony, because they want to back away from the case.",
        "Can't tell you how many people tried to do that with me in the Simpson case, and wanted no part of it.",
        "So you have to weed through those, and it becomes a very thorny problem."
