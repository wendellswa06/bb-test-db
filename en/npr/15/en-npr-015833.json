        "So when admissions officers are searching for black students to adhere to their commitments to affirmative action, they simply saw well-qualified black students.",

        "When you refer to immigrants in the black student population, maybe we ought to be specific, you mean a combination of African students or youngsters coming from Caribbean families?",
        "About 43 percent of the students that we interviewed in our study were from the Caribbean region, about 29 percent were from Africa - or their parents were - and about seven percent from Latin America.",
        "Did you find any significant differences when you looked at, let's say, the high school records of youngsters from immigrant families versus African- American students?"

        "But when it came time to pass legislation to implement that campaign promise, they found that doing it for all student loans would be too expensive.",
        "So they cut it back just to undergraduate students, and then just the subsidized Stafford loans.",
        "And then they did a phased-in interest rate reduction instead of an immediate reduction in order to reduce the costs.",

        "If the interest rate freeze expires and the interest rates do double, conceivably might it make students say, you know, given what I'm going to have to pay coming out, I'm going to have to find a school that just doesn't cost as much?",
        "Well, certainly, parents and students are getting more sensitized to the real costs, the bottom-line costs of college.",
        "We're finding that they are focusing more on two factors: What is the net price of this college?",
        "How much is the college really going to cost me, or how much debt am I going to have to take on to attend this college?",
        "And what is the return on that investment?",
