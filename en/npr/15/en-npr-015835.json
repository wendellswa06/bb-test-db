        "Yeah.",

        "I think David is absolutely right in terms of Romney's lack of authenticity.",
        "And that hurts them both among conservatives in the Republican Party, but also among people elsewhere.",
        "I think Rick Santorum is running a campaign that is somewhat more positive.",
        "He shows some vision - I don't agree with most of it.",
        "Whereas, I think Romney's problem is his campaign has been almost entirely negative; negative primarily against President Obama, negative against Newt Gingrich, soon to be negative against Rick Santorum.",
        "He's got to give people a sense, if I may quote Richard Nixon, of the lift of a driving dream.",
        "There's none of that in the Romney campaign right now.",
        "Yeah, I'd say this is about his personality.",
        "I think he really should take the risk, talk about his Mormon past.",
        "It's a sort of an inspiring story.",
        "He should talk about his faith, the things he believes in previous to being a takeover artist.",
        "You think that's part of what the problem is?",
        "That he's not talking about what really is at his core.",
        "Perhaps that's a political calculation.",
        "Right, and nobody knows where he comes from geographically, religiously.",
        "And so he sort of emerges out of the Harvard Business School and that's just a problem for people.",

        "So you see these worldwide magnified swings up and down, and that's what everyone is coping with now.",
        "And I guess it used to be that you sort of counted on world markets to buffer some of these large gyrations, and now it seems to actually encourage them.",
        "Talk about that difference, if you can.",
        "Yes.",
        "I think that during most of modern times, as the last generation or two, the world economies have, of course, been connected.",

        "No easy task.",

        "I've thought a lot about the presidential debate in the 1992 campaign, which was in a town hall forum where the first George Bush and Bill Clinton and then Ross Perot were taking questions from average people in the audience.",
        "And there was a woman who asked then current incumbent President Bush how the deficit was affecting him.",
        "And the president gave this sort of technical answer about how actually the federal budget deficit didn't make that much difference at all.",
        "And then Bill Clinton stepped in to answer the question the woman was really asking with the wrong words, which was how was the economy affecting him and affecting her and affecting the whole world.",

        "What so different about this one to make it so important?",
        "Well, there's two things.",
        "First, McKinsey is a very well-respected firm in the health policy community.",
        "And second, the finding that almost a third of employers said they would, quote, \"\"definitely or probably stop offering health insurance in the years after 2014,\"\" was really quite eye-popping.",
        "And it was one that obviously was going to be repeated a lot by opponents of the law.",
        "And this finding is actually quite different from that of lots of other studies that have posed the same question?",
        "Absolutely and by a lot.",
        "The Congressional Budget Office, the Rand Corporation, the Urban Institute, several other groups have all looked at the question of how many employers are likely to drop coverage under the law.",
        "And remember, most employers will have to pay a penalty if they do that.",
        "And all of those studies have found a likely change will be much smaller.",
        "But you don't have to just look at studies to wonder about this.",
        "There's at least one real world example and that's up in Massachusetts, where they've required individuals to have health insurance for four years now.",
        "And in Massachusetts, access to employer health insurance has actually increased.",
        "It's gotten easier.",
        "On the other hand, one could say the economy is a moving target; this is a study that's come out with a different finding but not necessarily an incorrect finding.",
        "What is it about this study that raises eyebrows?",
        "Well, what really got people suspicious was that McKinsey has been refusing to release its methodology - how it did the study.",
        "They said they interviewed 1,300 employers for this study.",
        "But no one knew whether they were large employers or small employers, which makes a very large difference.",
        "We didn't know if they talked to human resources directors or to owners of companies.",
        "So they might not have even surveyed the people who can make the decisions about whether companies will continue to offer health insurance.",
        "And I spoke to several independent pollsters, including people at the American Association for Public Opinion Research.",
        "They said while they're not the polling police, if someone does a survey and refuses to release its methodology - that raises a big red flag.",
        "And then the politicians got into it."
