        "California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't on the ballot next Tuesday, but his political future may be.",
        "Schwarzenegger called a special election to pass what he calls his reform agenda, but the governor's sagging popularity could be dragging those measures down, as NPR's Ina Jaffe reports.",
        "The way Arnold Schwarzenegger sees it this special election is just an extension of the recall that put him in the governor's office two years ago.",
        "That's the pitch he made to the crowd at a shopping mall in the Southern California neighborhood known as Little Saigon.",
        "(Soundbite of mall speech)",
        "You recall the governor but not the broken system, and this is why we need this special election because in this special election you have a chance to go out and vote and to recall the broken system once and for all...",

        "These initiatives don't deal with what you'd call hot-button issues.",
        "Prop 74, for example, would make school teachers wait longer to get tenure.",
        "Prop 75 would force public employee unions to get written permission before spending members' dues on politics.",
        "The other measures limit state spending, give the governor more power to make budget cuts and transfer the job of drawing legislative districts from state lawmakers to a panel of retired judges.",

        "The latest polls show that he's dragging down his own initiatives.",
        "Three of the four look like losers, the one on teacher tenure is still close, and most voters say they don't like the whole idea of the special election in the first place.",
        "The governor's still campaigning hard, however, and Republican political analyst Dan Schnur thinks there is still some hope.",
        "That's in the West Bank, but what if what if they want to live in Israel proper?",
        "The best thing that the governor can do at this point is probably to engage in some political triage.",
        "Trying to explain four different ballot measures is nigh on impossible.",
        "If he were to decide that he was going to focus all of his time and energy into passing just a couple of them, I think, after election day Schwarzenegger could legitimately point to those as the first steps toward the type of reform he wanted.",

        "If the governor loses all of these, it's pretty humiliating and certainly will confirm to the groups who've taken him on and to the Democrats that they really don't have to pay a lot of attention to him.",
