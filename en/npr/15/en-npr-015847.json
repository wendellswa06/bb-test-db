        "Yes.",
        "It came from an old friend, Mark Penchko(ph) of Warsaw, Poland, and he gave it to me at last year's World Puzzle Championship.",

        "That's because the first two letters of zero are Z-E.",
        "The first two letters of nine are N-I and the first two letters of thirty are T-H, just as finite was, you know, five, nine and 10.",
        "And there's a third word that's been brought to my attention.",
        "On site can be one, six, one, zero--the O-N of one, the S-I of six and the T-E of 10.",
        "It works the same way.",
        "So three words.",
        "Well, we had over 2,200 entries--that's a lot--from people who solved the puzzle, and our randomly selected winner from the correct answers is Rick Brenner from Boston, Massachusetts.",
