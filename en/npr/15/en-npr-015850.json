        "...15 pounds about, so it's small.",
        "So a much better drug comes along that's much more effective and typically the principle is, if you're much better then you can at least go in at a 10 percent or 15 percent price premium.",
        "Sovaldi was a much better drug, and it turns out it wasn't much more expensive than the treatments it replaced.",
        "So according to the Senate report, insurers and doctors told the pharmaceutical company Gilead that $84,000 - or about a $1,000 a pill - was reasonable, but that didn't last long.",
        "That's because the hepatitis drug is only needed for 12 to 24 weeks, a relatively quick course that's good for patients and can produce big, short-term profits for drug companies.",
        "But insurers don't like spending so much money so fast and they're trying to restrict access.",
        "That is the paradox that something that is such a big breakthrough which is it cures you relatively instantly as these things go.",
        "The benefit accrues so quickly and the insurance company cannot afford to perhaps accrue the payment that quickly.",
        "Khedkar says insurers aren't interested in the total cost of a treatment.",
        "They're more interested in the monthly payment.",
        "The way the insurance company looks at it is a metric called per member, per month.",
        "That means in an insurer's eyes, expensive treatments are better if they take longer, and that's not always good for patients.",
        "So Sovaldi's price tag was logical in relation to its predecessors, but the debate focused instead on the big number.",
        "Lakdawalla, of USC.",
        "Very few people have argued that the drug doesn't produce a lot of value.",
        "The optics of pricing became part of the problem because it lent itself the rhetoric, like, this is a thousand dollars a pill and so on and so forth.",
        "Which he says is unfortunate because a quick cure is clearly better for patients.",
        "Hypothetically, he says...",
        "I think it would've been even better if they had sold one pill for $85,000.",
        "Imagine if you just took one pill and you're done.",
        "Yet think of the headlines if they had done that."

        "People have very strong opinions and have their theoretical reasons why one diet might work better than another diet.",
        "And we wanted to test those theories in a very strictly-controlled fashion.",
        "So Hall and his colleagues sequestered 19 obese individuals at the NAH over two-week spans to control what they ate and to measure their body chemistry precisely.",
        "The researchers wanted to test the very popular belief that the only sure way to lose weight is to cut out the carbs to make your insulin levels drop.",
        "And true, cutting carbs did work.",
        "We cut the carbohydrates.",
        "Insulin went down.",
        "Fat burning went up just exactly as that theory predicts, and people lost fat.",
        "But then the same volunteers were also subjected to a much different diet.",
        "Here, they left carbs alone and cut out fat instead.",
        "Insulin levels weren't affected by this diet.",
        "But it was, in fact, every bit as effective as the low-carb diet.",
        "Hall says so much for the idea that only low-carb diets can help people shed fat.",
        "That theory, as it stands, that very strong claim, is certainly not true.",
        "Instead, the best evidence favors those who say if you want to shed body fat, it's the total calories that matter most."
