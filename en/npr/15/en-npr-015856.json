        "Correct, and again, it has been approved target for broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy, but in particular, it is a uniquely important critical target for anti-tuberculosis therapy.",
        "The reason for that is that in a patient with active tuberculosis infection, there are both rapidly growing tuberculosis bacteria and slow-growing tuberculosis bacteria.",
        "The slow-growing bacteria are called persistors.",
        "In order to clear the infection and cure the patient, one needs to kill both types of tuberculosis bacteria, the rapidly growing ones and the persistors.",
        "In the persistors, there are very few biochemical activities occurring in the persistor cells.",
        "And as a result, there are very few points of vulnerability.",
        "There are very few ways that the drug can interfere with the survival of a persistor.",
        "There is one clearly known proved target to kill a persistor, and that target is the machine that we've been studying, bacterial RNA polymerase.",
        "The persistors need RNA polymerase to survive.",

        "The Saudis weren't unhappy that the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, made what is a famous speech to Congress - he essentially made their case.",
