        "JOHN ROBERTS: And that's always when you have not enough chairs and too many people.",
        "And that's really what our problem is, and we have to decide who's in the highest priority to get a chair.",
        "Many factors go into deciding who gets a chair.",
        "Art Caplan is a bioethicist at the New York University Langone Medical Center.",
        "He says as doctors work on making the best possible match, they look at a person's biology, blood type, age, immune system.",
        "Then we look at who's sickest, who needs the organ the most.",
        "Among that group, the system then starts to say, who's going to do best?",
        "Who will survive with the greatest chance of living and living long?",
        "And then beyond that, you're starting to look at things like geography.",
        "If you could use an organ locally, you're probably not going to ship it hundreds of miles away somewhere else.",
        "And talk to us about the under-12 rule, which is what is coming into play here with the case of Sarah Murnaghan.",
        "The under-12 rule was built over time because adult organs don't fit well into children.",
        "You're usually having to either use a piece of a lung to do it or you're kind of cramming the thing into a smaller space.",
        "And so it isn't that surgeons and transplant people said we just don't care about children and we'll put them at the end of the list.",
        "It was built on the idea that their outcomes weren't as good with adult donor lungs.",
        "They did better in adult recipients.",
        "A federal judge has now intervened in this case.",
        "Can you remember a case where this has happened before?",
        "I cannot.",
        "I have no recollection.",
        "I've been looking at transplant ethics issues for nearly 30 years where an outside party said, we don't like the rules that we have seen created for the distribution of organs.",
        "We're going to jump in and overrule what's been in place.",
        "Why do you think the judge chose to intercede?",
        "There's politics.",
        "Certainly, people are pressing to say this little girl has a right to live and please, judge, help her.",
        "At the same time when the judge does it, it's serious business because we've had a system for many, many decades that has, without much controversy, tried to allocate fairly the scarce supply of organs.",
        "And this is now a situation where the judge has said, I don't trust those rules.",
        "It could open the door to other people saying, I want my situation addressed, too, because, I think, I'm being discriminated against or I don't agree with how the rules are treating me in terms of giving me priority."

        "But the way things are now, adding someone to the list, pushing Sarah into the pool pushes someone else off.",
        "Do we have the best possible system at this point for transplants?",
        "It generally does a good job in trying to let medical factors and objective factors drive the distribution of organs.",
        "What isn't a good situation is admission to the transplant centers.",
        "One of the first tests that everybody does is a very thorough wallet biopsy.",
        "They're going to see if I can pay, so the ability to pay counts.",
        "I was surprised to hear that.",
        "So I asked bioethicist Art Caplan just how important being able to pay really is.",
        "It's a major driver in access to transplants.",
        "I disagree with that completely.",
        "I think there are people that have harder time getting referred for a transplant, but I don't think that it's necessarily an insurance wallet biopsy approach.",
        "Once again, that's Dr. John Roberts, president of the OPTN.",
        "He says Medicaid will cover transplantation for low-income patients.",
        "But - and here's a big catch - not in every state.",
        "So location can determine how big an individual's bill will be.",
        "And transplants easily run hundreds of thousands of dollars, some even hitting seven figures.",
        "And Dr. Roberts says it's the post-surgery costs that can create the biggest financial hurdle for patients.",
        "One of the things that we need to do is try to figure out, all right, how can we get long-term immunosuppressive medication for the patients that need it?",
        "Currently, you know, for kidney transplantation, Medicare limits the length of time that Medicare will pay for their drugs to three years."
