        "And, make no mistake, when I told Senator Mitchell that I injected Roger Clemens with performance-enhancing drugs, I told the truth.",
        "I told the truth about steroids and human growth hormone.",
        "I injected those drugs into the body of Roger Clemens at his direction.",
        "Unfortunately, Roger has denied this and has led a full court attack on my credibility.",
        "And let me be clear, despite Roger Clemens' statements to the contrary, I never injected Roger Clemens or anyone else with lidocaine or B-12.",
        "I have no reason to lie and every reason not to.",

        "They gave out statements as they were read by - they do not appear to testify today.",
        "But as their statements were rather - this was very damaging against Roger Clemens.",
        "Well, yeah, and certainly the one by Andy Pettitte.",
        "You know, Representative Elijah Cummings said, you know, he's as confused as everyone.",
        "And he says we got these two guys on both sides.",
        "I'm looking for something in the middle that will give me a sense of who's telling the truth here.",
        "And what he focused on and several other lawmakers focused on was an affidavit signed by Andy Pettitte instead of testifying today, and also Andy Pettitte's sworn deposition.",
        "And here's what they said.",
        "First of all, they said Andy Pettitte is a longtime friend of Clemens.",
        "He's a God-fearing man.",
        "He has unimpeachable character.",
        "And, you know, they asked Roger Clemens, do you think Andy Pettitte would lie.",
        "And Clemens said, no. No, he's an honorable guy.",
        "So, then what Cummings did was he pointed out that Pettitte said in his deposition that in 1999 - either 1999 or 2000, he had a conversation with Roger Clemens in which Clemens admitted using human growth hormone, banned human growth hormone.",
        "And then, he said they had another conversation in 2005 in which Pettitte came to Clemens and asked him what will you say in public if someone asked you about this.",
        "And Clemens said to Pettitte, according to Pettitte, that he would not - he would tell the truth, because he's never used it.",
        "And Andy Pettitte said, hey, Roger, you told me that back in 1999 or 2000 that you did use it.",
        "And Roger said, no, I didn't.",
        "And Andy Pettitte said, oh.",
        "And so, when asked about that, Roger Clemens answers weren't too convincing.",
        "He said Andy Pettitte misremembered, he misspoke, he misheard.",
        "And that seemed, at least to Elijah Cummings, several other lawmakers, certainly to skeptical journalists that didn't seem to be too strong a statement.",
        "On the same, on the other hand, Republican Congressman Dan Burton of Indiana pointed out that there had been several inconsistencies by the other witness, Brian McNamee.",
        "Again, I'm going to make sure I got this straight.",
        "Your friend, Roger Clemens, you allegedly gave him these shots.",
        "You kept the pads and the needles for five years and went on and kept working for him because he was your employer, and then you said you felt bad about proposing and giving these to the Mitchell committee when you first started talking to them?",
        "Yes, sir."
