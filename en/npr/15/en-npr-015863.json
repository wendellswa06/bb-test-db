        "Why is Congress focusing on baseball as opposed to any one of the number of things that they could help solve for our country or the world?",

        "And probably, that was part of it.",
        "You know, one congressman did point out, and he anticipated that question and that complaint.",
        "And he said, look, you know, for the other - you know, we did this for five hours a day.",
        "The rest of the time, we are dealing with those kinds of issues that Nicole was talking about and probably are more important.",
        "I've had this discussion in my own head: Why is this important other than it's my job to cover it?",

        "If you're an athlete, you could argue that those are important issues to bring up.",
        "And, you know, Congress, last time they brought this up with baseball, it forced baseball to get tougher with its performance-enhancing drug testing and program.",
        "They were dragged, kicking and screaming into it.",
        "Who knows what this may do.",
        "It will forward the dialogue, I think, that I do think this country needs to have on performance-enhancing drugs, whether it's in sports or in society, because it's rampant in society.",
        "Nicole, thanks very much for the call.",
        "And Tom Goldman, I guess we should also point out that the Barry Bonds trial for perjury, alleged perjury, that's still pending.",
        "And at the same time, you've got - this story is not going away.",
        "And in another part of Capitol Hill, you had Senator Arlen Specter, talking with the football league commissioner about Spygate, and what the coach or the Patriots may have done or not done.",
        "So Congress and politics and sports and courtrooms, pitchers and catchers report later this week, Tom.",

        "Like the members of the caucus, Blanco is a Democrat, and generally has had a good relationship with African-American legislators.",

        "The lawsuit challenges Blanco's right to enact spending cuts without legislative approval.",
        "A state judge will consider the case next week, but in the meantime, it's complicated the governor's already difficult task of forging a budget compromise.",
        "Blanco's idea has already had tepid support from Republicans, who complained she wasn't cutting spending enough.",
        "Now Blanco also has to respond to charges from her own party that she's cut too much.",

        "This is a real big, ambitious plan, and it won't be done in this 17-day session.",
        "McGinnis says legislators may approve the less controversial parts of the governor's plan before Thanksgiving, but with much of her agenda now mired in political squabbles and lawsuits, there's a growing sense here that Louisiana's budget crisis may linger until the next special session in January.",

        "Well, the White Sox's opponents in this year's fall classic are the Houston Astros, who had never even made it to the Series before now.",
