        "Iranian-American writer Hooman Majd, says this is one of the time when Iranians are allowed to make their concerns visible.",
        "This is a period when people can express themselves better than they've ever expressed themselves in public.",
        "Of course, there's a couple of red lines, still, people would get into trouble if they criticize the supreme leader or if they criticized Islam itself, but beyond that it's open season on the government.",
        "So there is still no criticism of the supreme leader, the Ayatollah above Iran's president in authority.",
        "Hooman Majd traveled twice to Iran as the campaign season approach and also followed last week's debate.",
        "Well, actually I mean, if you read the transcripts and some other things that were quoted in the American media, the debates seemed pretty intense, and they were intense.",
        "However, there is also level of politeness.",
        "At parts they were kind of boring, just talk about things that are, I mean, kind of ambiguous plans and then policies.",
        "But the actual parts - particularly between Ahmadinejad and Mir-Hossein Mousavi, his main opponent on the reform side - the parts where they attacked each other were really kind of exhilarating and exciting and never before seen in Iran.",
        "And I think people were just riveted by the fact that here are two politicians just going at each other, you know, talking about the failures of the government and what's wrong with Iran.",
        "What specifically did they differ on in this debate?",
        "Well, Ahmadinejad took the opportunity, and I think that he's feeling a little vulnerable right now, polls are showing that he's slipping in popularity.",
        "He started a personal attack on Moussavi and Moussavi's wife, kind of an unprecedented attacked on his wife.",
        "He accused her - she's a chancellor of a university, she had a couple of PhDs, she's a well-known professor - he accused her of having gotten into PhD programs without having sat entrance exams, basically corruption in terms of how she got her degrees.",
        "Did Moussavi answer the charge against his wife?",
        "He didn't specifically answer the charges about his wife, but he got very angry, and - visibly angry and began a blistering attack on Ahmadinejad's policies including calling him a dictator.",
        "Actually he didn't say you are a dictator, you said, you're not a dictator, but your policies are dictatorial and we're going in that direction.",
        "Granting that there is a lot of heat, a lot of passion between the two main candidates, president Ahmadinejad and his main challenger Moussavi, is there a significant difference in where they would take Iran?",
        "Number two, the Curse of the Republicans.",
        "During the 1992 Republican National Convention, the Astros got the shaft.",
        "Ordered to vacate the Astrodome for four weeks so it could be made over for the GOP, the Astros embarked on an eight-city, 26-game, 28-day road trip.",
        "The Astros played respectably, but when they got back, the already-cursed Astrodome had been tainted by an even thicker stench of loserdom.",

        "In 1963, back when the Astros were still called the Colt .45s, third baseman Bob Aspromonte befriended a Little Leaguer who had been blinded when struck by lightning.",
        "The Astros-loving kid asked Aspromonte to hit him a home run three separate times.",

        "She said, `Abramoff's activities went,' quote, `\"\"far beyond legal lobbying to the illegal act of paying for official acts.\"\"' Did she spell out what those paid official acts were?",
        "Well, she spelled out what some of them were, as well as were spelled out in the plea agreement that Abramoff reached this morning.",
        "It apparently is just a small amount of what actually occurred because they had to have something to hold off on, or else he had no incentive to come and make this plea agreement.",
        "And even so, he's looking at nine and a half to 11 years and restitution of some $25 million.",
        "But there's a whole variety, from the well-known golfing trip in Scotland to payments--kickbacks essentially--from charities operated by Abramoff and his associates, where clients paid those charities not realizing that they were tied to Abramoff.",
        "And while we're focused on congressional corruption here in Washington, DC, there's another case in Florida where, again, Abramoff and his associates are involved.",
        "And he pleaded guilty to charges in that as well.",
        "Well, yes.",
        "It's not exactly clear how that will be resolved; we're going to hear that in the coming days.",
        "But one of the things that apparently brought Abramoff to the table was that if he is given a sentence of time in the Florida case, that will be counted against his--whatever sentence he ultimately gets in this case.",
        "This is the case that everybody here in town is really watching because it--this is the one that goes towards members of Congress.",
        "Some people think as many as a dozen members of Congress are the targets of this investigation.",
        "The Justice Department won't say, but a lot of members of Congress have reason to be worried, now that Abramoff has agreed to cooperate."
