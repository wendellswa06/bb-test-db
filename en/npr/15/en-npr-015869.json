        "Well, he has been talking a lot about minorities, as you just heard.",
        "But in the past, when Republican candidates looked like they were reaching out to minorities or made a visit to an inner-city community, it was usually because they weren't actually targeting minority voters, but they were trying to make themselves more appealing to moderate suburban voters, particularly women who can be turned off by divisiveness and xenophobia.",
        "And if that's the case with this new move by Trump, then he is doing something very unusual for him in that he's acting like a typical Republican presidential candidate."

        "And one long-standing theory about presidential races is that by this time, the dynamics of a campaign are pretty well set.",
        "It's hard to change, barring some blowup in a debate or a big October surprise.",
        "Usually at this point the candidates' messages are set.",
        "People have formed impressions.",
        "And usually the campaigns at this point are focusing on the ground game, getting up the vote, really granular efforts to target and reach individual voters.",
        "So this flies in the face of all of that.",
        "Now, one thing that could conceivably change the dynamics of the race are the continuing problems plaguing Hillary Clinton involving emails.",
        "And this week we've heard about the Clinton Foundation and how much access donors had to Clinton when she was secretary of state.",

        "And the issue - it seems very familiar when it comes to the Clintons - lots of smoke but no fire.",
        "In other words, there was a lot of overlap between the foundation and people Hillary Clinton interacted with at the State Department.",
        "Certainly, the foundation created a lot of potential conflicts of interest even if there wasn't a quid pro quo, which hasn't been proven yet - no actual favors done even though things look bad.",
        "And the question now is, is there someone she met with that any other secretary of state wouldn't have or a favor she did that was contrary to U.S.",
        "foreign policy?",
        "Appearances do matter, but we don't have any hard evidence of corruption.",
        "Now, that being said, she has made things worse by saying things that have proven not to be true about her emails, like she turned them all over - not true - or that FBI Director Comey said she was truthful in everything she said turned out not to be true or that Colin Powell blessed her private server arrangement.",
        "But all of this is why she is distrusted by so many voters.",
