        "Now, while alternative transportation options like biking or using the metro rail are available here, in other parts of the country, these aren't always realistic options.",
        "So Ray LaHood, the Transportation secretary, wants to change that.",
        "He became a hero to bike enthusiasts last month, when he posted a notice on his blog saying that cycling and even walking should no longer be afterthoughts when it comes to federal transportation planning.",
        "We're elevating it to the point that as we develop new road systems, as we develop communities where people can use light rail or street cars or buses, bike trails and walking paths will be equal partners, if you will, and equal components of those kinds of transportation opportunities in communities around America.",
        "And now Secretary LaHood, according to a recent story in USA Today, something like 90 percent, 91 percent of Americans, drive to work.",
        "Many Americans either don't live close enough to public transportation, or they can't cycle to work because it's simply too far for them to do that.",
        "What options would they have?",
        "Well, I mean, we've put almost all of our resources into our roads, and the reason that 90 percent of the people ride to work or drive a car to work is because that's where all of our resources we have a state-of-the-art interstate system in America that connects America.",
        "If the commitment - when President Eisenhower signed the interstate bill - had been to high speed inner-city rail, think of where we would - we'd be in the same position Europe and Asia are in today.",
        "Our commitment has been to roads, and part of our commitment now at DOT is to create opportunities for alternatives to congestion, to automobiles, knowing full well that it takes time to change habits.",
        "And we know that 90 percent of the people aren't going to be cycling to work.",
        "But that opportunity and that option and that kind of alternative is something that we think people want.",
        "What about funding?",
        "I mean, will you essentially say to states, look, we will increase your funding for certain projects if you include plans for things like bike paths?",
        "We will, as a part of our livable and sustainable community program, which will be a part of the new transportation bill that we'll be working with Congress on this year, one of its components will be walking and biking paths and the resources to fund those kinds of opportunities in communities.",
        "Tell me about this idea that I've been hearing of a national bicycle route system similar to the national highway system."

        "Do you think that there's been an overreaction, or do you think that, you know, they have a point there?",
        "Well, look it, the trucking companies pay a lot of taxes to use the roadways, but there's plenty of room along the roadways for all forms of transportation, whether it's cars or trucks or cyclists or walking, and using the bully pulpit that I have as the secretary of Transportation to promote these has gotten a lot of attention.",
