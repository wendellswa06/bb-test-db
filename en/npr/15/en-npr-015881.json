        "That's called retro-nasal olfaction or what I refer to as mouth-smelling.",

        "It's true.",
        "You know, we've all done this when we were kids in school, but unless you really do it as an adult and think about it and watch it, it's a whole different reaction.",
        "You really do notice the difference.",
        "It's - I also, I've also noticed that your sight, you know, what you expect food - years ago, I used to do this show called \"\"Newton's Apple\"\" on PBS, and one of the things that they - they handed me once an ice cream cone with vanilla ice cream in it.",
        "And they said have a taste.",
        "And I tasted it, and I could not figure out what was on the cone.",
        "And it turned out it was a scoop of mashed potatoes.",
        "Oh, wow.",
        "That's a good one.",
        "But because I was told that that was vanilla ice cream, my mind had a crash with my senses, and I couldn't even figure out what it was until they said it's mashed potatoes.",
        "And I - oh, now I taste it, you know?",
        "It was really weird.",
        "Yes, and that's a great illustration of how important the sense of sight is.",
        "You know, we talk about eating with our eyes, but it really is true.",
        "Our sense of sight is the dominant sense when it comes to experiencing food.",
        "And that doesn't mean that it's most important.",
        "It just means that it's most influential.",
        "So if I wanted to, I could serve you a glass of wine that had some - white wine that had some red color in it, or a glass of orange juice that had color in it that turned it pink, or any type of food that I had manipulated the color of.",
        "And what you do is you're going to default to your sense of sight because it happens first.",
        "You see the food before you can even smell it, and certainly before you can taste it.",
        "You're going to default to that sense of taste - sorry, sense of sight, and then if what you're tasting doesn't match up with what you're seeing, you'll have a little bit of a difficult time making sense of that.",
        "So our reactions are much slower when what we're seeing doesn't match up with what we're tasting.",
        "And in fact, just like you experienced with the mashed potatoes on the ice cream cone, our sense of sight can completely confound what we think we're tasting or smelling."

        "Absolutely.",
        "Presentation is very important.",
        "And you bring up an interesting point about eating at 30,000 feet.",

        "...food just doesn't seem to taste right on an airplane.",
        "Right.",
        "And there's a lot of reasons why.",
        "And in the book, I go into some of the science behind why food tastes terrible on an airplane.",
        "And some of it is interestingly related to our sense of sound, our sense of hearing.",
        "And if you think about being on a plane, there's this very low-level, but very intense, constant noise in the background from the engine of the plane.",
        "And what scientists have discovered is that that low-level noise in the background has a somewhat masking effect on taste.",
        "So whatever you're tasting on the airplane needs to be a little bit saltier or a little bit sweeter, or you're going to experience it as less salty or less sweet simply because that sound is masking the taste.",
        "As a food inventor, which you are, do you think that they make the food, then, be more spicy or salty to overcome that hum?",
        "Well, yes.",
        "And the good airlines are doing that.",
        "In fact, Lufthansa tests their food - the menu as they're developing it - in an airplane fuselage, and they simulate both the atmosphere on the plane, as well as the sounds that you hear, as well as, you know, all of the other compromising elements, sensory elements of being on a plane.",
        "Talking with Barb Stuckey, author of \"\"Taste What You're Missing: The Passionate Eater's Guide to Why Good Food Tastes Good.\"\" In your book, you say that it's important for you to find a mate that shared or shares your passion for food, but it didn't quite turn out that way for you, did it?"

        "It turns out, they're also more sensitive to the heat that comes from jalapeno chilies, for example.",
        "And so...",

        "Yeah.",

        "The blue dye helps them show up better.",
        "You're going to be looking for the little bumps on your tongue.",
        "And if you take something that's the size of a notebook paper hole or a reinforcement hole and stick it on your tongue, you can actually count the number of taste buds that you have inside that hole.",
        "And that will give you a sense of where you fall on the tasting spectrum.",
        "And generally, we find that there's about a quarter of people who fall in that hyper-taster range, about a quarter of people who fall at the lower end, where things are less intense to them.",
        "And then the vast majority of people fall somewhere in the middle.",
        "Wow.",
        "A little home do-it-yourself kit to - and you're saying that your fiance, because he has a super - his super-tasting ability, even though he's eating just meat and potatoes, he's getting taste out of them that you might not have because you don't have his talent.",
        "Yes.",
        "And - his talent, exactly.",
        "He is probably not getting tastes that I don't, because, remember, there's only five basic tastes.",
        "But he is experiencing the intensity of them differently.",
        "And so, you know, that's really what I hope people get from the book.",
        "And this understanding is what I call taste empathy, so that you have a little bit more empathy for the people in your life - loved ones, for example - who are very picky eaters or people who can't tolerate certain foods, certain bitter foods or vegetables, for example.",
        "They're not trying to make your life more difficult.",
        "They're just reacting to their biology.",

        "Good advice from Barb Stuckey, author of \"\"Taste What You're Missing: The Passionate Eater's Guide to Why Good Food Tastes Good.\"\" Some experiments, some home - do-it-yourself thing you can do at home this evening right before dinner or when you're going out to a restaurant.",
