        "People who test positive for the gene mutation that indicates Huntington's disease, for example, get an all-but-certain look ahead at how their lives will end and maybe even roughly when they will end.",
        "We're in the early days here.",
        "The relatively small number of Americans who have been tested for genetic diseases have learned that knowing is not easy, knowing whom to tell, whom to keep in the dark, what to do with your money, with your time, your relationships, with your body, an enormously complex set of decisions that people who get tested do not necessarily anticipate.",
        "So how complicated does it really get when you've got that simple test result in your hand?",

        "I've been through the book, and it's a fascinating thing you do.",
        "You essentially talked to 65 people who have been candidates for genetic testing.",
        "They had reasons to believe that maybe there was something in them that a genetic test would reveal.",
        "Generally speaking, they were concerned about bad news.",
        "Some of them went ahead and tested.",
        "Some of them didn't.",
        "Some of them were positive.",
        "Some of them were negative.",
        "And you journey with them through the forest of decisions that they end up having to make.",
        "And what's fascinating is that they're decisions that most of us don't even think about when we think oh, I'll go get a test for that gene.",
        "So I want to talk with you about those journeys and what's learned.",
        "And I want to hear from our listeners who have embarked upon that journey and what decision-making process was revealed to you that you think the rest of us don't understand is at stake here."

        "You know, the media is full in the last 10 years of stories about discoveries of, you know, single-action genes that sound like single-action genes, a gene for - a gene for aggression and a gene for jolliness and a gene to make you gay and a gene to give you autism and a gene for this and a gene for that.",
        "How far ahead of reality are those reports?",
        "How many real diseases can - are specific to one gene mutation?",
        "Well, at this point we know that there are about 5,000 diseases that we have very good genetic data for, that is to say where we've been able to find a genetic marker that indicates a very clear predisposition for the disease.",
        "Sometimes, in the case of Huntington's, as you mention, if you have the mutation, you will die of that disease if you don't die of something else.",
        "On the other hand, something like breast cancer, if you have the mutation for that, it means you have about a 50 percent chance of getting breast cancer, which is a much increased risk.",
        "There are other conditions, though, and there are also behaviors where we really don't yet know the full genetics, so things like intelligence, things like athleticism, blonde hair, blue eyes, there are undoubtedly many, many genes that are involved in those kinds of traits or behaviors, and we're beginning to identify some of them but not to the level where we can make strong predictions.",
        "What you then explore in the book is what an enormous lifting of the carpet into something - into a work that maybe people hadn't anticipated when they went to get the test.",
