        "We've seen the hybrids take off, but what about electric cars?",
        "As you look forward to 2014, do you think that electric cars are really going to start taking off?",
        "I'd like to say yes, but it, you know, continues to be a slow climb, and you know, and carmakers will tell you, this is kind of what they expected, incremental, you know, it's very much linked to the cost of gasoline and gasoline's been relatively affordable lately.",
        "But it's not for want of product because, for example, BMW just rolled out a beautiful urban EV called the I-3 and it's a radically different kind of car, and I think in many ways this will be the way cars will be built a decade from now.",
        "And looking at a picture of it, it looks maybe more cute than flashy, this electric BMW.",
        "Price tag on this one, Dan?",
        "And let's start with a very obvious one, which sounds obvious and then turns out not to be, and let's put it in terms of Huntington's, which as you just said would indicate it's going to tell you, number one, that you're going to die of this disease unless something kills you first, and you're not going to - it's going to be a difficult death.",
        "Your personality is going to change, and it's probably going to happen at roughly the same age that it happened to an ancestor or to your parent.",
        "And the other thing is that there's a 50-50 chance that you're going to pass it on to your children.",
        "So you test for this gene, and you come out positive.",
        "What do you then have to consider?",
        "Well, there's a wide range of issues, as you mentioned.",
        "The first one is whom do you tell.",
        "So people suddenly had to wrestle: Do I tell my 18-year-old son or daughter or my 17-year-old or my 21-year-old child that he or she therefore also has a 50-percent chance of having this mutation?",
        "Do I want to have that shadow their lives as they're just getting going on their independent adult lives?",
        "And what kind of answers did you hear to that question?",
        "Well, people wrestled.",
        "People generally found, I think, that people in 17, 18, that's too young.",
        "Some people waited until their children were getting married, and suddenly when they were about to get married, at age 28, their parents said, you know, by the way, Uncle Jack, he didn't fall down the stairs and die as we talked about, he actually had Huntington's disease.",
        "And then suddenly people had to figure out, well, should I still get married, should I have kids.",
        "So I think that's too late.",
        "So I think that it's important to make independent judgments and also talk to a genetic counselor or a geneticist or a physician about what makes sense for the individual.",
        "But I think teens are too early, and waiting until someone's about to get married, late 20s, is too late.",
        "I want to bring in one of our listeners.",

        "Did you feel compelled to tell your husband prior to your marriage that Huntington's was in the family?",
        "Yeah because he'd actually met my father right before my father had passed away, and it was very obvious at the time that he was suffering from a lot of the physical symptoms.",
        "So to not address the situation was out of the question.",
        "So I made sure that very - it was an early and open discussion about the discussion because I felt like it was fair for him to know.",
        "Would you rather that we lived in a world where you had no idea whether your father's illness was inheritable or not?",
        "For me personally no. I think it depends on the individual.",
        "And for me, like I said, I have been able to be at peace with my decision, but I've seen my own sister, who not knowing put her into a severe depression for years.",
        "Robert, is that quite typical, that it actually is kind of - the not knowing is more of a torment than knowing?",
        "Well, it's a very difficult decision because for some people, not knowing is worse, and therefore they decide to get tested.",
        "People, I should say, also often feel that they are beginning to have symptoms, and that then may lead them to decide to test or not test.",
        "There's also issues during dating, that is to say even before getting married.",
        "At what point do you tell, if you're just beginning to date someone, do you tell right away on the first or second date, and if you do there may not be a third date.",
        "On the other hand, if you wait too long, people can feel you've not been honest.",
        "So those are very difficult decisions that you and others may have faced, as well.",
        "Julie, thank you very much for your call.",
        "I believe also, Robert, you wrote about people who did tell a prospective date, and that in fact was the end of it, that suddenly because people can see - think that they can see into potential, as I said earlier, plotline in your DNA, that it may turn out this way, or the odds are higher that it may turn out this way, you're suddenly perceived as damaged goods, and your datability goes down.",
        "Did you see much of that?",
        "Yes, that happens, particularly with Huntington's disease, and one concern is that as we go forward, as more and more people are tested - and soon when you walk into your doctor's office, at some point in the near future, your whole genome will be tested.",
        "And so we'll each know information or have the possibility of knowing information about our mutations."

        "It's basically $900 to test your whole - the three billion letters that make us.",

        "Many people elect to undergo genetic testing outside of their doctor's care, and then they struggle with whether to divulge what they've learned to their physicians.",
        "Some worry that the information is going to become part of their permanent medical records or that doctors might report what they learn to insurance companies or employers.",
        "It's a tricky business and one that's only truly come to light in the last 26 years since investigators identified the first mutation for Huntington's."

        "Yes, it's exactly right, and often there are reasons that people in the family may not want to know each other's results.",
        "One, is because people may be upset.",
        "If you find out that you have a mutation, it means that maybe I can have a mutation, as well, say, for breast cancer.",
        "Also, sometimes people say, you know, I'm going to apply for life insurance and disability insurance, and the insurance company will probably ask me has anyone in my family ever had a genetic test, and if so, what was the result?",
        "And so if you get a genetic test, I don't want to know because I know you have breast cancer, and I know you're thinking about it, but please don't tell me because this way I can say I don't know, and otherwise if I say, oh yes, my mother or my sister has a mutation for breast cancer, I may be denied disability insurance or life insurance.",
        "And so there are other reasons as well why increasingly there may be secrecy, unfortunately, about some of these issues in families.",
        "What are the laws, then, with insurance companies in terms of getting a test result, that if you take one outside on your own, and there's no - you know, it's a mail away kit, and these things exist, and you take it outside on your own, and you keep it to yourself, I suppose there's no way the insurance company would know that you've done your own test, and you know your results?",
        "That's correct, but then you face a problem.",
        "Should I tell my doctor that I have this mutation that can affect my health?",
        "And the problem is if you tell the doctor, the doctor will no doubt write it in the medical chart, and if you apply for life insurance or disability insurance or long-term-care insurance, the insurance company may well ask to see the chart and see that information there.",
        "There is the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, or GINA, that became law about a year and a half ago.",
        "But it applies only to life insurance and does not apply to all life insurance.",
        "So it does not include disability insurance and life insurance and long-term-care insurance.",

        "When you talk with people about whether they should tell their bosses, say a career professional who's making his or her way up through middle management discovers that he or she has the gene mutation for Huntington's, and that person's parent, who also had the mutation, died at the age of 55.",
        "Have the people you've spoken with decided the ethical question of whether you should tell your boss I'm probably not going to be here when you would want me here, or are people more wrestling with the question of I need to protect myself, and the ethical thing to do is to keep this to myself, and the unethical thing would be for my employer to discriminate against me because of this.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, it's a terrible choice to have to make.",
        "And the problem is that there is often subtle discrimination that goes on.",
        "So what people told me, as I describe in the book, is that, you know, everyone thought I would become the next head of the department when the head of the department retired.",
        "And, but I had this test, and I told a few people at work, or I told a work friend or colleague that I had this mutation, and when it came time to replace the boss, I was not chosen.",
        "I was passed over."
