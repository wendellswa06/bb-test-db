        "And some family members were also doing it, and we have shared results.",
        "So for me, it was interesting to get back the results and see that I'm less likely than the general population, say, to get Parkinson's.",
        "I am slightly more likely to get arterial sclerosis, which gave me the possibility of OK, control your diet and exercise more.",
        "But then something interesting happened for me, which is I got a notice from them that now they could test my (unintelligible), which is what I sent them, to see whether I was likely to get Alzheimer's.",

        "Yeah, it remains interesting when I get all kinds of additional results they come up with on my first sample, but it's nothing I have an emotional charge on.",
        "It may say oh, I don't think I'd really like to come down with that.",
        "I've slightly more risk for this or that, like the arterial sclerosis.",

        "But nobody in my family has ever had breast cancer that I knew of.",
        "So I didn't have a charge on that, but boy did I have a charge on the Alzheimer possibility.",

        "And we can then see, before we implant embryos into the woman's body, we can see which ones have a mutation like Huntington's and which don't.",

        "It's a controversial procedure, as many issues involving assisted reproductive technology are.",
