        "You can do something.",

        "They include the service workers union, which is--they've got 1.7 million members; the Teamsters; the Food and Commercial Workers and UNITE HERE, which represents garment and hotel workers.",
        "They're really upset because they feel that the labor movement is on a slide to irrelevancy, and they want to see what they consider to be bold changes.",
        "One of their suggestions--or one of their demands, really--is that the AFL-CIO put half of its budget into organizing workers because they need more members.",
        "And, of course, AFL-CIO is willing to spend more on that but not as much as this group wants.",
        "So what has been the reaction, other than some recalcitrants evidently, and, you know, is the mood sort of deepening, as this convention takes place tomorrow?",

        "You said it's about a third of the membership; that sounds like a lot.",
        "Well, it would be the biggest split since the 1930s, and it would be certainly a huge blow in terms of dues.",
        "The AFL-CIO would lose many millions of dollars in dues.",
        "And I think it could also hurt the political organizing effort because even though both sides say they'll continue to work together to elect candidates who are supportive of their views, there's a fair bit of bad feeling here.",
        "And this new group--they call themselves the Coalition to Win--they're planning on meeting tomorrow to put together their own sort of parallel structure and parallel organization.",
