        "It doesn't open up the box for all the states that have banned gay marriage and never had gay marriage on the books.",
        "The court here said look, the status quo in California was that there was gay marriage and that the other parts of the law provided absolute equality with marriage and that therefore the only thing that Prop 8 took away from people was the unique status of being married, and that in and of itself was a kind of discriminatory act.",
