        "So Nina, we're been saying that it's expected that - court-watchers are expecting that this decision will be appealed to the U.S.",
        "Supreme Court, but it seems from what you're saying it's narrow, it may not really apply to other states, maybe this isn't such a good case for them to take.",
        "Well, it's not a - if the court had said there is a fundamental right to marry for gays and lesbians as well as straights, that would have meant that every place west of the Rockies, which is where the Ninth Circuit operates, those are the states covered by the Ninth Circuit, gay marriage would have been legal under the laws of the - despite the laws of those states.",
        "That is not the case here.",
        "This is a California-centric decision based as much as possible on California law and California court rulings.",
        "And therefore it is not the sort of bomb that it could have been.",
        "And the court is at least free, quite easily, to simply say that's California, it's based as much as possible on California law, we don't have to take this case.",
        "On the other hand, the court could take this case and say - and then the question would be if you change the law, are you free to change the law, to go back to the position that the state law was in at one time when marriage between - when same-sex marriages were banned?",
        "And this decision says you didn't offer us any good reason to go back.",
        "You have to have some legitimate reason, and you didn't offer us one that we saw as legitimate, and that would be the question that the Supreme Court would then have to grapple with.",
        "In that sense, it's - as I said, it's a very narrow and very shrewd decision in the sense that it doesn't have to interject a national court decision on this question right away.",

        "OK, thanks so much for calling us, Rob, appreciate your comments.",

        "In 2007 a district court judge here in Des Moines ruled the same as the supreme court, ruled it was unconstitutional to ban same-sex marriage.",
        "And there was a brief period in 2007 before he put a stay on that.",
        "One couple was able to marry in 2007, so that was the first same-sex marriage in Iowa, but he put a stay on the ruling and it eventually reached the Iowa Supreme Court.",
        "And then the seven judges in a unanimous ruling in 2009 ruled that ban unconstitutional.",
        "So was there any kind of backlash against the decision when it was...",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "In 2010, conservative groups and many evangelical Christian churches rallied support, and three of the seven justices were voted off the court.",
        "They go up for retention votes every so often, and they - the voters voted them off, including the chief justice of the Iowa Supreme Court.",
        "So three justices lost their jobs over it.",

        "It's been three years.",

        "The last opinion poll that was taken statewide to gather public sentiment about same-sex marriage was about a year ago.",
        "At that time - we're still evenly split over the issue - 38 percent say they oppose same-sex marriage, 34 percent say they support it.",
        "I think the more significant number is the 30 percent of Iowans who say they don't care, it doesn't affect their lives in any way."

        "But I'm wondering what are you finding, Rob - and we're hearing something very different from Minnesota - what are you finding, Rob, in Iowa in terms of the churches' involvement and also in terms of what Tim has been talking about, which is interesting, which is what's going on on a sort of personal level between people, within families, neighbors, friends?",
