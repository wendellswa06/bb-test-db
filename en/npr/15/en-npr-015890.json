        "And you haven't seen any - what I was wondering is if in states where this has been legal for a little now, people have started getting married.",
        "Maybe all of a sudden, somebody realizes the people next door are actually a married couple, maybe it's two women.",
        "Does that shift their opinion in any way?",
        "Does it change people's attitudes?",
        "I guess that's what I'm wondering.",

        "My experience has been that people who were opposed to it are still opposed, but maybe resigned to it.",
        "I'm hoping what changes is the young people who are now, let's say, in high school and in college who are gay will see marriage as an option for them if that's what they want, whereas people from generation who are now in their 40s may not have ever considered that as an option.",

        "That's right.",

        "I'm getting the sense that because of the younger people who have grown up with young people who are coming out at a much earlier age or LGBT alliances in high schools and colleges across the country, I think because of that people are more accustomed and have more friends who are gay or lesbian.",

        "They've cleaned up their act since then, but they very carefully got this deal under the wire of regulators by seizing 4.9 percent of Citigroup as opposed to the 5 percent that lets the Federal Reserve stick its nose in the business.",
        "So basically, they just tailored this so that they wouldn't get any extra scrutiny?",
        "Right.",
        "And it says something about where we are with this mortgage crisis because Citigroup has declared some losses, but it's anticipating further losses that they'll have to take as we reevaluate what is this mortgage paper worth.",

        "Interestingly enough and I certainly concur with everything Jerome said about the issues that are facing African-Americans here in Michigan.",
        "I think that Detroit brings a core issue to mind, the fact that you have such a heavy concentration of African-Americans in Detroit who are, for whatever reasons, primarily Democratic voters.",
        "I think it has taken Detroit off the radar screen in terms of political clout as it hits Lansing, which is our capital city, needless to say, where a legislature is predisposed to ward those constituencies or those markets that are more Republican base.",
        "So, you see areas like Grand Rapids, for example, the western side of the state or the northern side of the state, that reap the benefits where the vote, rather Democrat or Republican, are more dispersed than they are in Detroit, Michigan, where if it's not a completely controlled Democratic Congress, Senate and governorship, it makes it very difficult for them to stay on the radar screen on a consistent basis.",
        "And I think that's eroded Detroit's effectiveness in Lansing.",
        "You are a Republican and yet it sounds like you think that Detroit is being underserved by the state government?",
        "I wouldn't put it that way.",
        "I would certainly say that Detroit is probably not fairly represented in Lansing because, again, of its leanings for the Democratic Party.",
        "There is no balance there, so when things go to committee or when things go to the House and there isn't a voice on the other side of the aisle, I think those kinds of issues get pushed to the side.",
        "But I think that would be true in any city rather it's urban city or suburban cities.",
        "If you don't have a voice in a room where decisions are made, your voice loses its power.",

        "Detroit's been on the radar screen for a long time, or at least over the last eight years in particular.",
        "And because it's had sort of monolithic political affiliation, I just don't think it's been able to sustain its clout.",
        "And as we shift back into more moderate or, even in some circles, Republican politics, you'll start to find Detroit get pushed further and further or what.",

        "And they're really looking for that now.",
        "I mean, I think a lot of African-Americans have some hope that be it Barack Obama or be it Hillary Clinton on the Democratic side and, you know, to a lesser degree, some of the Republican candidates can make a difference, can pull the state out of its doldrums and get it back on track, much like many other states have done, you know, done well.",
