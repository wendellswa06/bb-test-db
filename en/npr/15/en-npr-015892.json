        "You know, I think we're probably just beginning to understand what happened.",
        "I think it's clear that the legal world sort of tipped on its axis after 9/11, and there was a sense, I think, in the government and probably among the public that legal failures had caused the problem and so legal solutions would fix the problems.",
        "And that led to a very, very wholesale effort to redefine the laws of war, reexamine our criminal surveillance laws, all sorts of very, very broad efforts that we're only really now starting to evaluate and to in effect say was the fix a good fit for the problem or was it sort of an over-correction?",
        "So I think that it's really taking this long to kind of think critically about some of those steps we took.",

        "In some ways.",

        "So now I think we're pulling back a little and as recently as last week we had a federal judge in New York who struck down some of the provisions in the Patriot Act that had to do with so-called national security letters.",
        "Those are sort of warrantless subpoenas, and there was a provision that would have gagged the recipient of those subpoenas from talking about it.",
        "The judge in New York - here we are all this time later - says, hey, that is that the, quote, \"\"legislative equivalent of breaking and entering.\"\" It's way too excessive and has to be struck down.",
        "Well, 9/11 also highlighted this age-old issue of presidential power.",
        "I mean, certainly the president attempted to use this in the warrantless wire tapping issue, the attempt to classify people as enemy combatants.",

        "But it's certainly the case, as you said, that this president has staked out the most extreme vision of sort of unilateral, unchecked executive power most of us will have seen in our lifetime, a sort of variant on Richard Nixon's claim that if the president does something it's never illegal.",
        "We saw it in the torture program, we saw it in the extraordinary renditions to black sites, we saw it in the labeling of people enemy combatants and suppressing sort of fundamental rights that they may have had to due process, in tandem with all these unilateral executive actions.",
        "Well, what would you say the biggest legal issue that still needs to be resolved is?",
        "One of the most imminent ones remains to be a question of the trials for the folks who are down at Guantanamo; many of them who have been sitting down there without any sort of meaningful due process for years and years.",
        "The Supreme Court is poised to hear that case this fall.",
        "But I think there are other, larger questions about what kind of warrantless wiretapping is acceptable in light of new technologies and questions about our interrogation policies that may not be squared away.",
