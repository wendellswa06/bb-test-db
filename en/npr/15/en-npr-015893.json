        "It was a horrible feeling to see these houses constructed so poorly.",
        "I was wondering how hard it is to walk back why houses fail in storms like this, you know, what the fatal flaws are.",
        "When the damage is so extensive, how can you find the clues that tell you why a house was destroyed?",
        "Well, even a house that is no longer there provides ample evidence for us.",
        "For example, those houses that were anchored - and I use that term loosely - with a cut nail, as the cut nail is dragged across the slab it scars and leaves a mark on the slab.",
        "So we can tell which direction even the wall failed.",
        "Did you look at the damage of the two elementary schools that were destroyed?",
        "Yes.",
        "And what did you see?",
        "Well, these schools had been designed for the building code of 90 miles per hour.",
        "And we found a number of fatal flaws in the construction, especially with the concrete masonry unit walls otherwise known as CMU.",
        "There were many unreinforced walls and they did not have the steel rebar that goes into them or the grout that goes into them to protect them against anything more than a 90-mile-per-hour wind.",
        "And that's disheartening in a way because schools obviously are where children are congregated.",
        "And here we have just a standard type building with no real area of safety.",
        "Now fortunately, they had interior hallways which did provide some protection but it wasn't a shelter, per se.",
        "Um-hum.",
        "And in one of those cases I believe it was an interior wall of a hallway that collapsed and killed a number of children at Plaza Towers.",
        "That's correct.",
        "I mean, unreinforced concrete masonry kills.",
        "Children should not die in schools.",
        "To me that is - especially when you have a tornado coming - I don't care how strong the tornado is, there are ways that you can have a shelter to withstand that and you can save the children."

        "The Shabab, it's easy to see them as the result of the terrorist ideology, but we have to remember 90 percent of them are children.",
        "They're the youth.",
        "That's what the Shabab means.",
        "They're under the age of 20 years old.",
        "They've been misled.",

        "interest to knock those leaders out.",
        "They're doing that, hopefully, carefully with these drones and by targeted attacks.",
        "But at the bottom of it, the Shabaab is the result of the fact that the Somalis are poor, desperate and futureless.",
        "Jeffrey Gettleman, from your vantage point there in Nairobi, is that an accurate description of the situation with Shabaab in Somalia?",
        "Yeah, more or less.",
        "I mean, I think a lot of people resent not just the leaders, but the rank-and-file fighters who have been terrorizing them.",
        "But I think what's important to remember is even if the Shabaab are defeated, stability in Somalia is not around the corner.",
        "There - already we're seeing the emergence of warlords or the return of warlords.",
        "There are still parts of the country that are pirate sanctuaries, and the transitional government has, you know, continually embarrassed itself in many ways."

        "So this isn't the, you know, the end of Somalia's troubles if the Shabaab are defeated.",

        "And Bronwyn has written a lot about this, but there's this belief that the only way for Somalia to be stable is it to happen from within a grassroots, local governance, bottom-up approach.",
        "And we're just not seeing that, so I'm afraid that the - a lot of the problems of famine and underdevelopment and piracy are going to continue unless there's some serious progress made in governance.",
        "And we're just - nobody's really talking about that.",
        "It's a military story right now, and that's never been the solution.",

        "Outside forces also included al-Qaida.",
        "They did.",
        "Although back in 2006 when Ethiopia invaded Somalia, I think that the threat from al-Qaida was greatly exaggerated, and the influence that al-Qaida was exaggerated.",
        "I think that there is a consensus within expert opinion now that the Ethiopian invasion did far more harm than good and that if we could turn back the clock, I think that we would have a very different strategy playing out.",
        "Yet, al-Qaida did provide funding to al-Shabaab and training to its troops.",
        "It did, absolutely.",
        "And, you know, that's a point of debate within the intelligence community too.",
        "There is a very a strong school of thought that said basically that Somalia is inoculated from terrorists groups, that in the past, in the 1990s, for example, al-Qaida tried to gain a foothold in Somalia.",

        "The Somalis don't like foreign interference.",

        "They were not interested in the international jihad.",
        "And so, you know, al-Qaida's re-entry into Somalia in 2006, you know, it was alarming, but it was not a forgone conclusion that Somalia would become a safe haven.",
        "Jeffrey Gettleman, the factor that, of course, we have to consider here is the famine and that has been so damaging in the southern and eastern parts of Somalia.",
        "With the losses, territorial losses of Shabaab, has more aid been able to be delivered to more people?",
