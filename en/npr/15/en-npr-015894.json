        "Tomorrow, we'll talk about police shootings.",
        "How officers are trained to evaluate potentially dangerous situations and what happens after they fire their weapons.",
        "Join us for that.",
        "This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "I'm Neal Conan in Washington.",
        "Not really because this has happened and it's happened in an environment of conflict, so the Kenyan military has taken over certain parts of Somalia from the Shabaab.",
        "The Ethiopians have done the same thing.",
        "The African Union has done same thing, but it's part of a conflict.",
        "So the aid groups are not able to access those areas very easily right now.",
        "And there's even been increased displacement and suffering in some areas.",
        "I was just in Mogadishu a few weeks ago, and I wrote a story about an increase, a sharp increase in the number of women who are being raped both by government forces and freelance militias and also by the Shabaab.",
        "So, you know, we're not seeing like a real dramatic difference on the ground.",
        "This is still kind of at the midpoint of this story.",
        "And I think the biggest factor with the famine is that it's been raining a lot in East Africa.",
        "This year has had very heavy, steady rains.",
        "So I don't think you're going to have the food crisis next year that you had this past year, but things are still, you know, very fluid and very messy on the ground in Somalia.",
        "And, Bronwyn Bruton, as we look ahead towards if indeed the scenario we painted - nothing is certain in any conflict, but if Shabaab is fragmented and splintered and if it is reduced as a force incapable any longer of administrating territories, all these different players, how do you get them to sit and wait or encourage the development of what you were talking about, an internal solution?",
        "The answer to that is not a happy one, unfortunately.",
        "When we talk about Somali development, we have to understand the illiteracy rate is so high.",
        "The ability of Somalis to do something as simple as send money from Minnesota to Mogadishu to support their family has now been crushed.",
        "And that's a big part of the economy.",
        "This is a hawala system.",
        "The hawala system, yes.",
        "That's right.",
        "You know, it basically is a long, long haul that we're talking about, where you need to do development and education at the most basic level.",
        "It's really hard for me to take seriously the idea of nation building when you're talking about a group of people who don't have a good grasp of what democracy is, and requires so much, you know, just basic building block work that nobody really wants to do, least of all, I think, the United States.",
        "We're talking with Bronwyn Bruton, deputy director of the Atlantic Center, where she focuses on East Africa policy.",
        "Also with us, Jeffrey Gettleman, New York Times East Africa bureau chief.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And, Jeffrey Gettleman, if that's the situation, the agencies one would naturally turn to would be the African Union, the regional power, and then from there to the United Nations.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And it's interesting.",
        "The African Union is really stepping up in this situation.",
        "They are having more success in Somalia than they've had maybe anywhere else in Africa.",
        "And part of the reason is they're absorbing casualties.",
        "They, you know, they have suffered something like 500, 600, 700 men who've been killed.",
        "And the United States left Somalia in 1993 after 20 service members killed in the infamous Black Hawk Down incident.",
        "The U.N.",
        "is not willing to take those casualties."

        "So one reason why the African Union has been successful in pacifying Mogadishu, to a large degree, is because they're the only ones that are willing to, you know, have their guys get killed day in and day out.",

        "The Shabaab guys are determined fighters.",
        "They're pretty good with the suicide bombs and asymmetrical tactics.",

        "So like I was saying before, we're not finished here by any means.",
        "But what we're seeing is a momentum right now that resembles what happened in 2006, where you have all these different players working together to some degree to push out the Islamists, in this case, the Shabaab.",
        "And I think, you know, that's going to happen.",
        "I think they're not going to be able hold territory the way they were a few years ago.",
        "But it's not going to be the end of Somalia's misery.",
        "And it would be good to see more talk about, you know, how to begin to develop a political system that the Somalis actually believe in because so few, you know, have any faith in the transitional federal government.",
        "These people do not represent the average guy or woman out in the Somali hinterland.",
        "And that's the problem.",
        "And, Bronwyn Bruton, we're talking about Somalia, yet two fairly large parts of what we used to call Somalia are no longer consider themselves to be part of Somalia.",
        "That's Somaliland and Puntland.",
        "And are we going to see more and more fragmentation?",
        "Is that part possible?",
        "It is possible.",
        "And I think it's a big fear on the part of many Somalis.",
        "Opinion is divided in Somalia.",
        "The northern territory of Somaliland, for example, declared its independence 20 years ago, and they have no desire to be reunited with their colleagues in the south.",
        "But many other people want to see Somalia made whole again.",
        "And it - a big concern when you talk about the invasion of countries like Kenya and Ethiopia is that it is going to damage Somali pride.",
        "And it is actually going to give the Shabaab a boost because Somalis who are - who do not want to see parts of their territory effectively annexed by Kenya or by Ethiopia are potentially going to revolt.",
        "And, Jeffrey Gettleman, let's go back to where we began.",
        "If Shabaab is shattered, you mentioned that it does have overseas branches.",
        "There was an attack by Shabaab in Uganda.",
        "Might there be more, and where does Shabaab still have capabilities outside of Somalia?",
        "Well, it's funny you bring that up.",
        "There was just a warning a couple days ago by the British Embassy in Nairobi that a terrorist attack was in the final stages of planning, and it warned people in Nairobi to stay away from malls and nightclubs and public places.",
        "The fear is the Shabaab is planning something big in Kenya.",
        "They have supporters here.",
        "There's been a number of small attacks since Kenya went into Somalia, so that's - and I live here in Nairobi and things have changed.",
        "There's checkpoints on the roads.",
        "There's people getting searched - their bags getting searched, patted down to enter a supermarket.",
        "The whole place is kind of on this uneasy war footing, which is very unusual for Kenya.",
        "It steered clear of all of these conflicts in Sudan, in Somalia, in Ethiopia before in this region.",
        "So that's the big fear.",
        "They definitely have support in Kenya, but you never know.",
        "They could send somebody back to the United States.",
        "There are Americans who have died at suicide bombers for the Shabaab.",
        "So that's the big nightmare for U.S.",
        "law enforcement, is that a person who left the states, went to Somalia for training, will come back to the U.S.",
        "and pull off a big attack.",
        "Jeffrey Gettleman, thanks very much for your time.",

        "And lawmakers failed to pass tough carbon emissions legislation.",
        "Clean air legislation has not passed and so the thought was that the cap and trade or some type of carbon tax would be a strong incentive and advantage to a nuclear power plant that is a non-carbon emitter.",
        "So the downturn in the economy, the lower price, the lower demand and the lack of a carbon tax have all been negatives to nuclear power.",
