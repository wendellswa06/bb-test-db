        "That's the highest level since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita slammed the Gulf Coast, and on top of that, employers added the fewest new jobs to their payrolls in more than four years.",
        "The weak numbers caught most economists and analysts off guard, which helps explain why the markets are taking such a hit today.",
        "The big story here is that a healthy job market is critical to keeping the economy out of a recession, especially in the wake of the sinking housing market.",
        "So today's news that the employment picture is deteriorating isn't very good news for the economy.",
        "And what would it take at this point for the economy to slip into a full-blown recession?",
        "Well, unfortunately, Madeleine, not very much.",
        "Manufacturers, retailers and construction and financial services companies all cut jobs in December, and they are all on dangerous footing as they continue to digest these hits from the subprime mortgage fallout.",
        "I talked to Action Economics chief economist Michael Englund, and he says while consumers have largely ignored most of the bad news over the last six months, it hasn't been lost on American businesses.",
        "And that may not bode well for the future.",
        "It will probably take a lot to talk down the consumer.",
        "But if businesses keep cutting back on their spending because they want to trim their inventory levels and be prepared for the worse, the business sector is big enough and it alone can pull the economy into a downturn.",
        "And so if consumers finally follow suit and clamped down on their spending, Englund says we may be in for an all-out recession.",
        "Sam, what can the government do to avoid that?"

        "Well, so far the Federal Reserve has responded by cutting key interest rates as a way to boost economic activity.",
        "Usually, these lower rates spur businesses to spend more.",
        "And last year the Fed cut rates three times, and it's expected to lower rates again when it meets later this month.",
        "But fears of inflation are making the Fed's job a lot more complicated these days.",

        "Then you throw in oil prices and the Fed's job becomes ever trickier.",
