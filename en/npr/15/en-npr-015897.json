        "In essence, the plan promises to give tax breaks to those who buy health insurance on their own.",
        "It would also tax those who do not.",
        "But critics say the president's proposal is dead on arrival and does nothing to make health care available to everyone.",
        "So what is the best remedy?",
        "And how will those who can't afford coverage get it without going broke?",

        "With cost as a reasonable factor, what kind of coverage should be made available to achieve the maximum medical benefit?",

        "The problem is, we don't have a healthier country.",

        "There's a lot we don't know about treating high-cost patients in the most efficient and effective way, and we need to work on that.",
        "Well, let's talk now about the president's plan.",
        "There are two big aspects of that plan to re-jigger tax deductions for health insurance.",
        "One, he wants to remove the tax-exempt status of employer-sponsored health insurance and treat it as income.",
        "And number two, beginning in 2009, he wants to give a tax deduction to people with health insurance of $7,500 for an individual income tax filer and $15,000 for a couple filing jointly.",
        "Let's break it down, Joseph Antos.",
        "What basically does the president's health care plan seek to accomplish and what do you make of it?",
        "Well, I think it has several goals.",
        "First of all, the current system, which provides much greater tax benefits to people with higher incomes and good jobs and expensive health insurance and essentially nothing for low-income people and workers who can't afford to buy health insurance, it levels that out.",
        "It makes it more fair.",
        "Right now, we have higher income people receiving tax benefits that are essentially paid for by low or middle class workers.",
        "So that's going to be adjusted in way that I think will promote more workers getting health insurance, but will not in fact force higher income people to make decisions that they don't want to make.",
        "Dr.",
        "Walks, we've had employer-supported health insurance for workers for years, but it seems, at least from my reading of the president's proposal, that he would like to move away from that system.",
        "Is that your interpretation, and is that a good idea?",
        "Well, that is my interpretation.",
        "And I'm not sure that it's a good idea.",
        "In fact, what we - what I think it really says is that the president wants us to move towards individual choice and folks deciding what's the best care, making decisions about how they spend their money.",
        "I don't know that we have a lot of evidence that if you give folks who don't have a lot of money to spend the choice between spending that money on food, shelter, et cetera, and buying health insurance that they will do that.",
        "In fact, with the tax deduction, it will absolutely favor those who have higher incomes over those who have lower incomes."

        "Certainly, as I say, the letter has nothing in its content to really embarrass me, an earnest youth worrying about his future, et cetera.",
        "Nonetheless, it was not written for public display.",
        "And since I'm still quite alive - or feel myself to be so from time to time - I would quite simply not want to see these very private meanderings in print.",
        "When a writer is dead, certainly that becomes a different matter.",

        "I had not a clue that he'd written thousands of letters.",
        "I thought he was upstairs working on his fiction all the time.",
