        "President Obama also had a message to Israelis who were not in the room because of the Jewish holiday Sukkot.",
        "Israel's settlement moratorium has made a difference on the ground, and improved the atmosphere for talks.",
        "Our position on this issue is well known.",
        "We believe that the moratorium should be extended.",
        "We also believe that talks should press on until completed.",
        "An Israeli source says there are lots of compromises being floated from all sides, though none appear to be too serious yet.",
        "With settlers planning to resume building on Sunday and Palestinians threatening to walk out of talks if that happens, the negotiators are in a rush.",
        "A U.S.",
        "official, who asked not to be named, said there's literally no stone unturned, and negotiations are likely to go right down to the deadline.",
        "A former Palestinian negotiator said if Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas compromises on the issue, he will look weak in the eyes of Palestinians.",
        "Speaking outside the U.N.",
        "yesterday, Diana Buttu also said she's disappointed that President Obama is backpedaling on the settlement issue.",
        "I expected much, much more from President Obama.",
        "I really expected that he was going to act and be very decisive on the issue - at the very least, of the settlements.",
        "Because in my mind, how can anybody prove to us that the peace process is going to work and that settlements will eventually be evacuated if they can't even stop them from being constructed in the first place now?",
        "We have a mixed system now, and the question is how do we make it better.",
        "Those who argue for universal health care in the most extreme form are really talking about a government single-payer system.",
        "That is to say, the government makes the decisions.",
        "There's one type of health plan.",
        "And while that offers the promise of full coverage for everybody, in fact the reality that we've seen in Europe, in Britain in particular, is that the disparities in health treatment that we now see among lower income people, among minorities and so on, those types of problems persist in those universal health care systems.",
        "We have less than a minute left, Dr. Walks, for you to chime in on your interpretation of what universal health care actually means.",
        "I think Mr. Antos just did a wonderful job in explaining it.",
        "I want to muddy the waters a little bit.",
        "We're talking universal health care.",
        "What we really mean is universal health coverage, where everyone has access to health care.",
        "Universal health care would mean that we would be more aggressive in getting out into our communities and do what's called social marketing to help people to focus on health maintenance and maintaining the kind of health that many of us start out with.",
        "So the coverage is one piece.",
        "And all of the things that were just explained are right, including the fact that just doing it doesn't give us a healthier lower income and those at highest risk, as we find in England.",
        "I've done some studies over…",
        "I'm sorry, Dr. Walks, we going to have to stop, because our time ran out.",

        "There is a lot of work left to do to improve our preparedness on the hospital level.",
        "And it's very - in the U.S.",
        "we have a very scattered system, so individual hospitals are their own fiefdoms in a way.",
        "There are private hospitals, public hospitals; and each one of them is sort of responsible for emergency preparedness.",
        "And there's just not a lot of oversight on a national level of how prepared the various hospitals are.",
        "And one of the major - you know, fundamental issues would seem to be: Are they ready to generate their own power if needed?",
        "That is one of the big vulnerabilities we have in this country.",
        "So, hospitals are required to have backup generator systems.",
        "But, for example, there is no requirement that they have to be able to keep an air conditioning system functioning.",

        "Heating systems don't have to be powered by the backup generators.",
        "So even you can imagine a wide range of disasters could knock out the power.",
        "There are also many hospitals in flood zones that don't have elements of those backup power systems above flood level.",
        "So these are things that we don't yet have requirements on a national level to get hospitals up to the kind of preparedness that perhaps we would like in this country.",
        "And there's the big question of who pays for that.",
        "And who pays for that.",

        "Well, I think that's one of the major ones.",
        "The other one is that we really need to think about these things, and it's wonderful that we're having this discussion today in advance of when they happen because leaving these, sort of crisis situations and the very tough decisions about, you know, who do you treat first when you have a big load of people coming into a hospital...",

        "Senate confirmation hearings for President Bush's Supreme Court nominee, Judge John Roberts, begin next week.",
        "Along with all the specific questions he'll be asked about his judicial philosophy, one big question will loom over these proceedings.",
        "Is the Constitution alive or not?",
        "Put it another way: Should it be interpreted exactly as the framers intended, or should it accommodate changes in technology and morality and society in general?",

        "She's back with us now.",
        "Dahlia, why this question especially because of these hearings with Judge Roberts?",
        "Well, mostly I think because in preparing for the hearings myself, I was struck by the prevalence in the world of punditry of only one side of this argument--that is to say, I kept reading over and over again, `Roberts needs to be an originalist, he needs to be a strict constructionist, he needs to be one of those guys who reads the Constitution exactly the way the framers wrote it and intended it to be.",
        "He can't be one of those, you know, willy-nilly make-stuff-up-as-he-goes-along judges.",
        "And I thought that's interesting; what's the other side of that debate, and more importantly, why aren't we hearing it?",
        "There used to be this notion of a living Constitution, of a Constitution that evolved as times and morays and technology changed.",
        "And yet, we're not hearing that side of the debate.",
        "And so I essentially threw it open initially to readers and said, `What do you think?",
        "Is this Constitution in fact really dead?",
        "If it's a living Constitution, why don't we hear arguments for that?'",
        "The living Constitution side is often associated with liberals, so I imagine you heard from many, offering ideas to support the notion that there should be a living Constitution.",
        "What did they say?",
        "They argued, I think, overwhelmingly, one, a sort of normative point, which is the Constitution has to be alive.",
        "Look at the text of the Constitution itself.",
        "Look at the Ninth Amendment, look at the Eighth Amendment, which says there's a bar on cruel and unusual punishment.",
        "If there is a bar on cruel and unusual punishment and no definition of what that is, of course the framers intended for evolving notions of cruel and unusual to be incorporated into the constitutional scrutiny.",
        "And how about the originalists, the people who argued that--`Stick with this document, it was great 200 years ago; it's still great.",
        "These are conservatives.",
        "What did they say in response?",
        "The most interesting thing I found, the distinction between the two types of letters, is that the folks who are for strict construction or originalism are quite angry.",
        "There was a sort of tenor in their voice of real betrayal, a sense that these unconstrained judges are thwarting a popularly elected president, a popularly elected Congress, and that, you know, the sort of arguments about judges who have not been tethered to anything, who sort of make it up as they go along.",
        "But I will say that they went a lot farther than that and made really substantive and I think very smart argument about the need to sort of have something fixed, to sort of say, `We can't triangulate off whatever the current fads are or the fads in other countries.",
        "We need to really orbit around something that stays the same.",
        "That's the single most important thing in the law, is that it doesn't just shift around on a whim.",
        "And that was, I think, the essence of some of their best letters.",
        "Was there anything particularly insightful or persuasive that altered the way that you think about this question?"

        "Well, at one level, I think what was most interesting, I thought, was how even the average reader--you know, people who started their e-mails with, `Hey, I'm not a lawyer, but'--had incredibly nuanced and well-crafted arguments for their position.",
        "So I think it's a myth to think that Americans aren't deeply involved and concerned about this.",
        "But I think more than anything it really helped me understand that the tension here is not just about, quote, unquote, \"\"activist judges,\"\" you know, it's not just about the idea that judges are crazy monkeys, as I call them, who are sort of swinging from the constitutional chandelier and making stuff up.",
        "I think the tension is very, very much deeper, and it has to do with do we have something that is fixed and certain, immutable that we'll always know we can triangulate back to, or are we just going to sort of bounce along on the currents of fads and, you know, morals that shift and change.",
        "And I think in a sense that goes to the deep divide between conservatives with a small C and liberals with a small L.",

        "So what's the incentive for the lender to take such a loss?",
