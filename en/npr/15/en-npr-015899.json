        "This requires some very difficult decisions by some people who would be under enormous stress.",
        "Do people practice these kinds of decision making?",
        "Not enough.",
        "In fact, just yesterday a whole issue of a medical journal came out that had a few triage plans that they sort of sent out there, as they said, straw men to see what people are going to think about them.",
        "These are triage plans specifically for a nuclear incident; more like a, you know, a terrorism kind of nuclear-attack incident, but with some resonance to what we're seeing in Japan.",
        "And so, there's some very, very difficult decisions to be made and these are things that, you know, people are still throwing out there as models.",
        "There is by no means one way that everybody agrees upon that this should be done.",
        "And certainly most doctors, nurses, people at hospitals haven't practiced these.",
        "They aren't even aware of some of the decisions that they might have to make.",
        "For example, who do you let into your hospital, if your hospital is overwhelmed?",
        "Do you take some people off of life support equipment to make way for others who may have a better chance of survival?",
        "Would we want to do that as a society?",
        "What kind of effects would that have on societal trust?",
        "These are things that - you know, the conversation is really just beginning.",
        "And there's not just nuclear issues.",
        "N1H1 - well, it didn't turn out to be as bad as people feared, but it raised a lot of issues over what we would do in the face of a pandemic.",
        "That is exactly what caused a lot of people to start looking at this issue and making plans.",
        "And so now - in fact, some cities do have some plans that they've put in place, these drafts, that they hurriedly put in place when H1N1 looked like it might be a very severe pandemic and like we wouldn't have enough ventilators to go around; which we wouldn't in a severe respiratory pandemic, in a severe flu pandemic.",
        "And so these issues are very real.",
        "We hope they never come up but there is the possibility that they will.",
        "And so, how much effort do we put into preparing for these sort of, you know, worst case, high impact, high lethality, but low probability events?",
        "That's a very difficult question in these austere times."

        "So, how realistic are even preparatory drills?",
        "That's a very good question.",
        "I was speaking with someone recently who works on the hospital accreditation - with a hospital accreditation company.",
        "And they have in recent years, some of them - and there's no national requirement for hospitals to have particular types of disaster preparedness plans.",
        "So his company is working really hard trying to make some better requirements for drills and things like that.",
        "And he said, you know, we really don't know how much of this is vaporware and how much of this is real.",
        "We don't even know, first of all, how to test whether hospitals are following their plans, let alone whether those plans really would, you know, promote preparedness - or to what extent would they?",
        "And can we come up with better drills and better plans?",
        "So there's a lot of need for, you know, learning from these drills and taking those lessons.",
        "Learning from the disasters and taking those lessons and improving these kinds of standards.",
        "It used to be, for example, very common that you would do drills on paper and now there's more of a push to have drills that - you know, perhaps they aren't as good as the ones that our caller would have, you know, has suggested, but at least where there's real people running around and acting it out.",
        "What about supplies?",
        "Do hospitals lay in supplies of - for example, we hear about the efficacy of iodine in the case of a radiological event.",
        "You can take it to prevent the amount of radioactive iodine going into your thyroid and causing, maybe 20 years down the road, thyroid cancer.",
        "Do they stockpile things like iodine and the other things they might need in a disaster?"

        "If it's after that time period, it's not very useful.",
        "It's also only useful for radioactive iodine, and there are other types of isotopes where it's not effective.",
        "In fact, with our strategic national stockpile, if you go on the website, which is a stockpile of things that may be useful countermeasures in case of different types of emergencies, there are really only four types of countermeasures - iodine is one of them - that could possibly be effective in a type of a radiological emergency or nuclear emergency.",

        "Yeah, there was a whole program that started after 9/11 to help hospitals, you know, purchase some of the things that they might need, and unfortunately it has been cut in this next year's budget.",
        "So that's a little worrisome.",
        "I also noticed that with the stimulus program that we had recently, there was really not much in there at all in terms of improving our hospital preparedness or public health preparedness, and that, I think, may have been a missed opportunity."
