        "And our local hospital that work with also it's my community hospital that I go to, had backup generators to treat the patients and run all the emergency equipment.",
        "That wasn't the problem.",
        "The problem was the generators were not hooked up to the heating and cooling systems, and when the heat in the hospital got over a certain temperature - I want to say right around 85, 90 degrees - the hospital had to shut down per, I believe, probably JACO, the joint accreditation program, because a lot of the chemicals, drugs, IVs, medications were no longer considered good at a certain temperature.",
        "And so after closing for two to three days, it cost millions of dollars to open back up because everything had to be thrown out, restocked, and then we had to be reaccredited and have - or not reaccredited but recalibrate all of the equipment, all of the medication.",
        "It was a nightmare.",
        "And I believe since then the hospital has included the heating and air system on the backup generators because of that very reason.",
        "It wasn't a matter of life and death for patients, but it was a huge cost.",
        "And when the hospital had to shut down because of the heat, did all the patients have to be moved elsewhere?"

        "So if they picked up, there was a possibility of it getting pretty quickly to the hospital.",

        "Exactly.",
        "And it costs money to do that because you have to have bigger generators.",
        "But of course, on the other side, you just explained some of the costs, and then of course moving patients is a risk to patients.",
        "So - and particularly if you then add flooding on top of that, how do you get them out?",
        "How long does it take to airlift patients out?",

        "Should they be incorporated more quickly?",
        "They are being incorporated, higher-strength materials, more ductile or deformable materials.",

        "And you keep saying higher-end buildings and buildings where, of course, you have first responders, and the buildings they work in need to be held to a higher standard.",
        "But if you think about the scale of the disaster in Japan and translate that to California, I assume that would be very worrisome.",
