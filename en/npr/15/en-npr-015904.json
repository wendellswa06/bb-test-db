        "Nevertheless, a lot of people would say wow, you've got to be tired at least part of the time.",

        "And this brings up the whole issue of the hours-of-service rules, which are now going to be revised again for the fourth time, I believe, in this decade.",
        "And revised downward this time, do you think?",
        "I think it's a strong possibility.",
        "The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, earlier this year, announced that they would revisit the hours-of-service rules that were published in January, that became effective in January of this year.",
        "They became effective just before President Obama's inauguration.",
        "Those rules are the 11-hour driving limit, 14-hour total working time limit, 10 hours of mandatory rest.",
        "They replaced, back in 2003, a set of rules that went back to the 1930s, which allowed for 10 hours of driving time and 15 hours of total work time, on-duty time, eight hours of rest - but allowed you to also break up your driving time with off-duty breaks."
