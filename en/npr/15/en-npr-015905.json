        "Yeah.",
        "I - you know, most people out here got their license at 16 and had never been called to account for what they know about driving ever since.",
        "And I also agree with the first caller about the fact that I don't find truck driving as fatiguing as car driving.",
        "Largely, I think because, first of all, you do train yourself for it, and second of all, because you are so hyper-vigilant on things.",

        "But my biggest comment is that not only do cars - well, everybody needs to do this.",
        "It's the following distance that is your biggest point of safety because you're following distance gives you two things: number one, it gives you more room to react to anything happening in front of you and, number two, it gives you more room to see further in front of you to - so that you're not just reacting to the car immediately in front of you, but you are reacting to the vehicles that are even in front of those cars and�",

        "Right.",
