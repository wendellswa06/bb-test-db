        "Well, the events - and it often happens to someone's foreign policy - events intrude on what you might want to do.",
        "This visit was, I think, originally meant to kick off a high level of dialogue leading to the first summit meeting between the president and President Putin.",
        "But now Syria has risen to the top of the agenda because of the horrific use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime last week.",
        "And so a very different kind of conversation's going to be taking place with Lavrov.",
        "And President Putin has decided he's not even going to see Tillerson because the Russians are quite upset about what the U.S.",
        "has done."

        "struck.",
        "I think the U.S.",
        "is quite confident in its intelligence that it was the Syrian regime that either didn't dispose of all the weapons that it had three years ago or it's been producing new ones.",
        "So they're going to have a fairly tough conversation where the Russians are still standing by their client, rather than reining them in and trying to steer things towards ending this Syrian civil war.",
        "So let me ask, ambassador, if the conversation is really going to be that tough.",
        "And here's why I ask that.",
        "The United States certainly sent a flashy message by firing a bunch of missiles at a Syrian airfield.",
        "But that airfield is still being used to target rebels and civilians.",
        "The United States is still not, so far as we know, actively trying to overthrow Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian leader, although they're talking differently about him in recent days.",
        "Is it possible to say the U.S.",
        "still is not really conflicting with Russian interests all that much in Syria?",
        "Yes, I would tend to agree with that.",
        "I mean, not so much because of the degree of destruction at the airbase but the Russians, I think, have been assured by statements that this was not meant to signal the start of an open-ended campaign against the Assad regime.",
        "This was meant to punish the regime for breaching the international norm regarding the use of chemical weapons.",
        "But unless Assad continues to use those chemical weapons, this could end up being a one-shot deal.",
        "The focus of the United States remains, as has been said by many officials, fighting ISIS.",
        "And of course, we don't want to get into conflict with Russia or the regime, which have pretty sophisticated air defenses, which could interfere with our operations against Raqqa, which are the key focal point right now...",
        "Oh, yeah."
