        "Well, maybe not across the country, but Juan, has it not played out already that way in some states, as you've just suggested?",
        "I think so, and I think, Renee, what you're hearing there is Senator Obama seeking to have it both ways.",
        "His campaign, as you know, made a concerted effort to win over black voters, and now he has them as the really - his leverage point in this contest.",
        "He can count on them as he can count on no other constituency.",
        "But at the same time he doesn't want to be defined as the black candidate in the race, realizing the possibility that white voters would be turned off to that.",
        "He wants to be someone who transcends race.",
        "But if you look, for example, at Latinos, if you look at Asians, you see this racial divide.",
        "It's not just black and white.",
        "For example, in California, Senator Clinton won 66 percent of the Latino vote, doubling Senator Obama's total, Renee.",
        "In New York she won Latinos with 74 percent of their vote; in New Mexico 56 percent of the Latino vote.",
        "Among Asians in California she won a whopping 73 percent of their vote.",
        "So this is consistent.",
        "It's not just black and white.",
        "What you have is Senator Obama winning the black vote, that being his base, and Senator Clinton then going towards the white vote, the Latino vote and the Asian vote.",
        "Although just briefly, there's studies showing that when Hispanics become familiar with Obama, they do regard him favorably.",
        "So this isn't all fixed in stone when you talk about the Latino, the Hispanic vote.",
        "No, but it's overwhelming, I think, you know, for Senator Obama to - the contest right from the start, even with black voters, was about him gaining name identification, people becoming familiar, people becoming excited about his candidacy.",
        "He had to persuade black voters, for example, that he could win white votes in order for them to take him seriously as a candidate, and that's what he's done.",
        "And Juan, what about Wisconsin and Ohio?",
        "Those are crucial big states coming up in the next few weeks.",
        "Well, what you can see, Renee, is that given the kind of divide that we've seen - and they're pretty much now a clear demarcation between the two, Senator Clinton holding on to white women, older voters, working class voters, as well as poor voters, so long as they're white; and Senator Obama winning black voters, as we've been talking about, upper income voters, highly educated voters, and especially young voters.",
        "So looking forward, going into Wisconsin, Ohio, and even Washington, D.C., Virginia and Maryland this week, he can count on that constituency as a base, and the question is whether or not he can expand it.",
        "Juan, thanks very much."
