        "But Ken, we need to talk about some of this back and forth over this amazing phenomenon called Sarah Palin.",
        "It - amazing and phenomenal are the exact words, because first of all, going into the Republican Convention, the Republicans were running really between - their tail between their legs.",
        "They were disheartened.",
        "The polls show that Barack Obama had a lead in all - many of the key swing states, and John McCain had trouble rallying his base behind him.",
        "The introduction of Sarah Palin and her speech last Wednesday, I guess it was just only a week ago.",
        "Only a week ago.",
        "It's amazing.",
        "In St. Paul, just really re-energized the party, and one poll, I mean, USA Today/Gallup poll had him leading Barack Obama by 10 points among likely voters, white women in a Washington poll, Barack Obama had an eight-point lead and now, Barack - now, John McCain has a 12-point lead among white women.",
        "And everything seems to be turning around, Republicans are running with more and more confidence.",
        "There was a woman yesterday; her name is Jennifer Horn who is thought to be an underdog in New Hampshire, running under the Republican primary in the second district.",
        "She won the primary because she was portraying herself as a hockey mom, that kind of person.",
        "So the Sarah Palin effect has taken ahold, and the McCain campaign seems to be running the entire dialog.",
        "It seems like Biden and Obama don't know really how to deal with this.",
        "Well, you mentioned that one poll that had McCain up by 10 points overall, most of the polls though and one out today the Wall Street Journal/ NBC poll has it just about dead even.",
        "Right, it is dead even and, of course, the most important thing - and we will talk about this later - is obviously not a - it's not a national election as you always say.",
        "It's a 51 state, 50 states plus the District of Columbia.",
        "that's where the election will be won or lost.",
        "And those polls still have tightened very much to states that Barack Obama thought to win kind of handily, Pennsylvania, Michigan have tightened.",
        "The Democrats are a little nervous.",
        "And the advertising that both camps are doing is now reflecting the significance.",
        "It's amazing how much more quickly ads are coming up these days.",
        "But reflecting the significance of the maverick stance by the Republicans, their changed platform, and here's an ad out just this week.",
        "(Soundbite of campaign ad)",
        "The original mavericks.",
        "He fights pork-barrel spending, she stopped the Bridge to Nowhere.",
        "He took on the drug industry, she took on big oil.",
        "He battled Republicans and reformed Washington, she battled Republicans and reformed Alaska.",
        "They'll make history, they'll change Washington.",

        "Politicians lying about their records, you don't call that maverick, you call it more of the same.",
        "I wonder who writes the music for those ads.",
        "It's James Garner, I think when he was a maverick.",
        "But what's interesting again is that we're talking about John McCain's slogan of maverick.",
        "We're not talking about - once upon a time, it was about Barack Obama's ability to bring change to Washington.",
