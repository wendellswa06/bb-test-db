        "I mean, he had an affair with a top aide, and that seems like kind of a pickian thing, but of course, the city wound up spending millions of dollars to hush up that affair.",
        "There was a lot of settlement out of court, and finally, the governor, actually, Jennifer Granholm, intervened and basically forced him out.",

        "Senator, Senator.",
        "Senator, excuse me, going on trial later this month, I think - is scheduled to anyway - doing well in the polls in Alaska.",
        "Well, not well, but since Sarah Palin was picked as a running mate, of course, Sarah Palin being from Alaska, and the two of them are really never been that close but it's given the Republican Party a boost in many states including Alaska.",
        "Ted Stevens had been running behind Mark Begich.",

        "They are very active here, and Ohio has about 10 media markets when you consider the bordering states, so it's a tough state campaign in, and you will hear more radio ads on conservative radio and Christian radio for Barack Obama featuring the conservative Democratic Governor Ted Strickland in southern parts of the state and you'll see different ads up here.",

        "So that shadow, sometimes an eclipsing shadow, was always present in his life.",
        "And so at the age of 16, his mother sent him out of the country.",
        "He left with a cousin on foot and as a political refugee went first to Sudan, then Germany, then Italy and then by the time he was 19, to the United States.",
        "He ended up staying in New Haven, Conn.",
        "He, despite having seen, you know, bodies around him, classmates disappeared, walking through killing fields, soldiers breaking into his house, having lost a brother in the war as every family lost children in the war, he had a tremendous capacity for joy, the greatest of everyone I've ever met actually and a will to self-expression.",
        "And eventually, he and his brothers started a restaurant that became legendary in New Haven - Caffe Adulis - where he was the chef serving these Eritrean fantasia foods.",
        "And after he would leave the kitchen at night, he would go and paint.",
        "So by the time he and I got together in 1996, made a family, had two sons in quick succession, he turned from restaurants to a full-time life as a painter.",
        "Can we talk about some of the specific things that people have shared with you or given to you or sent to you?",
        "I was struck by how many of them are infused with joy."

        "One thing that was just lovely - one of my favorite readings was with a writing group called InsideOUT Writing, and these folks work with juveniles who are incarcerated.",
        "And so I worked beforehand with some of those young people and then they shared the stage with me.",
        "The theme was healing through writing.",
        "And so afterwards, a young man came up to me with a beautiful origami paper card and inside he said, I have a message in a bottle, I hope my poems reach you.",
        "And inside a bag filled with paper and confetti and tinsel, I reached inside and found a little, teeny-tiny glass bottle that I'm holding right now.",
        "And it has a cork and inside is a sparkly ribbon and a crystal heart.",
        "And then when you open up the cork, it's a drive that goes into the computer.",

        "One gentleman, an Eritrean architect, brought me a gorgeous, gorgeous book that I'm looking at now - \"\"Asmara: Africa's Secret Modernist City.\"\" And it's a book with a history of the architecture with beautiful photographs of Asmara, the city that Ficre grew up in, and he signed this.",
        "He brought it for my sons.",
        "This book has pictures of the whole world that their father grew up in that they, because of war and conflict, have not been able to see.",
        "And so I'm looking at the cover, which has a picture of an ice cream shop and bar right next to the theater where he learned to love cinema when he was growing up.",
        "And so here on the cover of this book for my children to see is one of their dad's magic places.",
        "You saw everything that Ficre made, but something came to you that you hadn't seen because an old friend found something that Ficre had given to him years ago.",
        "Can you tell us that story?",
        "Oh, my goodness.",
        "So a friend of mine from college put together that his friend knew me after hearing me on the radio talking about the book.",
        "And he said, I was friends with Ficre before I ever came on the scene - 20 years ago, perhaps.",
        "And he said, we were very, very close friends, and I went to Caffe Adulis.",
        "And one day, he painted for me a painting of his village.",
        "And then we lost track of each other, and then I lost track of the painting.",
        "He had just found the painting some 20 years later, and he said, I was getting ready to look for Ficre to give it to him.",
        "And he said, and then I turned on the radio and as I listened to this woman talking, I realized she was talking about the same Ficre.",
        "And so I want to give the painting to her.",
