        "Well, it's something they've been doing early for most of the year.",
        "The problem with Michigan, of course, is that the Democrats bypassed it, they ignored the state because of a fight with the DNC overrules.",
        "So, Michigan is one of the few states in the country - a few Democratic states in the country where the Democrats are coming to the game late.",
        "They didn't have the excitement of the primary.",
        "They didn't have the candidate during the primary.",
        "And they're almost playing catch-up.",
        "But as far those techniques, the Democrats are always been on top of that before the Republicans.",
        "George, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "Ken, let me ask you, everybody thought Barack Obama was going to have a tremendous advantage in money, because he eschewed the matching funds from the federal government.",
        "And he thought he could raise a lot more money than John McCain did, but now it may not be such an advantage.",
        "A lot of people thought that McCain will be hamstruck by taking federal money.",
        "He is only allowed to spend 84 million dollars from now until the general election, but the Republican National Committee and a lot of 527 groups, independent spending groups are raising a ton of money, again, especially since Palin now was named to the ticket.",
        "They are almost in parody with what the Democrats are raising and the problem for Barack Obama, since he's still raising money, he still has to spend much time going to these fundraisers where John McCain does not have to because he can't raise any more money for his campaign.",
        "And also the campaign is shorter.",
        "The distance between the end of the last convention, the Republican Convention ended last Thursday, and then the general election.",
        "It was only, I think, 60 days, which on the 56th now and that's short - John McCain only has 83 million dollars.",
        "You can spend it quickly.",
        "I mean it's amazing, we are talking Barack Obama with a 150 million dollars on maybe both parties having a 150-200 million dollars that should not be enough for 55 days, is pretty remarkable.",
        "But again, everything can - and so much is at stake, so many states are in play and so you know, the last thing that either party wants to do is find themselves without enough money.",
        "And we think, eight weeks to Election Day, that's not right.",
        "People can start voting, I think, in about three weeks.",
        "Some states have early voting that starts as soon as late September.",
        "Well, that's interesting too.",
        "Like Nevada, who - I have talked to journalists there from Nevada, but Nevada has early voting.",
        "New Mexico has early voting and these are states - these are areas where again, the McCain-Palin ticket has this momentum.",
        "So if people are voting early, that could be good news for the Republican Party.",
        "So all of these mechanical things, they sound like, you know, down in the weeds.",
        "These can really make a difference in presidential campaign."
