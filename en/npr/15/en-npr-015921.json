        "Electoral votes, yeah.",
        "Electoral votes, yes.",
        "It's one of the states out there that there are five electoral votes in Nebraska, if they can win the Omaha district - the second congressional district, they can pick up one or two electoral votes.",
        "It's never happened, but again the fact that the - if Barack Obama's going to win Ohio - I mean, I'm sorry Omaha, if he's going to win Omaha then obviously he's doing far better in the Midwest than people thought and it could be, you know, a very big pick up, but it has never happened even though they can split their electoral votes, they never have.",
        "And a red state that is now thought to be in play is Nevada.",
        "Joining us now from his in Las Vegas is Mike Mishak a reporter for the Las Vegas Sun, and Mike Mishak nice to have you with us.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "And how does it look now in the state of Nevada?",
        "Well, polls show that the state is tied, but if you look at the numbers then if you look at the ground games, the numbers certainly tilt to Obama.",
        "Here, I think Ken had mentioned earlier early voting that starts in Nevada on October 18th, so the push is on.",
        "And Obama has far outpaced McCain in all aspects of his ground game thus far, but he's really put an emphasis on voter registration.",
        "His volunteers were out capitalizing on what momentum he got from his convention, registering 4200 voters over the Labor Day weekend, 1500 voters the previous weekend, and this all adds up to what we're seeing with Democrats now having more than a 60,000 voters advantage over Republicans in the state.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that what you're seeing with this election is that Nevada has never gotten this level of attention in a presidential election.",
        "It's never been this important and certainly in the Democratic side there was so much enthusiasm with the candidates coming in for months and months and months.",
        "And you're seeing that in the voter registration and people on both sides being excited.",
        "Nevada had one of those early primaries this year.",
        "I wonder, a lot of Latinos in Nevada, how are they breaking?",
        "That's right.",
        "I think that they comprise about a quarter of the population in Nevada and what we have seen since the 2006 midterms is that well, their primarily registering Democratic and that they've increased their ranks , Hispanic Democrats based in Clark County, the population center where Las Vegas is, they've increased their ranks by 14,000 voters since the last election.",
        "And I think that certainly they broke for Clinton in the early caucus, but I think that now what you're seeing in Nevada is what you're seeing in national polls as well and that's Hispanics going overwhelmingly for Obama."

        "Does that hurting the Republican Party there as well?",
        "The Republican Party is weaker - is in pretty much the weakest state that people can remember in recent memory right now, and Gibbons as the standard bearer for the party certainly has not done anything to help.",
        "The party after I guess trouncing Democrats for four straight cycles, kind of just gave up in terms of maintaining that organizational machine that it has, and so they're out at there - the organizational disadvantage to Democrats and as far as morale is concerned it's pretty low.",
        "Does that the fact that McCain and Palin both coming from the west does that help them at all?",
        "Certainly, the arguments at the McCain campaign is making - they've scheduled a conference call this afternoon to talk about with Nevada's junior senator, John Ensign to talk about McCain's western appeal, the fact that he's a western Senator, the fact that he's a western Senator, the fact that he understands issues like land use and water.",
        "But McCain himself has been largely an uninspiring figure to Republicans.",
        "He - Republicans in Nevada.",
        "He supports Yaka Mountain, the proposed nuclear waste depository it's about 90 miles north of Las Vegas.",
        "At one time he had proposed banning sports betting in Nevada which is a huge part of our economy, but more so than those issues, he finished third in the Republican caucus in January.",
        "And when you look at exit polling, overwhelmingly the issue that really hurt him was this you know, out in the ether Republicans said that he - McCain just did not share their values.",
        "Now I think Governor Palin helps the ticket here.",
        "Certainly, we had one of our congressmen, Dean Heller, comment in saying that in the largely rural part of the state which is his district it helps him that she hasn't that McCain campaign has also argued that Governor Palin has energized the base and really brought a lot of energy that was previously lacking to the campaign.",

        "I know Utah is another world, but we are all Americans.",
        "So, anyway you see some people from California maybe campaigning there in Nevada for one party or the other.",

        "And there's no candidate that is going to have broad enough appeal to win all of it, and Pennsylvania is already very contentious between party lines, regional lines to begin with.",
        "I think it's really be a wild card, I think it will be the - my prediction is that Pennsylvania will be the Florida of the 2000 election.",
        "Ken, the polls before the Republican Convention showed Obama with I think five-point lead in Pennsylvania?",

        "A tremendous amount.",
        "A lot of people riled up at the bitter comments, not so much in Pittsburgh in Philadelphia which I visited recently, not even in sort of the affluent Philadelphia suburbs, but in Redding, Allentown, Wilksburg(ph), Scranton which has come up so much.",

        "And one of the things I find interesting is the maverick ad is why aren't people making more to do that it really is a stretch with Palin, the fact that she really was for that bridge to nowhere until it was not going to happen and then she kept the money.",

        "That it exists.",
        "During the Kerry campaign we did a little work, my family, but really they're really just wasn't a lot of interest.",
        "And so, the fact that they're there is my big point.",
        "The other thing is I took my daughter back to college last week, and she's in Virginia in Lynchburg.",
        "Lynchburg is a bigger town of course than you know Conifer, but riding through town, sure enough, there was the Obama office.",

        "So, that became an issue to some degree in the Iowa caucuses too Ken, and students from various other parts of the country are going to vote for Obama in Iowa.",
        "Well, what's interesting also is that we keep talking about Iowa, New Mexico, and Colorado and people say why we're spending so much time on this, had Al Gore won New Hampshire and its four electoral votes in 2000 he would have been the president.",
