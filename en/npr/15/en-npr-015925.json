        "Georgia is one of those states that does not have that power.",
        "So even though you have groups like the NAACP, who have said that, you know, Governor Nathan Deal cannot wash his hands of this case, the State Board of Pardons and Paroles is really the last legal option that you have other than, you know, the U.S.",
        "Supreme Court possibly stepping in or things of that nature.",
        "So the governor does not have any last-minute power after the State Board of Pardons and Paroles issues a result.",
        "But that also is kind of a political question, because some say, well, if these members are appointed by the governor, then the governor can, you know, privately or publicly, you know, push for the board to act in a certain way.",
        "And we haven't seen this governor make too many statements.",
        "But again, the members on this current board were not appointed by the governor.",
        "They were appointed by his predecessor.",
        "You mentioned the NAACP.",
        "Edwards is black.",
        "The case is in Georgia.",
        "Has race been a factor in this case?",
        "Race has definitely been a factor.",
        "I mean, yesterday - it's been interesting to listen to his supporters, because they have walked a very fine line before the clemency hearing, saying that this board has a great responsibility, also saying that we respect the MacPhail family, really trying to tone down a lot of the racial rhetoric.",
        "Since the clemency - since the clemency hearing, where the clemency was denied, then you've heard a lot of his supporters say this is Jim Crow in a new way.",
        "This is a real reflection back to the old South.",
        "So there's always been a bubbling of race here, especially when you're talking about a black man and a white police officer in the late - around 1989.",
        "So there's always been race as a factor, here, but it has really started to bubble up in the last couple of days.",
        "The execution is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern time at Jackson State Prison.",
        "Can you set the scene for us?",
        "What is that like?",
        "So one of my colleagues who has been down to Jackson State Prison to watch another execution said a lot of times, you know, you don't really have a lot of people show up to these executions.",
        "In fact, when it comes to media witnesses, they even have to try to make sure that they have enough media witnesses to go.",
        "The Troy Davis case seems not to be like any other.",
        "You've also had people taking buses down, coming down by the hundreds.",
        "You've seen civil rights activists like Reverend Al Sharpton, who have already come down to Jackson, Georgia.",
        "So the scene in Jackson, Georgia, from what we're understanding, is a lot different than what it usually is.",
        "You're seeing a lot of people surround that area, hoping that their public appeals will have some sort of sway, or just saying if this execution goes forward, we don't want to be seen as being silent on the issue."

        "Hi, Neal.",
        "And it's interesting, Charles Edwards mentioned that this case was before the Supreme Court just a couple of years ago.",
        "Yes, they did something very unusual.",
        "You know, the Supreme Court sits to decide legal issues, and there was not really a great legal issue or constitutional issue in this case.",
        "The fundamental issue was: Did they get the right guy?",
        "And so the Supreme Court did something unusual.",
        "Rather than hearing the case, they said we're going to send it back to Georgia and have a judge hold a hearing - you've heard this statement about seven of the nine witnesses recanted - to have the witnesses come in, take the testimony, and have the judge sort of review the case from start to finish and decide whether this person was properly convicted."

        "Most of the witnesses repeated what they said, and...",
        "In the original trial.",
        "In the original trial, and that he said: I think a reasonable juror would not have been convinced - had they heard all this - to have exonerated Troy Davis.",
        "I wanted to ask you, this is a piece that was written for CNN.com by the former Republican congressman from Georgia, former U.S.",
        "Attorney Bob Barr, who said prove - that in that hearing, the federal judge decided that Troy Davis had to prove his innocence, rather than - we think of the other way around.",
        "He has to be proved - proving innocence is far more difficult than establishing doubts as to one's guilt and flips our system or criminal jurisprudence on its head, Barr wrote.",
        "Instead of the American system's presumption of innocence and a requirement the state prove guilt, Davis' evidentiary hearing began with the court presuming guilt and required the condemned to prove his innocence.",
        "Even though the judge in the evidentiary hearing denied Davis a new trial, he conceded the standard was extraordinarily high.",
        "Davis was unable to meet this nearly insurmountable task.",
        "But while he fell short of proving his innocence, he established doubts to his guilt, prompting the judge to concede the state's case against him was not iron-clad.",
        "Well, I suppose that's a fair way of putting it.",
        "Of course, if you're a judge, and the person has been convicted by a jury, what you want to know is: Is there new evidence that's come forward, new witnesses that would question, cause you to doubt that?",
        "So the judge starts off with the presumption that the guy - that this defendant was properly convicted, and then wanted to know what's the new evidence.",
        "I will say, though, Neal, I think these are always the very hardest cases, because if I told you that somebody was tried and convicted, and I think with a 90 percent - nine chances out of 10 he's guilty, and we're going to go ahead and execute him, I think a lot of people would stop and say, wait a minute.",
        "Nine chances out of 10?",
        "What about that - and that's the scary part of a case like this."
