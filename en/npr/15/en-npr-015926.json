        "Here's an excerpt from a Times, New York Times editorial: The grievous errors in the Davis case were numerous.",
        "Many arose out of eyewitness identification.",
        "The Savannah police committed the - contaminated the memories of four witnesses by re-enacting the crime with them present so that their individual perceptions were turned into a group one.",
        "The police showed some of the witnesses Mr. Davis' photograph even before the lineup.",
        "His lineup picture was set apart by a different background.",
        "The lineup was also administered by a police officer involved in the investigation, increasing the potential for influencing the witnesses.",
        "In the decades since the Davis trial, science-based research has showed how unreliable and easily manipulated witness identification can be.",
        "Studies of 100 felony cases overturned because of DNA evidence have found that misidentifications accounted for between 75 percent and 85 percent of wrongful convictions.",
        "The Davis case offers egregious examples of these kinds of error.",
        "There is no DNA evidence in this case.",
        "There was no weapon found.",
        "It is eyewitness testimony.",
        "Yes.",
        "This is sort of a 10 or 15, 20-year revolution that's going on very slowly in the criminal justice system, and the previous caller alluded to it.",
        "DNA came along, more DNA testing, and lo and behold, to the shock of prosecutors, judges and a whole bunch of other people who had great faith in the criminal justice system, a lot of people were in prison, and they were innocent.",
        "And when they went back and looked at their cases - for example, rape cases - the woman very strongly identified the person as that's - that was the culprit, and it was the wrong person.",
        "And now, as you say, one of the major factors was faulty eyewitness testimony, and that's what's at the heart of this case.",
        "Let's get another caller in.",
        "Robert's on the line, Robert with us from Ashland in Oregon.",
        "Hi, Neal.",
        "It has always seemed very inappropriate to me for family members of victims to be given so much publicity and therefore influence, perhaps, on the judicial system.",
        "The victim's mother here has got to be one of the least impartial people in the universe, and it irks me to keep hearing quotes from her.",
        "That's why we have a justice system.",
        "She would never be allowed on a jury.",
        "If she was a judge, she'd have to recuse herself.",
        "I think the media collaborates with this, and there ought to be a disclaimer.",
        "It's just - I think that is part of the victims' rights movement that is a grave error.",

        "Well, I would be impressed by her open-mindedness, but she is just an individual who has some very severe stressors that are going to point her away from impartiality.",

        "I don't mean to be cold about it, but it moves us away from impartiality in the system.",

        "We know what the truth is, the truth that came out in the trial and the truth that Troy is not innocent, the truth that everything that they have tried to say - that is, you know, recantations and everything else - has been a lie.",
        "Our judicial system has said so, and he's had ample time to prove his innocence, and he is not innocent.",
        "David Savage, victims' rights, more and more families are present at parole hearings, for example, and things like that.",
        "Yes, I think I don't really agree with the caller - the previous caller's point, because certainly the family of - in this case - Troy Davis can come forward and say you should not go forward with this execution.",
        "You're executing an innocent man.",
        "And it seems to me if the press is going to allow the defendant's family to be a part of the story and voice their view, obviously, they're - they could be said to have a bias, too.",
        "They don't claim to be impartial.",
        "I don't see there's too much wrong with allowing the victim's family to speak in the press.",
        "You wouldn't want the victim's family to decide the cases as a judge or juror, but as a - I don't see the problem of allowing them to speak and state their view.",

        "My own thoughts about the death penalty have changed since my father's death.",
        "Putting that person deemed responsible for the killing to death does not bring my father back.",
        "The horrifying part of this story is that perhaps Mr. Davis is innocent.",
        "How can we, as a society, apply the ultimate penalty, a penalty that can't be undone, in a case when we are not absolutely positive of his guilt?",
        "And that raises the question: Courts are arranged so that they try the case, and it's beyond a reasonable doubt.",
        "And if a person is found guilty, it's difficult to get a retrial, David."

        "And that's why there are 3,200 persons on death row in this country, and there are, in a normal year, a couple dozen executions.",

        "The too-promiscuous grant of evidentiary hearings could both swamp the dockets of the district courts and cause acute and unnecessary friction with state organs of criminal justice.",
        "So prosecutors generally prefer to let verdicts stand.",
        "Certainly, prosecutors are not in favor of going back and retrying the cases again.",
        "But that's the real push and pull of the system, that defense attorneys don't - you know, want a chance to go back and reinvestigate the case and appeal on all the issues.",

        "Unless we can guarantee with 100 percent accuracy that an individual is guilty of capital crimes, we do not have the right to take their life away from them.",
        "Since our justice system has demonstrated time and time again that it is imperfect, as are all human endeavors, we should not presume that it is capable of determining who lives and who dies.",
        "And you can hear that argument, but you can also look at the opinion polls and say that something like two-thirds of the American public supports the death penalty.",
        "Yes.",
        "And even that caller's - that there are some cases where there's DNA evidence, or there's - really no doubt about the guilt.",
        "So it is not true that all death sentences, there's a residual doubt.",
        "There are cases where, I think, everybody, even that defendant sometimes agrees that he committed the crime, but there are some extenuating circumstances.",
        "But it - certainly, there are a large category that, even to the end - I've been surprised all the years I've been doing this, where you see a case that comes up and you read one side of the brief and you think, well, this guy's clearly guilty.",
        "And then you read the briefs on the other side, and what you learn was two fellows committed some crime.",
        "They shot somebody at a 7-Eleven.",
