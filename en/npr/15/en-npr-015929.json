        "This little red dot.",
        "So, Joe, why can - with my naked eye see Mars?",
        "Well, you can see it frequently with the naked eye, but this is brighter than usual.",
        "And the reason is - there's a bunch of reasons.",
        "But the reasons are that they're - Earth, the sun and Mars are all lined up at the moment.",
        "And it's a little bit - it's not really like a flashlight, but it's a little bit like, you know, it's more like a full moon.",
        "It's like the sun is shining full on Mars.",
        "So it's the most lit up it's going to be.",
        "OK.",
        "But also, it's happening at a time when Mars is closest to the sun or close to the sun.",
        "It's going to be actually closest in a little while.",
        "But that means it's getting more sunlight, so it appears brighter.",
        "So we're lined up, and we're close to the sun.",
        "And so that's why it appears so bright.",
        "The sun, this big flashlight on Mars.",
        "That's right.",
        "It's like - well, flashlights are directed.",

        "How come that time frame?",
        "Well, it's because - well, the closest-to-the-sun part is more infrequent.",
