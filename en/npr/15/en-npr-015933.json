        "And we don't think of that as part of the job because we're usually fighting with the guy across the aisle for space in the overhead bin.",
        "Exactly, yeah.",
        "A lot of the flight attendants are often thought of as, you know, they're simply there for customer service, as wait staff in a sense, but their primary duty is safety and security on board.",
        "I always thought you weren't allowed to wear the official American Airlines uniform but you said you approximated one from Lands End catalog, but nevertheless, I thought they should wear stripe shirts because in a lot of ways they are referees.",
        "That's right.",
        "You know, some of the flight attendants I talked to in dealing with passengers they that they kind of describe there job as being one really constantly had to calibrate the mood of passengers.",

        "You know, dealing with people with the overhead fight for overhead bin spaced and listening to people brought then their frustration about the security procedure.",
        "Because flight attendants are often the people that the passengers see that work for the airline and have time to talk to them, whereas you know, when the rushing from gate to gate, they may not come in to contact with any airline personnel.",
        "And I must say that I was trapped on the ground in providence this past summer for five hours on the tarmac.",
        "And they were, the flight attendants were great because I though we were going to have a pretzel riot.",
        "Oh, wow.",
        "Oh well, yeah, when I was on board that was one of the things that surprised me.",
        "There were - I had to say no a lot to passengers because there were a lot of things that passengers were use to getting that just aren't stock on board in airline anymore, like, you know, not enough blankets or pillows or you know, even food for sale.",
        "There were only two cookies stocked for the flight that I was on, which was a 737 aircraft with more than a hundred passengers on it.",
        "So even if you want to spend the three dollars for the cookie, they were sold out in the first five seconds.",
        "Exactly.",

        "Yes.",
        "That's - you know, that was really interesting to learn about the flight attendants.",
        "Their schedules are often, you know, wrecked by delays and you know, what passengers experience and you might assume that they're getting paid for the entire amount.",

        "The flight time, the actual flight time when they push back from the gate and then they are given a small per diem, a dollar 50 is about the average for the majors anyway.",
        "And the, you know, in addition to that.",
        "But they're really hard working people and the average flight the average flight attendant salary today is only around 33,500 a year according to the Flight Attendant Association.",
        "Allison, does that number sound about right to you?"

        "Yes and no. It's a little misleading because when you say the average flight attendant, it sound like everybody makes the same thing or that's what you started but most flight attendants start at 15 dollars an hour.",
        "And they probably don't get paid based on the 40 hour work week.",
        "Even though, they may work that or more.",
        "So you make a lot less when you start out and you have to get a lot of seniority before you making that 32,000 dollars a year.",

        "We've been taking pay cuts and our schedule has been getting way worse.",
        "Often we'll spend like four hours in the middle of the day in an airport, when we're not getting paid and we're in uniform, that just means we start early we end late and we might only have nine hours on the ground, which is really not enough to sleep much less feed yourself or refresh yourself.",

        "So this was for me a fun story because it was a look at the other side of air travel, kind of a chance to see what the airline personnel have to put up with from us these days.",
        "Absolutely.",

        "Some of the early morning flights are great to work and also, great to be a passenger on because oftentimes the ripple effect that occurs when flights are delayed happens - affects the afternoon flights more often.",
        "So there's a better chance that your flight won't be delayed.",
        "People are tired, they may have gotten up at four o'clock in the morning to get to the airport and get through security and get on the flight.",
        "So they're usually pretty easy-going.",
