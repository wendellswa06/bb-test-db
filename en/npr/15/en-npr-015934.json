        "Yes.",

        "I worked for a regional carrier, then later for a large international carrier that no longer exists.",
        "But we used to serve full meals between say, St. Louis and Minneapolis, which is about an hour and 20 minutes.",
        "But the upside of that was, as an employee, we had what we called duty and trip rigs.",
        "So if you would, say, go out at some place and get snowed in, for every three and a quarter hours that you were gone, you will get paid an hour flight time and if you really did your homework when you were bidding, you could accomplish a month's work in 12-15 days.",
        "And I know from later going in the management and staying up in the business up until a few years ago that since then, it's been at least for the employees, kind of a downward slide.",
        "Yes.",
        "Some of the flight attendants I talked to said that while some of those perks may exist on paper, it's actually harder to use them because, you know, as passengers are experiencing, the flights are packed fuller so there aren't empty seats to bring the family for a free flight for instance.",
        "And to give you an idea of the economy back in the late '70s at least the original carrier I worked for, if we had an average daily load factor of 57 percent or higher, we are making money.",
        "So yes, if you are flying on a pass, chances are that you'd get to where you wanted to go.",
        "And it was a different era nowadays.",
        "People work almost literally all the time but back in the day, even business travelers would get on a flight with a big, thick Stephen-King-book and have a cup of martini and kickback because he didn't have a laptop to work on.",
        "And Jerry, let me ask you.",
        "How many flight attendants per passenger in your day?",
        "Well, initially, our aircraft seated 100 passengers.",
        "The law is you have to one for every 50; then we went up to 110, we would have three flight attendants for 110-passenger-seat aircraft.",
        "For a full flight, it could get pretty stressful, but you just kind of learn to go with it and, you know, we managed to get it done."

        "And the reason for that is something called capacity.",
        "The airlines have decided that they can make more money reallocating the airline fleet overseas, over the North Atlantic, than fly domestic routes in the United States.",
        "For example, Delta Airlines, right now, is flying 81,000 fewer seats per day domestically, in the U.S., then they did a year ago.",
        "That would explain why all those flights are full."

        "The problem is, just having an airline reservation doesn't necessarily guarantee you a seat.",

        "I thought maybe, obviously mistakenly, that there was a silver lining with gas prices, in that fewer people would be traveling, so airports would be less crowded.",

        "Wow.",
        "So, where does the law of supply and demand kick in?",
        "Well, the law of supply and demand kicks in when you become a contrarian traveler, which is the smart way to go.",
        "And that is, it's not a question of thinking off-season, think different airports.",
        "Think Long Beach, or Burbank, or Ontario, instead of LAX.",
        "Think Providence, Rhode Island instead of Boston.",
        "Think Oakland instead of San Francisco.",
        "Think point to point, instead of going through a hub that could end up costing you time and money, in terms of delays or lost bags.",
        "Let us not forget the airlines lost more bags last year than ever before, over 23 percent higher in 2005 then in 2004 because the bags just aren't making the connections.",
        "And by the way, neither are you when you go through those hubs.",
        "Do you have any tips besides going to regional airports?",
        "What you want to do, is understand that the best way to use the internet is to actually sign in for your flight 23 hours ahead of time.",
        "Meaning, if you're on a flight tomorrow morning at 11:00 a.m., you can actually at 11:05 a.m. today, check in for the flight, which gets you a boarding pass which you can print up at home.",
        "Which means when you get to the airport you've eliminated one of those long steps in the process of waiting in line.",
        "You also get a better seat because at least you got in there early.",
        "That's one thing to do.",
        "Secondly, this connection with the Ukraine and now these new legal questions about Manafort, I think, are very dangerous to Trump because - and we've talked about it before in previous weeks - Trump's closeness to Putin in his - the way he talks about him, his policies, which seem very consonant with what Putin wants to do in terms of weakening NATO or weakening the European Union - I think that Manafort was already raising questions that won't go away just because of his departure about Trump's Russia connection or, at least, Russophilia.",

        "The State Department insists this was not a quid pro quo - that the U.S.",

        "These two tracks came together in a very finite period of time.",
        "And it would have been - given the fact that Iran hadn't proved completely trustworthy in the past - it would've been imprudent and irresponsible for us to not - since we knew this payment was coming and coming soon - to not hold it up until we made sure we had our Americans out.",
        "Eliana, what does all this do to a deal that the Obama administration had hoped to see as a legacy accomplishment?",

        "Not only that, but it was noble to attach a $400 million cash payment to the release of our hostages.",
        "And if that's the case, I don't understand why they weren't transparent and aboveboard about it from the outset and why it took reports from The Wall Street Journal and the Associated Press to get them to be candid about this, you know, seven months later after the fact that.",
        "That, I think, is troubling to a lot of conservatives, not only conservatives but to all the critics of press and the questions of John Kirby at the State Department fielded yesterday were from, really, mostly from the Associated Press."
