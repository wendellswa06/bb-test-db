        "You put it inside the turkey, you know, the head end goes into the head and the tail end goes into the tail and it transmits the heat inside the turkey.",
        "So it actually will cause the turkey to cook in about half the time that a normal turkey would cook.",
        "The head of the International Housewares Association, Phil Brandl, says about 10,000 new items are on display this year.",
        "Some entirely new, others are old standbys with a facelift, think brightly-colored pots and pans, for example.",

        "People are still interested in buying things, but they want to be wowed.",
        "Cornell says his company sells cutting boards with a different look.",
        "There's one shaped like a guitar on display, another like a piano.",
        "This gives a little novelty to the kitchen.",
        "People are tired of the old rectangle cutting boards and so now they can have something a little novel to look at, as well as being functional.",

        "But they have put some numbers to it and these numbers are amazing.",
        "They say it was the second largest earthquake on record and the third most fatal.",
        "It released the energy equivalent of 100-gigaton bomb, and that's about as much energy that is used in the US in six months.",
        "Boy.",
        "Yeah, it's amazing.",
        "And the shifts in the sea floor displaced so much seawater that the tsunami traveled as far as Antarctica in the south, the East and West coasts of the Americas, and as far north as the Arctic Ocean.",
        "And sea levels were raised around the globe, if just by a tiny amount, so that, really, Alex, no point on Earth remained undisturbed.",
        "Well, as you say, this is the tsunami, but it's the earthquake itself where all this started.",
        "What do we know more about that?"

        "And there are some surprising results about that, too.",
        "Yes, the geologists report that it got off to what they call `a flying start,' and then a slow slip.",
        "And that means that during the first minute that the earthquake broke a 60-mile patch of tectonic plate boundary, it began moving slowly northward and, had it stopped, it would have been nothing more than a typical 7 on a Richter scale.",
        "But, instead of slowing, as they normally do, this one really accelerated, and scientists who were listening with their instruments, so to speak, to the shock waves--they describe it propagating like a noisy fire engine traveling northwest.",
        "It would make a higher pitch moving northward toward Russia, a lower pitch to those listening in Australia...",

        "Well, the most remarkable feature was not this 5,000-mile-per-hour, 10-minute initial unzipping of the plate boundary; it was that subsequent slowing down very quickly that surprised them.",
        "And this slow slip left some really interesting real estate behind.",
        "For example, you may have seen pictures of the shorelines that were raised more than four meters in some places while the shorelines in other places just were dipping below the ocean.",
        "And despite the terrific loss of life and property, it was this slowing down that may have actually saved more lives because if the northern slip had not been slowed, geologist Roger Bilham writes in Science, `It might have generated a tsunami along the entire 1,300 kilometer rupture zone,' and this would have caused much more widespread and severe damage on the coastlines of India, Myanmar and Thailand.",

        "This is a candidate who is opposed to the Afghanistan war, who wants to legalize marijuana, who wants to repeal the Patriot Act, so I think he appeals to certain left-of-center voters.",

        "OK.",
        "How about Colorado - a battleground state with a Mountain West libertarian streak and maybe many young Ron Paul supporters?",
        "Because Colorado has a marijuana initiative on the ballot and Governor Johnson has endorsed it and the president has had no comment, I think that he disproportionately probably pulls a few more votes in Colorado from the president.",
