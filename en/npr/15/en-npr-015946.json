        "In 1947 and 1948, President Harry Truman prepared the ground for and then ordered the integration of the armed forces at a time when this was still quite controversial and indeed probably there was more resistance to it than support at the time.",

        "There is much that state and local government can do in providing positive safeguards for civil rights.",

        "In 1957, Dwight Eisenhower who personally had been opposed to or skeptical of the Supreme Court ruling ordering school integration nonetheless directed that federal troops go into Little Rock, Arkansas, to enforce the integration of Little Rock Central High School, which Governor Faubus of Arkansas and local forces were resisting.",

        "Are they fair comparisons to what President Obama said this past week?",
        "They're not perfect comparisons, because as you say, the racial struggle of America is more intrinsic to our entire national drama than other struggles for equality.",
        "And also, President Obama very markedly did not order any change in policy this past week with his comments.",
        "But I think they're similar in a president deciding that there is a change underway in public opinion and he's going to side in favor of a group that at that moment he views as being unfavored and even mistreated.",
        "Jim, in the past, presidents have also expressed regret for not speaking out, for not saying what they felt they should have said at the time."

        "This drops a boulder in the lake because suddenly anybody can sue because they were passed over.",
        "So it totally opens the playing field of sexual harassment to literally include everyone in an office."
