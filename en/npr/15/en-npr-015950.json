        "Well, you know, when we've seen these giant malls, the indoor ski slopes in the desert, I always assumed that there was at least oil money backing those projects.",
        "What happened to the oil money?",
        "Well, Dubai had limited oil and gas of its own, and I think their oil industry pretty much peaked in the early '90s and that was it.",
