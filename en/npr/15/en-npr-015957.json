        "One of the guards that we spoke with who had operated in Iraq for nearly three years had said that his team, his 20-man team, had been involved in probably on average about four or five shooting incidents a week.",
        "That's about five times as much as Blackwater basically disclosed as being the average for the entire company.",
        "And you know, what we're hearing from private security contractors, not only with Blackwater but with other companies, is that the number of shooting incidents is large, but there's very little reporting that actually goes on.",
        "If a team is out in Iraq and they feel that they need to take defensive action, they fire off warning shots or they fire more targeted rounds in an attempt to defend themselves.",
        "Often those incidents are not being reported."

        "And by the terms of the contracts of these firms, aren't they supposed to report every time they discharge a weapon?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, it depends on what the contracts are, but the State Department and the Defense Department, which have a large percentage of the private security contracts in Iraq, both require private security companies to report any weapon discharges whenever they occur on the battlefield.",
        "But what we're hearing is that - U.S.",
        "officials have told us that on the Defense Department side, that out of some three dozen private security companies that they track, only a handful actually report incidents.",
        "And then we're hearing from private security contractors that oftentimes the contractors themselves will simply be reluctant to report for any number of reasons, whether it's they're simply not interested in doing the paperwork, whether they don't want to invite more scrutiny or what-have-you, but that the majority of these incidents are not being reported and most of the companies are not reporting at all.",
        "So essentially what you are saying in your piece in the Post today is the Pentagon really would not have a very good idea of how many times these private security contractors are opening fire because they're not reporting it.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And the people who are in charge of tracking that say that themselves, that the statistics they've compiled to try to track the number of weapons discharges involving private security companies are essentially meaningless because there are so few companies that are reporting.",
        "One of the latest figures that we've seen were for - through May going back 12 months - and there were 207 incidents, weapons discharge incidents for the previous year.",
        "But that only included a handful of companies, and really the Pentagon has no idea what's going on with these other companies.",
