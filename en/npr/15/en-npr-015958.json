        "Is the copyright infringement, I mean - is there, in fact, an analogy to Napster?",
        "I know that some people have written, you know, the analogy is really this is all too good to be true like Napster was, and they're gonna take it away, somehow.",
        "Well, it's a very, you know, it's a very easy analogy, because, like Napster, it's individuals putting the content up onto the network.",
        "There's a very big difference, though, and that's the position of the copyright owners themselves.",
        "Where with Napster, it was very confrontational, and the record labels were immediately on the defensive, and, you know, the record labels were actually trying to outlaw the MP3 format itself, so they were absolutely antagonistic to the technology there.",
        "The difference with YouTube, and actually the online video phenomenon in general, is that the TV broadcasters, the movie studios are actively trying to find a way to exploit this technology, and so you have, you know, eTelevision and MTV have made deals with YouTube to put their content on there and they have them shared.",
        "You have movie studios making deals with YouTube to get their trailers hosted, so it's a completely different perspective and different approach that the content owners are taking, so I think the Napster analogy only goes so far.",
        "And one distinction, as I understand it, YouTube has inserted for almost all users, a 10-minute rule so that you can't just upload the latest episode of Lost or something, I guess in the hopes if you watch it three or four times, you might be able to figure it out.",
        "Right, well, that's interesting.",
        "So it's a 10-minute limit, but that reflects two things.",
        "One, it reflects their attempt to kind of limit copyright infringement, but it also reflects the very different nature of online video, because the audience for television - traditional television, is, you know, 30-minute sitcoms, 60-minute dramas.",
        "That's the classic structure that we're used to.",
        "Online video is a very different beast.",
        "It is short clips.",
        "It's all about - the average clip on YouTube is only three minutes long, and that's the kind of attention span and the appetite that we have when we go online is for these quick, short bursts of entertainment.",
        "And that kind of changes the very nature of what is being produced and what's being put on there.",
        "You know, it almost sounds suspiciously like this is the medium for cell phones, to watch this stuff, when - a short attention span theater."
