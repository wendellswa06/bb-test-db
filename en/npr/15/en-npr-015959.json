        "It's very fast and it's - as I understand it - it's easy to upload, too.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They really nailed the technology model.",
        "They - it's incredibly easy to upload videos, unlike with Google Video, which you have to kind of register and do a kind of several steps to getting your video on there.",
        "It's really fast and easy to get something up onto YouTube.",
        "And it's also incredibly fast to watch stuff on video - watch on YouTube.",
        "You don't have to go through a separate player like Real Media or Windows Media.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "So it's just a really good interface.",
        "It's important to remember, though, that - you know, we talked about the Napster comparison and the shakeout - that YouTube is just part of this much bigger context of online video that's exploding.",
        "I mean, there's iTunes doing video, there's Google Video, there's stuff like Blinks TV.",
        "And, you know, even though Napster was put out of business, file sharing is still alive and well.",
        "It's been kind of made respectable via iTunes.",
        "And I'm sure if - even if YouTube goes away, and I think it's far from sure that it would…",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "…this online video phenomenon is very much going to be the way we watch video from now on.",
        "Mike Miliard, as Tom Goetz was just saying, Napster, in a way, begat iTunes, and that worked out into a pretty reasonable business plan.",
        "Does YouTube have a reasonable business plan of yet?",
        "Well, it is tough to say.",
        "They've certainly got venture capital funding and they've got people interested in what they do, because you can't ignore something like this.",
        "They're having, you know, 40 or 50 million people, 40 or 50 million videos being watched every day by about six million people, and that's a lot of eyeballs.",
        "And that's a lot of - you know, there's a really a good way to leverage this.",
        "Now, how exactly that translates into dollars and cents is another issue, of course.",
        "But it's - a phenomenon like this is just a very, you know, important and interesting thing to consider."

        "Hello, I'm an undergrad at University of Colorado, and me and all my friends use YouTube quite a bit to both see media and share stuff.",
        "For instance, I just got an e-mail from one of my friends this morning sharing a comedian skit.",
        "And it's really been great to help all of us share media and enjoy ourselves.",
        "And it's so much better than Google Video or iTunes video.",
        "For me, at least.",
        "Yeah, Mike Miliard, one of the advantages, as Jessie suggests, is you can take a clip from YouTube, and then put it on, you know, your blog.",
        "Exactly, that was just another stroke of genius on their part in making it such an easy thing to use.",
        "It's easy to watch, it's easy to upload, and it's easy to share.",
        "You can put it on your blog, you can put it on online message boards.",
        "It's - they put the code right there for you to insert it.",
        "And it's easy as pie.",
        "And can you go on the site, in fact, organize your own little net group on YouTube, too?",
        "Yeah, actually, that's something they just recently introduced.",
        "It's kind of like each person has his own channel.",
        "You know, not in the traditional sense, but each person has sort of - is able to have an aggregation of their own content or clips that they've uploaded.",
        "And that's yet another way that the community is formed on the site.",
        "Jessie, I just tried this yesterday for the first time, and I was astounded how easy it was.",
        "Yeah, it's very easy.",
        "I originally found it through Blingbling.net when they were sharing some of the NBC clips that got pulled off.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Since then, me and all my friends have been using it quite a bit.",
        "We may be somewhat geeky, but it's pretty big phenomenon among the college-aged group."

        "Pornography in general?",
        "Yeah, that's all screened.",

        "YouTube actually only has 32 employees, but the users police the site and they flag things that are have nudity, or are in any way objectionable.",

        "Well, again, the site, some 12-year-olds are reasonably responsible, too, but the site is being policed is I think what the answer is.",
        "And I think the challenge isn't so much the content being objectionable or not.",
        "It's really just what to do with all this material.",
