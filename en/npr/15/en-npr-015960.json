        "And I think it's an incredibly curious and interesting phenomenon.",

        "My question is, particularly, where do - where's this going to go in terms of substantive entertainment?",
        "Is it only going to be juvenile stuff, or is there going to be drama, is there going to be something that's moving, or is it all comedy?",
        "In addition, and I'm talking about user-created content, not archival stuff.",
        "Yeah, or Thomas Goetz, if people are carrying those cell phone cameras around, are they going to be taking pictures of news?",
        "Yeah, so it's definitely there's a lowest common denominator thing going on, on YouTube and the other video sites, where, you know, the things that get clicked are the guys who are, well, doing stuff you don't want to say over the radio.",
        "Hmm.",
        "But you have to remember that the real field of this is massive.",
        "And there's really good kind of enterprise video production going on.",
        "There's stuff like Rocket Boom, which is an online news show.",
        "And that's real news done in a very entertaining way.",
        "There are archives, video archives that are putting all of their stuff online, so you can get, you know, archives of World War II documentaries and all sorts of other content.",
        "So, it's…",
        "I'm sorry…",
        "I was just going to say, you have to look for it, but it's out there.",
        "Yeah, but I guess what I'm asking you - we're seeing an evolution of user created content with the ease of use and access to digital cameras and editing, but are we seeing much - I mean, there are other - I haven't seen anything on YouTube, and granted, I haven't looked very hard, but is there stuff with more artistic value than comedy?",
        "Not to demean comedy at all, but is there more user created stuff that's going to be more artistic, more substantive?",
        "Or are we seeing entertainment in general sort of go the low road?",
        "And, I mean, you know, you can only go so far with respect to sort of, you know, playing this game.",
        "Either you're policing this stuff and the copyrighted content comes off, or you're not.",
        "But if play too fast and loose for too long, someone eventually is going to become cross.",
        "They will come and do bad things to you."

        "No, I don't think so.",
        "I mean, you know, absolutely, this is what happens when the means of production get democratized.",

        "That's just the way the world works.",
        "We don't have the filters like TV networks and whatnot mandating production values, etc. But, you know, check out machinima.com, it's m-a-c-h-i-n-i-m-a.",
        "Machinima is an evolving art form that's basically film using video game engines.",
        "And it's kind of hard to explain, but basically they're people taking video games, hacking them into little short films, and it's an incredibly vibrant and rich art form that's emerging.",

        "As we touched on earlier, there's still some questions about how and if sites like YouTube are going to make money.",

        "One of the perversities of doing media over the web, of streaming all of these little mini-video snippets, is that unlike television - where every incremental viewer doesn't cost you any more money - every incremental viewer who watches a video snippet over YouTube actually does cost you money, because it requires bandwidth.",
        "So, the strange thing in YouTube's business that makes it a very difficult business in many ways to figure out exactly how you're going to pay for this stuff is bandwidth cost, you know.",
        "Streaming all those bits out to all those people watching people whack themselves on the side of the head with a board, or whatever they're doing, is expensive.",
        "You know, estimates vary, but, you know, certainly a million dollars a month wouldn't be far off what it's likely costing YouTube today to stream something on the order of 200 terabytes a day of traffic, where the Library of Congress, I think, is something like 20 terabytes.",

        "And I logged on yesterday, did not see any ads.",
        "There is a striking absence of ads, for a bunch of different reasons, you know.",
        "And they have, in part, to do with YouTube trying very hard to get enough people on the site to begin with, and not having ads get in the way of that experience.",
        "But then there's a deeper problem, which is as an advertiser, how much control would you like to have over where your ad runs and how fine grained it runs?",
        "Do you want it to run in advance of a video of, you know, some skateboarder falling on his head?",
        "Or would you want to have, you know, much more careful control where it only runs before ads where skateboarders don't fall on their heads?",
        "And so, as soon as you start introducing this idea that you have to have much more control over where an ad runs, the whole business of running YouTube gets, you know, much more complicated and more expensive.",
        "So, where in principal, ads might sound like a wonderful idea, in practice - from an advertiser's point of view - this is fraught with all sorts of problems.",
        "Not least of which is also the copyright issue, where you obviously don't want your ads running in front of an SNL skit that actually isn't YouTube's at all.",
        "We're talking about video on the Web in general, and YouTube in particular.",
        "That's y-o-u-t-u-b-e.",
        "And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "So far, there have been venture capitalists willing to pay the money to not only found YouTube, but to make it grow so phenomenally fast."

        "Yeah, there are some folks at a group in the Bay Area called Sequoia Capital - who are a well-known venture firm - who've put in, over the course of two financing rounds, a little over 11 million dollars into the company.",
        "Which is, you know, in so-called Web 2.0 terms or technology terms these days, is still a pretty darn hefty investment.",
        "But the flip side of this, of course, is that when you're spending a million dollars a month on bandwidth, and there's not a lot of money coming in the door in other form, you can also spend 11 and a half million dollars pretty fast.",
        "So, you know, it's kind of like watching, you know, a fairly entertaining, but possibly very exciting car crash as you sort of race to the wall ever faster burning cash very quickly, and watching as the bank balance goes down.",
        "So, you know, working out the calculus of getting paid - which almost certainly has to be advertising, which is fraught with all the difficulties I've described - is the whole story here.",
        "And I want to bring Thomas Goetz into this as well, but let me ask you, Paul Kedrosky.",

        "That's a gigantic and titanic gamble, and it led to a lot of silly behavior in the late 1990s.",
        "So it's a little bit regrettable we're seeing some of that again.",

        "Yeah, well it's very much - I mean, you know, to talk of a bubble this time around.",

        "There's almost no IPO's going out the door right now.",
        "And so it's a lot of venture capitalists, and people like Paul who have an inside kind of perspective can see the machinations going on and see whether these companies are going to live or die."
