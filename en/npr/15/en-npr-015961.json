        "But after some time, it's released to the general public so that people can make generic drugs.",
        "So, similarly, why can't we work on something on these lines so that these TV shows can legally be posted on these kinds of Web sites and everyone can share it?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Thomas Goetz, surely, nobody's making any money anymore on the Dean Martin Show.",
        "Well, that's a good point, but you also have all of these content owners who are trying to exploit their backlists, their back catalogs.",
        "And, you know, the analogy between patents and copyrights is kind of complicated.",
        "But copyrights do have a window that expires.",
        "Unfortunately, it's something like the lifetime of the creator plus 50 years, so it's pretty moot.",
        "But having some mechanism to, you know, create a more free library is people like Creative Commons are working on that everyday.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "And let me ask you, Paul Kedrosky.",
        "Are people worried about this copyright issue?",
        "Well, do you mean in terms of whether or not the contents stored at YouTube violates copyright?",
        "From that standpoint, for sure.",

        "Although these things have a tendency to last longer than any of us think.",

        "Hmm.",

        "Yeah.",

        "Well, one of the founding precepts of Wired has always been information wants to be free.",
        "And that doesn't mean that nobody has rights to exploit their creations, but rather that digital technologies have made it very possible for all of us to take advantage of other people's creations and have made the actual creations far more powerful in that loop.",
        "So something like, you know - again I'll point you to Creative Comments, which is an organization which is trying to negotiate copyright for the 21st Century, where, you know, in the face of digital technologies, in the face of people being able to share things so easily, how can we reach a new middle ground that doesn't presuppose that everything needs to be locked down; which is actually an impossibility these days.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Paul Kedrosky?",
        "I'm kind of with the caller in that I think there is a culture -I don't want to say necessarily a culture of criminality - but I think too many people are too coy about this issue, and they end up falling back on this defense and saying whatever technology makes possible must be okay.",
        "Or at least we need to sort of respond as if technology is the driving interest here.",
        "And there are many, many copyright owners who have a legitimate interest in not having their content - and even that word is too euphemistic - having their product, having their creation, be spreads freely.",
        "And they should, you know, expect legitimately that YouTube and others would take an active interest in helping police it.",
        "And to this day, that's going on, but it's at nowhere near the level that you might expect as someone whose property is being spread around so freely.",
        "But I have to say that something like Saturday Night Live, you know, nobody that that show was - many people who would consider it on a downward trend until Lazy Sunday made it cool again.",
        "And YouTube made that property, if you will, far more - worth much more, and it made it cool to watch Saturday Night Live; it made it hip.",
        "And I think, you know, you can't just say that locking it up is effective.",
        "I think it's a dangerous metaphor, though.",
        "I think you're right, it helped make that SNL a little more hip again, but it's a little bit like saying, you know, I - you had something in your closet that no one was seeing in your house and I broke into your house and took it out; and now everyone's excited because they think you're cool and hip again.",
        "It doesn't apologize for the initial act, which was, in its nature, criminal.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Well, not if the NBC Marketing Department was the one putting it on there."
