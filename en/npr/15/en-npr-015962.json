        "So the progression here has been that - we are now reporting that a portion of this board learned about an allegation of forced oral sex that was being investigated by the LAPD in January of this year and continued to let Mr. Moonves run the company, didn't take substantive action.",
        "Then in response to this first New Yorker story I wrote several weeks ago, as you said, they also did not take any substantive action.",
        "They did appoint independent law firms to investigate the matter, but they didn't suspend Mr. Moonves at the time.",
        "And then finally there were rumors in the past week, shortly after we began to reach out for comment to CBS, that what they were going to do in response to all of this was negotiate a graceful exit with a compensation package for Mr. Moonves of up to $100 million.",
        "And this was incredibly galling and frustrating for a lot of these women.",
        "OK.",
        "So you just mentioned a complaint to the Los Angeles Police Department.",
        "That is one of the more serious allegations here.",

        "It's six additional women all on the record.",
        "They are more serious, as you pointed out.",
        "And this particular woman, Phyllis Golden-Gottlieb, who's a veteran television executive who worked with Mr. Moonves, says that he forced her to perform oral sex on him.",
        "It's a disturbing story.",
        "It's very violent.",
        "That in a subsequent incident, he exposed himself to her.",
        "And that when she rebuffed him, he, the next day, violently threw her against a wall injuring her.",
        "And then after that, he retaliated against her, moving her into ever-smaller offices at their production company and, in her view, destroying her career.",
        "And you say that - you report that she reported this many years later, in recent months, to the Los Angeles Police Department, that they investigated, that they couldn't file charges because the statute of limitations had expired, but that they found them to be credible allegations.",
        "Now in the face of all that, Les Moonves has resigned.",
        "Do you see any sign of an effort at a cultural change at the company, though?",
        "I think we'll have to wait and see.",
        "You know, one thing that changed radically in the wake of these additional women coming forward is there's no longer this discussion about a $100 million golden parachute.",
        "Mr. Moonves will now depart in the face of the outrage of these women with no compensation package as of now, pending the results of that investigation.",
        "They will give $20 million to Me Too organizations.",
        "And six members of the board of this company will be replaced.",
        "Whether that will change the culture there we'll have to see.",
        "A lot of these women are waiting for that answer."
