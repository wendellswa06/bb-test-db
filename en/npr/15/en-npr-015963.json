        "I wonder what your thinking is on that subject.",
        "Well, I think there's no question that Chairman Bernanke is concerned about exactly what you just described, and that is that we're watching the costs of our commodities rise, and we're watching inflation go up.",
        "And the Feds' battle for the last 30 years, self-consciously, has been to attack inflation and to try to keep it from getting out of control.",

        "We've lived through almost unprecedented, really since the 1950s, low inflation.",
