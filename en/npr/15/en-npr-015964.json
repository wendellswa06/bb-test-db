        "Spiderman and these other movies have been done by outside production studios, and Marvel is just getting a little piece of it.",
        "But they're now making a strategic move to start producing these movies themselves, taking on the full benefit of the wins and the full downside and costs of any failures.",
        "And that's a kind of a radical move.",
        "I think it's the right move, but it adds an element of risk.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Well, I guess I'd say welcome to the club Boston Globe, and I - certainly our local paper, as you know, Neal, the Washington Post, continues to put in tables.",
        "But I think that it's an inevitable by-product of having a medium that has grown in terms of its power and its influence - that would be the Internet - which is able electronically to do, with far more breadth and dynamism and I would say near-term updating, quote our stocks for us.",
        "So I think that, I think the Boston Globe has made a business decision that it can make better use of that space or just not add additional paper in.",
        "And I would say that the Washington Post will make that decision one day as well.",
        "We'll predict, we'll try to beak some news today on this show, Neal, and say that's going to happen, too.",
        "Because I think it just makes sense.",
        "In the end, the medium is the message.",
        "We, each of us - whether its radio or whether its newspapers - we try to make the best use of our space or our audiences' time, and I just don't think that stock tables makes really good use of a Boston Globe subscriber reader's time.",
        "And I think that they're recognizing that.",
        "Just think of all the fish that are going to go unwrapped from now on.",
        "Anyway, let's see if we can get another caller on the line.",
        "This is Mark(ph).",
        "Mark's calling us from Kansas City.",
        "Yes.",
        "I'm a quantitative analyst of the stock market.",
        "And my question for you is, with the dividend yield of less than 2 percent on the stocks on the DOW and the S&P 500, and the interest rate to where you could put your money into money markets and make more, and with historic high-valuations and Pes - multiples where they are - I would just kind of wondering why you're so sanguine about, you know, a 5 or 10 percent correction.",
        "When the market, you know, does go up and go down, why would you say that it's not to be paid attention to?",
        "That's all.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "Thanks for the call, Mark.",
        "Yeah, well, let me say, I don't think that - I'm not advising anyone not to pay attention to it.",
        "I certainly have paid attention to it and enjoy doing that on a daily basis, probably far more than most people should spend their time doing.",
        "I think that quantitative analysis is a useful thing to do, and I think its great that you're a specialist in that.",
        "From my standpoint, the stock market's low dividend yield kind of - not historically low, but in general terms, lower than a lot of the rest of history - means that, well, you have to look at the dividend yield as sort of the interest rate you're getting paid for owning stock.",
        "So that means just for owning stock, Neal, you and I are getting 2 percent paid back to us each year.",
        "And if our stock rises, that's, of course, additional benefits.",
        "You have to look at that number in the context of interest rates overall.",
        "And the actual relationship between the dividend yield today on the stock market of 2 percent and interest rates of about 5 percent does not make me worried that the stock market is too high, or that dividend yield is too low.",
        "There've been periods in history, certainly, when interest rates were way, way ahead of the stock market's dividend yield.",
        "And that might be where you want to be a little bit more worried.",
        "So you have to, we have to view those things as competitive with each other.",
        "And that's the way I've viewed them.",
        "So I don't find the market either particularly over or under valued.",
        "I will also say that I'm not a market timer.",
        "A lot of quantitative analysts do, and if they can do that consistently, more power to them.",
        "A lot of people have, smarter than I, have concluded that it's hard to time the market consistently and be right.",
        "I respect that work, and I generally spend more of my time thinking about individual stocks and companies rather than the stock market itself.",
        "And on that front, let me ask you briefly about I think you've got your eye on the Roomba."
