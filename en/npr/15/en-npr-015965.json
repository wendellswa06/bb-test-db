        "This was a time when Mussolini was in power in Italy, Hitler in Nazi Germany, Stalin in Russia, and there was the sense that democracy might have come to its end.",
        "Dallek wrote a biography of the American president inaugurated in those times, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.",
        "It was the lowest moment of the Great Depression.",

        "Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment.",
        "And yet, we are stricken by no plague of locusts.",
        "That was the speech in which FDR said the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.",
        "Dallek's biography never mentions the present day yet invites comparisons.",
        "Roosevelt took over without any real idea of how to end the Depression.",
        "He openly said he would just have to improvise until something worked.",
        "But there was one big thing he did know.",
        "What Roosevelt understood was that he needed to bring the country together, and that it was essential to maintain democracy.",
        "He faced a country that had been bitterly divided during the 1920s between the modernists and the fundamentalists."

        "But when we looked at what happened over time, among those who were drinking the low-fat milk, even those who started normal weight were more likely to become overweight than those who were drinking higher-fat milk.",
