        "It suggested that, indeed, Saddam was finished, and he at least was, but it also suggested that the war was effectively over, and it suggested that the Iraqi people were welcoming the arrival of Americans with the enthusiasm that some had predicted.",
        "I must tell you, Neal, when we first crossed the border, I remember the commander of the 3rd Infantry Division telling me, you know, tomorrow morning, Ted, we've gotten word from our CIA contacts in Nasiriyah, and we're going to be crossing a bridge into Nasiriyah and they're going to have marching bands waiting for us, and the mayor is going to be there with flowers.",
