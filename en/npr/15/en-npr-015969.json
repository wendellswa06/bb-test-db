        "And Ted Koppel, it's there is no way to believe that - I think the number as of today, provided by the Pentagon, 4,415 Americans killed, that that's going to be the final number.",
        "I don't think it's going to be the final number, and also, Neal, 32,000 wounded, many, many tens of thousands who have suffered brain damage, concussions, and when you said tens of thousands of Iraqis killed, I think the accurate number is probably more in the hundreds of thousands, if not over a million Iraqis killed.",
        "One point I do want to make that I think compliments what Colonel Nagl was just saying, and that is there is no question that getting rid of Saddam Hussein in terms of his standing as a human being was for the good of all mankind.",
        "But remember, for many, many years the United States covertly assisted Saddam Hussein because he was seen as a counterbalance, and an Iraq led by Saddam Hussein was seen as an adequate counterbalance to the Iranians.",

        "That's certainly true.",
        "The Marines really no longer in Iraq in a substantial way, but there's a very substantial Marine presence now in Afghanistan.",
        "So both the Army and the Marines are very much feeling the strain of almost a decade now of continuous war, and I'm afraid many more years in front of them.",

        "We were there for the surge.",
        "I'll always remember this day because it's actually the fourth birthday of my daughter, who was born while I was deployed.",
        "But I just wanted to say, you know, it's a bittersweet day, having served there, because it's obviously exciting that we're getting our combat troops out, but the reason it's a little bit difficult is that I don't feel like our end state or the goal of the mission to know when we were finished was ever well-articulated by our leaders.",
        "So though I think clearly pulling out combat troops was part of our plan and part of what success looks like, I just never felt that that end state was well-articulated.",
        "So it's hard to differentiate between success and just kind of stopping.",
        "John Nagl, you know a lot more about counterinsurgency than anyone else on this program.",

        "What success looks like in these kind of wars is a country that in the end is able to defend itself against internal threats, ultimately against external threats, probably with continued American assistance for a number of years, and a country that promotes stability in the region rather than instability.",
        "And we do, we've paid a very high price to achieve that in Iraq, and I'm afraid we're going to be paying the tolls for a number of years.",

        "The surge has allowed us to disrupt his butt.",
