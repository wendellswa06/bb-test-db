        "Creating an air force is not just as simple as looking in the catalog and saying I'll take five of these and six of those.",
        "It takes a long time to train the pilots, the support staff, the maintenance crews and a long time to create an air force that is actually capable of being both defensive and, if necessarily, offensive.",
        "Again, I don't want to take the shine of the celebration, but I think the emphasis really needs to be on Americans coming to realize that in one form or another - and the number of civilians, civilian contractors, who will be taking over some of the jobs that were previously done by military men and women that number is going to go up.",
        "We are going to have tens of thousands of Americans in Iraq for years to come.",

        "And I think, for me, as I left there - my last rotation was in the summer of 2008 - and my biggest concern is after the surge, we started reconciling ourselves with a lot of insurgent groups, and a lot of these insurgent groups had consolidated power bases regionally.",
        "And the biggest concern I think is the inability for the government to actually assimilate them into leadership roles due to religious differences and personnel - you know, personal differences, even regional differences in Iraq.",
        "And until that happens, I don't think the possibility for another internal struggle within Iraq is completely out of the question.",
        "Let me ask Colonel Nagl.",
        "If the Sunni tribes in Anbar are not integrated somehow back within - given some reward for what they did in the uprising, is there going to be another conflict?",
        "The decision by the Sunni tribes to join what became known as the awakening, or the sahwa in Arabic, to stop fighting against the United States and ally with the United States against al-Qaida and the most violent of the insurgents was absolutely a turning point in the war.",
        "That started in 2006, continued through 2007.",
        "And when I was there visiting Iraq in 2008, there was a lot of concern about whether the Shia majority were in fact going to bring the Sons of Iraq onboard, give them jobs in the security forces with the Iraqi police.",
        "Some of that has happened, not as much has happened as we would like it to fully develop.",
        "But the fundamental dynamic of the conflict has changed.",
        "Ultimately, for Iraq to be - have any chance of being at peace, the Shia had to understand that they had won, and the Sunnis, who had been in power but were a minority, had to understand that they had lost the war.",
        "And ultimately, I think that has happened."

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And so Iraq is going to remain a contentious place, but the fundamental split between the Sunni and Shia that drove the insurgency and almost the civil war that it became in 2006, I think, that has fundamentally changed.",

        "The reason why I picked up on the witness intimidation issue is because so many cases are not going to trial, not only in Baltimore but throughout the entire country, because folks are committing crimes and then threatening people and telling them that if they are to testify in a trial that they're going to do them harm.",
        "And in many instances, that's exactly what they're doing.",
