        "The reason for this database is to make sure that contributions that are coming in to a candidate are on the up and up.",

        "Oh, I don't believe that.",

        "And as you watch this DVD, it becomes clear that it's being aimed at some person--you don't--you can't really tell, but because the people who hang out in these groups and gangs--they know all the language--it's clear that it is aimed at some particular folks.",

        "And the interesting thing to bear out what I said about the realness of it, already three people that appeared in the video have been arrested for some very, very serious charges that really had nothing too much to do with the video itself.",
        "In other words, they didn't get arrested because they appeared in the DVD, but because of their drug activity in general in the community, then that has the result of getting them arrested and being charged with crimes.",

        "That is correct.",

        "What do you hope that this act, the Witness Security and Protection Act, will do?",
        "Well, what the act would do is bring some $90 million to state and local governments to help them carry out witness protection programs.",
        "Basically, what you have now is you have a federal program--but let me tell you, most of us the trials that we have that involve witness intimidation are not on the federal level; they're on the state level, and most states don't have money to even protect witnesses.",
        "Now keep in mind, we are providing all kinds of new police organizations in Afghanistan and Iraq and other places around the world, but when it comes to protecting our own witnesses here in this country, we do very little on the state level.",
        "So what it would do is allow for $90 million to be allocated to the states and--so that they can then protect their witnesses.",
        "And it would be patterned, in large part, after the the United States Marshal Service program, which after 30 years have--their witness protection program has never lost one witness over 30 years, which is astounding.",
        "We just don't have that level of protection in our states.",
        "As a matter of fact, just in Baltimore in the last six or seven months, we've lost seven people already to violence involving witness intimidation, and they--in other words, they're dead.",
        "Congressman, let me take you, before we lose our time here, to a couple of other issues on the peripheral, and that's what's being dealt with and talked about there on Capitol Hill, and that's the whole question of the filibuster, in particular with the situation of the nominated judges.",

        "Are we going to see some horse trading here?",
        "What's your thought?",

        "I just think that the Republicans have gone far too far in this effort to have right-wing judges appointed to the bench.",
        "Nobody ever said that when you give advice and consent, which is what the Senate has to do, that every single person is going to be confirmed.",
        "Basically, what the president is saying is that `If I nominate somebody and we're in the majority'--and because these votes are done on party lines, as you well know, he's saying automatically, `My people should be judges.",
        "Well, that's not what the Constitution says.",
        "It says `the advice and consent of the Senate.",
        "And some would argue that this is advice and consent.",
        "Well, the fact is that if you're not the party in control, then you're powerless to do anything about it, and I just don't think that's the way the Founding Fathers meant for it to be.",
        "When it comes to people who have been disadvantaged and left out of the system, and many of whom are minorities, what happens is that the courts are their last resort, in many instances, to get any kind of justice.",
        "And if you have judges that are already bent on--have a huge conservative bent to their decisions, that's a real problem.",
        "So there becomes no backstop for them.",
        "There's nowhere for them to go to receive justice, in my mind.",
        "And I'm a lawyer.",
        "I've practiced for over 20 years, and I can tell you that I just think trying to get rid of the filibuster with regard to judges is a major, major mistake and would be a tremendous setback to our justice system."

        "And until just a few days ago, he served as president of a conservative group that funded campaigns against Republican senators, including the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and several key Republicans - right - who have all signaled now that they would oppose Cuccinelli if he were nominated to lead USCIS.",
        "So Cuccinelli took over on Monday as acting director, but the White House has not formally nominated him, and it's not really clear if they will."
