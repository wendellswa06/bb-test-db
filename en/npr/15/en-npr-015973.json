        "As NPR's Joel Rose reports, the students at Columbia University have filed federal complaints in an effort to force changes at the school.",
        "The three complaints were filed by 23 students at Columbia and its affiliated Barnard College in New York.",
        "Among the charges, they say that students are pressured not to report incidents of sexual assault or harassment, that those who do report assaults are often told they must not discuss their cases outside of the campus disciplinary process and that the alleged perpetrators are frequently allowed to remain on campus and even in classes with their accusers.",
        "It sets up a situation in which the university is actively contributing to the ongoing perpetration of sexual violence on campus, and it's awful.",

        "In February, Columbia's president pledged to change the way the school reports data about assaults on campus, but that was not enough to satisfy Columbia senior Marybeth Seitz-Brown, who also signed on to one of the complaints.",

        "The complaints were filed with the Department of Education, which will decide whether to investigate.",
        "A spokesman for Columbia declined to comment, but in a statement he said reforms at the school will continue.",
        "Columbia is just the latest among dozens of schools that are facing charges for allegedly mishandling sexual assaults under Title IX and the Cleary Act.",
        "That's in part because of a change in the way the laws are enforced, but it's also because students from different schools are building networks to teach each other how to file complaints and to support each other.",
