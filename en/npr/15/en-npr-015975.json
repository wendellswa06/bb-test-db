        "NPR's Dina Temple-Raston has been following this story, and she's here now.",
        "Dina, scientists and legal experts, they're saying that the evidence against Ivins is really far from foolproof, that there is no smoking gun.",
        "What are they concerned about?",
        "Well, a lot of the scientists who have looked at this say that they couldn't - that the FBI couldn't possibly have ruled out everyone who might have matched the anthrax vial or had access to the anthrax vial that they matched to Ivins.",
        "And this is basically, without getting too much into the science, this is because anthrax, all you have to do is grow more.",
        "So if you had some anthrax, conceivably, from this vial that they linked to Ivins, you could have grown your own source of more of that.",
        "They also can't place him in Princeton, which is where the letters were mailed from, and he has this very distinctive, cramped handwriting that they couldn't match the handwriting on the envelopes.",
        "The FBI said it was similar, but there was nothing conclusive there.",
        "And there's this broader feeling that he couldn't have possibly accomplished all of this on his own.",
        "The plan was too elaborate and too technical for one person to do by themselves.",
        "So what does the FBI say to all those questions?",
        "Well, the FBI said, when it came to the anthrax, they actually used just old-fashioned gumshoe investigations to narrow it down to Ivins.",
        "They said they interviewed hundreds of people to account for the anthrax, asking questions like how much did you use, what did you use it for, what did you do with what was left, that sort of thing.",
        "Ivins was basically the gatekeeper on this vial of anthrax and was really meticulous about who had different pieces of it.",
        "And basically, they ruled out everyone, and that's how they got to Ivins.",
        "Human Rights Watch says this case is one of a string of prosecutions aimed at suppressing freedom of speech.",

        "Bryce actually developed PTSD - he's stationed in Germany, and on New Year's Eve after his first tour when he heard the fireworks going off, the shoot-shoot-shoot, it reminded him of incoming mortars and he started with PTSD.",
        "His personality changed.",
        "He had trouble remembering things.",
        "He started having trouble controlling his anger, and it changed him so much that his wife talked about divorce because he was no longer the man she married.",
        "And then because she was considering - you know, they were considering getting a divorce, and he went into depression and then later started contemplating suicide.",
        "So it was extremely debilitating to where - all this was happening in 2005 - and in August 2005, he had a mental breakdown in Germany and was airlifted to Walter Reed in Washington, D.C.",
        "and put under suicide watch in the psychiatric ward.",
        "And he ended up being in Walter Reed in the psychiatric ward for about a month.",
        "My wife and I, Judy(ph), were lucky enough that we live about 100 miles south of Washington, so we were able to see Bryce about four times during his hospitalization there.",
        "And I wonder, Larry Sieverson, what is scarier - a son on suicide watch in Walter Reed or a son on patrol in Fallujah?"

        "How about a son that has problems with suicide and is on patrols in Ramadi?",
        "After Bryce left Walter Reed in September 2005 - he was supposed to get out in November 2005 - he was subject to a stop-loss and could not get out, and his obligation to the Army was moved back to February 2007 to allow for deployment to Iraq.",

        "But while she worked for a bank it just built up inside her to where she ended up being hospitalized for stress-related intestinal problems and missed four weeks of work.",
        "And then she had a breakdown at work another time, crying uncontrollable, went home for three weeks.",
        "So in just that one year she missed seven weeks of work completely related to the early part of the war.",
        "And I should say that during that time period, Brandon(ph) was in Tikrit on a Abrams tank, and Bryce was in Baghdad on a Bradley fighting vehicle.",
        "So during that time period we had two sons as ground troops in Iraq.",

        "Yes.",
        "At the beginning of invasion there wasn't much communication.",
        "It was a few letters coming in.",
        "But once things got kind of established, we would receive e-mails.",
        "And I have to admit they were a godsend because when you received an e-mail, it was instantaneous and you knew at that one moment in time that your loved one was safe.",
        "It - I can't stress how - what a relief it was when you would receive that e-mail.",
