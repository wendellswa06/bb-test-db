        "for drug trafficking charges?",
        "Most likely he will be extradited to the United States.",
        "That has been the strategy of the Calderon administration with these very high-profile figures.",
        "They actually dont want them inside the Mexican prison system for fear that they will corrupt the system around them and eventually break out or continue to run the organizations from inside the penal system here in Mexico.",
        "So its most likely that the Calderon administration will try to just extradite him to the United States, face the charges that hes facing in the United States, and have him completely out of their hair.",

        "Because it's the principle emphasis of their fundraising throughout the rest of the summer.",
        "In fact, when it comes to those maxed out $75,800 donors, the Romney Committee reports 51 of them, the Obama Committee just 17.",
        "Unlike the donors to superPACs or politically active social welfare organizations, these donors are giving directly to the candidate's campaign committee and to the party strategists working with them.",
        "There is one curiosity about Romney Victory, Inc. The amount of cash on hand.",
        "The joint fundraising committees usually service pass-throughs, shoveling the money out to the candidates and the party operatives as fast as possible.",
        "They keep just enough for upcoming expenses.",
        "So, for example, last month, the Obama Victory Fund reported cash on hand of $4.5 million.",
        "Romney Victory, Inc. says it has more than 12 times that much, $58 million.",
        "Again, Tony Corrado.",
        "That really is an anomaly, that big cash buildup that's going on here.",
