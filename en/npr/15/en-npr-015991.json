        "And it's not easy.",
        "Meaning you might not get them to agree with you but you want to push them to the point were they have to level with you about something?",

        "That gave you the possibility of putting a wide-angle lens up that high without any distortion in getting the entire ring, the symmetry of the ring and the press rows around it, unlike the Ali-Liston picture which was a lot of luck.",

        "Yeah, but that's a lot of shots, but I also had a recycled time on my strobe lights.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It lit the ring of probably eight, maybe nine seconds.",
        "So you really couldn't shoot more than one shot on a knockdown anyway.",

        "Well, yeah, but you could still have the choice.",
        "This was lit with strobe lights that even with wonderful quality you get with digital cameras, you can blow my picture up 50 feet squared if you chose to, and the quality is fabulous.",
        "If I were doing that picture today, it is very unlikely I would use strobes.",
        "I would - the digital quality is so good.",
