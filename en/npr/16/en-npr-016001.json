        "I can land at a restaurant in the - at the corner of their parking lot.",

        "Can't do that with an airplane.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I'm also an airplane pilot, but I find the helicopter much more fun.",
        "Mike, have you flown a helicopter?",
        "Yeah, but I've never flown so that one's a piston-engine helicopter and you've got to throttle on the collective.",
        "I've flown lots of turbine-powered helicopters where you don't have to worry about the -they have a gas generator that makes the power.",
        "But, yes, it - I've got - I guess time in maybe 12 different kinds of helicopters.",
        "My gosh.",
        "Is there a kind of plane that you have not flown in yet that you would like to?",
        "Well, I'm working on it, if I could find one.",
        "And when I fly helicopters or fly these airplanes - I don't have a helicopter license, but when I was, like, an instructor at the U.S.",
        "Navy Test Pilot School, we were encouraged to go fly all the airplanes that the school had.",
        "So I flew, like, a Cobra from the front seat, flew an H-57, flew an H-60, flew an H-47, H-46 in there, as a co-pilot.",
        "So, you know, I'm not a type-rated helicopter pilot.",
        "And then when I got the opportunity to teach at the British Test Pilot School, I got to fly their helicopters too, under the same reasoning."

        "Oh, it's just - it's a dream come true to go there.",
        "We had 12 different kinds of fixed-wing airplanes and only four instructors.",

        "The first year we had a British Electric Lightning.",
        "That was the over-under engine combination airplane.",
        "And the second year I was there, we traded that airplane for a air defense version Tornado.",
        "So I got a day in my logbook over there -well, I actually have a day in my logbook where I flew a Chipmunk in the morning and a Tornado in the afternoon.",

        "Hi.",

        "And I would encourage all your listeners to somehow ride with a pilot over their local area, and you'll see things on the ground and patterns that you just can't see any other way.",
        "I was trying to take pictures from a biplane the other day, and that bottom wing gets in your way.",

        "A guy came along and offered it off my hands, but I've got my eyes set on a Hatz biplane.",

        "It has a regular kind of, like, Continental or Lycoming engine up in the front.",

        "So the extremely cold temperatures that much of the U.S., especially eastern part of the country, has been experiencing over the past 10 days was one of the key ingredients for this storm.",
        "These cold temperatures were caused by really cold air, what scientists call jet streams, coming down from up north into most of the country.",
        "And when that air moved further south and met warm, moist air over the Atlantic, it caused a dramatic drop in air pressure, which is what scientists called a bomb cyclone.",
        "OK, so this cold air that my mom felt in Indiana, single digits, or in upstate New York or here in Washington D.C.",
        "where it was in the teens, that is one of the ingredients of this bomb cyclone.",
        "One of the key ingredients, yeah.",
        "Hits some warmer air coming up from the Caribbean or wherever.",
        "And what is a bomb cyclone as opposed to any other storm?",
        "Well, that's just a scientific term that describes this kind of cyclone that's formed by these two masses of warm and cold air.",
        "When they collide, it causes a very, very rapid drop in air pressure, and that's what they call bomb or bombogenesis.",
        "It's just a fancy term to describe this dramatic drop in air pressure in a very powerful storm that is going to intensify as it moves north on the - along the East Coast.",
        "What kind of effects could we see?"

        "There could be power outages.",
        "And people should be thinking about where they could stay warm if they lose power.",
        "So what's the epilogue, then, to this bomb cyclone?",
        "Well, this storm is going to subside by tomorrow.",
        "But what it's going to do is it's going to pull in more of that cold, frigid Arctic air over most of the country.",
        "So both on the East Coast, the Northeast and big chunks of the middle of the United States, the Great Lakes region, are going to see very, very frigid temperatures.",
        "Wait a minute.",
        "This super low pressure area, is it kind of like a black hole?",
        "It's going to suck air in its direction.",
