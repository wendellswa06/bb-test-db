        "And he wondered whether the same area would respond when we use textures like smooth or rough as metaphors.",
        "So we ran this experiment where we had people listen to textural metaphors, like he had a rough day, and contrasted the activity with sentences more or less matched for meaning, but without a textural metaphor, like he had a bad day.",
        "Sathian says the results suggest that in the brain, at least, a rough day has something in common with a sheet of sandpaper.",
        "When listening to these sentences containing textural metaphors, we found activity in the part of the brain that's involved when we feel surfaces.",
        "Sathian says research like this adds to the evidence that the human brain is not processing language in some special module.",
        "The brain is really working as a very highly distributed system.",
        "So it's really very hard to think about any experience that we have in a highly modular fashion, in the sense that it's being processed only in one region of the brain, and not in others."
