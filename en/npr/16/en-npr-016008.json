        "And Phil is with us from Berkley in California.",
        "Hi.",
        "Thanks for doing this program on this important topic.",
        "My question is, what kind of progress is being made against the people who abscond these young women, and basically put them in this slavery situation?",
        "I've seen reports about it before.",
        "I think I saw an excellent program on PBS about it.",
        "But as a father, it kind of drives me nuts to think that someone that you love could be disappeared on you this way and put in this impossible situation.",
        "I salute the lady for the important work she's doing.",
        "But what's actually being done, you know, about the criminals who instigate this?",
        "Now, Bill Finnegan, you write a lot about that in your article.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think it's a really difficult problem to stamp out.",
        "You know, it's a huge criminal business now, considered to be the third largest internationally, after weapons and narcotics.",
        "And the United States has been quite aggressive, sort of made itself the world's policemen on the subject, and rates other countries every year according to how much they're doing to fight trafficking.",
        "It's difficult to measure.",
        "It's difficult to say how many people are trafficked.",
        "And there's internal trafficking, and there's tremendous domestic trafficking in India, for instance.",
        "And then there's transnational trade into this country as well.",
        "But the figures, even for trafficking into the United States, the estimates have gyrated a lot over the years and nobody's really sure.",
        "I wouldn't say that it's booming in the way that some reports have had it, kind of alarmist, lurid stuff, very much focusing on the sex trade.",
        "I mean, there's also a tremendous amount of labor trafficking.",
        "And it's strongest, obviously, from poor countries into richer countries where there's the demand for labor, and where people want to migrate, and for economic reasons.",
        "And very often get tricked into either the commercial sex trade, or some other form of extreme exploitation.",
        "But according to your article, Bill, the people who abduct these young women, or lure them, and then sell them off, well, they're rarely prosecuted, and when they are, it seems they get a slap on the wrist."

        "Yeah.",
        "It's - well, I looked closely at Moldova, and at Dubai, and in Moldova, there's a fair amount of action in the court.",
        "But it's not very satisfying, from the point of view of anti-traffickers.",
        "I mean, it tends to be the smallest fish, the people at the very bottom of the recruiting chain, not the managers or the mobsters who are running the business, who are prosecuted.",
        "And then are not very seriously prosecuted.",
        "And Dubai was a tremendous prostitution business, a certain amount of it depending on trafficking, and a strong anti-trafficking law, passed largely at the behest of the United States, but virtually no prosecution for traffickers.",

        "And Stella Rotaru, let me ask you, is there ever a case where you've seen where the girls, or the young women, turn on their captures?",
        "At least successfully?",
        "There are cases when women agree to testify against the traffickers.",
        "But usually the court procedures would take a lot of time.",
        "And every court session would be a new trauma for the beneficiary because she would have to see and to face the recruiter or the pimp.",
        "So continuous psychological is needed - psychological assistance is needed in this regard.",
        "And we have had cases when the persons involved in the trafficking would be arrested, not all together, but one by one.",
        "And then it would be several court sessions, and she would have to tell her story again and again, and several judges.",
        "So it's very traumatizing, and the traffickers have very good schemes.",
        "Usually when they're arrested they don't have money in their accounts.",
        "So there is not a good compensation system in place.",
        "So compensation is practically impossible.",
        "And Bill Finnegan, you tell in your article the story of one trafficker who was - an abductor who was convicted, and then the judge said, well, he's got young children.",
        "he can't serve time in prison.",
        "And then you tell this story of another higher-up in an organization who was convicted, and then turns to the policemen, on his way out of the prison, saying I just bought my freedom for 40 thousand euros.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that for honest cops, that first story you mentioned, that actually took place in Ukraine, which is next door to Moldova.",
        "And it was actually the story of a girl who was trafficked to Moldova.",
        "Kind of an unusual pattern, but she pursued the case, she and her friend who were both trafficked into Moldova, and succeeded in getting convictions, but both the people involved in trafficking then walked.",
        "The situation of the police, who were terribly, terribly underpaid in Moldova and Ukraine, and other countries in Eastern Europe, and other source countries, as they're called in the human-trafficking world, is really grim.",
        "I mean, there's a lot of corruption.",
        "And the rare, I don't know if that's quite fair to say rare, but an honest policeman in a situation where there's a lot of protection rackets being run is in a sort of desperate situation.",
        "He can work and work and work, or she, and actually bring someone to justice, and the next thing he knows, that trafficker's walked free."
