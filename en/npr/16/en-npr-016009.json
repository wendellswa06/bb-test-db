        "If somebody wants to help a girl or group of girls or maybe - it depends on the amount of money, they can write in the mail to us.",
        "And there is a certain procedure, because last week we've already had 1,000 dollars donated by several people from the U.S.",
        "So it's possible, and there is a procedure already.",
        "And Bill Finnegan, do you know the address or procedure for this?",

        "Hello.",
        "I also just wanted to thank you for discussing this topic.",
        "I think it's very important.",

        "What is kind of being done at the grassroots level, maybe, you know, to tell these or warn these girls or boys if, you know, if you're approached by somebody, or you know something that, you know, to be wary?",
        "Well, Stella Rotaru, I know you go around to schools in Moldova.",
        "Yes, I am, and our partner organizations, like La Strada, CPTW, and the other organizations working in the field.",
        "We have groups of volunteers, and together with these volunteers we go to different schools, universities, to villages, to towns all over Moldova.",
        "We've used before the movie \"\"Lilja 4-ever,\"\" a very strong movie, now the last play is the theater play which is called \"\"Abandoned People,\"\" and basically it is a very powerful play.",
        "It shows migration and trafficking as a consequence of illegal immigration.",
        "So volunteers go to schools, they watch this movie or the theater play, and after these they have discussions.",
        "Also, there are advertisements on the radio.",
        "There are talk shows.",
        "So a lot of work is being done on the prevention side.",
        "And then very important and a new approach, in my one program is that we started in 2003 already, providing assistance to the so-called at-risk cases.",
        "So, because we really think that it's more important to help a person who is in the risk of being trafficking, and it's easier to help the person than to rehabilitate this person after the trafficking experience, when the traumas are much more bigger.",
        "But Bill Finnegan, you also have pointed out in your article, most of the Moldovans, and other people from poor countries in Eastern Europe who go abroad, those jobs really are there.",
        "So this is really only a small fraction that get - they get victimized this way.",
        "That's true.",
        "I mean, the kind of prevention work and awareness work that IOM and other organizations do in places like Moldova is really extensive and quite successful in kind of raising people's awareness of the problem.",
        "But the sort of counterpropaganda, as it were, that is all the money that flows into a place like Moldova.",
        "A third of Moldova's GDP is now estimated to be remittances, you know, money sent home by people working abroad.",
        "That's just the kind of material argument there.",
        "I mean, Stella described people fixing up their houses, getting new cars, all that stuff.",
        "People, in other words, having successful emigrations, is much stronger, especially for, you know, a young, unworldly person who, you know, doesn't see any opportunity at home and thinks, well, you know, I don't really know anybody who's been trafficked, I mean, which is partly a function of the relatively few people who are caught up in it.",
        "And also the secrecy that surrounds it."
