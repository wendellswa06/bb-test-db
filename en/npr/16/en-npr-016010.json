        "Typical incoherence on my part.",

        "We're in a moment of unprecedented distrust of Washington.",
        "And that is where the country is.",
        "And I thought - and the question is does anybody in Washington reflect that distrust and do they have a solution to the genuine problem which is the Washington broken?",
        "We've tried to reform Social Security, immigration, health care, energy, all those things are failures or likely failures.",
        "And so I thought the president took some steps to showing I will change Washington, I am not a typical Washington insider.",
        "He adopted some policies, which are kind of independent friendly, freeze on spending, nuclear power, offshore drilling, that's non-orthodox stuff.",
        "Nonetheless, I don't think he went nearly far enough.",
        "The country is just in a rage about Washington, and he is behind that, as are the Republicans, but at least they can say we're against Washington.",
        "He has to try to say Washington is terrible, trust us to run more of the country and that's a contradiction.",
        "I agree with David on this, the need for him to distance himself from Washington.",
        "At the end of that speech, you wondered does Barack Obama live in Washington anymore because he really was trying to identify with that anger.",
        "And I think part of his strategy here is to make an argument that, wait a minute, these Republicans who have been giving me all this grief and the statement that led to this segment, these guys are at least as responsible for the mess we have here.",
        "So, he's trying to push back against them, which is something he really hadn't done very much of in 2009.",
        "But they could at least say Washington is broken, let's go get all the power out of Washington.",
        "That's a reasonably simple message.",
        "To me, the core moral corruption is the deficits.",
        "You've got to tackle the deficits in a very hardcore way.",
        "And that means Republican saying we need tax increases, Democrats saying we need spending increase, we're not even close to that."
