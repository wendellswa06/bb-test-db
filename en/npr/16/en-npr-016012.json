        "How do you live well?",
        "And how do you do it without damaging other people, embarrassing yourself?",
        "Reporting on a lobster festival, he didn't review the food, the crowds, his attention went to the shellfish in the pot.",
        "I spent a week interviewing him, after the 1,000-plus-page novel \"\"Infinite Jest\"\" made Wallace's name.",

        "He talked about shyness, the greasy thrill of being famous.",
        "A little part of me likes it, he said, but that part doesn't get to steer.",
        "He talked about being lonely, the fear that his tussle with burly, psychic self-consciousness figures might get so bad he'd do damage to himself.",
        "He talked about a friend's unsuccessful try at suicide, how it had scared him off.",
        "He laughed, I just, I knew that if anybody was fated to screw up a suicide attempt, it was me."

        "It's conventional wisdom at this point, but it's because it's cobbled together from the learnings from a lot of different categories, some of the packaged goods people, and then you look at the big ticket industries.",

        "They buy 55 percent of consumer electronics.",
