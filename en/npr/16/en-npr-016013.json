        "I think most of the time what people read about women's earning power is what I call the poor story of the women's market.",

        "For example, probably at least once a year you see a flurry of articles on women on average earn 76 cents on the dollar...",
        "Right.",
        "...compared to their male counterparts, which sounds like women maybe don't have very much money.",
        "But on the flipside of that is the fact that women do bring in over half of the household income in 55 percent of households, and one big huge chunk of that is the fact that one out of four - over one out of four U.S.",
        "households - is headed by a single woman.",
        "So - and 22 percent of homes are owned by single women, compared to only 12 percent for single men.",
        "So there are lots of other - and the prognosis is only upside, by the way, Neal, because women, for example, are bringing home the majority of law degrees from law schools these days; business degrees, the majority there; 46 percent of medical degrees.",
        "And when you look at bachelor's degrees, women are taking home 57 percent of those.",
        "And when you consider that, combined with the fact that on average a college graduate earns twice as much over his or her lifetime as a noncollege graduate, you can see that women's earning power is only going to get stronger.",

        "Many things we agree upon, but when we can't - and you have to make a decision - I think the high wage earner should be the decider.",
        "Well, Joe, I'm really glad to hear that, because in 30 percent of households, the woman is the high wage earner, especially in the most high income households where, for example, in households where women earn over - where the woman of the house earns over $100,000, in 70 percent of those households she's the primary decision-maker.",
