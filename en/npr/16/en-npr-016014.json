        "Absolutely.",
        "In new car purchases, more than 50 percent, and in some markets, up to 62 percent of all new vehicles are purchased by women today - about 48 percent of all used cars and 40 percent, surprisingly, of trucks, new trucks.",
        "And how has that changed over the past decade or so?",
        "I think that there - basically women have always been involved in buying cars, and even 10 years ago were purchasing just under 50 percent of all cars bought, new vehicles.",
        "However, I think the big difference is that women are beginning to understand their purchasing power.",
        "And as women have escalated into higher level jobs, paying jobs, and have moved into more executive positions - and also with the advent of the Internet have more information available on these kind of statistics - are really beginning to kind of come into their own in the automotive buying market and are demanding a better experience.",
        "So in terms of that change, I guess Ask Patty is in response - in part a response to that change.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "One of the things that women complain about - and many studies have been conducted - is that women don't feel respected when they go to car dealers to do business, either in the service area or at the sales area.",
        "And so there's sort of a general mistrust, and that may be with men as well.",
        "But I think women really need to feel more comfortable...",
        "Car salesmen don't enjoy a sterling reputation for their - anyway, but...",
        "No, and there have been some recent little segments on television that have sort of depicted that in a very negative way, and I - and by the way, I want to say that there are some very fine new car dealers that do do a good job with women.",
        "But back to your question, I think that women, because of past bad experiences - and you know, if a woman has a bad experience, she's going to tell 20 of her friends, who are going to tell 20 of her friends - and so we go to those environments expecting to have a bad experience, and often we'll take a man just so we get respect.",
        "So here's the number one thing women want.",
        "We want to be respected.",
        "We want to be treated like we're intelligent human beings when we go into that male-dominate atmosphere.",
        "And since the Internet provides so much information to research for a new car - or a used car, for that matter - we can be totally prepared when we enter the dealership, and so we, you know, expect with our - you know, as Marti pointed out, women like to research.",

        "Most car ads that I see on TV seem to be aimed at men.",

        "Car - the car manufacturers seem to have sort of this - and even the car Web sites, if you go look at them, are really speaking to the man market, as if women don't buy cars, for one, or we don't enjoy our cars.",
        "And quite the contrary - and I can tell you, we have a lot of interaction on Ask Patty with women on a daily basis - women are very passionate about their automobiles.",
        "We love our cars.",
        "In fact, a great quote that I like to tell is women - one woman told me my car is like my purse.",

        "And you know...",

        "Absolutely.",
        "Studies show that women's number one - when they go out to purchase a car or a truck, they're looking to - because they cart around the family in them, the safety issues of that car.",
