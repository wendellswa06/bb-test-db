        "I'm a little surprised at how little - there are entire industries of people who are in the design business in Detroit and in California and in auto companies all over the world, and yet in my opinion I share David's observation.",
        "I think that there are so much opportunity to do a much, much better job in design for automotive."

        "What's interesting about automotive, speaking of the differences between women and men, is that generally the automotive companies, when they ask about styling, one of the things they found out is that styling to men means what the car looks like on the outside, whereas styling to women, they tend to think more about what it looks like on the inside.",
        "So the finishes, the knobs - as David was talking about - the burlwood, the brushed chrome, the leather or the seats, etc.",
        "And so I think there's a tremendous amount of upside for the manufacturer that figures out how to do that, and I just - you know, I know it's hard to make a car, but if Dell can make a computer overnight, I don't understand why you can't make a car and offer some options for color, you know, that - any color you want except for black.",
        "We're not that far advanced from Henry Ford's original design template.",
        "So I also think that the automotive - which cars people - women buy are going to change significantly, because as the Baby Boomers move into the sort of post-family age - I've got another book coming out in January called Primetime Women, which focuses on women who are 50 to 70 years old.",
        "And the - because Baby Boomer women are coming out of the primetime stage, I predict that we're going to see a move away from SUVs - which we have finally started to see acknowledged by the auto companies.",
        "Even though SUVs have been trailing off for over a year, they're finally starting to say, hmm, I wonder if that 10-year upward trend is still going to continue - which it's not.",
        "But what they are going to sell more of are luxury cars, sports cars - to Jody's point, women enjoy these cars - and I believe mini-cars, like the, literally Minis and Volkswagen Beetles, the cute cars, as it were.",
        "David, thanks very much for the call.",
        "I do have another example.",
        "Go ahead.",
