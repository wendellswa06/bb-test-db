        "I've been in it for about three years, and it's been like that even before the companies really started acknowledging it.",
        "That was one of the things, you know - and some of the guys that kind of mentored me, they were like, yeah, nobody really realizes this, but you know, 99 times out of a hundred it's actually the woman who makes the decision.",
        "And a lot of times I've even noticed that lately being that the woman is more enthusiastic than the man about it, you know, spending thousands of dollars on a TV and surround sound system.",
        "So that was something - that's something that has changed.",
        "But I thought that was a really interesting trend.",
        "And usually it's the guy who's kind of standing off to the side and the woman who's, you know, asking all the questions about, you know, picture quality and, you know, different things you can do with it.",

        "Zack, there's a couple of things that are interesting about that, because I think you really have a leg up on the competition by recognizing that.",

        "And his uncle was a highly successful financial advisor, so a sales person of financial services.",
        "And the kid said to the uncle, he says, yeah, I come in, it's the men who want to buy these yachts.",
        "And the uncle said to him, you know, you really should be selling to the women.",
        "And the kid said, well, you know, why?",
        "It's the guys that want the yachts.",
        "And the uncle said, exactly; t hat's why you have to sell to the women.",
        "You know.",
        "And to Zack's point, it is usually the woman who has a lot of questions.",
        "Men often don't feel comfortable - as comfortable as woman do asking questions, because they kind of feel like, oh, I'm supposed to know all about this.",
        "And asking for information from somebody kind of makes many men uncomfortable because it frames them as one down, i.e., by definition I know less than the person I'm asking and I'm just not comfortable with knowing less.",
        "Okay?",
        "One thing that I've seen too, that I've noticed - have you seen the Sony commercials, the world's first television for men and women?",

        "I made the decision, I signed the check, and there's no recognition of that.",
        "That's absolutely true.",
        "And the funny thing is that a lot of the reason that not-for-profits and for-profit businesses don't know that is it's a simple habit that businesses need to get out of, which is - I was the one who was involved in the purchase of our new backyard fence.",
        "And the guy came in - I was the only one who talked to him, and he was writing up the contract and he said name and I said Marti Barletta.",
        "And he started writing in the middle of the line.",
        "And he left the beginning of the line open and then he said, And what's your husband's name?",
        "And he was filling in my husband's name at the beginning of the line.",
        "And I said, now, why do you do that?",

        "Well, you would think he had learned a lesson from that, but would you believe that about two weeks later we got a thank you card in the mail.",
        "Now, kudos to the company for having the good sense to send a thank-you-for-your-purchase card, but it was addressed to my husband - to Kathleen's point.",
        "And I'm telling you, I would never - I made the purchase and I would never buy from that company again.",
        "It offended me.",
        "Here's - and finally, we just have a couple of minutes left, but here's an e-mail from Kurt in Renton, Washington.",
        "I heard an auto industry person say that women will buy what is marketed to men, but men won't buy what is marketed to women, which may explain why the lovely shade of purple on my '96 Escort - which a gazillion women of all ages have told me is gorgeous - disappeared after a single year.",
        "That probably does explain it, because that observation is in fact true.",
        "For some reason, it's - you know, it's related to the observation that I saw somebody in a meeting one time and she said to one of the male co-hosts of the meeting, she said, Neal, no offense, but you think like a woman.",
        "And I thought, what about the no offense thing here?",
        "Why is it that things that, you know, are female very often are considered to be, you know, less than things that are male?",
        "And I think that is changing and it will change, but still we have that factor and that's why men don't buy girlie stuff.",
        "Now, let me just add, women don't buy girlie stuff either.",
        "If you paint the brand pink, that is the fastest way to drive women away from your item that you're selling."
