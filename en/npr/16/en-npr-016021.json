        "I really do believe that the Democrats rally around their wounded, like they did Bill Clinton, and Republicans quite often hit the road.",

        "Well, the--a lot of them hit the road.",
        "They--it was too hot to handle, and they took off.",

        "That's one of the reasons why I am a Republican.",

        "You know, your father had a drinking problem, your mother was unhappy; they didn't get along.",
        "And you were kind of bossing them around even, telling them, `You can't get a divorce.'",
        "When you have a crisis in your family at that age and you're an only child, it forces you to confront difficulties and problems and try to find solutions.",
        "It forces you to go to your father that you did love and that loved you and said, `Dad, you know, you--this drinking thing has got to be dealt with.",
        "I do think that it led to the kind of person that I became.",
        "That's what I've been doing since I guess I was about five years old.",

        "Mm hmm.",
        "Well Quincy Troupe and I come out of the same tradition.",
        "We felt that if you are writing about your own traditions, and any people who have control of their cultural imperatives write about their traditions - that we look around the world - the country, and we thought about other men and women and they are particularly traditional starting publishing companies.",
        "And so with $400 and a mimeograph machine, I started Third World Press in 1967 after working Duddley Randel(ph), who had sort of started Broadside Press in Detroit, Michigan in 1966.",
        "So being a part of a group difficulty and struggle - the civil rights struggle, the black empowerment struggles, the Black Arts Movement, we all came out of that movement talking about building independent black institutions.",
        "And I just took it a little bit further and dedicated my life - I'm primarily a poet, you see...",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "So I come out of this tradition in writing poetry - and which I still am, but the business side - so we not only have Third Press, we also operate four schools in Chicago, too.",
        "So this question of building independent black institutions, it becomes the underside of a strong people.",
        "When you look at a people, you look their institutional structures.",
        "And so for us, publishing especially creative works was something that was drastically missing in the black communities.",
        "There are - most things that succeed are at the precipice of failure many different times.",
        "So what was one moment where you had to make a choice that this was going to succeed despite what other people told you, whether it was a financial moment, a moment in your own personal life - what, for example, was a challenge that you faced that you got through?",
        "Well, I guess one of the major challenges has always been dealing with the federal government, mostly in terms of taxes.",
        "Not being a trained business person, much of what I did in the early days was, you know, learning on the job, and so we were hit with a major, major tax bill once that almost put us out of business.",
        "But essentially, you know, I had to borrow money to deal with that.",
        "And then I think the other large question - we own our own headquarters in Chicago.",
        "About 20 years ago, we bought a half a block in Chicago, and out of the black publishers in the United States, there are only two black publishers that own their own headquarters.",
        "That's Jonathan Publishing Company here in Chicago and Third World Press here in Chicago.",
        "And so buying this property moved us to another whole level in terms of dealing with the underpinning of how do you run a successful business, and so therefore, I've had a little on-the-job training all the way through the 42 years we've been alive.",
        "And then working full time at Chicago State University, directing (unintelligible) in creative writing at Chicago state, so I've never taken a salary out of Third World Press or out of schools, so I've had to work these jobs as well as write.",

        "Given that you have published 18 books to date with major publishing houses, what is your space in the literary world on a business end?",

        "Do you float from publishing house to publishing house?",

        "I got together that money, and I published that and proofread it and everything else.",
        "And then after that - after that venture, I've been - I've published my work with small houses - small publishing houses and major publishing houses.",
        "And to get right to the crux of what you just asked, I've kind of floated.",
        "I've kind of floated around, especially on the prose, non-fiction side of things.",
        "For the most part I've published my poetry with small presses.",
        "I started out with a black publisher in New York, a little small black publisher in New York, and he died, and then I moved over to Coffee House Press in Minneapolis, which has published all my poetry since that time.",
        "But the Miles books I published with major houses.",
        "The Pursuit of Happiness\"\" I published with major houses.",
        "The James Baldwin book I published with major houses, and then the children's book - the children's books that I write I publish with major houses.",
        "I want to add another thing to that.",
        "I really have always respected Haki for what he has done and his perseverance in publishing all these writers, and we are both poets.",
        "He's a poet.",
        "I'm a poet, and we've come up the hard way through the whole - through this whole environment.",
        "He's also is a college professor.",
        "I was a college professor for 34 years, but I retired in 2003 and came move back to New York.",
        "But one of the other things that I would just want to mention and then I'll shut up is that I've always been interested in - because he does the publishing, Haki does, and that I think that's great, but I think we need journals and magazines, so I've always been in the business of starting magazines - Code magazine which came out in Los Angeles and a number of other magazines - American Rag.",
        "I could just go down the list of whole bunch of magazines that I've started.",
        "And now, I'm editing a journal that comes out of New York University called Black Renaissance Noir, which I'm going to change the name in the next - not in this coming out issue, which will be out in about a month, but in the next one it's going to be called Bow Bob(ph).",
        "And so, we're going to change the name to that, and that journal publishes fiction, non-fiction, poetry, essays, photographic essays, reproductions of artwork from African-Americans, Africans, primarily Africans and African-Americans and Latino writers and Asian writers and with some sprinkling of white writers in there."

        "Tell us a little bit more about what you do?",
        "Pretty much what we do at the Literary Consultant Group is, we allow for authors that are looking to do their own thing or self publish, as one may call, it to get all of their ducks in a row before kind of going out into the world blind, not really knowing and making a lot of the mistakes that independent publishers or self-published authors make without having a certain amount of information.",

        "They may already have a title picked out.",
        "They may already have even printed some books already, and depending on really what it is that they need and what I see from my expertise as far as what they may need to change and start the process over again, those are the things that we help them out with.",
        "Some people, you know, may have cover treatments that are just not going to work in the market place, and we will coach them and advise them of new and innovative cover treatments that may help increase awareness and bring people to their project.",

        "Just quickly, maybe each of you could give me a sense of what you think the best play is for people who are trying to get books published, meaning should you go ahead and self publish?",
        "Should you approach an existing small publisher?",
        "Should you try to, you know, pitch to the majors?",
        "Haki, what do you think?",
        "Well, let me just give you a little bit of background what's happening today.",
        "There are about six or seven black publishers that are active, and we've all cut back not because of the economy, but other than Johnson Publishing Company, Broadside Press, there's also Black Classic Press that just does books that are basically children's books.",
        "We have African World (unintelligible) Press.",
        "We have Amber Books, and, of course Third World Press.",
        "You have to understand that the whole publishing industry is controlled by probably seven international conglomerates and four of those are foreign owned, and out of the big seven, most of them are in Munich, London, and Sydney, but all have offices in the New York.",
        "And 80 percent of the books that are published come from those seven conglomerates.",
        "And there exists in the country now about 85,000 small and self publishers - and in the country.",
        "And so self publishing is not something that is off the table we suggest because - and we publish somewhere between 20 and 25 books a year, and that's a lot for us in terms of the resources that are available, and so we do suggest - I mean, my first book - I self published my first book, \"\"Think Black,\"\" back in 1966, and so it's not off the table.",
        "I think that with the guests that you have today, what is clear is that many of these young people need to - or writers need to study publishing, one.",
        "Two, need to study...",
