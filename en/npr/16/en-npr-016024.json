        "So I'm wondering, as an outsider to all of this, why is the NBA so much more fashion-forward than, say, the NFL or the MLB?",
        "Sure.",
        "Why these guys?",
        "There's two reasons.",
        "First of all, one is that their bodies and their shapes actually lend themselves to looking really, really good - really good cuts in suits, you know?",
        "Most of them have fairly slim waists for their heights.",
        "And they're very good builds, whereas, you know, a lot of NFL players, you know, they're gigantic.",
        "Some of them are 300 pounds.",
        "And quite frankly, they don't look - just don't look as good in suits.",
        "But the other reason is because the NBA, back in 2005, the league instituted a dress code.",
        "It was pretty controversial at the time, though."

        "Sometimes they opt for, like, a little gold jewelry around their collars instead of the ties.",
        "I think most of the established players, like the James Hardens and Kevin Loves - you know, they'll go for the classic suit.",
