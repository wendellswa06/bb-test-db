        "And last week's earthquake highlights that concern.",
        "There are 30 dams all along the Min River and its tributaries upstream from Dujiangyan.",

        "You open a map of China and you see that almost all of its rivers have been dammed.",
        "There are almost no rivers that flow naturally.",
        "Of course, a certain number of dams makes sense.",
        "But all in all, too many dams have been built.",

        "Professor Ai says the earthquake makes it even more urgent to reassess the wisdom of building so many dams.",
        "And he adds one final thought to the mix, in this new appraisal of dams, and rivers, and who controls them.",
        "He says, right after the earthquake, the army was trying to reach people to rescue them, but the roads were blocked.",
        "If there weren't so many dams, more soldiers could have gone by boat but the dams were in the way.",
        "Nearly half of California's water supply gathers in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.",
        "From there, it is shipped to cities and farms using massive water pumps and a system of aqueducts hundreds of miles long.",

        "Now, you're a mother.",
        "When you talk about race to your daughter as she grows, what tone of voice will you use, and what will you tell her?",
        "Well, I think I'll use a proud tone of voice to tell her about our African-American history, her family's African-American history.",
        "I mean, I grew up in a world that was quite sheltered.",
        "And, you know, I really wanted to paint in \"\"One Drop\"\" my evolution from being a sheltered, privileged white girl to, you know, someone I hope of a more sophisticated understanding about the role that racists played in our country."
