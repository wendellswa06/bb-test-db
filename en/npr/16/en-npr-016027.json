        "It's - 90 percent of them are street demonstrators who started out demonstrating in the eastern cities against Gadhafi.",
        "When he attacked, they all got armed and have AK-47s and a few RPGs, but no major firepower.",
        "And they're not organized as an army, and they're not - it's going to be very hard for them to organize themselves as a force - an infantry force, as it were, to go against Gadhafi's troops."
