        "Well, there is a little bit of backing away.",
        "And at the same time, it's a little bit of normal hesitation.",
        "The Arab League tends not to take very forceful positions because it's a group that brings together Arab governments, and Arab governments rarely agree completely on major points like this.",
        "And you have the double problem that the Arab governments that are now in power and are in the Arab League, many of them are being challenged, are being thrown out by their own people - the latest one being Yemen, where the president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, is on the verge of being thrown out by his own people, not by foreign intervention.",
        "So you're dealing with a group of very mixed legitimacy and credibility.",
        "And I think Amr Moussa also has the extra issue, which is he's going to run for president of Egypt.",

        "And he said that would be a decision for each Arab government to make.",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "And this is the problem of the Arab League, which is that it's an organization of governments.",

        "It does, sometimes, reflect Arab public opinion.",
        "In this case, ironically, it does very well reflect Arab public opinion because Arab public opinion wants to help the rebels, and stop the Gadhafi regime from carrying out its attacks.",
        "So far, how is political support for these operations in Britain, France, and then the four other European countries that are taking part in this?",
        "So this is a rare moment when the Arab League and Arab public opinion actually coincide - and even more rare that it coincides with Western military action.",
        "So this is a moment to savor.",
