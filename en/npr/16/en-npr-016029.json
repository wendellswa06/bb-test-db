        "Those who know that Gadhafi, who's a real dictator, who is the sole boss of Libya and who is opposing all modern concept of democracy governance, etc., are very happy to see the back of him.",
        "Now, it's true that Libya is a very important client to many African countries, including West Saharan countries, among which my own country, Mali.",
        "Many -Libya has invested a lot - I mean, three of the main hotels in Bamako; 100,000 hectares in the irrigation area of Mali; many, many gifts to mosques, cultural centers, etc.",
        "It's true that he's an important client for Mali, and that people who - people or institutions he helped are not very happy for what is happening in the Libya - in Libya.",
        "So as we look at the situation in Africa, these gifts, will they buy Colonel Gadhafi's support?",
        "There's also, of course, an instinctual aversion to what might be seen as colonial intervention.",
        "I think we should not overestimate, I mean, these statements.",
        "Yes, it's true that two or three countries - I mean - the feeling is very strong that this looks like colonial aggression.",

        "And Nicolas Sarkozy is low in the polls.",
        "There is a moral case to be made, he felt, and the French were particularly worried that if the Gadhafi forces entered Benghazi, that the colonel and his sons would make good on their promises to be merciless.",

        "And the Turks have tried to keep lines out to Gadhafi in case there's some negotiation.",

        "And it's also not clear, if the rebels gather themselves and march again on Tripoli, whether they're going to have the protection of the multilateral coalition in what is, in essence, a civil war."
