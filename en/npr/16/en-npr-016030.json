        "Well, I agree with that.",
        "I mean, I don't think the United States and the West should be intervening all over the world.",
        "It's just that consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.",
        "But if you're going to take big moral stands, you need to be able to defend yourself against people who say, why here and not there?",
        "So far, it's been very good and very supportive.",
        "In France, President Sarkozy got a big round of applause from the socialist opposition as well.",
        "I mean, people here - many were reluctant when he took France back into NATO in a full way.",
        "That includes his current foreign minister, Alain Juppe, who opposed it.",
        "People do think of France as having a special role, a kind of exceptionalism in the way that Americans often think of the United States - that it's a kind of city on the hill that stands for certain values and will, you know, exercise its will to spread those values, whether they're democracy or freedom.",
        "And the French feel that they've saved lives here, and that they've pushed the world -which they have done, with the British - to take a moral stand in the name of protecting democracy, but also protecting civilians against a Gadhafi offensive that he threatened would be merciless.",
        "Having started this operation, could there be any suggestion that Paris and London could allow the rebel forces to lose at any point?",
        "No one wants to get into that.",
        "I mean, everyone keeps saying this is Libya's fight, and they don't want to intervene on either side of a war.",
        "But we said that in Kosovo, too.",
        "But in the end, in a very cold way, NATO intervened on one side of the civil war in Kosovo.",
        "It was probably the right side, but it was intervention in domestic affairs, and Russia and China don't like that.",
        "A lot of people don't like that.",
        "The justification is the protection of civilians.",
        "It's the right to protect.",
        "But that's a fairly new concept, and no one's quite sure how far it extends.",
        "And finally, Steve Erlanger, there will be some - particularly here in Washington - who will be skeptical that Britain and France will have the stomach to sustain these operations for a long period of time after, inevitably, some of their bombs go astray and cause civilian casualties.",
        "That's always a risk.",
        "And if one of their planes happens to be shot down and a crew captured, it will create other problems.",
        "And at the moment, Gadhafi is lying low.",
        "They're not flying.",
        "The French said that since Saturday, even over Benghazi, they've found no civilians needing protection.",
        "They haven't fired a shot since Saturday.",
        "But we don't know how long Gadhafi will sit like that.",
        "And we don't know how this is going to end - or when.",

        "The overwhelming vote by the Security Council, I think, reflects a broad understanding that number one, stop the violence; and number two, we do believe that a final result of any negotiations would have to be the decision by Colonel Gadhafi to leave.",
        "Colonel Gadhafi declared the Security Council resolution illegitimate, a cover for what he called naked aggression, and vowed to fight to the last.",
        "(Through translator) This interference has no justification.",
        "But remember, we are stronger than you because of our will, because we're going to fight on our land and we're going to fight for every square, every part of our land.",
        "And we will die as martyrs.",
        "We're not going to go like that.",

        "And good of you to be with us.",
        "Hi.",
        "And what are the options, at this point, for Colonel Gadhafi - especially after he's seen what must have been the cream of his armored forces obliterated south of Benghazi?",
        "Yes.",
        "He has very few options.",
        "But one of the options - and probably one that's most disturbing to the allied forces against him - is he can just decide to sit tight.",
        "He has lost tremendous amounts of armament.",
        "He's lost, also, his air defense forces.",
        "His planes are inoperable.",
        "But to get him out without him going voluntarily or an internal coup, there would have to be a land force, and that is just not going to happen.",
        "So he could just decide to sit tight, and that would probably be the worst option all around.",
        "The forces, at the moment - the pro-Gadhafi forces - control the big oil ports in sort of the middle of the country.",
        "Of course, the rebels still have Benghazi and a few other areas.",
        "And of course, then Colonel Gadhafi has his bases in Sirte and in Tripoli, in the western part of the country.",

        "He's got to - he still needs to, you know, feed his population to keep them happy.",
        "But he has both that oil income - he also has - when I was in Tripoli, I found out that he's got hundreds of millions, if not billions, in cash and gold at the central bank, and hidden.",
        "So he will have access, for quite a while, to funds.",
        "The other outcome that would be - could be that we have a divided Libya, where the rebels keep their eastern (unintelligible); Gadhafi keeps the west and central.",
        "And it ticks along - Libya ticks along very, you know, wounded on both sides because, of course, the rebels will be in trouble if they don't have access to funds.",
        "We could have a partitioned Libya, which would make no one happy.",
        "And yet the Security Council resolution also calls for a sea and air interdiction.",

        "The family and other officials are all under various kinds of sanctions.",
        "Might there be, as the foreign minister of France, Alain Juppe, said today, might there be an unraveling from the inside, an understanding by some currently supporting Colonel Gadhafi that maybe their interests lie on the other side?",
        "Yes, that's - I think that was the outcome that is being hoped for by those who want to see Gadhafi gone.",
        "Because as you said, under the U.N.",
        "Resolution 1973 - it is to protect civilians.",
        "Of course, that's what it states.",
        "Unstated is regime change.",

        "The West - you know, America, Obama - has stated it; so have the European leaders.",

        "An internal coup is not - I don't see it happening now.",
        "There's still enough support around him.",
        "And remember, the people around him know that once he goes, they're in danger as well.",
        "So that support for Gadhafi will continue.",
        "When it gets and very hard to see what the tipping point is, but the tipping point, if it comes, will be when those around him decide that he's had it, it's over, their only chance for their own survival is to get rid of Gadhafi.",
        "Will that be acceptable to the rebels?",
        "That's another question.",
        "I certainly heard the name Mussa Kussa - the foreign minister, formerly head of security, was Libya's liaison both with the CIA and the MI6 - under that rapprochement.",
        "Would he be acceptable to the West?",
        "Would he be acceptable to the rebels?",
        "Is Gadhafi looking at that as well?",
        "And he has a history of getting rid of his opponents, so there's a lot to play for here.",
        "But an internal coup would probably be the smoothest way ahead, in terms of regime change and Libya getting back to a functioning state.",
        "And finally, right now, both sides in Libya, their aims are maximalist.",
        "No negotiations with those traitors - and the traitors, of course, depends which side you're on.",
        "Might there be some middle ground?",
        "You mentioned Omer(ph) Kussa - Mussa Kussa.",
        "Might there be some form of negotiation?",
        "There isn't now.",
        "And as you say - and it's always early on that the absolute maximalist positions are taken.",
        "Now, as both sides start to tire a bit, Gadhafi starts losing more and more of his - and remember, of - as he loses his equipment, both vehicles and planes, well, that's what keeps him in power.",
        "So if he loses more of that, as the rebels simply get tired; how are they getting food?",
        "As it drags on, I think that's when you will have a chance for negotiations.",
