        "Well, the White House is transmitting this report to the Senate Judiciary Committee.",

        "That will be on Friday.",

        "And it's important to note - both of those votes just need 51 votes to pass.",
        "Does the public get to see the FBI investigation?",
        "It's unlikely.",
        "Generally, background investigations are not available to the public.",
        "And there's nothing, at this point, that has indicated that we will get to see this.",
        "All right.",
        "So let's talk about the political implications of all this, which is what Domenico Montanaro has been looking at.",
        "The other night, Domenico, we saw the president at a campaign rally mocking Christine Blasey Ford and her testimony.",
        "He got a huge laugh, huge applause in Mississippi.",
        "He clearly sees this as a political winner for himself and Republicans.",
        "Is it?",
        "Well, the nomination fight certainly fired up Republicans.",
        "I mean, since July, the number of Republicans saying that they think these midterm elections are, quote, \"\"very important\"\" in our new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll - that number has skyrocketed from 68 percent to 80 percent.",
        "That's about the same level as Democrats, who we've been saying all year were more fired up than Republicans and that that could lead to this blue wave.",
        "But I have to tell you, Republican strategists have been telling me that nothing had been able to break through this year.",
        "And quite frankly, they'd been concerned that the GOP base wouldn't have a sense of urgency to show up to the polls - until now.",
        "Which is really interesting because there were Democratic strategists who said they were having a hard time getting people fired up about fighting the Kavanaugh nomination.",
        "And there had been some presumption that this was, you know, all part of the Democrats' plan to get people all riled up.",
        "But it turns out that it's the opposite, that this is actually energizing Republicans.",
        "The poll asked respondents whether Kavanaugh should be confirmed regardless of what the FBI has found.",
        "What's the answer there?",
        "Well, 52 percent of people said that he should not be confirmed if there are lingering doubts.",
        "Forty percent said that he should.",
        "That's a reversal, by the way - I should note - from 1991.",
        "When people were asked about Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill and whether or not he should be confirmed if there were lingering doubts, 56 percent of people said he should be confirmed."

        "In our poll, the 40 percent who say that he should still be confirmed regardless is driven by Republicans, not surprisingly.",
        "Three-quarters of Republicans say that he should still be confirmed even if there's a doubt.",
        "And among them, Republican men - that's 81 percent who think that he should be.",
        "That kind of resentment, that cultural grievance - something we've seen emerge over the last couple of days - we noted the president's comments.",
        "And this nomination fight really firing up Republicans, you know?",
        "That is a big piece of what Republicans are hoping helps them this year.",
        "I mean, at the root of this, this is a new chapter in a culture war.",
        "I mean, you've got the president saying this is a dangerous time for young men, the threat of false accusations.",
        "Is that really something Republicans think is going to help them with the gender gap this fall?",
        "Well, maybe not with the gender gap.",
        "But their bet is that Democrats and Democratic women, in particular, were already sky high, and they need to get out the base.",
        "They're looking at numbers with independents, Latinos and young people, where they don't seem as interested in this election.",

        "Even if Kavanaugh is confirmed, there's going to be a shadow over his tenure.",
        "Certainly, there is a - as you noted - a cultural kind of battle, tug of war going on right now.",
        "And it's hard to see how there wouldn't be a shadow over it based on what we've seen transpire in the past couple of weeks, yeah.",
