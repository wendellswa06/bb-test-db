        "Yesterday the White House and NASA released their vision for the future of space exploration, so we'll talk about the president, his enthusiasm, NASA, every kind of thing that you might talk about with the president's science advisor, because this is your chance to talk with John Holdren.",

        "Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Holdren.",
        "Thanks very much, glad to be here.",
        "Why did you accept this job?",
        "I think it was an irresistible opportunity.",

        "He is well-informed about science and technology.",
        "He understands their connections to the big challenges the country faces.",
        "He's made it clear that he wants science and technology to be at the center of how the government thinks about these challenges and how it responds to them.",
        "Who in the science and technology community wouldn't jump at the chance to work with this president on that set of issues?",
        "And how do you see your role?",
        "Because there are different divisions of the government.",
        "You have the EPA, you have other kinds of science-related organizations.",
        "Where do you fit into that big picture?",
        "Well, Ira, you do have a huge array of science and technology capabilities in the Cabinet departments, in other agencies such as the EPA, the National Science Foundation, NASA, and indeed in other offices in the White House.",
        "Energy…",
        "On environmental quality.",
        "The role of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the role of the science advisor are, above all, to make sure that the science and technology advice that get to the president and the vice president are as objective and free of political agendas as possible."

        "Secondly, we have the responsibility of keeping track of what's going on across that whole array of Cabinet departments, agencies and offices, trying to make sure that it is integrated, that people are communicating with each other, that they're cooperating with each other, so that the science and technology operations of the executive branch are a coherent whole rather than a scattered set of operations in all those different entities.",
        "So it's really my job to work cooperatively with all those other people in the science and technology slots around the government, and there are a lot of them, and there are a lot of very good people, thanks in part in the top positions to the other appointments that this president has made.",
        "There's so many things to talk about.",
        "We have just the whole hour to do that, and less than that now as I keep babbling on.",

        "We spent the first part of the 120 days we had from the president's executive order to produce science integrity guidelines, surveying what the various Cabinet departments and agencies already do.",
        "We've compiled that information, we started to think about what needs to be added, what needs to be better coordinated, and we've opened it up to public comment on the OSTP Web site.",
        "Let's talk about some of the issues.",
        "There was a release yesterday about a new direction for NASA and the space agency, which doesn't have a chief as of yet.",
        "Are we changing our mission in space now?",
        "No, we're not changing the mission in space.",

        "We've been a leader in space.",
        "It's become important to our economy, to Earth observation, to national security as well as to understanding our place in the universe, but we have some challenges.",
        "We have a gap coming up in the capacity to put astronauts in space on American launchers between the time the shuttle program is scheduled to end, at the end of 2010, and the availability of the next-generation launcher, which is scheduled to be 2015, 2016, sometime in that time frame.",
        "So that's one challenge.",
        "Another challenge is that the International Space Station, in which we've made a tremendous investment, along with other countries, needs some thought as to how we can extend its usefulness beyond 2016.",
        "Another challenge is the question of when are we going to go back to the moon?",
        "When are we going to go beyond?",
        "How can those aspirations be reconciled with the other needs within NASA and with the budget?",
        "So we're standing up a blue-ribbon panel, it's going to be chaired by Norm Augustine, to take a fresh look at the options for how are we going to meet all these goals, what are the ways we could do it?",
        "But it's not - we certainly did not announce a change in vision.",

        "President Bush did set a date for going back to the moon.",
        "Are you saying that date now is on the table, or it's up in the air, or we don't know?",
        "Well, indeed, President Bush announced a grand vision with specific dates, but he never did provide the budget that would be consistent with getting there, and so obviously one of the things we have to look at under realistic budget constraints is whether that date is attainable or not.",
        "And as far as dividing the budget between people in space and robotics in space, which have achieved so much, is that also a priority that you'll be looking at?",
        "I think we're going to continue to have a balance going forward.",
        "We understand a good deal about what robots in space can do, and it's a lot, but there are other things for which humans and their urge to explore are at the forefront, and we want to be able to continue with that.",
        "There are other questions of balance between, for example, looking up and looking down: the Hubble, which is important, looking up; the Earth observation satellites that are important looking down.",
        "We also have aeronautics in NASA's name, and aeronautics has suffered some in recent years.",
        "We need to restore a more substantial level of activity in the aeronautics side.",
        "And one of the great problems any president and any science advisor would face is this giant question of energy production, the different forms that the energy production could take: coal, nuclear, alternative energies.",
        "How will you decide, and how will this administration decide, which one of those and how much money to devote to each one of those?",
        "Well, there are multiple, interlocking questions there, Ira.",
        "One is what is the role of the federal government versus the role of the private sector and the marketplace, and we expect in this market-driven economy that in the end the choices about the energy portfolio are largely going to be made by consumers and by the private sector.",
        "But we want to be sure in terms of the federal involvement that we have adequate investment in research and development to produce the menu of options from which the marketplace is going to choose, and we want to be sure that that marketplace includes consideration of problems like climate change, pollution of other kinds, and other environmental impacts that wouldn't be in the economic balance sheets, the decision-making factors affecting consumers and firms, unless the government took action.",
        "Well, do you see the role of the government as trying to stimulate the marketplace in one direction or another, let's say to one form of energy production by tax credits or any other kind of stimulation?"

        "Well, clearly, a major priority going forward, and the president has been very clear about this, is to get our arms around the climate-change challenge, and that is going to require a set of market signals that favor energy options that don't emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases or at least emit far smaller quantities of those heat-trapping gases than the fossil-fuel technologies on which we mainly rely today.",
        "So you can expect - and again, the president has already been completely clear about this - you can expect going forward the president to push for a cap on carbon pollution.",
        "You can look for a variety of other measures designed to make it more attractive, to deploy renewable energy options and other energy options that do not emit greenhouse gases.",
        "The president also said during his campaign that he believes in clean coal.",
        "I think he does.",
        "So do I.",
        "I think we have no choice but to clean up our coal technologies, and the reason for that, the United States still gets 50 percent of all of its electricity from coal.",
        "No matter what else you do with solar, with nuclear, with anything else you can think of, you're not going to change that heavy coal dependence overnight, and it therefore makes sense for us, as well as for the Chinese, the Indians, the Australians, many others who use large quantities of coal, to figure out how to do it without emitting the large quantities of carbon dioxide, not to mention other pollutants, that have been associated with coal-burning.",
        "But we haven't really found a way.",
        "It has not been tested fully yet, has it, sequestration of coal?",
        "Well, the way to capture carbon dioxide and sequester it away from the atmosphere, I mean, certainly technologically the capacity to capture carbon dioxide has been demonstrated, and the capacity to inject it back into the ground has been demonstrated.",
        "But we haven't integrated it at all at full commercial scale, and that's something we need to move ahead smartly to get done.",
        "We need to move to the level of integrated demonstration plants that show that, in fact, at commercial scale you can capture carbon dioxide.",
        "You can inject it into suitable geologic formations, from which it will not emerge for a very, very long time.",
        "And again, the United States is not the only country working on that.",
        "The Europeans are working on it, the Japanese are working on it, the Chinese are working on it.",
        "I think before long the Indians will be working on it.",
        "Pretty much everybody around the world who depends on coal understands that we simply have no choice but to master the technologies to bring its carbon pollution under control.",
        "Okay, we have to take a break.",

        "Do you also believe that we should be investing in nuclear power and building new nuclear-generating capacity?",
        "Well, I think, first of all, yes, we should be investing in nuclear energy.",
