        "In addition, going back to the previous point, if we did have plug-in hybrid vehicles, you could finally have nuclear energy, as well as renewable forms of electricity generation, making a contribution to motor-vehicle energy consumption, and that would be terrific.",
        "If we don't have - if we have not solved the waste-disposal problem, how can we move forward on building plants?",
        "The approach to waste disposal can take a number of different forms.",
        "Right now what we're doing is we're storing the radioactive wastes at the reactors in fuel-storage pools and what's called dry-cask storage.",
        "We could, if we chose, build at a variety of places around the country, engineered interim nuclear-waste-storage facilities, basically steel-reinforced concrete facilities that would contain the radioactive waste safely for a century or more while we explored what the best geologic options would be for the longer term.",
        "So we're not without options for dealing with our radioactive waste, but I think everybody will be more comfortable about expanding nuclear energy once we have chosen a particular path, and that is why the secretary of energy has announced the creation of a blue-ribbon panel to look again at the options that the country has for radioactive waste management going forward.",
        "There are, again, a variety of those options, and I trust that that blue-ribbon panel will be helpful in steering the country toward a choice that will enable us to proceed.",
        "Let's turn a little bit to something that you brought up before, and it is really an 800-pound gorilla, and that is climate change, global warming.",
        "How big of a problem does this administration view that, and how much are the alarm bells going off up there in Washington?",
        "Well, again, the president has been very clear about this.",
        "He's been clear through the campaign, he's been clear in many, many speeches he's given since he was inaugurated.",
        "He sees climate change as a major challenge, but also, as with many challenges, a major opportunity.",
        "It's going to drive innovation.",
        "It's going to lead to the development of new technologies and new businesses that are able to deliver the energy services that people want while reducing the carbon pollution that we produce, and we're going to get it done.",
        "He is on record repeatedly as saying in this country, we need a set of climate-change targets and mechanisms for getting there that will reduce our emissions of heat-trapping gasses by something like 14 percent before the 2005 levels by 2020 and that will reduce them by more than 80 percent by 2050.",
        "That is a big task, but the ambitiousness of those goals underlines how the president sees the importance of this problem.",
        "This is something that, for ourselves and as our contribution to the rest of the world, we need to get right, while helping everybody else to get it right too, because this is a problem that the United States cannot solve by itself."

        "Are we talking about - just what?",
        "And what methods are we looking at in our…",
        "Well, again, there are many different ways to go at it, but economists will tell you that the most efficient ways - that is, the ways to reduce carbon pollution most - at the lowest possible cost, are likely to be found by putting economic incentives to do it out there and letting the private sector and ingenuity determine the most economical ways to proceed.",
        "There are basically two approaches that fall in that category.",
        "One is a tax, and the other is the so-called cap-and-trade system, putting a cap on carbon pollution and having tradable permits that determine who gets to do the emissions and how much they pay for them.",
        "In the U.S.",
        "political environment at the moment, it seems overwhelmingly likely that the approach to capping carbon pollution, rather than taxing it, will be the one that is embraced.",

        "And again, he was very clear about that.",

        "He wants to auction 100 percent of the permits, and there's now, of course, proceeding in the government the usual complicated process.",

        "And I just wonder if you're aware of that situation and if there's anything you're thinking about doing about it?",
        "Thanks, Richard.",
        "I am not familiar with the details of the funding situation for artificial intelligence research.",
        "I am familiar with the problem that increasingly, over the last several years, more and more of our research funding from the government has been focused on shorter-term objectives and not so much on high-risk, high-potential return, longer-term research.",
