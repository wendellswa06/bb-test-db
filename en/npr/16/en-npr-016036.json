        "There's been a lot of science agencies that have been talking about that for quite a while.",
        "Well, I didn't really talk about it in the way that that was reported.",
        "I was taken out of context, and I did not say it was under consideration by this administration.",
        "What I was asked about, whether I thought geo-engineering needs to be thought about in the context of the climate question, and I said, from the scientific standpoint, of course it has to be looked at.",
        "We have to understand if there's any potential there, we have to understand what its costs and its downsides are.",
        "But there are vast, different set of possibilities for doing that.",
        "And then I said in the interview - although this part didn't get reported in most of the stories - that the approaches to geo-engineering that have been looked at so far mostly looked very expensive, of limited effectiveness and burdened by big side effects.",
        "That doesn't mean we should keep looking at them, but they're certainly not under consideration for use in this administration.",

        "That's not to say that there isn't still a lot of room for improvement.",
