        "How does an unmanned submarine help sailors trapped in a submarine on the bottom of the ocean floor?",
        "Well, in this case what happened to those poor sailors is they are actually in a rescue vehicle.",
        "These unmanned submersibles have cable-cutting abilities.",
        "If the only problem is that they have to cut a cable to free the other submarine's propeller to let it rise to the top, then everybody's in good shape.",
        "If there's more damage than that, it may not be enough.",
        "You have to just pray that everything goes like clockwork because every breath these men take is like another tick of the clock down from how long they have to live.",
        "If everything doesn't work absolutely perfectly, we're not going to get them out in time.",
        "And again, the problem is there's just not enough rescue gear around the world all ready where it needs to be.",
        "You almost wish you had rescue stations like firehouses, that there would be somebody close enough to get to you no matter what.",
        "But submarine rescue has never been high priority.",
        "And one of the reasons it's not high priority is most submarine accidents are not survivable.",
        "Most of the time you're not lucky enough to be in only 600 foot of water.",
        "You go down so far that the pressure of the ocean is so much greater than the internal pressure of the submarine that you're crushed, so you have to be lucky enough to have an accident in relatively shallow water, which 600 foot is.",
        "It's not shallow enough to just get out and swim, but shallow enough that the submarine will survive sitting on the bottom.",

        "Even with the gas we're going to spend, the hotels, all that, we're still going to save, from my calculation, a couple thousand dollars by driving.",
        "Gas prices, many will find, are much cheaper than they were last year.",
        "Tamra Johnson of AAA says gasoline is unusually cheap this summer with prices averaging about 2.24 a gallon nationwide and much lower in some states.",
        "We're looking all the way back to 2005 when we saw prices this reasonable.",
        "And so especially during the summer, we typically see prices start to rise, and that hasn't been the case for 2017.",
        "A record-breaking 44 million people will be traveling more than 50 miles from home over the July Fourth holiday weekend.",
        "Some will fly, taking advantage of cheap airfares, so airports will be packed.",
        "But 37.5 million people will be driving, so expect traffic to be bad.",
        "And more traffic also means more crashes.",
        "Maureen Vogel of the National Safety Council estimates nearly 600 people will be killed on the roads during the holiday weekend."
