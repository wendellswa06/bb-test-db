        "Exactly.",
        "Robin Kelly didn't have that much money.",
        "But she did have that independent PAC that focused their ire on Halvorson.",
        "Let's see: There is a vote coming up in the House of Representatives.",
        "It looks like the Violence Against Women Act is finally going to pass the Republican-controlled House.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, the Republicans will put up an amendment that, I think, it tries to save some money on, but basically, they will, for the most part - it's expected that the House will pass the bill that's already been passed by the Senate, and it will be signed into law.",
        "Interesting.",
        "And there is a lot of news this week about the sequester, including the interesting fact that the first, you know, recent meeting - I guess the first meeting of the year between the president and the leading members of Congress - is going to be after the sequester clock ticks down to zero on Friday.",
        "That's pretty remarkable, yes, because the sequester begins officially midnight on Thursday, after - you know, Thursday going into Friday.",
        "And it won't be until Friday, where President Obama sits down at the White House with Speaker Boehner, Mitch McConnell, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid.",
        "I think you are absolutely right, because, you know, every once in a while, you're absolutely wrong.",
        "We'll see if we can get one more caller in, but in the meantime, there is - there's actual movement, just in about 30 seconds or so, in the House on two of the big items on the president's agenda: assault weapons and Bob Goodlatte, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, a little give on immigration.",
        "And, of course, this is already leading to a lot of finger-pointing this week alone, the fact that they haven't met yet, why are they meeting after this sequester takes place?",
        "And two, the president is going around the country saying that - how bad the sequester is, and the Republicans saying this is really all of - it's a campaign event for the president because it's really, the cuts and the damage is not going to be as bad as the president insists it will be.",
        "And interesting, among his harshest critics, the journalist Bob Woodward, who's saying that the president is saying look, I'm not going to be able, because of the sequester, to send aircraft carriers to the Gulf.",
        "He said this is madness.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's very interesting how the Republicans are passing around Bob Woodward's column in the Washington Post, and the Democrats are saying, oh, no. Woodward has it all wrong.",
        "In the past, it's usually been the opposite.",
        "We have some people on the line who think they know the answer to this week's trivia question, and that is the last member of a president's Cabinet whose nomination was defeated in committee, but then he won confirmation on the floor."

        "Of course, he was President Bush's attorney general in 2001.",
        "That was a 50-50 Senate then.",
        "And there were nine Democrats and nine Republicans on the Judiciary Committee.",
        "But because Russ Feingold, the Democrat, voted in favor of John Ashcroft, the Judiciary Committee supported it 10 to eight.",
        "So he did pass the committee.",

        "I'm not sure he ever got to - he was going to be nominated, I think, for Homeland Security, but I don't think his nomination ever got to the Senate.",
        "That's correct.",
