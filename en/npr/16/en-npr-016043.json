        "There's a question of whether the state is going to take over the city.",
        "Dave Bing, you know, a very popular guy, he was a great ballplayer of course, of course, but at the same time Detroit's finances have been in big trouble for many, many years, and he just has a tough battle.",
        "But he should win re-election.",
        "Ryan Holeywell, I wanted to turn back to you.",
        "As we look at the role of the mayor in American politics, you'd think it would be a guaranteed step up to higher executive office.",
        "You do have the former mayor of Denver, currently the governor of the state of Colorado, but it's - that seems to be unusual.",
        "Well, it's sort of interesting, and sort of the way I've heard it described by some people who've served talked about this phenomenon is that these guys tend to love their cities so much, people from elsewhere in the state are skeptical of whether they'll have the same attention.",
        "That was the Ed Koch problem when he ran for governor in '82.",
        "Right.",
        "Against somebody from Queens.",
        "Right, Mario Cuomo.",
        "And the last governor, the last mayor who became president, you know, was Calvin Coolidge.",

        "The other challenge that I think a lot of these mayors encounter is that, you know, you look at what happens in city hall, and the work that a mayor does is very non-political, or nonpartisan rather.",
        "You know, you talk to these guys, you go to the mayors conference, and when you have conversations with them, you really don't even know if they're Democrats or Republicans.",
        "To move up to higher office, you know, state legislature, governor, Senate, Congress, those are very partisan positions, and, you know, some of these guys just don't - aren't interested in that.",

        "In other words, in Los Angeles for example, the mayor cannot appoint police commissioner or education, the head of the board of education, whereas in New York City, for example, they have that power.",
        "So sometimes the mayors are hampered by the lack of strength in the charter.",
        "Yeah, and, you know, I think when you look at the mayors and sort of the role of mayors across the country, I think sort of regardless of whether they're a strong mayor or whether it's a system where they have a city manager doing a lot of that sort of work, I think sort of the sort of most important role of the mayor and what they can really utilize is that power to communicate.",
        "And that's sort of their biggest asset is that bully pulpit, advocating for their citizens, talking to the media, making the case for their city to businesses.",
        "And sort of the mayors who really seem like they excel the most are the ones who really do the best job at being able to communicate their message."
