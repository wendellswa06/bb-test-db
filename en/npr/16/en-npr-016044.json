        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, that's one of their big issues, but they're focusing on other issues, too.",
        "You know, one of the big issues that they're working on right now - they're actually in town working on this issue right now - is trying to figure out ways to ensure that they're still able to fund their infrastructure, a big problem that cities across the country are dealing with.",
        "They're trying to figure out ways to deal with the immigration issue, trying to see if they can play a role in that debate as Congress is looking like they're going to address that this year.",
        "So it's sort of an interesting role that the mayors have, in that they're at home, you know, trying to solve(ph) their cities.",
