        "I mean, you've just done something that, first of all, nobody is ever going to know you did it.",
        "Second of all, you defeated things that were supposedly undefeatable.",
        "And third is you're leaving the country, and you had a great time.",
        "Things that are supposedly undefeatable, these are the most sophisticated door locks and then their camera systems and special, you know, lasers, I assume, that detect you if you're moving inside, all that sort of thing?",
        "Well, back then, we didn't run into any of those.",
        "But there were, you know, like safes and locks and, you know, alarms and things like that that had to be overcome.",

        "Well, as it explains in the Smithsonian article, the - I was - first of all, I wasn't allowed to go out to the field.",
        "And the article says that it was because there wasn't enough money in the budget.",
        "But what I found out later it's because the managers, who wouldn't allow me to go, were going to use that money to give them self bonuses at the end of the year.",
        "So they short-circuited the operations, and, you know, I had to go out cold, and that was not the way to do it.",
        "And so as opposed to driving up when the coast was clear, you drove up and got a signal from a source saying, hold on.",
        "Don't go inside.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And that, we should haven't known about that.",
        "There was no way that that should happened.",
        "And what actually did happen was that a maid was in the embassy that you had targeted that was not expected to be there, cleaning up, and, obviously, in the way.",
        "Well, part of the problem, too, was at one point, my group chief said, you don't have to send anymore questions to the field.",
        "They've asked - you've asked enough questions.",
        "And those are the kind of things I would have asked, and I had asked in the past.",
        "Those kinds of questions that they said, never mind.",
        "We were all set this time.",
        "Correct.",
        "Right.",
        "And it turned out those questions had not been asked or answered, at least not sufficiently.",
        "We were hanging out to dry.",
        "I mean, it was terrible.",
        "We were sitting in a car in a non-white neighborhood, you know, six white faces.",

        "And, you know, we're sweating, and we're waiting for the go-ahead.",
        "And then when we get in, there was no perimeter security.",
        "There was nobody to tell us that somebody is walking through the door or anything.",
        "Yeah, it was bad.",
        "And these are dangerous things to begin with and, obviously, things can always go wrong.",

        "Well, when I ran an operation, there were - well, first of all, the mission was the primary, but there were three heavy responsibilities within that mission.",
        "One was the safety of the team.",
        "If we got caught - I mean, especially depending on the target, you know, you're not going to be seen again probably because you're in the target's country when you're in something like that, you know, in the embassy.",
        "So if, for example, you broke into - I'm making this up out of whole cloth.",
        "Sure.",
        "The article in the Smithsonian does not identify the nations that - whose embassies you targeted, and I don't know anything about it.",
        "Let's say you broke into the embassy of, oh, Romania.",
        "As soon as you're in the embassy, you're on Romanian soil?",
        "Correct, correct.",
        "And so if they arrest you, you're going to get packed off back to Romania or maybe just disappeared.",
        "Well, most of the time, the local chief of station had some kind of - something in, or set up that he could try to get us out of the situation if something happen like that.",
        "But technically, no. They don't - nobody has to listen to the law - local laws because they're - you're in their country.",
        "And so did this job that, well, was not set up properly, did it go off all right in the end?",
        "Luckily, yes.",
        "But one - two other things I want to mention though.",
        "That there - not only the safety of the team, there was the reputation of the United States.",
        "I mean, if we got caught doing something, or in somewhere we shouldn't be, that would have been an international flap between our country and whoever else, and probably the country we're working in.",
        "And then the third and most important was the life of the agent.",
        "I mean, the CIA leans on agents almost, I mean, not exclusively but, you know, a large percentage of the time to gather information.",
        "And this guy was very critical to their operations.",
        "And when I came back and complained about it, nobody cared.",
        "There is - one of the important things, and we'll get to the aftermath of that in just a second.",
        "But one of the important things..."

        "Exactly.",
        "Correct.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "These are not easy things to do.",
        "Well, it's - that's where the, you know, patience and, you know, focus on what you're doing comes into play, and that's all you can do.",
        "I mean, we were - you're hanging out there when something is open, of course, especially in the situation that was described.",
        "In other situations, maybe they were given to us, and we'd work on them.",
        "But, yeah, that was very important.",
        "And you - I mean, if you had to, you made notes, you may took pictures.",
        "You did whatever you could to make sure everything was in the same place as you started out.",
        "And were you ever informed as to whether the codes that you received, well, were important, that they resulted in some important breakthrough or not?",
        "B-U-Z-Z.",
        "Well, normally after an operation, we get word that there had been X amount of - I mean, of intelligence reports written based on what we have found out.",
        "And that was just the tip of the iceberg because, you know, in a lot of places, we found stuff that would, you know, last several months, where they would be reporting, you know, day after day after day of intelligence, information.",

        "Well, the problem is, I mean, we - the agency had had this organization for probably about 30 years and there had never, ever been anything that close to screwing up.",
        "And, yeah, you're right.",
        "When I talked to the group chief and the office director right on up to the executive director of the agency, and all they worried about was me confronting them.",
        "And going outside the chain of command, as it were.",
        "Well, actually I went all the way up to chain of command one at a time.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And so it was just that they say we've got this squeaky wheel down there and he's a problem.",
        "That's it.",
        "That was it.",
