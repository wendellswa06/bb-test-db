        "And what did you decide to do then?",
        "Well, I decided to - May of '93 - let's see, well, we were negotiating from that point till 1997, we were - I was negotiating with the Office of General Counsel, which was the legal side of the agency and trying to resolve the whole issue.",
        "The whole issue of your departure from the Central Intelligence Agency?",
        "Correct.",
        "Plus, I filed a grievance and that was being investigated, which I found out wasn't really being investigated.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "But then there were other actions that you undertook to say, look, if the Central Intelligence Agency is not too interested in my skills anymore, maybe somebody else is.",
        "Oh, that's further down.",
        "My first reaction was from '91until September '92, I heard continuously, day after day after day, that what you did meant nothing.",
        "And finally, I said to somebody, yes, well, then maybe I should just cancel everything that I did if it meant nothing.",
        "And they thought I was joking.",
        "So finally in September of '92 when I realized I wasn't getting my job back, I had found a job.",
        "Somebody went behind my back and had me taken off the job within the agency.",
        "And so what I did is I wrote a letter to a foreign embassy and advised them that their - the equipment had been bugged.",
        "You could understand how this might not be entirely square with the CIA.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "But what I figured was because I had trained several of the FBI officers in Flaps and Seals and I'd also gone on operations with them, I knew a little bit about what they did within the country.",
        "And I didn't even figure that would get out of the country, the letters.",

        "Well, the only thing that the - when the FBI had talked to me, they said that they had picked it up from some foreign intelligence service that passed it to them.",
        "But when I was debriefed in 1998 by NSA, the lady who debriefed me was asking questions.",
        "We talked about the letters, and she said, don't you realize what those letters - how much those letters could've hurt NSA?",
        "So I don't think they got out.",

        "But - or wouldn't hurt them.",
        "But at the same time, I didn't expect them to get out.",
        "Then there is the issue of offering your services elsewhere.",
        "That was in 1997.",
        "What happened was is the agency sent me an offer for, you know, a contract, and the contract said, you know, that they would give me five or $300,000 over six years and then I would drop down to another grade and all that stuff.",
        "But what nobody knows is the contract - and I'll read it to you: Failure to comply fully with the above - without the discretion of the agency will be considered a breach of this agreement.",
        "Under such circumstances, the agency would have the option of terminating the contract.",
        "When I saw it, I said, they're not telling me the truth and I'm not going to back it.",
