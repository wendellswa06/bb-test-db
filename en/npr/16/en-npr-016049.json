        "So when President Obama took office, wind and solar energy were much more expensive than fossil fuels, and government incentives helped encourage companies to invest in renewables.",
        "Today, does that cost gap between fossil fuels and renewables still exist?",
        "You know, it varies from technology to technology.",
        "Obviously the subsidies help the sector, but in the end, in some markets, solar is competitive against natural gas and wind is competitive.",
        "And I think that what we're going to see over time is that even for states that we all might characterize as red states, they still have the incentive to offer renewable energy as part of their electricity grid because many Fortune 500 companies find that saying they've made a pledge to go 100 percent renewables is material to their business.",
        "And so how big a driving force is the private sector?",
        "What kind of commitments have we seen, and are those likely to change depending on the government?",
        "I think those commitments are here to stay.",
        "They're huge commitments made by companies like Wal-Mart and Google and Apple.",
        "So if you're a state, you basically have to offer renewable energy to those corporations.",
        "And I don't see that changing, regardless of whether the Trump administration focuses on the fossil fuel sector or not.",
        "I've heard a lot of people say oh, well, now that Donald Trump has won the election, there's no chance of the U.S.",
        "upholding the commitments that it made at the Paris climate summit to limit carbon emissions.",
        "Do you think there actually is a chance of the U.S.",
        "upholding those commitments under a President Trump?",
        "A lot of these kinds of policies are made on a state-by-state basis.",
        "And so the United States may not get to 100 percent of the commitment that President Obama made, but, you know, we do know that renewable energy is being adopted in the United States faster than expected.",

        "The difficulty with doing a deep cut is that over the longer period, of course, people will become malnourished.",
