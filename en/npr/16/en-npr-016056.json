        "And one of the things I started thinking about was, this is a sort of a document that - you know, in the old days, I think your mom and dad would write you a letter.",
        "As they sent you off into the future, they would write you a letter, and they would tell you the things they had always wanted to make sure that you knew.",
        "Now, I feel like we aren't communicating these things to our young people as much.",
        "The big thoughts, you know?",
        "Even something like that, like listen to your own instincts, like that's sort of a big idea in a way.",
