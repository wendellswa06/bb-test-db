        "Former CIA employee Jeffrey Sterling goes to trial next week on charges that he violated his oath and leaked classified information to New York Times reporter James Risen.",
        "Up to this point, Sterling's legal plight had been largely overshadowed by Risen's First Amendment arguments.",

        "It now seems that Risen will not be called to testify as a witness by the prosecution.",
        "NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is here with us in the studio to talk about the case.",
        "And first, who is Jeffrey Sterling, and what do prosecutors say he did to broke the law?",
        "Robert, Jeffrey Sterling is a former CIA worker who once sued the agency for employment discrimination, and prosecutors say he leaked information on an operation targeting Iran's nuclear capabilities and some other classified material to Jim Risen.",
        "Risen's a reporter at the Times, and he put some of that material in his book, called \"\"State Of War.\"\" That book wound up embarrassing the CIA because it describes some of the operations it undertook as ham-fisted.",
        "And now Jeff Sterling faces several charges of unauthorized disclosure of defense information.",
        "The law in question here is the 1917 Espionage Act.",
        "Sterling could spend dozens and dozens of years, if he's convicted, behind bars.",
        "This case has been kicking around the courts for years.",
        "Why is it taking so long?",
        "Largely because of the legal fight over a prosecutor's decision to subpoena testimony from Jim Risen, the New York Times reporter.",
        "That decision was initially approved by the Justice Department in the Bush years, and then President Obama's administration reapproved it.",
        "The fight went all the way up to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which sided with Justice.",
        "And the the Supreme Court refused to hear the dispute.",
        "That took years.",
        "Groups, including Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, have backed Risen all the way.",
        "They've been saying that he should not be compelled to testify against the source.",

        "Risen only very reluctantly confirmed basic details about the case, and he said explicitly on the stand he did not want to add to the mosaic prosecutors may be trying to build to convict Jeff Sterling.",
        "That said, Robert, Risen still could be called by defense lawyers for Jeff Sterling in the course of the trial.",

        "Nothing's got the approval of Congress so far, though, because it's really hard to define in this age of blogging and tweeting who counts as a reporter.",
        "In the meantime, the Justice Department has slightly adjusted its guidelines.",
        "It now requires higher levels of approval at DOJ before subpoenaing reporters.",
