        "There's a piece on this record, it's called \"\"Decollage,\"\" and it seems to hint at Stanley Kubrick's use of Strauss in \"\"2001.\"\" And I don't know whether you thought of that, but did you sort of borrow from other science fiction scores in your compositions?",

        "A federal appeals court unanimously supported the Bush administration's right to conceal the names of those from whom it seeks advice.",
        "The case began four years ago when Vice President Cheney's energy policy task force solicited opinions from private energy executives.",
        "In response, two groups, the Sierra Club and Judicial Watch, promptly sued for disclosure.",

        "This case bounced from an appellate court to the Supreme Court, which sent it back to the appellate court, and the first time the appellate court upheld the judge's order to reveal names of those who advised Vice President Cheney on energy policy.",
        "Now why did this same court unanimously rule in favor of the administration?",
        "It's a fascinating decision because it restrikes the balance between the White House concern with what it asserts is its interest in being able to consult broadly within the administration, but also with outsiders, on the one hand, and the view of some public interest groups that there ought to be as much sunshine as possible on the way the White House does business.",
        "Do you think the court was right in this ruling, or was it right the previous time?",
        "I actually think it was right in this ruling.",
        "First, let me emphasize that this ruling was what's called an en banc ruling, so it involved all of the judges on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, Democrats and Republicans alike, and they ruled unanimously.",
        "So that in itself is quite significant.",
        "But the second point is that this opinion, unlike several others that judges have issued, seems to me to demonstrate much more sophistication in appreciating what it's like to be in government trying to make complicated public policy decisions.",
        "I'm actually of the view, having served in two administrations at the White House, that too much sunshine can actually inhibit sound decisionmaking.",
        "The problem here is not that the public is unaware of who met with whom.",
        "The problem is that a lot of people in the public, myself included, don't like the policy choices that were made.",
        "The remedy to that is not forcing full disclosure of every meeting and every conversation, or putting TV cameras in every office in the West Wing.",
        "The remedy to that is to elect different people to political office, and also to see to it that when decisions are then delegated from the White House to administrative agencies, that they obey the law in allowing full participation at that stage.",
        "Why is it important that any presidential administration be allowed to withhold certain information from the public?",

        "He was the former executive director of the Christian Coalition, he has ties in that social conservative movement and he pushed for these anti-gambling grassroots activities on Abramoff's behalf, but it turns out Reed was doing it to create a clear path for those other gambling interests.",
        "Reed says he didn't know he was working on behalf of gambling interests, but there's some e-mails out there that he sent that suggests maybe he did know.",
