        "Another story about this march - the army was followed by legions of slaves who were being freed.",
        "Was this a march to free the slaves?",
        "Sherman was adamant that the last thing he wanted was a large procession of African-Americans following after his armies.",
        "He was willing to take the young, strong guys.",
        "He could use them to build roads and cut down trees and do those sorts of things, but he didn't want the children, the women.",
        "But look, this was freedom, it was there for the first time in many of their lives, and a large number of them just dropped everything and followed the armies.",

        "We rented some big tympanis and we put them on a lot of the songs.",
        "But I think all the other references to science fiction (unintelligible) is more like in our subconscious because we do music in very instinctive and spontaneous way, and then when we listen to the record, it's, oh, this reminds me of this movie, this reminds me of this movie.",
        "You know, it's in our blood.",

        "You've done work for Sofia Coppola's films \"\"The Virgin Suicides\"\" and \"\"Lost in Translation.\"\" How did you do the music for this?",
        "Did you watch it over and over and over again, you know, with instruments in front of you?",
        "Yeah.",
        "We watched the movie all day long for like one month.",
        "It was, like, very intense.",
        "At some point, I remember where I was so familiar with the movie that I feel part of the team back in 1902.",
        "And I can see how much fun they had to shoot that movie.",
        "I can feel the energy, the fact that they were so young by the time.",
        "I discovered that with \"\"Virgin Suicides\"\" because when you look at a movie all day long, you start to know all the moves of the actors and you know exactly what they are doing, and so you feel part of the set at some point.",
        "So I really felt after one week I'd been hired by George Melies to compose the music of his movie, you know?",

        "I felt part of the whole process.",
        "It was very strange.",
        "And Melies did not write a soundtrack for this film in 1902, right?",
        "No.",
        "He was not thinking of music when he was doing this movie because cinema was not associated with sound.",
        "And when they asked us to do that, we wanted to be sure that really he had no indication, no recommendation, he really had no thought about any music on the top of it because we never wanted to take the place of someone else or to betray the work of a composer.",

        "And we are playing this kind of record to our music, so it's sort of an artistic fight.",
        "I read that you guys worked on a very tight schedule to finish this music.",
        "Why?",
        "Because I think they were so scared not to be able to achieve such ambitious restoration process.",
        "And when they were close to finish, there were so much buzz around this movie that they decided to show it at the Cannes Film Festival.",
        "So they were not expected such a short deadline.",
        "So when they called us, they said, look, sorry, but one month from now, it's going to be shown at Cannes in the South of France.",
        "And that's it.",
        "There's nothing we can do about it.",
        "So we were pretty scared because we just finished the day or two days before.",

        "We were thinking, oh, my God, how can they dare to touch such a monumental cinema?",
        "So when we were in Cannes, I was very stage fright.",
        "And the light went dark and it was the giant screen - because we worked on a computer - I saw what we have done.",
