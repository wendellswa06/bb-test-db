        "In a lot of other places, the city was destroyed almost.",
        "And almost all the people have fled.",
        "So it's interesting and intriguing to see somewhere where life has come back so quickly.",
        "So what made the story in this city different then?",
        "Well, what it was, was the different tactics we used.",
        "The security forces made a huge effort to keep people from fleeing, partly because it's a huge city and it wasn't clear where all those people would go.",
        "And the security forces also attempted to move more slowly so as not to destroy so many of the buildings.",
        "You do see, you know, battered buildings in the city, bullet holes sprayed across walls and the occasional building that's just been pancaked by an airstrike.",
        "But a lot of it is livable.",
        "Livable, I guess, but people still living in a city where ISIS is controlling an area that is so, so close.",
        "So things can't feel all that normal.",
        "Right.",
        "Exactly.",
        "You don't forget it for very long.",
        "So as you said, ISIS is still controlling the western side of the city.",
        "On the other side of the Tigris River, they are firing rockets pretty indiscriminately from that bank, which is landing on the east side.",
        "And they're also using drones.",
        "I met one lady, a teacher named Zainab (ph), who had stayed in her house throughout the fighting.",
        "And she pointed to me a house just a few doors down from hers where a family gathering had been targeted the day before by an ISIS drone, and several people were injured.",
        "And she also said to me that she was sure that there were still people living in their neighborhoods who had been with ISIS, who had supported ISIS.",
        "You know, there's a lot of fear and suspicion still.",
        "And what about basic needs, Alice?",

        "It's a struggle.",
        "They are getting food in there.",

        "So in the fighting, the main water pipe underneath the river was broken.",
        "And several pumping stations were also broken.",
        "And that means, you know, for hundreds of thousands of people living in eastern Mosul now, they don't have water supply.",
        "And that might not seem like such a big deal after you've just survived a war and ISIS occupation, but there is actually, you know, problems getting enough drinking water sometimes.",
        "And obviously, it's not ideal not to have a sewage system.",
        "The U.N.",
        "is bringing in water, but it's a big city.",
