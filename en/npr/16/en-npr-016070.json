        "That's an important cut there because they don't usually talk about what is and is not allowed in such concrete terms.",
        "It shows that McCain is really trying to make the case that he got what he wanted, and there are outside groups that agree with him.",
        "For example the group Human Rights First looking at the legislation says yeah, we think this does not allow practices like waterboarding.",
