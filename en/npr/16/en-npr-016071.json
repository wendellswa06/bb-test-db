        "But if there's an idea you have, you just have to try it out.",
        "I mean, I had the idea, and I went with it so the outcome was sort of the best I could hope for, I guess.",
        "Dudley says he's received hundreds of requests to make dental aligners and one suggestion from an orthodontist that they go into business together.",
        "But he says he has no interest in any of that.",

        "He joined the town's first uprising and was captured.",
        "Captured, yeah, but not into jail - into secret basements of the security hands of the regime.",

        "You have grave violations of the Geneva Conventions clearly prohibited.",
        "And then when you peel that back, grave violations include cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.",
        "So peel back that layer and it includes serious physical or mental pain.",
        "Underneath that you've got the definition including the phrase non-transitory mental suffering.",
        "So you come to the question well, is waterboarding non-transitory?",
        "Some have said that as harmful as waterboarding might be, its effects don't last a very long time and so this multi-layer definition may actually allow things like waterboarding.",
        "So if Director Hayden was looking for clarity at the end of the day, how will CIA interrogators know what they can and cannot do?",
        "Well, the legislation will pass in some form, either this form or an amended form, or perhaps it won't pass at all.",
        "But if it does, then the General Counsel of the CIA will write a legal memo explaining what they believe is okay.",
        "And then some people are saying that at the end of the day this question of what is and is not permissible may actually be moot because it sort depends on accountability and the legislation as currently written would prohibit detainees from filing lawsuits challenging their treatment under the Geneva conventions.",
        "Some have said well, if that language stays in the bill, and it's upheld, then with no court accountability, there really is no way to challenge people who perhaps may have been interrogated under techniques that are not allowed in the legislation."

        "On the flight home, President Bush told reporters aboard Air Force One that success in Iraq doesn't mean an end to all violence and at the Rose Garden event he elaborated, saying such a standard would give a handful of murderers power to determine success."

        "To some degree, it depends on how you interact with them.",
        "If you simply go to Google, for example, each day and never signed up for any of their services, they will know that you came from a particular computer, a particular IP address, sort of your internet telephone number, and they may be able to, over time, know that you made certain kinds of searches.",
        "But they don't know who you are personally or anything like that.",
        "If you sign up for one of their services, for example, they have a personalized search service, they'll start keeping a record of what you've searched for and that would be associated with your Google account which would be associated with your name and if you actually decided that you wanted to buy things like video from them as they sell, then that would be potentially associated with your credit card number and your actual address and they have a better idea of who you are in that way.",

        "They might start showing you car ads because they know you are interested in cars based on your searching habits.",
        "So that's an example where they're targeting your search behavior maybe well after the fact of when you actually did that original search.",
