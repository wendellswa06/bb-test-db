        "I mean people do need to be more aware of it because they have these conversations with search engines, very private conversations about things that they wouldn't tell a doctor, they might not tell a friend, they might not tell their spouses, but they are almost confessing to the search engine.",
        "So you want to be aware of it and you want to be aware of it not just with what they are doing on the search engine, but even to the point that there's a record of what you're searching for on your own computer or even within your own browser.",
