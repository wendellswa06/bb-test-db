        "USAID officials declined to be interviewed for this story, but the agency says the US commitment to Afghanistan remains strong.",
        "Administration officials say one reason that funding for Afghanistan appears to have been drastically reduced is that the amount was inflated last year by a supplemental appropriation of about $3 billion.",
        "Much of that funding did go for security, to the Afghan army, police and counternarcotics efforts.",
        "But some also helped swell last year's total for reconstruction to more than a billion dollars.",
        "It's still possible that Congress could appropriate more money for Afghanistan, but lawmakers have shown little enthusiasm for increasing the commitment in the face of growing deficits, as well as disillusionment with the far more costly reconstruction efforts in Iraq.",

        "We have an obligation to these countries to help them in their reconstruction.",
        "But we need to do it with reforms in the system that will make sure that the money's being used wisely, that there's oversight, that the taxpayers are getting their money's worth when the funds are used for reconstruction.",
        "After nearly four years of a US and international presence in Afghanistan, all sides acknowledge that there's still an enormous amount of rebuilding to be done before the country is free from the risk of collapsing back into a failed state.",

        "It was when they could tell me, I said, `By God, I'm going to find them.'",
        "And so Emory, a retired mechanical contractor, embarked on a mission to identify Punchbowl's unknowns.",
        "But with no funding or official support from the military, the work has been painfully slow.",
