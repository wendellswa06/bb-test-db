        "Okay, so you're the parasite.",
        "You're happily freeloading off a mouse or a rat.",
        "But you need to get yourself into a cat to reproduce.",
        "So how do you pull that one off?",
        "Toxo does something incredibly elegant that it migrates up to the brain of the rat…",
        "Where, somehow, it changes the way the rat behaves so that the rat, when it smells a cat or cat urine, does not do the normal thing and run like hell.",
        "Instead, it makes the rodents decide the cat's smell is kind of nice, and they go right up to it.",
        "The cat pounces, catches the rat.",
        "The cat thinks, darn, I'm good.",
        "The rat thinks, what I am doing?",
        "And the Toxoplasma thinks, mission accomplished.",

        "Its offspring catches a ride out of the cat on cat feces.",
        "Another rat or mouse picks them up, and the whole cycle begins again."

        "If you really reflect on it, you get, sort of, the heebie-jeebies.",
        "Sapolsky read about all this five years ago in an obscure journal, and the question he had was this - what was the parasite doing to the rat's brain, so that the rats, instead of fearing the smell of a cat, are drawn to it.",
        "Sapolsky's lab bought some Toxoplasma, bought some rats, bought some bobcat urine…",
        "It never occurred to me, you could buy bobcat urine, but it turns out you can.",
        "And they tried to find out.",
        "They wanted to know how clever was the parasite.",
        "Was it making surgical strikes on specific circuits in the brain, or just generally wreaking havoc?",

        "What they've found, though, in visiting with families is, for example, I visited with a woman who had a small child who was in a half-body cast from the waist down, and we started talking about her family.",
        "She lost in the earthquake four of her six children.",
        "This little one was in a half-body cast.",
        "So you saw many families where part of the family was gone.",
        "They had lost several children, they'd lost brothers, they'd lost sisters, they'd lost aunts or uncles.",
        "And I know there will be many orphans from this, but most of the family structure in Pakistan is such that the extended family reaches out, and so most of these children do have some family left to still take care of them.",
        "And winter is approaching, and it gets very cold there.",
        "Are you afraid that more children will die?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And some of the things that are most important to prevent additional child deaths are keeping up the immunization programs, making sure that they have shelter, making sure that there is clean water and sanitation, because diarrheal diseases can be a very large component of a health-care issue for children.",
        "So all of these issues, all of these interventions are critical if we are going to avoid additional lives lost as a result of this disaster."
