        "I would imagine that this is immediately a perilous situation if somebody's heat goes off.",

        "Well, we did see some outages - some power outages on Wednesday morning just due to power lines breaking because of the heat.",

        "That can be another, you know, just kind of infrastructure-related problem.",
        "And so people are just really, you know, encouraging people who are low-income to keep their thermostat up and worry about paying the utility bill later.",
        "In my hometown, I was told the schools are closed, of course, but the school buildings have remained open.",
        "People can go there if the heat goes off.",
