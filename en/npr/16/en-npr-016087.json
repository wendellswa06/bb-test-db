        "This is something that the president's allies in Congress have had the same complaint about - that it's hard to know what he really wants, hard to get him on the record and keep him there.",
        "Yeah, Steve.",
        "And what Bill means by getting him in the room here is that he thinks one of Liu's goals today will be to convince President Trump to meet with Xi Jinping to make a deal.",
        "And if you look at the president's calendar, he does have an outstanding meeting planned with Kim Jong Un somewhere in Asia in the near future, so perhaps the thinking here is to have President Trump swing by Beijing at that time to put an end to this trade war once and for all.",
        "The hope of imposing these tariffs is that China would feel pain and feel more and more pressure over time to make a deal.",

        "China's Communist Party exerts economic and political control through these companies.",
        "And Xi Jinping is unlikely to cede that to the Trump administration.",
        "Oh, OK.",
        "So structural changes - no. What about changes to the use of trade secrets or the stealing of trade secrets or the handing over of trade information?",
        "Is China willing to change that?",
        "I think that's definitely going to be a part of what the Chinese will offer.",
        "This is something that the Chinese have already talked about when you look at their policy changes going forward - that they want to help IP protections inside of China, not only for U.S.",
        "businesses, but, you know, Chinese companies are now making stuff that's worth stealing, too, and so they want to protect their own business.",
        "OK.",
