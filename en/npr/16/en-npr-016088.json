        "Last Friday the 3G version of this came out.",
        "So, a whole new wave of people were buying the iPad on Friday at the Apple store.",
        "So far, app sales have been strong, 12 million apps downloaded for the iPad so far, 1.5 million iBooks sold.",
        "So the question now is, is that sort of ooh-ah effect of showing someone your iPad and then they run out and buy one going to continue to happen?",

        "They're doing it in a combative way.",
