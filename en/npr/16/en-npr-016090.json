        "Grant, welcome back to DAY TO DAY.",
        "We talked to you back in March when surf didn't show up for the International Mavericks Surf Contest.",
        "There were no big waves then, but looks a little different today, I guess.",
        "Yeah, except for we can't see it because of the haze.",

        "But we know that out there some of the biggest waves of the year are arriving.",
        "And sometime in the middle of the day, probably the largest wave of the year will be breaking at Mavericks, and if we're lucky we'll be able to see it and ride it.",
        "How big a wave do you think that'll be?",
        "I'm guessing it will be maybe 60 or 70 feet high.",
        "That's on the face, so they would call it 30 foot ocean swell, but that basically doubles when it hits the reef, so it wouldn't be shocking if they were 70 feet.",
        "So right now there's fog and haze, and you can't really see to get out and surf?",
        "No.",
        "Yeah, it's actually raining.",
        "These waves are really dangerous, even when you can see perfectly, and you really need to know where you are when you're in the water because when you're in the wrong spot, they beat you up a lot.",
        "So.",
        "You said surfers from all over the world have flown in for this?",
        "Yeah.",
        "How many people are there with you on the beach?",
        "Well, they've actually gone back to hide in their hotel rooms.",
        "A lot of them are tired and cold.",
        "Guys from Australia and Brazil; a friend of mine from New Zealand called.",
        "I know a friend from Africa left two days ago to get here for these waves.",
        "He's the actual current champion for Mavericks.",
        "And people know about this because these surfers watch these kind of satellite weather reports, and so you can tell that these conditions are going to be there and then everybody comes in for them."

        "Yeah.",

        "You know, we know the swell is out there.",
        "We know giant waves are coming because there was a huge storm just off our coastline a couple of days ago.",
        "And so that's why the guys are here, but they also understand that we might not even get to go in the water.",
        "Well, what is going to have to happen today for you to go try it?",
        "We need to be able to see the land.",
        "The break is quite away offshore.",
        "And if you're just out there and you can't even see the rock where we line up, then you're pretty much a sitting duck.",
        "So we need to be able to see something and once that happens, we'll have to see, assess, whether the waves are too dangerous to surf because of the surface condition, like bumps on the face can make it too dangerous, or sometimes the currents can make it really, you know, a challenge.",
        "What is a bump on the face of a wave?",
        "I think, you know, like a stairwell.",
        "Pretend you are going to take a skateboard and try to go down a big hillside and then halfway down there a stairwell appeared in the middle of your sledding hill.",
        "It throws you off and makes it difficult to turn and it can be the reason that you take a really bad wipeout.",

        "There is another place that you said symbolized the question of both the progress that's been made and the questions that remain, and that is a place called Marja, which we remember from a couple of years ago, the site of - well, it was a Taliban stronghold, and many U.S.",
        "Marines died retaking it.",
        "Exactly, two years ago, it was considered a no-go zone for not only the Americans, but Afghans, as well.",
        "It was really a nest of Taliban fighters and drug traffickers in Helmand Province in the southwestern part of the country.",
        "Today, Marja is a completely different story.",
        "It was really the only place I could go in the country out on patrol and take off my, you know, combat helmet and walk around in this marketplace.",
        "And one of the reasons is there are so many government troops there - you know, the government being the U.S.",
        "government, Marines, Afghan soldiers, Afghan police, Afghan local police, which are, in essence, sort of an armed community watch.",
        "There are thousands of them all over the place.",
        "And that's keeping the security.",
        "Again, the big question is: As the Americans pull out their troops in large numbers by September and then into next year, can the Afghans pick up and do it on their own?",

        "I went back as a civilian advisor in 2009 and 2010, and I think things had really changed over those few years.",
        "So by the time - you know, we got to 2009, and I think that the American patience with the war had been ground down.",
        "The casualties from Iraq, the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had really begun to weigh on the American people, and it dawned on U.S.",
        "and allied commanders that we didn't have all the time in the world and that we had to get serious about our exit strategy.",

        "Building up key institutions within the Afghan state to allow us to leave.",
