        "Until there's some semblance of feeling of the - especially out of the rural areas in the mountains toward Kabul as their capital, rather than just the tribal area, it's not going to work.",
        "We're wasting our time and our money.",
        "Tom Bowman, we've been talking about security.",
        "He's talking about a much larger political question.",
        "He raises a very good point.",
        "And the United States government really hasn't pushed hard enough on corruption issues over there.",
        "They're going after some small fish here and there.",
        "And I gathered some string when I was over there - you know, embedded with U.S.",
        "forces with certain officials over there, talking about corruption.",
        "But they really haven't made this a priority.",
        "The issue is...",
        "Just want to interrupt and say gathering some string means he hasn't done the piece yet.",
        "Exactly, yeah - still working the story.",
        "But the thing is that the focus has always been, in the U.S.",
        "government, how many troops do we send, how many do we not send, how many do we reduce.",
        "Going after these hard issues like corruption has not been a priority yet, and that's a clear problem with the way ahead here.",
        "And the caller's absolutely right: If people don't feel loyalty to the government, that's why you have insurgencies.",
        "You have insurgencies when the government is predatory, when it's nonexistent, when it's not there to help you.",
        "It's going to be a continuing problem in the coming years.",
        "And Andrew Exum, it's not just that, there are loyalties to local commanders, local leaders, local warlords.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, there's a lot to unpack with that caller's question and comments - I mean, first off, the issue of centralization and decentralization.",
        "Afghanistan has a centralized government enshrined in the constitution.",
        "That's not traditionally the way that Afghanistan's been governed.",
        "I think what we, the United States and the rest of our Western coalition want is not necessarily a strong, centralized state, but a state at peace with itself.",
        "That was Afghanistan for the vast majority of the 20th century, when Afghanistan was the exception in Asia and wasn't - didn't get caught up in, you know, global conflicts or violent insurgencies, really, until the Soviet invasion and the Marxist coup that preceded it.",
        "With respect to legitimacy, you know, it's always a relative thing.",
        "We political scientists talk about it in terms of legitimacy being the degree to which existing institutions are thought most appropriate for society in comparison to alternatives.",
        "And one of the issues we've had in Afghanistan is that everybody who's currently trying to rule Afghanistan has already tried and failed."

        "I wish that only the bad guys were making money off of poppy.",
        "Unfortunately, you know, a lot of our key allies in Afghanistan and many local powerbrokers also make money off the poppy trade.",
        "It's, in many ways, tangled up within the binary conflict between the government and the insurgency, but it's by no means black and white.",

        "But I would also like to say that it doesn't seem as if there's much emphasis on infrastructure in Afghanistan.",

        "When I was over there last year in Marja, there was a Marine gunnery sergeant running education programs there, and that has to stop.",
        "They have to have more educated Afghans taking a vested interest in their government, and not only working as translators for the Americans.",
        "I mean, first off, I've learned a lot from Marine gunnery sergeants over the years, but it's probably not the ones you want running your schools.",
        "In terms of infrastructure, just a point of interest here, you know, when the Afghans and the Americans talk about transition, they're really talking about two different things.",
        "When the Americans are talking about transition - the Americans and our Western allies - we're talking about transfer of lead security responsibility.",

        "What infrastructure do we have to not only raise taxes, but then to disperse income to, you know, to build, you know, everything from schools to roads to sewage treatment plants.",
