        "So that really was able to show me.",
        "And the other part that maybe even is more important was just taking a look at all the different changes.",
        "One of my first jobs in the Navy, I was a navigator, and this is well before we had the global positioning system.",
        "So I may be one of the few guys who actually still know how to use a sextant and all that sort of thing.",
        "And we are able to - when you navigate a ship, you don't just use one source of information.",
        "You use everything you can.",
        "And I kind of look at the climate the same way.",
        "So we look at the changes in the Arctic.",
        "We look at the melting of the glaciers.",
        "We look at what's going on with the ice fields, especially in Greenland but also West Antarctica, look at the changes of the temperature in the ocean, the changes of the ocean acidity, and all of that observations, all of that evidence, if you will, together, along with my now better understanding of what is driving the climate, has sort of taken me from the, hey, I'm not sure there's really anything here, to there really is, there really is some changes going on.",
        "And to make sure that our Navy is ready in the 21st century, we have to look at these changes just as we look at changes in the political spheres and the economic spheres and the demographic concepts.",
        "You say in a talk that you foresee the ocean level rising three to six feet in the 21st century.",
        "And that is a pretty high number, far above what the IPCC estimates.",
        "Do you have a plan for a worst-case scenario like that?",
        "And why is your number a little bit higher, or much higher?",
        "Rear Adm.",
        "TITLEY: Well, sure.",
        "Let's talk about the number first.",
        "I testified to the Congress back in November that, you know, we in the Navy believe that the sea-level rise in the 21st century is most probably going to be about a meter, so let's say a little over three feet.",
        "But what I told the Congress is if I'm wrong, I'm probably wrong on the low side.",
        "And the reason for that - and the IPCC, while they didn't have those kind of numbers, they knew there was something missing when you go read the full report.",
        "And the observations and the science since the IPCC report was released is showing us that the changes going on, especially on the Greenland ice field, but also in the Antarctic ice field, are much more rapid than have previously been seen.",
        "And you may have had, on previous shows, some of the - either the glaciologists or the oceanographers, but talking about how the warmer water is getting up into those fjords in Greenland, melting the bottoms of these glaciers.",
        "And the best example I can think of is, is if you think of, like, a medieval cathedral with flying buttresses, and those buttresses hold up the walls, well, if you start taking away those buttresses, or start melting the bottom of the glacier that was grounded in the fjord, all of a sudden the ice starts falling a whole lot more faster than it had before.",
        "We're still at just the very beginnings of understanding this.",
        "I think the science, it's - you know, if I was 30 years younger, this would be a wonderful thing to go get a Ph.D. in.",
        "But from a Navy perspective, a practical perspective, I think we're going to have to account for at least a meter of sea-level rise in the 21st century."

        "Well, how do you go to a Congress whose entering freshmen on the House side, many of them don't believe in global warming and may say to you we don't want our tax, military money spent on this silly thing?",
        "Rear Adm.",
        "TITLEY: Well, I think right now, and although that sounds, it's like - you know, can get people's attention, right now the observations show that the sea-level today is rising somewhere between three and three and a half millimeters per year.",
        "And it turns out - and I'll bet many of your audience knows that sea-level rise, somewhat like politics, is in fact - with apologies to Tip O'Neill - is all local, because you have to understand not only what the global sea-level rise is, which in itself is a huge challenge, but then there are local effects, and then even if the land is going up and down makes a big difference.",
        "So our secretary of defense, when he signed out the Quadrennial Defense Review, which is an overarching strategic document for our Department of Defense, has directed his staff, specifically an office called the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program, to do some very detailed studies of the impact of sea-level rise on some of our Department of Defense installations, and including places the Navy is very interested in, like Coronado, near San Diego, out in California; Camp LeJeune, where we have a major Marine base; and the Norfolk, Virginia area.",
        "And that - those studies will probably take about two years or so.",
        "And I've been asked before, it's like, well, geez, can we wait two years?",
        "And I said: Well, two years is about seven millimeters of sea-level rise.",
        "I think we can wait seven millimeters to try to really understand and get the right answers so that while we do not - absolutely cannot be caught sort of behind - behind the changes, we also do not want to spend money too soon or what we would call ahead of need.",
        "So we have time to get the answer.",
        "Now is the time to start acknowledging that we need to look at these studies, and the secretary of defense has directed those studies to happen.",
        "And what would - if the studies verify what you're saying, and I don't think there's any reason to doubt that what you're saying about sea-level rise is real, what actions, what are the first actions that the Navy would take to combat the sea-level rise?",
        "Rear Adm.",
        "TITLEY: I think, Ira, that each place is likely to be different.",
        "Give me an example of - pick a place.",
        "Tell me what - let's say San Diego.",
        "Thanks, Juan.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Rear Adm.",
        "TITLEY: Okay.",
        "For San Diego, I think again, and the studies will need to be done.",
        "But do you build slightly increased levees?",
        "Do you take a look at that?",
        "Do you take a look at raising some of the infrastructure?",
        "Do you - let's say if some of the hotel services underneath the pier, and as the water slowly comes up, do you need to, say, redesign those piers so that the hotel services would not flood, let's say, on a storm tide?",
        "So these are all things that our engineers in our naval facilities command, in our installations command, are starting to think about today.",
        "And again, while these numbers are very, very significant, we do have time.",

        "What - and if this isn't rehashing too much, but two questions.",
        "One is: What are the maybe top three or top five pieces of evidence that converted you as a meteorologist?",
        "And secondly: Do you in the Navy attribute any of the global climate change to human behavior, or are you all kind of staying out of that fray?",
        "Rear Adm.",
        "TITLEY: Okay, well, thanks very much for the question.",
        "First, the types of evidence that at least I've looked at, and I've talked with our senior Navy leadership, is really the Arctic, is I think sort of a harbinger of the of some of the largest examples of climate change."

        "We have seen not only the extent of the ice in the summertime, or September, come down dramatically, but even more so the total amount of ice or how much thick ice and thin ice is up in the Arctic.",
        "And we're seeing, really before our eyes, a very different system now in which - just 10 or 15 years ago, there was what people or scientists call multiyear ice, really thick ice last for years and years.",
        "It's probably five, 10, 15 or more feet thick.",
        "Almost all of that ice is now gone, maybe only 15, 20 percent - at the most - of the Arctic has that kind of very thick ice.",

        "As to the causes of climate change, again, when you look at the physics, you know, about the only things you can really change is you can change the sun and how much energy's coming in.",
        "NASA's done a pretty good job of measuring that, and it shows that pretty much within a couple of tenths of 1 percent the energy from the sun over the last 50 years has been pretty constant.",
