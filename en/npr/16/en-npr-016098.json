        "My feeling is that if every scientist who is prepared to study global warming instead studied alternative energy and conservation and what to do about it, that we would be much farther ahead, because scientific understanding never ends.",

        "And again, for the next two years, we see sea level rise, say, six or seven millimeters.",

        "We are working with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other federal agencies to fundamentally retool our ocean and atmosphere and ice prediction systems to make them, frankly, more relevant to sort of the human scale, not just global scale, but the human scale and human times - so seasonal, decadal times of times, the kinds of times that families, businesses, industry, government, military actually make budgetary decisions on.",
        "And we need to do that to, frankly, have credibility.",
        "As I'm sure your audience knows, while the large-scale effects of climate change are quite easily understood, when you come down to regional and specific effects that you're actually going to budget for and mitigate against, the science is much less certain.",
        "While we're not going to have ourselves parallel - paralyzed by analysis, we do need to invest in the right amounts of understanding before we spend large amounts of our taxpayers' money.",

        "But I think it's very encouraging that our senior leadership - our president, our secretary of defense, our chief of naval operations, secretary of the Navy - have been very consistent that this is one of the topics - not the only topic, by any means, but one of the topics that deserves serious, sustained attention.",
