        "And there are days where I'm on call or I'm on service where that means that I have to respond within a few minutes to the emergency department, where I have to run down and I have to begin my care for the patients.",
        "So a trauma surgeon is someone not in the emergency room.",
        "Physicians or trauma surgeon is someone who cares for someone when they hit the door to the months or the years afterwards that they get cared for.",
        "I have people I'd operated on 10 years ago, they come back and they see me and I could - I'll check them out and make sure they're OK and do the right thing for them, which is one of the reasons why I became a doctor was because I wanted to, you know, ride on my white horse and save the day, and I really get a chance to do that.",
        "When I'm a trauma surgeon, I could walk to work and I could see anything, and it really is pretty amazing the stuff that I see on a daily basis."
