        "Okay, so here I am, let's say driving around Cambridge, and I'm frustrated looking for a spot.",
        "And I whip out my phone - my web-enabled phone - and I go to your website and what do I find?",
        "You would log in with your telephone and pass code, which you get when you register.",
        "When you register, you also tell us the types of cars that you drive.",

        "It sounds like it takes a long time.",
        "By the time you do all of this, won't you lose your spot?",
        "The whole process takes about 45 seconds to find a space.",
        "And in the case of an on-street space exchange, they're not selling a public space.",
        "All they're selling to you is the information of exactly where they are and exactly what time they're leaving.",

        "You're saying they're not selling the space, per se, but just the information about the space?",
        "Well, it's fully legal to say, I'm leaving this area at this time.",
        "I'm not going to hold this space for you, but I'm going to drive out of that space at 156 Main Street at 4:43.",
