        "Yeah.",
        "The human body - particularly with a long-term mission, you have a tremendous amount of bone loss.",
        "On a Mars mission, they've talked there's been an estimate of you'd lose one-third to half of your bone.",
        "I mean, that's similar to - if you went into a wheelchair.",
        "I mean, it's a serious consideration.",
        "And on the lighter side of it, just the simple act of eating, crossing a room, going to the bathroom, these astronauts are, like, they're the most high-achieving people in the world, and yet you kind of have to send them back to preschool because they have to relearn everything.",
        "I've written a list of some of the things that you have written about in the book that I'd like you to respond to.",
        "I'm not going to give you the entire list all at once.",
        "I'll drop them off piecemeal, if we will.",
        "But let's start with this one, which I thought was really interesting and unusual, and that is the idea of being bored to death up there.",
        "That was the most amazing thing to me, that someone could be bored.",
        "Even on the way to the moon, there's a memoir by Gene Cernan about Apollo 17, and he says: A funny thing happened on the way to the moon - not much.",
        "Should have brought some crossword puzzles.",
        "And that just blew me away that you could be on the way to the moon, and yet it would be boring.",
        "More typically, it's the long missions of Mir or the International Space Station where you the scenery doesn't change.",
        "You can't go out for a walk.",
        "You're - I mean, the repetitiveness and the lack of color and, I mean, it just begins to seem mundane, and particularly when you're not you know, on a shuttle flight, you're busy.",
        "You've got so much going on and so much to do, I'm told, that boredom doesn't enter into it.",
        "But a long-term flight, yeah.",
        "It can be very tedious, apparently.",
        "What's the breakaway effect?",
        "Tell us what that is.",
        "The breakaway effect - this is something space psychiatrists and psychologists have talked about, and for a Mars mission, in particular, you -if we go to Mars, this would be the first time astronauts will lose sight of the home planet.",
        "Oh, sorry, that's Earth-out-of-view phenomenon.",
        "R-rated.",
        "Breakaway effect is something else.",
        "Breakaway effect, that was something way back in the early days.",
        "There was this notion that when you were flying, particular solo, that you would become enraptured with this feeling of power and that you would just want to go on and on and on, and that was a there was a lot of fear when they put the first man into space that he would just become enraptured by it and lose his mind and just, you know, want to take off and not be a responsible astronaut.",
        "So that was something - it didn't really come to pass, though."

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "One of the things that you talk a lot about, the food in space, I also notice that there's an issue of alcohol in space.",
        "What's happening with that?",
        "Well, there was a desire among some members of the space community to have either wine or beer aboard the spacecraft as something to, you know, a beverage with your dinner."

        "So it's very difficult.",
        "Coca-Cola actually came up with a way to do it, but the problem is that in the human stomach, if the gas bubbles don't rise to the top of the stomach, it's very difficult to burp, and it's very uncomfortable.",
        "So there was Coke available, and you could do beer in space, but the astronauts wouldn't want to drink it because they just sort of feel bloated and uncomfortable, and when you do burp, it's a little messy because some sort of liquid comes out, and then nothing works up there.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "You know, it's just - it's amazing all the different kinds of things that you have to take into consideration in space that we take for granted when we are here on the ground.",
        "And you went through some of the testing, I guess, would be the best way to describe it that the astronauts go through.",
        "And you described some of it as being more difficult, you believe, on the ground, on Earth, than it actually is in space.",
        "Yes.",
        "One example I'll give you, and it's something that obviously everybody can relate to: a toilet, an Earth toilet, doesn't work in space.",
        "You need gravity for that to work.",
        "So in space, they use air flow to sort of cause separation, as they call it, of the material from the body.",
        "It's a little gross.",
        "Forgive me.",
        "But now the problem here is you've got this very elaborate space toilet, and you need to test it.",
