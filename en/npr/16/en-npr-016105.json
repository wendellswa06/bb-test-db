        "The astronauts are still fairly protected within the electromagnetic field of the Earth.",
        "And when you get into these Mars missions, even the lunar missions, the astronauts always have to be able to get back to their land, or if there was a major solar event on the sun, then they would have minutes to get to the shelter before they would die on the surface.",

        "And there are astronauts who feel that that would be a nice way to close their career.",

        "But you mentioned the shielding.",
        "And one of the interesting things that I learned about - the thinking is that, you know, because hydrocarbons are pretty good at radiation shielding, that you would use your food on your way out to Mars as shielding, and then you would actually save the astronauts' waste material and make kind of shingles and use that on the way back.",
        "So that way, you wouldn't have to carry the shielding.",

        "I understood the bones will actually be soft to support the human body.",
        "Is this true?",
        "You would have bone loss, anywhere from, what I've heard, on a two-plus-year Mars mission, you would run the risk of one-third to one-half loss of bone density, which is significant.",
        "It's on a par with someone being in a wheelchair, wheelchair-bound.",
        "You definitely need to be exercising.",
        "And, I mean, and there isn't, at this point, an ideal countermeasure.",
        "I mean, there's a lot of exercising on treadmills.",
        "Of course, you have to bungee yourself to the treadmill to get any kind of approximation of weight-bearing exercise in zero gravity.",
        "So that is a huge challenge, and that is one more thing to be concerned about.",
        "Before we take a call from Kentucky, here's another email that we got: How long does it take an astronaut to adjust their sleep pattern without gravity?",
        "You know, I think it's different for all different astronauts.",
        "I know that they do fly sleep medications because, you know, if you listen to NASA TV - and I'm the kind of geek who does.",
        "I love NASA TV - they'll say: The astronauts are entering the pre-sleep phase with sleep at 11:58, and the wakeup call will be in the morning.",
        "And it's like exactly eight hours later to the minute.",
        "So, you know, who can sleep like this?",
        "And plus, the schedule is changing all the time.",
        "So sleep meds are your friend, I think.",
        "Well, you know, one of the interesting things you wrote in the book about, talking about sleep, was that no snoring is allowed.",
