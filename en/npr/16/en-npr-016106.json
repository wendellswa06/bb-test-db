        "There was when I was at the Japanese Space Agency, I observed they were doing sort of an isolation of 10 candidates to become astronauts.",

        "How has NASA dealt with this?",
        "Well, when I asked about that, because I had heard this term called space stupids, that you get a case of the space stupids.",
        "And I had thought that was specifically an effect either of something unique to space.",
        "I didn't realize, in fact, what they were talking about - what I was told that the space stupids has to do with lack of sleep, stress, possibly medication that you're on, all the sort of stresses that astronauts deal with on a short mission, and that it's the same thing as, you know, you cramming for exams one week and being up late and a little discombobulated.",

        "Well, there were guns I'm not sure of the current protocol, but in the earlier, you know, way - going back to the beginning of space travel and the - there were rumors that during the first spacewalk, Alexey Leonov, there was a rumor that if he couldn't get back into the capsule for some reason that his crewmate was supposed to shoot him.",
        "And I looked into this, and in fact, that is not true.",
        "The reason that they carried little pistolets again, it has to be lightweight, this is space pistolet, the reason was because when they come down, it's not a water landing like we had with the U.S.",

        "Hi.",
        "I've wondered - I've heard a lot of space shows and no one - in science fiction, you solve the gravity problem by spinning the space station or the vehicle so that there's at least half of gravity, and that would solve a lot of the problems like bone loss and toilet design and all kinds of stuff.",
        "Yes.",
        "Why don't they do that?",
        "Is there some real difficulty with...",
        "I think - well, the - it's a big, moving part.",
        "And my understanding is that - it just - it makes the design very complicated and that - but, yes, you're right.",
        "That would be the most effective - like in \"\"2001,\"\" when Keir Dullea is jogging on that big ring in the - in space, a similar thing.",
        "It would just sort of spin you outward toward the edge of it and you'd be running along like - kind of like a hamster in a wheel sort of thing.",
        "And that would work.",
        "And I think it's - there have been attempts that have sort of stalled and any number of - sort of typical space program problems probably brought it down.",
        "Thank you for that call.",
        "You know, one of the other things that you talk about in the book is that you have people from different nations going up together to the space station, for example, and that creates or can create certain cross cultural kinds of problems - communication, for one, and other things.",

        "The thing is, though, with a mission, the crew have trained together for some duration of months or even, in the case of Mars, probably it would be years.",

        "So he brought, apparently, it was kind of a thimble for the wine, and then a little, tiny host.",
        "And he did kind of a do-it-yourself communion there on the moon, with the guidance of his - I'm not sure what denomination it was.",
        "What about travel outside, when you're tethered to the spacecraft?",
        "As we've already indicated in the news just today, that they're going to be doing that this week and there's some repair work at the space station that needs to be done right now.",
        "How much of an issue is that as far as preparing and being able to, you know, pull off what's necessary?",
        "Well, normally, when you go up on a mission that's going to involve an EVA - they call it extravehicular activity - outside the spacecraft, a space walk, they will have rehearsed it in this huge swimming pool called the neutral buoyancy tank, and they'll - you'll be floating - the astronaut will be - put -will put on his spacewalking suit, the big, kind of bulky, white, marshmallowy thing.",
        "He'll put that on, and he will go - he or she will go through and rehearse exactly the things that he or she will have to do.",
        "And it's because you're out in the void, you've got - you got a lot of handholds all over the outside exterior of the spacecraft.",
        "It's looking like a nursing home.",
        "There are handrails everywhere, because you're holding on for dear life.",
        "If - you know, you don't want to let go and drift away.",
        "There are -everything has to be tethered.",
        "And your gloves - they're pressurized, so it's tiring to use your hands, and so there are special tools that are involved to make the task simpler.",
        "A lot of bolt tightening and, you know, pushing something in and pulling it out.",
        "There's not a lot of fine detailed work, because it is so difficult to use your fingers.",
        "But one statistic I heard, for a six-hour EVA, this astronaut told me, 250 hours in the tank training for it.",
        "That's amazing.",
