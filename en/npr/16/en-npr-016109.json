        "So they need to go to places that can provide it.",

        "I did.",

        "They had left at the end of high school, had gone into furniture work and now suddenly, and in a very short period of time, seen that their world was turned upside down.",
        "One of the things that was so striking in Lenoir, and this really speaks to the speed of the global economy today, is how fast those jobs disappeared.",
        "As you just mentioned, it was a matter of five or six years and thousands of jobs in this small county, more than two-thirds of the furniture jobs there, which really was the mainstay of the economy.",
        "So, it was a real shock.",
        "They went back for two and three years of information technology training.",
        "They had to learn to do homework again, write papers again, learn all kinds of terminology, and I really admired the efforts that they put in.",
        "In the end they were not able to get what they wanted.",
        "They did not get hired by Google.",
        "One of them was able to get an information-related job at the community college.",

        "In middle age, when you're an older worker, you're competing against younger workers, new ideas, to make that leap.",
        "Well, one of the people you talked about was - did get a job at Google but was 23 years old.",
        "Exactly, and that was kind of - that was the other lesson, one of he big lessons I learned from this piece and that was the generational change.",
        "The people who lose the jobs who are in their 30s, 40s and 50s, they're often not the ones who get the new jobs.",
        "And this was the son of a furniture factory worker.",
        "So, in his life, you had this generational change from the old economy to this sort of new slightly growing nascent new economy.",
        "And what happens to those people, the 40- and 50-year-olds who can make the transition?",
        "Well, in a place like Caldwell County in western North Carolina, there are not a lot of jobs in general.",
        "And so, many of them have really struggled.",
        "There are on unemployment.",
        "They have gone back to get GEDs.",
        "Many had actually left in eighth or ninth grade.",
        "So, they're not that competitive to begin with in terms of getting a job.",

        "So, in order to make ends meet he had to work a lot harder at jobs that I think he - you know, he's happy to have them.",

        "And the irony of working at Wal-Mart.",
        "The jobs that are sent overseas go to China, which is where they manufacture furniture to be sold by Wal-Mart.",

        "A curious twist, I mean, the story ended up being full of twists because I followed these folks for a while, is that Wal-Mart actually became a safety net for laid-off furniture workers.",
        "There were - at one Wal-Mart I went to in Granite Falls, which is just south of Lenoir, employed 30 laid-off furniture workers.",
        "And to give you a sense of how competitive things are in Caldwell County, in that area right now, when there's a job opening at Wal-Mart there are 300 applications for every job.",
