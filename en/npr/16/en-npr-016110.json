        "Excellent question, and Google will not say.",
        "I can tell you that when I was in the Google data center, I did meet a few people from Caldwell County, I met many people from North Carolina, but I don't think it was a lot of people.",
        "I think that one of the challenges - and again, this speaks to something we've been talking about earlier in the program and that is competition.",
        "Google can draw from all over the world.",

        "And is any of this retraining working or - are people finding jobs if they go study information technology or study for a job in the health care industry?",
        "Well, I think the real power of Frank's story is to remind us that - we sometimes in these economic times think that training is the whole answer, that the problem is we - there's a mismatch between people's skills and the work that's out there.",
        "And I think as Frank so beautifully said, in terms of - sometimes the math doesn't really add up, that the new jobs really aren't there.",
        "So we're training people to compete for a smaller number of jobs, or oftentimes there's a mismatch between the kinds of retraining we're doing and the kinds of jobs that are available.",
        "Give us an example of that.",
        "Well, in some cases we see people - oftentimes, blue collar workers are retrained for HVAC or truck driving or other kinds of blue collar skills and, actually, there isn't very much employment there.",
        "So again, I think we've got - what we really have to do is look at where the real jobs are, the numbers of jobs, and really tailor that training towards those jobs.",
        "And in those cases, though, I assume in some cases, this works?",
        "In some cases it works beautifully, but again, the real issue here is not so much training as it is jobs.",
        "And we need to sometimes step back and say the issue is not just the skills of individuals, but what are the jobs that the economy is creating?",
        "And I think this is one of the issues in Washington right now: Are we going to be involved in some kind of a jobs creation program to really try to nibble at the still-very-high unemployment numbers?",
        "Well, one of the things you saw at times of great demand for workers, and you think back to, well, ship-building during the Second World War and other situations like that, well, you know, they will train workers if they need them badly enough.",
        "Absolutely, and I think you're so right, Neal, that in terms of when jobs are there, training oftentimes isn't the issue because there's also kinds - many forms of on-the-job training one can do and many kind of training that employers do.",
        "So this idea of simply having workers train prior to employment is only one way that it can be done.",
        "And there is, again, the psychological penalty that we're talking about.",
        "Americans derive an enormous amount of identity from what they do for a living.",
        "It's often the first question you ask of somebody you meet for the first time."

        "Absolutely, and you know, there was a new New York Times poll out several months ago that talked about really the psychological impact of employment.",
        "And particularly for older workers, particularly for older men, as we saw here in the case of Bill Curtis(ph), a major impact on issues of self-esteem, self-worth, and these are very difficult to overcome, particularly in an isolated situation that oftentimes many workers feel in unemployment.",

        "And you'll be talking to them, and they'll be very composed and very professional, and then they will just begin to cry and cry and cry.",

        "They might be in their late 40s, and they're afraid that even if they can find a job, it's going to pay a third or a half of what they were earning, and they don't know how they're going to - how they're going to be able to pay for their kids' education.",
