        "But what we're not seeing is that new industry, that new area where we're seeing large numbers of job creations.",
        "So, the question, I think, remains unknown and I think that's one of the real questions we have to post to our politicians in Washington is: What kind of policies are we going to enact that will help to grow some sector of the economy where we can create hundreds and thousands of new jobs?",
        "It's very interesting.",
        "That's a great question that we just heard.",
        "I've been asking that question for a number of years here in Washington and I have yet to hear what I would considered to be a reassuring answer.",

        "People will say it is a very dynamic economy.",
        "Isn't there some wizard in a garage somewhere inventing the next computer?",
        "Well, apparently - hopefully so, but they haven't told us yet.",
        "And what people will often say, labor economists will say, technology changes very rapidly.",
        "We can't anticipate what it's going to be.",
        "I mean, Google is 10 years old.",
        "Think about it: 10 years ago, who would've imagined and now Google is an enormously successful company that employs several tens of thousands of people.",
        "That said, I think for ordinary people, the folks who are calling in today, that's not very reassuring because people don't really know.",
        "And certainly, when you look - when you talk to politicians, we don't have, you know, a really grand job strategy in this country.",
        "Don, thanks very much for the call.",

        "He's 65.",
        "And about 18 months ago, he was laid off from the survey job he'd been doing for more than 40 years.",
        "For him, as I'm sure for many others his age, it was difficult to, one, come to the recognition that he was not ever going back to that job - he hung on to that hope for a long time.",
        "And two, that he needed to figure out what other skills he did have.",
        "Having worked so long in one industry, he really had a tough time identifying new options.",
        "About two months ago, he began a job driving school buses, which he really loves and oddly, it's something of a family job since his father drove a bus for many years.",
        "I'm really proud of my dad for having the courage to make a try at something new, and we're all quite relieved that he has a paycheck again.",
        "So there is at least one story that turned out pretty well.",
        "Tom Juravich, thanks for your time today."
