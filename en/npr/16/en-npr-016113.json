        "Well, John McCain has been given a very rare opportunity in presidential politics.",
        "He's essentially been given a free run - a window of opportunity in which he, you know, can do whatever he wants while Obama and Clinton continue to fight it out for the Democratic nomination.",
        "It gives McCain a very rare luxury of going out and talking not only about the public policy differences between himself and the Democrats, but talking about himself.",
        "Normally, when a candidate talks about his or her own biography, it's not particularly newsworthy.",
        "But because the news media does need to cover the Republican nominee while they're covering the Democratic primary fight, McCain is getting a much larger media platform for that biographical story than he normally would.",
        "So just because the media feels the need to be balanced in its presentation, this is really helping him.",
        "He's getting some free time.",
        "No question about it.",
        "Well, he's on this, what he calls \"\"Service to America\"\" tour, going around the country to places he's been in the past.",
        "We heard him a moment ago on that.",
        "But doesn't the country really already know this guy, and often in a very positive way?",
        "How would you redefine yourself and why would you?",
        "Well, I don't know it's so much that McCain is redefining himself, but rather reminding voters of the things that they like and respect and admire about his personal and political accomplishments.",
        "What's interesting about this is that while the framing of the tour is biography, he does use it as an opportunity to talk public policy also.",
        "There was a piece on the Washington Post a couple of days ago, looking at how the Senator's using his time, saying that some Republicans think he's still running unconventionally.",
        "For instance, he does not have a full-time pollster.",
        "He does not have a political director.",
        "Well, John McCain tried running conventionally through 2006 and the first half of 2007.",
        "And the result was a campaign that almost collapsed to near bankruptcy.",
        "When you see news footage of Senator McCain, or go to his website for videos, do you ever look for signs that - because he's got a temper, he's known to have a temper.",
        "And how can you tell that he is pleased with the way the campaign is going, or maybe displeased?",
        "One of the fun things about watching John McCain is that while he is a very honest man, he has one verbal habit that can be somewhat misleading.",
        "And I should warn you on this one, Alex.",
        "When John McCain insults you, that means he likes you.",
        "When John McCain calls you \"\"my friend,\"\" that means he is sort of wary about you.",
