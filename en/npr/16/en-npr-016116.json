        "In one case, a university posted pictures of students who were allegedly smoking pot in a field or a park at the school, asking for people to identify the names of the students in the photographs.",

        "And I think the first step is just being aware of that fact, and that when you post online, you need to be responsible and teaching kids how to do this responsibly.",
        "I think then the next step beyond understanding what's going on and understanding the consequences of it is having the law try to help shape some of the norms of the blogosphere and of social network Web sites toward being more responsible as to what people post about each other, to how people behave in these settings, because right now, it's a kind of free-for-all."
