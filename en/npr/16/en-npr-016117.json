        "Rex Smith, the editor of the Albany Times Union decided not to identify that young woman in his newspaper, even though he and several members of the staff found out who she was.",
        "In a follow-up piece he wrote, he suggested to readers who wanted to know her identity: Knock yourselves out on Google, folks.",
        "Rex Smith joins us now from his office in Albany, and nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Well, thank you.",
        "I'm glad to be here.",

        "Well, you wrote it.",
        "I did.",
        "Why did you decide not to publish the name of this woman who was in the car of the congressman, even an ex-congressman?",

        "Yes.",
        "And I think that's true.",
        "And I think it goes to something that Professor Solove was just saying about social norms eventually shaping the conversation.",
        "There have been certain norms that had developed in journalism over the years, the centuries of its practice in the United States.",
        "And one of those is some concern for the privacy, for the rights of individuals who are private people rather than public people.",
        "The young woman in question is not a public figure.",
        "She is someone who apparently just had the misfortune of hopping into a car with a drunk ex-congressman that we didn't think that there was a reason for citizens to need to know her name.",
        "We didn't think there was a value to the community of her name being known.",
        "And that's one of the things that differentiate journalism, as it's practiced in this country, from simple conversation.",
        "We are not simply clerks of the facts.",
        "We're not a file cabinet from which stuff goes in and just comes right out.",
        "We do make judgments, and I thought, as an editor, that the appropriate judgment in this case was to limit the public information in this case because it just didn't seem to have a value to me.",
        "Though it's clear, you had a discussion about this, debate about it in the newsroom.",
        "We had - yes, we did.",
        "We had a conversation.",
        "It - we had - frankly, we reached the conclusion pretty easily though.",
        "Four of the senior editors, actually, just had a sort of brief conversation in my office, and I actually did look up, as a matter of fact, the code of ethics of the Society Professional Journalists, where there is a phrase that says recognize that private people have a greater right to control information about themselves than do public officials and others who seek power, influence or attention.",
        "So I thought that in this case, she was that kind of a person.",
        "And, of course, I know that in the modern age, people can get information on their own that we, in the media, would previously have been the sole gatekeepers of.",
        "That's the way of the world now.",
        "But as long as we still have mainstream media, as long as I'm still charged with setting the standards that this newspaper adheres to, I think we need to observe some of those standards, and one of those is that we'll give some concern to the privacy interest of individuals.",
        "Would the ease of finding the name of this person, would that be a factor at all in this?",
        "Because, again, somebody up there who's interested could find the name and put it on a blog.",
        "They might be able to.",
        "I don't know that it would be all that easy because the police were not releasing the documents in question.",
        "I do think that sometimes if something is easy to get, then it does affect your judgment.",
        "And I don't think there are blanket judgments as you can make about these things.",
        "That's why we still have human beings as editors instead of computers.",
        "And I think that these, by the way, are evolving standards and that editors, people in my position, are going to be changing the way they view this, even as we look at them now differently than we did a few years ago.",
        "And certainly, it's different in different products.",
        "I was just having a conversation this morning with a professor in our community who is upset by something that someone wrote about him in a blog that is hosted by our Web site timesunion.com.",
        "And it's a citizen blog that our Web site hosts and he thought that I should have taken down the comment."

        "Many years back, there was a site called the Nuremberg Files, which publicized the names and addresses and other identifying information of abortion doctors.",
        "And then, it would have doctors who had been wounded, shaded in gray, and doctors who had been killed with a line across their names.",
        "And this was used by people who wanted to do violence against these individuals.",
        "So what someone thinks is right, another person thinks is wrong.",
        "And if this is the way things are enforced in this kind of vigilante mob justice kind of way, with every individual making decisions for themselves about what is worthy of condemnation and what isn't, then we have to accept that even for the things that we might agree with, such as we might, you know, not like certain things versus things that we might want to protect.",
        "But someone else could have a very different idea.",
        "And, I think, that once we go down this road, things can readily spiral out of control, even for instances of shaming where people deserve to be shamed in some way."
