        "It's only been within the last 20 years that you've had states pass laws to try to address this problem.",
        "And it's only been within the last 20 years that you've had batterer intervention programs spring up.",
        "And so it's something that's, you know, I think that we're still in the early stages of dealing with this as a societal problem.",
        "You covered some of those meetings - the batterer intervention programs - and some people were eager to share their stories and see to get something out of it, other people were saying - told you afterwards - they're just not talking about the same situation that I faced.",
        "That's right.",
        "I talked to - most, as I said, most of the people who participated in these programs have been court ordered to participate.",
        "They've been charged with domestic battery or they've violated an order of protection and so the judge has said listen you've got to complete - I think it tends to be around 50, 60 hours of treatment.",
        "And if you don't we're going to lock you up or you are going to receive another type of court sanction.",
        "And so once a week these batterers, you know, often - I visited a program where you had - there were about ten men who gathered every week - and there are also programs for woman I should add.",
        "And so every week ten men got together and the two facilitators walk them through the problems of abuse and how to change their behavior.",
        "And I thought it was interesting.",
        "You sit in these programs and at first it looks, you know - it appears like the participants, they learn the language pretty quickly, you know.",
        "Once again, if they don't successfully complete they can be, you know, they can be, you know, they can receive other types of court sanction including jail time.",
        "So, they'll learn the language and, you know, I talked to the people who run these programs.",
        "Often times you will see man who will say, who learn the language, who say, you know, I'm going to be accountable for my actions.",
        "I understand they're wrong, I want to change.",
        "But even in one, you know, in the course of one evening you can see those men sort of explode later and say, you know, it's not my problem, you know, my girlfriend's the problem, and basically, flash signs that they do think that violence is justified, and that they're not changing.",
        "And people have gone - I mean I covered a story here in Chicago recently where a woman - actually the NBA player, Eddy Curry, his ex-girlfriend was recently murdered and her - as well as her 10-month-old child.",
        "And they guy who's been charged with the murders, he had been charged with domestic battery six times.",
        "He'd actually attended one of these battery intervention programs and successfully completed it.",
        "And so, he went on to be - you know, he'd also been - he'd also served on prob - you know, served two years of probation, and he didn't change, so - you know, and we've now got two murders on our hands here in Chicago.",
        "Let's turn, now, to somebody who's worked with abusers in a domestic violence rehabilitation program.",
        "Chris Murphy is a professor of psychology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and director of the New Behaviors Program at the Domestic Violence Center of Howard County, Maryland.",
        "Today he's with us from member-station WYPR in Baltimore, and it's nice to have you with us today.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And we've just heard Megan Twohey tell us about her experiences, pretty grim, as a reporter covering this for a year.",
        "Your vantage point gives you another perspective.",
        "Do abusers change?",
        "Well, I think that you have to look at the question sort of broadly.",
        "People change in all kinds of ways, with or without help, and we know that as psychologists."

        "For example, a lot of people quit smoking without being in smoking programs and quit drinking through self-help and various other means, and when we're talking about domestic violence, we have to be clear that there's a wide array of people who engage in those behaviors.",
        "On one end of the continuum are sort of people who might have done this once in their life with a lot of sort of factors contributing.",
        "Not to justify the behavior, but you know, someone may be stressed out, they may have lost their job, they may come home and find their wife in bed with another guy, and they may do something that a lot of us could probably identify with - that they push her or slap her or get in a scuffle and end up being arrested and sent to a counseling program.",
        "So there are situations where this kind of behavior wouldn't be something that we consider sort of in character for somebody, and where there would be a lot of factors that might contribute to it.",
        "And then there's, on the other side of the continuum, people who may, kind of - it may be part of their nature, almost, to be abusive.",
        "They may have grown up with this.",
        "They may have a lot of issues with control and power, and they may have personality types of problems that make it very difficult for them to control their anger and aggressive impulses.",
        "And so these are often the individuals that I think were being mentioned before that tend to repeat the behavior over and over again.",
        "And you know, past behavior is always the best predictor of future behavior.",
        "So the more often it's happened, the more severely it's happened, the more it seems to be part of someone's style - the more likely it is that they'll keep doing it, with or without help.",
        "So I think the answer to the question, whether or not people ever change, is a very complicated one, and it's clear some people do, and some people may not be able to or may not want to.",
        "And there's an entire industry, and I don't mean that in a pejorative way, but it's an industry that has set out to, well, treat these people - and you're part of it.",
        "Right, exactly.",
        "Absolutely, yes.",
        "I've been doing research and treatment in this area for a number of years, and the data are quite mixed in terms of whether what we do is successful."

        "When you look at, compared to minimal monitoring, kind of safety monitoring or probation monitoring control groups, often our counseling programs don't show very much significant added benefit in terms of reducing violence.",
        "So in that regard, the glass is sort of half-empty.",
        "But on the other side of the coin, somewhere between 60 and 80, or even up to 90 percent, of people who go through these programs don't re-offend in terms of physical assault against their partner in the six months to a year after the program.",
        "So we typically collect our outcomes by interviewing the victims and asking them a lot of detailed questions about whether she's been hit or slapped or pushed or shoved or any of those sorts of things.",

        "Yeah, and let me ask Megan Twohey.",
        "In your experience, are the victims always reliable witnesses, and is six months to a year a reasonable period to think about?",
        "Well, I was going to - I think that this is a good opportunity to make the point that sometimes, you know, when we're looking at whether or not an abuser can be forced to change, whether it's through one of these court programs or the victim bringing domestic battery charges or getting an order of protection, in some cases those - you know, the sort of legal system that's sprung up to try to force people to chance can effectively stop them from abusing that particular victim.",
        "But my experience has been, and I think research shows this, that oftentimes, even if somebody is forced to stop abusing a particular victim, they'll move on to somebody else.",
        "And that oftentimes the abusers have, you know, a long history, and if it's not this girlfriend, it's the next.",
        "And indeed, the case you cited a moment ago, allegedly Mr. Goings, who murdered a woman and her child, that was his story - moving on from one victim to another victim to a third victim, and that was the one who finally ended up dead.",
        "So anyway, Megan Twohey, thank you so much for your time today, appreciate it.",
        "My pleasure.",
        "Megan Twohey, a reporter for the Chicago Tribune.",
