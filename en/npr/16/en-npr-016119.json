        "Yeah, it does.",
        "It makes me think about the fact that whenever we're working with people like Tom, we always are thinking about both their motivation or the will to change, and also their ability or capacity to accomplish the change.",
        "And anything dealing with anger or the motivation to be aggressive or violent is one of the more difficult behaviors to change in all of psychological intervention practice.",
        "And Tom is an interesting individual because it sounds like he's had a very high level of motivation to, you know, enter a program voluntarily, to admit that he has this problem, to take responsibility, and obviously those are very important initial steps.",
        "I've only read about this stuff for research for this program, and I could be completely off-base here.",
        "Nevertheless, reading this, choking -choking a red-flag danger sign.",
        "Yes.",
        "I - that's one of the things that really worried me when I saw myself doing what, well, pretty much what I'd grown up seeing happen in the house where I lived as a child.",
        "It was eye-opening, and I just couldn't… Let me put it this way, up until I was married and in a relationship for a long time, I had no idea I was capable of those things.",
        "I wasn't a violent person.",
        "I didn't get in fights before that.",
        "I just, I was never that way.",
        "I just had - I really had no idea that I was capable of being that way until these situations occurred where I just would get out of control.",
        "Tom?",
        "The programs, the programs, they help - I want to say that they are helpful because they give you a lot of knowledge about what's going on.",
        "They give you language to talk about it, too.",
        "Yeah, they let you be able to see what you're doing, what leads to the problems.",

        "I go to church, and I pray and pray and pray.",
        "And I know that sounds silly to some people, but that's what's helped me the most is really just kind of getting at one with myself a little bit better.",

        "And so there's a learning process that goes on there, where you learn how to handle conflict and resolve problems through the use of anger and violent expressions.",
        "But also, there's a kind of an effect that can last in terms of the person's own sense of their self and their ability to handle stress and these kind of traumatic experiences they've gone through.",
        "And you know, one of the things that hasn't been studied very much in this field is whether, you know, a competent, long-term treatment for the after-effects of those childhood traumas will help resolve that impulse that he has.",
        "But I see Tom as a very successful person in many ways, because even though he still at times gets so angry he would like to hit his partner, he is able to restrain himself from doing that."

        "And yet, he never was able to come up with the motivation to follow through on any kind of counseling or any kind of treatment.",
        "And that was sad.",

        "It's always someone else who needs to be taught a lesson or screwed up or made me angry this way.",
        "So, we have to overcome that and some of the hostility about being ordered to counseling because most of the people coming to our programs are court mandated.",
        "So that's an absolutely essential issue that has to be addressed to increase the effectiveness of the programs.",
        "The reporter at the beginning was talking about how you can go to these programs and they can be teaching skills and teaching information, but if somebody's not receptive to that or they think it's always someone else's problem, you could have the best ideas in the world, it's not going anywhere.",

        "And rightfully so, they wanted to really point out that abuse is a controlling and willful behavior in most instances, and that there are - there's motivated reasons why men tend to exert that control over women.",
        "But in the extreme, that philosophy has led to the idea that what really needs to happen is people need to be held accountable for their behavior and essentially punished or locked up or given this sort of legal sanctions and that that would be the major answer that we can provide.",
        "And that, at some level, misses the parts where people might have been traumatized; they might have other problems, such as substance abuse or mental health concerns that need to be addressed.",
        "So I think we need to broaden that philosophy a little bit and not assume that just confronting people and telling them that their behavior is bad will be enough to get them to change.",
        "And is it fair to say that those programs that arose out of the shelter movement also assume that women were always, or almost always, victims?",
        "Yes.",
        "That's been a very core assumption.",
        "And most of the programs are gender specific and treat only men or work only with men.",
        "But in recent years, we've seen an increase in women being referred to the programs through the courts.",
        "And so, we've pretty much all had to also develop programs for women.",
        "And one of the things I would say is kind of interesting is that as more women came into these programs, the programs became more aware of and sensitive to the fact that there are often other issues such as childhood histories of trauma and abuse, or occurring problems with drugs or alcohol, or the fact that somebody might be referred as a perpetrator but may also be a victim.",
