        "It's not inevitable that in every relationship, the conflicts or the violence will escalate.",
        "There's been some long term studies of early marriages that show that there are situations where there's a single push, or shove, or slap, or hit on either person's part and that the most likely outcome of that is actually that it doesn't continue over time.",
        "But when things get to a certain point, like the callers we've had, where it seems to be their usual response to difficulties and conflicts is to get extremely angry and to start having impulses to hit things or throw things.",

        "But in 1969, the Supreme Court ruled in the Adam Clayton Powell case that Congress' ability to exclude a member could only be based on the Constitutional requirements of age, residence, citizenship and that a member was duly elected.",
        "Presumably, Moore would meet all those criteria, so they would have to seat him.",
