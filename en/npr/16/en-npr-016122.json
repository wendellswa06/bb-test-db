        "And I found - I instinctively would look at my feet because that's what Earth intuition trained you.",
        "If you drop something, you look down at your feet, and of course that's not the answer to this equation when you're in a weightless environment because they might be floating over the top of your head.",

        "For example, when you invented the telescope, all of a sudden you could look at the planets and you could see that they had moons and that the - our moon had craters, and you could learn all kinds of things that you cannot learn without the telescope, and same things with microscopes.",
        "Well, space is just another place in which to do experiments where you can do them in an environment where you are weightless, and this is just one more knob, so to speak, that you can tweak and do experiments and see what happens.",
        "I mean - and this is the thing that you see in the video.",
        "There are all these examples of, you know, you talk about the textbooks.",
        "So we start with a textbook rotating, and you said that you saw this - the people would do this in class, but it would be a lot quicker, right, 'cause you could watch in slow motion in space.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I need to point out that the textbook that I had - and this was on expedition six in 2002, 2003, the - I could fly one book, and the book that I decided to fly was a book written by one of my former professors, Octave Levenspiel at Oregon State University, and he wrote a book called \"\"Understanding Thermodynamics.",
