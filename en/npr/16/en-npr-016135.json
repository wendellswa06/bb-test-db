        "They let owners and dogs interact and rather than just watching them, the team took urine samples.",
        "And what they did is they measured oxytocin, which is a hormone that has been very associated with trust and social bonds.",
        "Oxytocin is the same bonding hormone that gives parents warm fuzzies when looking at their infants.",
        "Researchers found that when dogs stared into their owners eyes, oxytocin levels rose in both the people and the dogs.",
        "The same was not true for wolves who were observed with their handlers.",
        "That suggests that what they observed in dogs might actually be something special about dogs and not just a general feature of interaction between humans and any other animal."
