        "One of the issues that's very critical to the West is the fact that so much of Western states' property is tied up in federal government ownership, which means that not only did many of those states struggle with a tax base since they don't have it for property tax and, therefore, education, but it also means that the federal government is regulating huge amounts of the issues that touch their state.",
        "This becomes critically important during times of wildfires, when they're unable to do some of the management tools that would really help to either prevent or fight those fires.",
        "So that's an issue that I always heard my colleagues who were governors from the West passionately talk about.",
        "And frankly - as it is with most issues in the ranks of governors - it really was rarely about Democrats and Republicans.",
        "It was about good policy and bad policy.",
        "We're speaking with former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee.",
        "He's hoping to be the Republican presidential candidate in 2008.",

        "And let's get Mark on the line - Mark with us from Memphis, Tennessee.",
        "Yes, my question is on - I wonder what role the governor thinks his personal faith should play in a country where a separation of church and state is mandated by law?",
        "I think it's important for a person to be honest about his or her faith, and that's why I've been honest about mine.",
        "People as me, does my faith influence my decisions?",
        "And I say to them, quite frankly, no. It really drives them.",
        "And it's very important that people understand if you want to know what makes me tick, understand my faith.",
        "I think it's one of the reasons that when people say, gee, you have this perception that we ought to be interested in children beyond the birth canal.",
        "That's because of my faith.",
        "It's because of my faith that I really do believe that as Christians, as well as citizens, we have a responsibility to take good care of the environment.",
        "It's not ours.",
        "We don't own it.",
        "We just get to use it, but we don't have a right to abuse it.",
        "We shouldn't worship it, we shouldn't elevate it beyond life itself, but we ought to practice the old Boy Scout rule, and that is leave your campsite in better shape than you found it.",
        "That's not only a good position to take environmentally as a conservationist - which I do - but I think it's a good position to take because if I understand that this world was created by a creator, then I've got a responsibility to manage it carefully, wisely and pass it on in as good, if not better shape.",
        "It worries me when someone is asked the question about his or her faith, and their answer is something like, oh, I don't let my faith influence my decisions at all.",
        "Because when that person says that, what they're really saying is my faith is so insignificant, so inconsequential in my life that it really doesn't mean a whole lot.",
        "Lakeland's shares were trading at about $4.75 earlier this year.",
        "Now, they're worth nearly $20."

        "I'd rather a person be like Pete Stark of California, who last week announced that he was an atheist.",
        "Someone asked me if I was concerned about it.",
        "I said no. I'd much rather a person be honest about his atheism than to be dishonest about a Christianity that he claims to behold, but he doesn't really live it and doesn't really believe it because he never practices it.",
        "Well, does professing a faith in Christianity, does it give you any special privileges as far as the government's concerned, do you think?",
        "None whatsoever, no. I think that what we should do is recognize that our nation was founded on the idea that faith should never be prohibited or preferred.",
        "Those are the basic tenants of the First Amendment, that no one's faith should have preference over another.",
        "No one's faith should have prohibition against another.",
        "And if a person wants to have no faith, they're free to practice no faith.",
        "Any faith that is coerced is not faith at all.",
        "It's the equivalent of a spiritual - and I'll use this term, and I know it's a rather graphic one - but it's really the equivalent of spiritual rape.",
        "It is a relationship forced upon somebody.",
        "That's not faith.",
        "Faith is always out of the volition of the person who embraces it, and therefore it's most critical that we never try to impose our faith.",
        "We certainly ought to share it.",
        "We certainly ought to quick and eager to discuss it and to debate it, to explain it.",
        "But to force it - absolutely not.",
        "That would be completely, frankly, polar opposite of the definition of what real faith is about.",
        "Thanks for the call, Mark.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And here's an e-mail from Dana in San Francisco.",
        "How would you solve the immigration crisis as president?",
        "Do you favor discontinuing the policy of automatic citizenship by birth, a policy which is not followed by any other modern, industrialized nation, a policy which is not necessarily supported by the 14th Amendment?",
        "And do you feel NAFTA and the other trade agreements are unconstitutional, since these treaties were not passed by the required two-thirds majority of the Senate?",
        "So that's a broad range of issues relating to immigration and free trade with Canada and Mexico.",
        "Generally, free trade is a good thing, but it's not free if it's not fair.",
        "And our problem is that in many cases, we're practicing a level of free trade that's anything that but fair because we're subscribing to principles of the WTO that other nations aren't.",
        "We are living up to not only issues of how we treat workers and how we pay workers and issues of how well a company protects the environment while other countries are not doing anything to create a level playing field.",
        "So it's critical to have a free and open trade, because that actually builds jobs for us.",
        "But it doesn't build it jobs, in fact it takes jobs from us, when we don't force other countries to play by the same rules we're playing by."

        "As for the border, I think we ought to secure it with a fence, whether it's electronic or physical, because I go to an airport in Little Rock, get on an airplane here, and even though everyone in that airport who's working the desk - whether it's the skycap or the TSA agents or the gate agents or the ticket-counter people - they know who I am because they call me by name, but I still have to walk through those barriers of security, show my photo ID, take my shoes off, put my laptop in one of those little plastic tubs and occasionally still get patted down to make sure that I'm not going to be a threat to anybody.",
        "Now here's my point.",
        "If as a tax-paying citizen that they clearly know who I am - if I have to go through several layers of security just to get a seat on an airplane, it's not unreasonable that someone who comes here from another country would have to show who they are, why they're coming here, where they're going, prove they don't have a communicable disease or a criminal background, and then have an orderly process through which if we needed them in our economy, we let in.",

        "Just last week, a flight from Milan to Boston was diverted to Bangor, Maine, because the plane was carrying a passenger whose name appeared on the government's no-fly list.",
        "While some may find this vigilance comforting, others are asking this question: Why doesn't the government check passengers against the no-fly list before the plane takes off?",
        "That sounds like an Explainer question.",

        "When passengers check in for international flights headed to the United States, the airline does do a quick name check.",
        "This preflight verification usually includes running passenger names against the estimated 30,000 names on the DHS' no-fly list.",
        "DHS constantly updates and refines the list, but sometimes airlines don't have the most recent versions.",
