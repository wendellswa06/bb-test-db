        "Heroic, but how long had they been working on this?",
        "Well, conceptually BP says they've been working on this since the very beginning.",
        "But they were actually making - tailor-making little changes to this final product right up to the very end.",
        "In fact, they even modified it after they installed it on Monday because one part of the stack started leaking.",
        "So they actually took a replacement they had built and had on hand - on standby, just in case.",
        "They lowered it down a cable one mile to the seafloor, and they installed it down there.",
        "All this sounds like it's very expensive, particularly since you're building custom parts and then bringing spare parts, and then having things at the ready that you might or might not have to use.",
        "Any idea what this costs?",
        "Well, I called BP today, and they said they have no number for it, but it's clearly a vanishingly small sliver of the $3.5 billion that they've spent so far on the spill.",
        "I also talked to David Summers, an emeritus professor of mining engineering at Missouri University of Science and Technology.",
        "He also writes for a popular oil and gas website called the oildrum.com, which has been following this disaster since day one.",
        "And Summer says the real cost to BP hasn't been so much in dollars as it has been in reputation, particularly in light of some of the spectacular failures that we've talking about that preceded this success.",
        "Every time they put something in there and it doesn't work, they get that much more egg on their face.",
        "So the pressure to be sure that this time it's going to work is really what was driving the whole thing.",
        "And that meant not only getting the hardware right, but testing it and rehearsing it carefully before they actually got down to business, which they did.",
        "Now obviously, this key piece of equipment is coming very late in the process.",
        "We're now almost three months into this disaster.",
        "Should they maybe have built this ahead of time and had it on standby?",
        "And is this the kind of thing that might be required for all oil wells, deepwater oil wells in the future?",
        "Well, we'll have to see what the regulations in the future are.",
        "But I must say that the delay here wasn't just not having the equipment on hand, it was also really not knowing what to do here.",
        "Because you may recall that there was a lot of focus not so very long ago on this top kill procedure.",
        "And if that had worked, they wouldn't actually have needed this stack at all.",
        "So that said, David Summers says he's sure that looking forward, the oil and gas industry will plan to have all sorts of gear standing by in case anything like this happens again."
