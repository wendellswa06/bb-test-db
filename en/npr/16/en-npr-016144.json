        "Senator McConnell told me that he is leading a bipartisan effort willing to compromise, which I think is a little bit contradictory to what the established party line is, you know, this absolutely no-new-taxes line.",

        "And you know, from what I understand, the top 10 percent of the wage earners in this country are paying 70 percent of the taxes today.",
        "I don't think the wealthy are getting out of paying taxes.",

        "And I probably disagree greatly on how we're going to pay for it.",
        "I don't necessarily think we ought to be raising taxes to do it.",
        "But if the president's going to draw some attention to infrastructure, then I want to be there for him, because that voice doesn't get spoken loudly enough.",
        "And although Oklahoma City doesn't have the infrastructure needs of a lot of cities, if I can be a voice for these large eastern cities that have this deferred maintenance, then I'm going to do so because I think the future of our country relies on it.",
        "That's Mick Cornett, the mayor of Oklahoma City and president of the Republican Mayors Association.",
