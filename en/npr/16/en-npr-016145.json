        "Some of Mr. Obama's health care plans are designed to cut costs by simplifying record keeping, for example, or stressing preventative health care.",
        "But his effort to expand health care access to people who don't have it now would cost more money.",
        "And his original plan to pay for those costs by raising taxes on wealthy Americans may be postponed because of the economic downturn.",
        "Even if it does cost money, the man tapped to lead the president's health care reform effort, former Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, insists mending the broken system will pay off in more ways than one."

        "And the goal of the emperor was to confine all of this trading activity to Canton.",
        "Sort of constraining all the foreign traders to this 12-acre spot of land on the edge of the Pearl River, they could keep an eye on the foreigners and they can also keep the potentially negative influence of those foreigners away from the rest of the citizens of the country."
