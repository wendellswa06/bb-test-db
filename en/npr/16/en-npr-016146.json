        "In your research, Eric, what did you find out about what those American traders thought of the Chinese that they encountered?",
        "What did they say, what did they write about them?",
        "By and large, those who thought about China had a - probably a good regard for China.",
        "It was an illustrious empire, created a lot of the great inventions in the world, and it was viewed somewhat favorably before the American Revolution.",
        "But after the Americans started going to China, and especially to these traders who brought back stories and were confined to a small area in Canton and only saw a little sliver of China, their opinion of China and the Chinese was very negative.",
        "They thought that a lot of the small traders were trying to cheat them at every turn.",
        "They saw a lot of poverty.",
        "They felt that the government was dictatorial and corrupt.",
        "They didn't like how they treated women.",
        "So there was generally a condescending attitude on the part of the Americans towards Chinese.",
        "I'm speaking with Eric Jay Dolan.",
        "He's written a new book about America's relationship with China.",
        "It's called \"\"When America First Met China.\"\" It's interesting because in modern-day China, a lot of the views and attitudes towards the West are informed by the opium wars.",
        "And the treaty impositions after those wars, the harsh terms that were laid down on China, this was primarily a British affair.",
        "But the United States also sort of got a piece of the pie at the end of these wars.",
        "At the end of the First Opium War in 1842, the British, who had bested the Chinese on the battlefield, forced upon them what has been referred to by many as the first of many unequal treaties.",
        "And it was forcing them at the end of a gun.",
        "And among the terms, China had to cede Hong Kong to Britain, they had to open up four other ports besides Canton to foreign trading, and perhaps most insulting of all, the Chinese were forced to pay a $21 million indemnity in Spanish silver, which was to cover the cost - the British costs - of the war and also to pay for the opium - 20,000 chests of opium, which had been destroyed by the Chinese during the war.",
        "So after this treaty was signed, the Americans got their own treaty, which gave them much the same rights as the British had and opened up increased trading opportunities.",
        "What happened after the end of the second opium war between the United States and China?",
        "Did the relationship change, and who did it benefit?",
        "After the Second Opium War, the main change in the relationship was the way in which the trade was conducted.",
        "It was more expansive because a number of ports were opened.",
        "There was the opportunity to bring Chinese goods back to America faster because this was the time when there was the rise of steamship travel in the late 1860s, and also the Transcontinental Railroad gave another new pathway for the China trade to be prosecuted.",
        "But the trade didn't blow open like Americans had hoped.",
        "It stayed relatively small in terms of the whole United States economy.",
        "That, of course, very different from today.",
        "We're talking about one of our biggest trading partners.",
        "How does the past sort of clue us in to how this relationship works today?",
        "Well, there are some parallels.",
        "We're still largely connected by trade and concerns about commercial issues.",
        "It's interesting to note the deficit, which we talk about a lot today, is something that was with us also in the beginning.",
        "But the relationship is also fundamentally changed.",
        "Back then, it was just about imports and exports.",
        "Today, there are huge number of connections between America and China, and we're much more dependent upon each other than we ever were before."
