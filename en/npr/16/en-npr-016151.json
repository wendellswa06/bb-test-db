        "Second of all, to suggest that human-rights concerns shouldn't be allowed to interfere, and that was Secretary Clinton's word, with these other pressing concerns, I think, suggests that the administration doesn't realize or isn't going to use those other issues as a vehicle to promote rights.",

        "We have very few data on what the long-term trends actually have been, and it'll be extremely worthwhile to look at the cores.",
