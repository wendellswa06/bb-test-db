        "So they get home at 4:30, 5:00 at night, because we have an extra long schedule, and they look at their day as just beginning.",

        "I'm not sure.",
        "So why are we surprised that they don't want to go to bed at 9:00, 10:00 at night if they just look at their day as starting at 5:00 when then get home?",
        "Are they then sleeping through the first part of their day when they should be sleeping, in school?",
        "Some of them are struggling to stay awake and some of them are, if they're physically awake, they're not present in the classroom, and that certainly not for lack of my attempting to make my classes as interesting and as compelling as possible for them.",

        "Hi.",
        "I'm 16, and I was wondering what kind of long-term effects does this sleep deprivation have on a kid?",
        "Because, I just have some coffee, and I'll be fine, you know?",
        "And I go to school, and I do what I do, and I fall asleep about fifth period.",
        "So, I was wondering what kind of effects does this has long-term.",
        "That's all.",
        "I think that's pretty consistent with what we feel is happening to these young people.",
        "And we do hear from teachers all the time, at least I do, how hard they're working especially in the morning classes.",
        "But it's fascinating to hear that you know they're day starts for them after school though you know we as adults think well we need to get them prepared to go to school.",
        "That's their you know essentially their job as a lesson.",
        "So that, you know, part of that feeling maybe just I feel so desperately awful during the school hours, I can't think of it as my day.",
        "Well, but you're not sitting there with four different electronic devices when you get home from school.",
        "Exactly.",
        "I, I you know I think that that's a huge, all the competing priorities that kids have for sleep and rest.",
        "You know 97 percent of the students that were polled said they have had some electronic device in their bedroom.",
        "Bedrooms become sort of these entertainment zones for kids and there's no question that, that interferes with their ability to prepare psychologically and mentally to go sleep.",
        "An interesting story, I gave a talk at my son's school this week, and one of the teachers commented afterwards that he had taken a group of 15, 16, 17-year-old boys including my son to Ecuador last summer for five weeks, and the average bedtime for the kids was 8:30, because there was nothing else to do.",
        "And yet I know with my son who is almost 17, I have to practically drag him off the computer after three warnings at 10:00 at night.",
        "So, clearly there's a huge piece of this that's biology, but a lot of it is electronics and over stimulation and too many activities.",
        "I have to agree with you.",
        "Let me remind everybody that this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.",
        "We're talking about teenagers and their sleep habits with our Mary Carskadon and Judy Owens.",
        "Our number 1-800-989-8255.",
        "I found it to be with my kids too, true also.",
        "You know I've had to actually put a timer on the internet to control when they could get on and off.",
        "I've sort of framed this in my head as kind of the perfect storm.",
        "I mean the biology hasn't really changed, and it wasn't different in Ecuador than here, although the light that the boys got in Ecuador is a lot different than that feeds back on the biology.",
        "But you know what's new now in the 21st century, maybe the later part of the 20th century, really is all of these over-stimulated and this sort of technological playground that bedrooms have been turned into.",
        "Throw in a healthy dose of caffeine and you know they're just caught in this maelstrom.",
        "Yeah, they're doing these frappacinos and high caffeinated drinks now.",
        "And you're right, put those two together, and I wouldn't be sleeping either.",
        "Right.",
        "Except that your 8:00 class, or your 7:00 class, which a lot of the older teenagers have to confront.",
        "Well, let's talk a bit, Dr. Owens, about the health consequences there must be besides the academic consequences, the health consequences, if you're doing this over a period of years?",
        "Well, certainly we know from the poll results that mental health consequences seem to be very closely linked to insufficient sleep, which we know from many other research avenues.",
        "But the kids who are getting less sleep clearly were more depressed, had more mood issues, and that clearly is a significant concern when we consider the prevalence of depression in the adolescent population.",
        "One of the other health consequences which I've actually found quite interesting was that insufficient sleep seems to affect their interest in or willingness to exercise.",
        "And clearly when we have this epidemic of pediatric obesity that has occurred in this country, you wonder how much of a role both insufficient sleep in it of itself, as well as leading to inadequate exercise, how big of a role that might play in all that."

        "Hi I was just wondering does naps help?",
        "Cause I remember I would always take a nap when I came home from school as a teenager?",
        "Yeah, good question.",
        "Can you catch up a little during the day?",
        "Yeah, I think naps can be a good short term solution but one of the studies that our group did a while ago showed that people getting insufficient sleep, and this was college students sleeping five hours a night, that afternoon nap actually did help for five or six hours with alertness.",
        "And, of course, the problem is that it had absolutely no impact on how sleepy they were the next morning.",
        "So to some extent if falling asleep early in the evening or earlier in the evening is a problem, then that actually can interfere with that as well.",
        "So it's, it's kind of can be a good news, bad news solution.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Can you catch up on the weekend you know if you sleep like teenagers do till noon or 2:00?",
        "Well, that's another one of these good news, bad news problems.",
        "If the teenagers... Remember we have our clock that's helping regulate part of this.",
        "And if you teach the brain that nighttime goes till noon or 2:00 in the afternoon, then come Monday morning, the brain's going want to be on the pillow, not in the classroom.",
        "So, you really run into kind of catch-22 there, and I think, I mean Judy may have more to say about this in terms of what to advise parents in terms of how late to let the youngsters sleep in in the mornings on weekends, you can't just cut them off at the pass and not let them get any extra sleep, but I think if they run their clocks really late, it can head into other problems.",
        "Dr.",

        "Well, just to reiterate what Mary commented on.",
        "I think we do typically tell parents that it's important to try to keep as consistent a sleep-wake schedule between weekdays and weekends.",
        "In younger kids, we recommend no more than an hour difference.",
        "Obviously with teenagers, they are going to need to extend their sleep a little bit.",
        "But it really does impact on the circadian rhythm.",
        "The other issue is that when you think about it here they are regaining some of their alertness for the weekend, but then when the weekday comes, the time when they need to be at their most alert, they need to perform in school, they're really at a disadvantage.",
        "Is there anyway for a parent to know by, you know, your kid's actions whether they're sleep deprived or not?",
        "Well, one of the clues is how, whether your teenager wakens spontaneously in the morning.",
        "And when you look at surveys about this, typically during the school day again, teenagers need an alarm clock or a parent or someone else to take them.",
        "Where as if they're allowed to sleep as long as they need to on the weekends they wake up spontaneously.",
        "So, that's one clue.",
        "Another clue, you know, you raised the issue of napping, about 30 percent of the kids in the survey were taking fairly regular naps after school.",
        "And the need to that suggests that you're not getting adequate sleep at night.",

        "Hi, Ira.",
        "Comment I wanted to make, Ira, is about six years ago, I was a president of a school board in West Central, Wisconsin, and the Dinah(ph) School District in Minnesota did something like this where they backed up the school day for the senior high.",
        "And so I suggested that to our school board, and the teacher's union was not happy with this.",
        "They liked getting out at 2:30 in the afternoon, and they really raised a ruckus of us trying to change the schedule of moving the elementary earlier and the high school school schedule later.",
        "And so I was beat up on that and that was the teacher's union who stopped it.",
        "Dr.",
        "Carskadon, any comment?",
        "Well, physiologically it makes a little sense too because the adults are actually more alert in the morning.",
        "Their circadian rhythm clock is different and it's set at a different time.",
        "So, indeed, it is easier for them to make it to school at an earlier hour.",
        "The problem is that the victim becomes the student, who's the one who's supposed to be trying to get an education.",
        "So I could see that it would be a potentially big conflict.",
        "And I think that's why school districts who've managed to make the change have really been those successful in getting, you know, input from and acceptance from teachers, parents, and students.",
        "And those who've done it seem to find most of the constituents being much happier.",
        "Thanks for calling, Steve.",
        "Thank you, Ira.",
        "I think one of the important things that also has emerged from that great Minnesota experiment is the fact that the kids, whose start times were delayed, really did sleep longer.",
        "You know, one of the arguments against changing school start times is well they'll just stay up an hour later.",
        "And they won't get anymore sleep."

        "Right.",

        "So they're asking for help.",
        "Yeah.",
        "What's also interesting here is we've had other researchers, Robert Stickel(ph) from Harvard's been on many times, and he studies learning of skills.",
        "And his research shows definitely that if you don't get seven or more hours of sleep of night, those piano lessons or whatever kinds of new things you're trying to learn, are just not going to work that well.",
