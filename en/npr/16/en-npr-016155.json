        "And there's some very intriguing evidence to suggest that there's a link between people who don't get adequate sleep and who are overweight or obese.",
        "So, obviously that's one potential health consequence.",
        "One of the other things we really haven't talked much about is this whole issue of drowsy driving.",
        "And I think it's something that's very under recognized, but when you look at the poll numbers, a substantial percentage of teenagers are driving while drowsy.",
        "And that's equally dangerous as driving when they're drunk, and yet we don't pay a lot of attention to that.",
        "It's not something which kids are taught about, typically, in driver ed classes.",
        "And that has potentially fatal consequences.",
        "I think you could also have links to that kind of outcome with the depressed mood, as well.",
        "The problem is, we don't have the kind of prospective data that really would enable us to say for sure one way or the other.",
        "Well, we do know teens are involved in a much higher proportion of accidents now, don't we?",
        "Well, there's certainly data...there was a lovely study done a number of years ago looking at crashes where the driver was drowsy.",
        "And half of them, the driver was aged 16 to 25.",
        "So, it's a high-risk group.",
        "So, we've normally said that's because they've been distracted by other teens in the car, you know, talking, and playing, you know, being distracted.",
        "But it could be because of drowsiness or depression.",
        "I think that's, you know, I think all of those factors come in.",
        "But it really is clear that, you know, teens are drowsy.",
        "They're just learning how to drive, and you know, you sort of have a compounding of factors.",
        "And if they're experimenting with alcohol, the effects of alcohol on a drowsy brain are enormous and accelerated, versus the effects on an alert brain."
