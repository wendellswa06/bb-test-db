        "This past Friday, the Supreme Court agreed to hear an abortion case out of Louisiana.",
        "Can you just briefly explain the central issue in the case and why this is so significant?",
        "Louisiana had passed a statute that required doctors to have admitting privileges before they could perform abortions.",
        "And that would result in virtually no abortion facilities in the state.",
        "It's similar to what Texas attempted to do several years ago, and the Supreme Court struck down that law in 2016.",
        "But this time, the federal appeals court for Louisiana has upheld the law, and the court was sort of forced to take the case.",
        "The question I think for people who both support abortion rights and expansive abortion rights and those who oppose them is whether the court will turn over the precedent set in Roe v.",
        "Wade.",
        "Is this case a case that could do that?",
        "It could be.",
        "But there is nowhere for the new justices, the Trump justices, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, to hide.",
        "They're going to have to say more than they said at their confirmation hearings, and that's why it's critical.",
        "And it is likely that both of them differ from the swing justice of the last 15 years, Anthony Kennedy.",
        "So DACA is another controversial issue.",
        "In November, the court's also going to consider whether President Trump can end the DACA program that shields immigrants brought to the United States as children from deportation.",
        "It's my understanding that the court isn't going to rule on whether the law itself is legal.",
        "So what's the issue here?",
        "The issue is executive power.",
        "The issue is to what extent the Trump administration could reverse the executive action taken by Barack Obama and whether the Trump administration followed the correct procedures.",
        "So it will be read by the public as a key ruling on a Trump policy.",
        "And therefore, it's important.",
        "And so finally, let's turn our focus to the coming week.",
        "The court is going to hear three cases related to workplace discrimination on Tuesday.",
        "And basically, the question for the court is whether the Civil Rights Act applies to gay and transgender people in the workplace.",
        "Is that the crux of the issue?",
        "Correct.",
        "And it's a question of statutory construction - whether Title VII, passed decades ago by Congress to apply to discrimination based on sex, should also be read to apply to sexual orientation.",
        "This is the first time several of these justices are going to weigh in on gay rights.",
        "Is there something that people will be seeing on Tuesday that will be relevant to what's to come, or not?"

        "It's hard to read a whole lot into the questioning during any case.",
        "But if you hear a lot of skepticism about the applicability of Title VII to sexual orientation, then I wouldn't be betting a whole lot of money on the court expanding gay rights.",
        "And you may find justices on both sides of the ideological aisle saying so, pretty much with the view that if Congress wanted this to apply to sexual orientation, they would have said so.",
        "And they can continue - they can change the law in the future.",
        "It's not for us to turn the law into that.",

        "As part of the European Union, this border has been effectively erased.",
        "If Brexit actually happens, the border will likely come back.",
        "Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, negotiated this agreement with European leaders for a so-called backstop that would've avoided a physical border with checkpoints between the two jurisdictions.",
        "But the idea never got parliamentary approval, and Boris Johnson now has other plans.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "No country that values its independence, and indeed, its self-respect, could agree to a treaty which signed away our economic independence and self-government as this backstop does.",

        "And that would create problems for the flow of goods across that border because Ireland would be a member of the single market, and Northern Ireland would not be.",
