        "The attack happened around about 9:00.",
        "I got there about 15 minutes later, and I saw lots of the walking wounded being taken out of the subway and being taken across the road and laid down and just helped to the floor so they could just rest.",
        "They were very, very shocked, covered in black soot and shaking from the shock.",
        "And so they used your church then as kind of a staging ground for...",
        "And then--well, what they did is that they were able to get ambulances immediately to take them to the nearby hospital, the Royal London, but my church then became--because all of the cell phones went down, the emergency services needed a command center so they took my church as their command center for about four hours.",
        "And now it's being used as a place for the firefighters and for the police and for the ambulance men to be able to go in, to be quiet and have some coffee and to have a sandwich and just be peaceful.",

        "He was bleeding from his forehead, and he was full of black soot, and he was shaking with shock, and I just sat there with him and held his hand, and I said, `Can you remember what happened?",

        "And so I think they're trying to reduce the number of police they have to put out on the street, because frankly, a lot of officials have been complaining about unnecessary to do when there's no particular information indicating that there will be an attack.",
        "And Mr. Chertoff--secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, said there is no information indicating that there will be an attack in the United States.",
        "But nevertheless, he wanted to urge all of these mass transit officials to take extra precautions.",
        "And I think most of them didn't really need that warning, because they were out--they had their officers out already.",

        "However, they were cautioning us not to depict this as extraordinary, because they've been doing these sweeps on a regular basis since 9/11.",
        "They did step up these sweeps today, but they say, `These are things that we've been doing all along.",
        "You almost got the sense that these were sort of photo ops to show us, and probably the terrorists, what kind of measures are in place all the time and to demonstrate that security is tighter.",
        "At the same time, you've been on the Metro.",
        "You know you can carry almost anything you want into that place.",

        "Hello.",
        "I'm calling from South Carolina, and wanted to make the comment that I think that the face that the British public is putting on to all of us in the world today is the face that they have carried all along throughout terrorist attacks and imminent attacks all of these years, and we should be using them as a model for our own behavior; that life goes on as it has for them for many decades through a lot of turmoil.",
        "I'm very proud to say I have many friends overseas, and I think they're really showing us their mettle today, quite definitely.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks so much for your call, Brian.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "And, Larry, also just in terms of security, although obviously, the British system was not entirely secure, they did have a very measured emergency response that seemed to work in this case.",
        "Well, unfortunately, the British have a lot of practice from the IRA bombings quite a while ago, but they've still been through this a lot, and it will be interesting to see how well the US response is able to ramp up after having gone several years without any sort of attack.",
        "We are seeing that a lot of the evacuation measures, the extra security precautions that they're trying to put into place in cities like Washington, DC, are going a lot more smoothly, and that's partly because of the practice that they're getting.",
        "You know, we recently had the Capitol and buildings around the Capitol evacuated because of planes in unauthorized airspace.",
        "At first, those evacuations were a little chaotic.",
        "Then they became a little bit more measured.",
        "Police were a little bit less eager to tell people to go running away quickly, and this morning when I was riding to work, the Capitol Hill area was battened down.",
        "They were checking cars randomly.",
        "They looked in my trunk.",
        "And so they're putting into place measures which, at one time, we would have perceived to be extraordinary but are now quite ordinary in a city like Washington, DC.",
        "Well, for an update on what British authorities have been saying, we turn now to Jimmy Burns.",
        "He's the public policy correspondent for The Financial Times, joining us from London.",
        "Jimmy, what are investigators saying at this point now about what they know about these attacks?",
        "Hi from London.",
        "Well, the British officials and both government level security officials and police are clearly adopting a very cautious line in terms of what they're stating in public.",
        "And I think the reasons for that are both political and also professional.",
        "I mean, from a political point of view, they have not forgotten what happened in Spain following the bomb attacks in Madrid last year when, of course, the government jumped to a conclusion which proved to be utterly false, which is that the Baath terrorist organization had been involved and then turned around and said it was the Islamic terrorists, and that cost them the election, and they were thrown out of power.",
        "So I think, you know, they've learned a lesson there.",
        "But also because genuinely, the police here and intelligence services want to be absolutely sure that they've identified who's done it before giving wrong steers to the relatives of people who have been affected by this and also to the media.",
        "That said, I mean, I'm finding no one at all, where I'm standing at the moment in the newspaper and outside it at this time, who doubts that this was the product of an Islamic terrorist group, that the attacks certainly bore striking similarities to the attacks in Madrid in terms of an attack on the public transport system during a rush hour; i.e., maximum civilians moving into a very busy part of town.",
        "All the stations that were affected were those which have a huge in-flow of commuters, in particular, people working in banks and legal offices and what were clearly designed to cause maximum casualties.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Jimmy, if I could interrupt you a second, I'd like to take a call while we have you on the line, from Jeremy in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.",
