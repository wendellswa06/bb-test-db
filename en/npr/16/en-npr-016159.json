        "Yeah.",
        "Hi.",
        "I first learned about the events from a friend out there in the Philadelphia area and tried to contact my two sons working in London through cell phones.",
        "And unfortunately, we've found out that they were unable to use the service and how distressing it is for people who obviously are unable to contact family in the United Kingdom and, you know, having myself live through the problems previously with the IRA issues and being involved in a personal situation once myself, but I'm glad to say that I did contact them after three hours.",
        "Oh, you did get them.",
        "I was going to see if...",
        "I did, yes.",
        "...if Jimmy Burns had any advice for you or anybody else listening, who does have relatives who may not be able to get through and are wondering.",
        "Jimmy.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, your caller just now, of course, pointed to one of those sort of very disconcerting things that we all lived through this morning.",
        "I mean, I'm talking about Londoners; that, you know, certainly for two or three hours, all our mobiles really kind of went on the blink and went dead, and we--I mean, I personally had two hours of complete panic, not being able to get in touch with my 19-year-old daughter and my 20-year-old daughter, both of whom were using the public transport system, and like that, you know, dozens and dozens and dozens of examples which I'm sure are familiar to Americans who've lived much worse days than we have.",
        "But I will say one thing, just to pick up on the point made by your (technical difficulties) caller who I thought made a sort of very noble and generous comment from your side of the Atlantic, but I think made an important point, which is we need to remind ourselves--and I've been asked this question a lot in the course of the day from people ringing from abroad, how we, you know, react as Londoners and, indeed, as Brits.",
        "We have to remind ourselves that this is not new to us.",
        "You know, at the height of the IRA campaign, London was very badly hit, and we've relived it in Northern Ireland, and we're also, you know, a nation used to pulling through on these things, and I think that if these terrorists think that this is going to divide the British nation--and by British nation, I'm talking about all races, all religions who live here and consider themselves British--I think they're hugely mistaken.",
        "Quite the contrary, I think this is going to have an incredible gelling effect at a time when, you know, national sentiment is riding quite high anyway as a result of the Olympic decision, bringing the Olympics to the UK.",
        "Yeah (laughter).",
        "...for your call, Jeremy, and I'm glad you heard about your family and that they're safe.",
        "I just wanted to note, Jimmy, that, you know, yesterday in London, it was a time of just extraordinary euphoria and happiness, and now here today, the exact opposite, terrible, terrible news.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "But, I mean, you know this as well as I do, because you've lived through it.",
        "You lived through it on 9/11.",
        "I mean, it is incredible how out of a tragic situation like this, humanity pulls through.",
        "I mean, I have been, here at The Financial Times, inundated with e-mails from around the world, including many friends from the US, from Europe, asking if I'm OK, asking after colleagues, asking after common friends, and expressing total solidarity.",
        "And I think if we keep this in mind, humanity can only go forward.",
        "All right.",
        "Thank you very much, Jimmy."

        "Thanks.",
        "Jimmy Burns is the public policy correspondent for The Financial Times, and he joined us from London.",
        "On the line now is Jonathan Stevenson.",
        "He's a senior fellow for counterterrorism at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, and he joins us from Groton, Connecticut.",
        "Thanks for being with us, Mr. Stevenson.",
        "A pleasure.",
        "So what do we make of this study of attacks?",
        "What does it tell us about who may be behind these attacks?",
        "Well, I mean, given the--I mean, we can take on board with some plausibility the claim of credit by the al-Qaeda group in Europe, even if that's just a mouthpiece for another upstart organization, but I think we can infer that this group was, at the very least, inspired by al-Qaeda and perhaps had some more intimate connection to the leadership or at least some kind of middleman from the leadership.",
        "As people have observed, it does bear striking similarities to the Madrid attack, and I think probably is motivated by similar factors to--with the desire to drive a wedge between the United States and its European partners, of which Britain is certainly the closest.",
        "Now how significant is it that these attacks occurred as the G8 Summit was being held?",
        "I think it has to be at least construed as significant.",
        "I mean, for one thing, a terrorist attack in the host country of the G8 Summit takes the steam out of the meeting of the G8, and it also acquires that--captures that meeting as a captive audience, and one can imagine that, you know--and basically changes the headlines and shifts the focus of conversation in that very meeting.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So it's pretty much a truism that terrorists seek as wide an audience as possible, and that's precisely what they're getting.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But what effect will this have on policy in Europe?",
        "Do think that it'll have any?"

        "I don't think it'll have an appreciable effect on strategic policy on either side of the Atlantic.",
        "It is true that, you know, the Madrid attack had, for somewhat peculiar and particular reasons, an effect on Spain's support for the US enterprise in Iraq and on the leadership of that country, it having occurred just a couple of days before the election.",
        "But, you know, I don't think there is much that can feasibly change, at least in the short term, in terms of the way that the campaign against terrorism is being prosecuted.",
        "Certainly a lot of European voices consider the Iraq intervention ill-advised, but most agree that, now that we're there, there's little alternative but to stay the course and at least try to make it a stable polity, as much as that may antagonize jihadists, which I think indeed it has.",
        "So the default change would probably be with respect to homeland security and in trying to make it better, which, other people have observed, I think not inaccurately, has lost momentum because of the distraction that world leaders have had over matters elsewhere, such as Iraq and Afghanistan.",

        "Hi.",
        "Dave.",
        "Hello.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "I, like most Americans, feel great sadness for the people in London, just as I did after the 9/11 attacks here in this country.",
        "And I think the news media should cover the story the way it is.",
        "My concern, however, is the nature of the coverage of the everyday terrorist attacks against the Iraqi people.",
        "President Bush has said that we must fight terrorism overseas in the Middle East so that we don't have to fight the terrorists at home, and I think sometimes it gives the impression that an Iraqi life is not worth as much as an American, or in this case maybe a British life.",
        "It suggests to me when we cover this story, which is a dramatic story, with the G8 conference on, so largely that we don't cover the day-by-day attacks that kill 20 to 30 people in Iraq.",
        "All right, Dave.",
        "Thanks so much.",
        "I want Jonathan Stevenson to respond to that because what you're bringing up, the issue you bring up of Iraq, must have something to do with this.",
        "Jonathan?",
        "Yeah, actually, I think that's an interesting and perceptive observation that your caller just had.",
        "It reminds me a lot of what a lot of people said about the IRA's campaign, in that they knew that just another bombing in Northern Ireland and another killing of a Northern Irish Catholic or Protestant was not going to draw the same kind of news coverage as a bombing in London would.",
        "And that is still true today with respect to Iraq.",
        "The death of an Iraqi civilian or even of a US soldier in Iraq is not as jarring to public perception as a terrorist attack in the United States or a European capital.",
        "And the terrorists know that and therefore are, I think, all the more motivated to go out of area, so to speak, and hit at the larger cities that are supposedly more secure of Western countries.",
        "As to what that says about how the news media should cover Iraq, I'm not certain.",
        "I do think--you know, I think it's probably not quite true to say that Iraq attacks don't--get minimal coverage.",
        "They do get fairly extensive coverage.",
        "But--in defense of the media, I would say part of the reason that, you know, a suicide attack on an Iraqi police station, let's say, perhaps gets less column inches per death, if I can put it somewhat crassly, is that those attacks are more frequent..."

        "I mean, thinking about the pattern of attacks--we are on higher alert in our transit systems now.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that the attacks in London kind of continue a trend that al-Qaeda and its affiliates have had of hitting at close American allies, you know, starting right after the Iraq intervention with Saudi Arabia, going on to Morocco, then Turkey, then Spain.",
        "then Britain.",
        "There seems to be--I mean, what's interesting to me is that al-Qaeda and people inspired by it seem to use what are essentially old-fashioned, conventional terrorist tactics, although super-charged in a way, against European targets.",
        "And yet they don't seem to have, at least so far, the same kind of interest in American targets, which makes me believe or infer that they are saving their prime enemy--that is to say, the United States--for something far bigger.",

        "There are also a bank of new anti-terrorist laws, which enables them to take people into custody for longer periods than previously, governing intelligence.",

        "And those 200 people now will be--are being viewed to see if they're still there.",
        "I'm sure MI5 officers will be very worried if they see some of them are missing.",

        "Well, Britain has quite a complicated system.",
        "There are about five or six agencies that actually deal with terrorism.",
        "Scotland Yard is the police organization which will be carrying out the investigation on the ground.",
        "And then there is Special Branch, which is responsible to Scotland Yard, and they gather in intelligence on terrorist targets.",
