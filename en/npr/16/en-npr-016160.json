        "But MI5, which is the domestic security service, has overall responsibility for counterterrorism.",
        "And then MI6, which is the foreign intelligence agency, will be dealing with terrorism abroad.",
        "In this country, there's been a fair amount of criticism of the FBI.",
        "How do the British public feel about the MI5?",
        "Well, I think MI5 is going to have a difficult time in the next few days and next few weeks.",
        "They obviously--they weren't totally caught unaware about this.",
        "They had lowered the alert recently--it's a very high alert, but they had lowered it, which is a bit surprising given that the G8 meeting was taking place.",
        "And I imagine there's something of a panic now and it may be that these are people that they didn't have under surveillance and knew nothing about, and were completely clean people.",

        "I've never been more clear about an election in my life.",
        "Well, a lot of those cameras came in because of the attacks by the IRA in the last few decades.",
        "And central London has a huge number of these cameras.",
        "And some of the IRA attacks and the people who carried them out, they were discovered through use of CCTV.",
        "And I assume that there will be pictures of some of the people that did carry out these attacks, and MI5 and Scotland Yard will now be gathering all the intelligence they can from those.",
        "But it's going to be like a needle in a haystack, I imagine, because of the particular time it took place.",
        "There would've been so many people around going to work into the center of London.",

        "I think everybody expected this would happen.",
        "I think people will initially come together and support the prime minister, but I do think this is going to create some difficulties for Tony Blair because a majority of the population are already against the war in Iraq.",
        "And it's possible that they will see this as a consequence of his support for that war.",
        "And many observers at the time when the war started said that this was likely to fuel terrorism and not to suppress it.",

        "I mean, are businesses going to be shut down tomorrow?",
        "Is the transit system still going to be closed?",
        "Well, certainly, most schools in London are going to be closed tomorrow, and a number of businesses too, I think.",
        "There is some speculation that parts of--I mean, I think parts of the rail network, overground rail network, are probably already up and running this evening.",
        "And there's a possibility that some of the Tube network will also be.",
        "But I've heard reports today saying that there's even the possibility of a tunnel collapse at the site of one of the explosions.",
        "So that could be a very long job.",
        "And all the attack sites are immediately treated by the police as scene of crimes.",
        "And therefore there will be very detailed forensic analysis of all of those sites to try and gather as much information as possible.",
        "Now you were on the scene earlier today.",
        "What did you see?",
        "I was at the site of the bombing which took place on a Tube train, an underground train at Edgware Road.",
        "And I arrived there just about 50 minutes, five zero minutes, after the attack took place.",
        "It's quite remarkable and, I think, encouraging in one sense to say that there was already on site a massive number of emergency response vehicles; dozens and dozens of ambulances; fire tenders.",
        "And then you saw the forensic teams come in, the nursing teams, and so on and so forth.",
        "I think one must say that the emergency response has been quite outstanding.",
        "We couldn't get anywhere near the actual site of the explosion, naturally, but we saw people who had been treated coming out.",
        "And in fact, incredibly, one of my own colleagues was actually on the train that was hit, and I was able to speak to her when she was released.",
        "She wasn't seriously injured, I'm very delighted to say, but she told me that after the explosion, there was a lot of crying and shouting, but it died down very quickly.",
        "And in fact, in some of the carriages, even the emergency lighting stayed on.",
        "So people decanted from those trains out of the back of them and walked the 100 yards or so back to the railway platform that they'd left--those that could, of course.",
        "And within a very short time, the emergency services were able to take everybody out.",
        "I think probably within two hours they had everybody, including the most critically injured, out of the actual location itself.",
