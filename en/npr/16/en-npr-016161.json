        "And it's reasonably possible that that figure will possibly rise even just a little bit from there.",
        "Plus, as you've mentioned, I think the latest figure I've seen is something around about 700 casualties.",
        "Yeah.",

        "And parts of that hotel were commandeered and medical staff moved in it to set up a triage station.",
        "People were very, very quickly sorted and graded according to the nature of their wounds and they were treated in that order, and then shipped out as needs be to the hospitals which were quite close by.",

        "And they were helped in that by the overall calmness of people.",
        "There was not much panic on the streets.",
        "Even after these incidents when you saw people walking through the streets, because there was no public transport, they were calm, they were measured, there was no running, there was no incidents as a result of any scares.",

        "I believe--excuse me, I believe that he's due to return possibly even this evening.",
        "That's the report that I heard earlier in the day, and I don't think it's changed since then.",
        "So he's clearly come down here to speak directly to the intelligence chiefs and the police chiefs to find out exactly what they have found out so far and to give his instructions.",
        "And then he will return to the politics of the day, as it were, at the G8.",
        "And he's determined to send a message to terrorists that they are not going to disrupt this conference?",
        "I think so.",
