        "It didn't help that her diet was overloaded with sodas, sweets and frozen dinners.",
        "So her doctor put her on insulin shots and told her to watch what she ate.",
        "Well, you're sitting there thinking, well, what does that mean?",
        "Her doctor just kept upping her insulin to manage her spiking blood sugar.",
        "But then she lost her insurance.",
        "The insulin was costing hundreds of dollars a month she didn't have.",

        "They travel around giving these six-week seminars, and they go deep, explaining the difference between sucrose and glucose and why white potatoes are more likely to spike blood sugar than sweet potatoes.",
        "They preach eating as much fiber as a stomach can stand and squeezing in light activity throughout the day.",
        "The Wickhams test blood sugar levels to track progress, and some see early results.",
        "Her blood sugar's going down.",

        "When they get that diagnosis of diabetes, you expect this is what's going to happen to them until they finally pass away.",
        "The Wickhams give a disclaimer that their reversal program is not yet backed by piles of scientific literature, but they do cite promising studies from researchers like Roy Taylor of Newcastle University.",
        "There just hasn't been information about the possibility of reversing diabetes.",
        "Type 2 diabetes is reversible in this sense - having diabetes means your A1C levels, measure of blood sugar, are elevated.",
        "You can drive those levels back down, even without medication.",

        "Taylor's research finds that by losing 30 pounds or so, Type 2 diabetes can be turned back in the early stages.",
        "I think the main headwinds are conceptual ones, scientists and doctors just believing that this is an irreversible condition because of what we see.",
        "But change is already on the horizon at the American Diabetes Association.",
        "It has a new position on what it calls remission.",

        "We've known, literally since the 17th century, that diet is the key to managing diabetes.",
