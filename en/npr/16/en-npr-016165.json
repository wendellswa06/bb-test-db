        "We had to have our IDs right up at our faces.",
        "And they'd each stop you there at the turn and show it face up to a camera or you had to pass slowly in front of a guard, went down several passageways up and down staircases and finally down one long hallway in what's called the special prison section, where we reached cell number 20, and that was Guzman's.",

        "Well, first is oversight, and we are going to engage in that very strongly.",
        "The other aspect, of course, is legislation with the Senate.",
        "The Republicans, apparently, will never react to misdeeds on the part of the administration.",
        "Since they control the Senate, that avenue is blocked.",
        "The third element is the courts.",

        "The science and the technology have matured together to the point where we can propose this sort of next step in volcanology.",
        "Here's how it would work: Sensors on the ground would send data continuously to the five volcano observatories currently operating in the United States.",
        "Ewert says these observatories could be linked together to operate a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week volcano watch office.",
