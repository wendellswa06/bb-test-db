        "Juma only began working with college students a few years ago, so it's too early to know its success rate.",
        "Chavez meets weekly with about 25 students, either in person, on Skype, or on the phone.",
        "She's also taking on new students like Taylor Lott, a high school senior who's going to the University of Southern California next year.",
        "Taylor and her mother, Cassie Hoskins, recently came to Chavez's office with a lot of questions about financial aid.",
        "So I was kind of confused because I was worried, like - more loans.",
        "I can't do that.",
        "I'm not sure, you know, how that would work.",
        "Why would she need loans if she had financial aid?",
        "And, you know, I...",
        "Chavez tells them they could take out a small subsidized loan.",
        "If you're going to be borrowing more than, say, $5,000 a year, at that point we really start looking at it as somewhat unmanageable debt.",
        "Chavez's coaching is rooted in practical dilemmas, but Taylor's mom, Cassie, says it can also be inspirational.",
        "She started to just blossom.",
        "She exploded.",
        "She was able to speak before people, and she was able to express herself - the things that she wanted in life.",
        "She was able to express her aspirations for college.",

        "I think, at this point, the federal government would need to step in.",
        "Fannie and Freddie, they either own or insure about one half of the mortgages in the U.S.",
        "There are big problems with credits slowing the mortgage markets right now, and Fannie and Freddie are really pretty much the only game in town there.",
        "So I think the feds are concerned, if something happened, and Fannie and Freddie fail, then we'd see a much more severe downturn in the housing market.",
        "And one advantage, perhaps, in the federal government taking over Fannie and Freddie is that it could bring down mortgage rates a bit.",
        "If you look at the spread between the interest rates that Fannie and Freddie are paying versus risk-free treasuries, that spread has widened a bit, which indicates that people are, perhaps, a bit reluctant to lend to Fannie and Freddie despite the rescue package that the federal government put together last month.",
        "So, if the feds take it over, and the Treasury Department is essentially running them, then that would allow Fannie and Freddie to borrow at lower rates, and that could bring down mortgage rates for home borrowers.",
        "So, as dark as the clouds are now, there might be silver lining for future homebuyers?",
        "I think that that's the case.",
        "There could be some advantages.",
        "And then, over the longer run, we need to think about what our mortgage policy should be, how involved the federal government should be in the market.",
        "But I think that's a decision for the next president.",
        "Gus, I know this is asking a very big question, but when do you possibly see the banks being able to pull out of this crisis?",
        "Well, it's going to take some time.",
        "I mean, there are a lot of excesses that were developed over the past few years.",
        "Too many homes were built.",
        "There were people who, in retrospect, who got mortgages who probably shouldn't have.",
        "And so it's taking some time for all this to fall out.",
        "Inventories are going to need to decline further, so we have builders cutting back.",
        "You know, they're building fewer homes, and we saw that again today.",
        "At some point, we see prices falling, which will make prices affordable for some folks.",
        "So, you know, we probably don't think conditions are going to stabilize until some time in the first half of next year.",
        "I have to say, for someone who's saying the conditions aren't going to stabilize until sometime next year, you sound relatively calm.",
        "I think, for the average Joe, you keep hearing these stories, and it's hard not to panic.",
        "Why shouldn't we panicking?",
        "Well, I think, for most homeowners, as long as you didn't buy in the past few years, you're probably in OK shape.",
        "It could be that the value of your house has gone down, but it's probably still worth more than you paid for it.",
        "You probably are able to afford your mortgage payments.",
        "So those folks are doing OK.",
        "I mean, obviously, it's not good if the value of your house declines, but at the same point, they're not facing severe financial distress.",
        "I think there are people who have purchased their home more recently or perhaps refinanced, maybe they faced a higher interest rate because they had an adjustable-rate mortgage.",
        "Maybe they qualified for a loan that, in retrospect, they probably shouldn't have gotten.",
        "So there are some people who are facing some severe problems, but I think, for the majority of homeowners, they're not in immediate danger."

        "Probably in the neighborhood of about 12 that I can remember, like 12 significant ones.",
