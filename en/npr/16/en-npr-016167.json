        "The California billionaire had emailed Lonnie Bunch with a message of congratulations because, after overseeing the creation of this, the newest of the Smithsonian's many museums, Lonnie Bunch has been promoted to run them all.",
        "When's your first day, by the way?",
        "(Laughter) Seems like it's already started.",
        "He formally starts as secretary of the Smithsonian next week, moving to a new office, although it will be hard to leave this one.",

        "His windows overlook the National Mall - the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials, the Washington Monument.",

        "Now he becomes the first African American to direct all 19 museums in the Smithsonian, along with its 21 libraries and the National Zoo.",
        "His association with the Smithsonian goes back to the 1960s, when he was a kid.",
        "We were traveling from New Jersey, where I grew up, to visit my mother's family in North Carolina.",
        "So we'd pass these signs for museums in Virginia and Maryland.",

        "We got to stop for gas later.",
        "We couldn't do these things.",
        "And he never stopped.",
        "And so I remember coming back, thinking I'm going to really be smart; I'm going to sort of give him 20-miles notice so we could stop, and he never did.",
        "But he pulled into Washington, D.C., and he parked in front of the Smithsonian, and he said, here's a place you can go where you won't be turned away by the color of your skin.",
        "And I never forgot what the Smithsonian meant to this kid.",
        "It meant America at its best.",

        "One was at the National Museum of American history, which is right across the street from the African American history museum.",
        "Their collections are different.",
        "We can go through this museum and find slave chains.",
        "We can go across the street and see the famous Star-Spangled Banner, that giant flag.",
        "But we know that Francis Scott Key, the guy who wrote \"\"The Star-Spangled Banner,\"\" was a slave owner.",
        "How does the story told their fit with the story told here?",
        "I think what's wonderful is that we're really looking at the same coin from many different sides.",
        "Because I think the biggest goal of history at the Smithsonian ought to be to help the American public embrace ambiguity.",
        "And so by going to the portrait gallery and understanding how they look at the notions of liberty and freedom - come to American history, suddenly you're getting to understand that America is this unbelievably complex place.",
        "And if we can help the public become comfortable with wrestling with the shades of gray, then we've really made a contribution.",
        "So we've talked a lot about diversity here.",
        "We're in a museum that is an expression of that.",
        "There's the National Museum of the American Indian just within sight.",
        "Are there more museums of that sort that are needed?",
        "I think that there is a desire to build on the complexity and understanding of America, whether it's issues of the Latino community, a story of gender issues.",
        "I think that it's really up to Congress to give us guidance on how they'd like to see the Smithsonian move forward."

        "You must have sometimes heard the concern expressed by some people that there might be a fragmented national narrative, that we're splitting it up into too many stories of too many groups and losing sight of the whole.",
        "Is there anything to that?",
        "So the Balkanization of American history, right?",
        "My sense is that, because we have these different portals into what it means to be an American, we're just giving you different ways to understand it.",

        "And then at the other end of the cell, there is a short concrete wall - came up to about my chest - and that's out of the view of the camera.",
        "And that's to provide privacy for the prisoner, but as we all know it, actually provided this advantage, a blind spot where Guzman went through the floor there.",

        "It was about two or three inches.",
        "It had no rebar in it.",
        "That was just incredible.",

        "And authorities say the engineers who built the tunnel must have had the prison blueprints and GPS devices to reach that exact point.",
        "And then what about all the noise - cutting through the rock and the soil right there to the shower?",
        "There are so many people working in that prison, and no one heard anything?",
        "That's just beyond credible.",
        "The amount of people that were bribed or in cahoots or just intimidated is just staggering.",

        "And here at home, the fallout politically is tremendous for President Pena Nieto.",
        "He gained so much by capturing Guzman, and he's lost even more with this huge escape.",
        "And it's just been really hard to watch Mexicans.",
        "They vacillate between disbelief to making jokes about the escape to just outright anger over this spectacle, the embarrassment and showing the world the great weaknesses in their institution.",
        "It's really painful to watch.",
        "All right, that's NPR's Carrie Kahn speaking to us from Mexico City.",
        "She just got a tour of the cell where the world's most powerful drug lord, Joaquin El Chapo Guzman, recently escaped.",
