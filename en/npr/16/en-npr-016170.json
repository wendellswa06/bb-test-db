        "Bill Bradley stepped away from politics, largely, after he failed to win the Democratic presidential nomination 12 years ago.",
        "But in a new book, he confesses that he misses public policy, and so sets out a series of arguments about how to get the economy back on track, about the corrosive role of money in politics and about the need to change what he calls a messianic foreign policy.",
        "If you have questions for Bill Bradley - the Knicks got eliminated last night, so we can skip that part - the number is 800-989-8255.",

        "Well, Neal, good to be with you and back on NPR.",
        "I'd like you to tell us a story about your first term, I think, a moment when Social Security was in crisis - sounds familiar.",
        "And you set up a series of town meetings where you expected to hear senior citizens say, now, don't cut my benefits, whatever you do, and then to hear their children say don't raise my taxes.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "You know, I was new in the Senate, about my third or fourth year, and here I was told that Social Security is about to go bankrupt, and there would be a presidential commission that was established who would make recommendations.",
        "And I needed to try to get a feel for what my constituents in New Jersey felt about it.",
        "So I had a professor from the state university, Rutgers, accompany me on at least 12 separate meetings around the state, and there would be three or 400, 500 people there.",
        "And the professor would put up on the board what the crisis was and what the options were to solve the problem.",
        "And, you know, talking to the politicos, they said, you know, well, all of the people who are working would just want to cut the benefits of the elderly, and the elderly would just like to increase taxes on the working people, and neither one of them would want to see the retirement age raised.",
        "Well, what I found was something quite contrary, because the elderly were grandparents and parents, and they did not want their children to bear the full burden of fixing Social Security by having a gigantic tax increase.",
        "And the children were daughters and sons, or granddaughters and grandsons, and they did not want to see the full brunt of solving the problem by cutting the benefits of their loved ones.",
        "And therefore, all four of them said - both of them said that in terms of retirement age, it would be OK if it was far enough out so people could plan.",
        "And that's exactly what we ended up doing back in 1983.",
        "We cut some benefits.",
        "We increased some taxes, and we extended the retirement age to 67 and solved the problem for another, you know, 40 years, 45, 50 years."

        "And that's - the point there is that I think people like it if politicians put country ahead of party and tell them the truth.",
        "I think the American people can accept the truth to a degree far beyond what the consultant community and the active political community believe.",
        "And to me, that's the key to our future.",
        "And so in writing \"\"We Can All Do Better,\"\" I was not only implying that we can do better on our economy and we can do better in our foreign policy and in the structure of our democracy, but I was also implying - given the challenges we face in the world today - that each of us has to be at his or her own best.",
        "And even if we're at our best individually, ultimately, our success as individuals, as a group, will depend upon the success of the nation.",
        "1983, of course, is a Republican president, Ronald Reagan, and Democrats control Congress - that kind of compromise hard to imagine today.",
        "That's true.",
        "A lot's changed since then.",
        "But keep in mind, Ronald Reagan - who's not exactly anything other than a conservative icon - always compromised at the end of the day in order to get something done.",
        "And now that's very difficult to imagine, particularly given the view of some of the Tea Party Republicans, that the era of collegiality is over and that the era of confrontation has begun, until they win.",
