        "You know, maybe we could focus more on the problems here at home, (unintelligible) maybe entail some responsibility.",
        "But maybe we shouldn't try to solve all the world's problems, but maybe just try to concentrate more here at home, that kind of thing, you know, instead of trying to solve every crisis around the world, you know, try to bind every wound, you know...",
        "John, I think we've got it.",
        "I agree with you 100 percent.",
        "I mean, all Americans think democracy is the best system of government.",
        "Americans are seriously divided as to whether we should fight wars abroad to promote democracy.",

        "One story said Europeans go to China to ask for investment in the euro bailout fund.",
        "The sender is required to give, you know, valid name, address, content, size of the package, who they're sending it to in the United States.",
        "It was a story about the Chinese then saying, well, we'll do it if you change the following provisions under the World Trade Organization that will essentially make it more difficult for them to be sanctioned, right.",
        "This - it was about - really about Chinese economic power in the world.",
        "The next story was Western business looks for investment in Libya.",
        "In other words, we are picking over the bones of our latest venture in the Middle East.",
        "During the last 12 years, while we've been following these wars in faraway places for dubious reasons, the Chinese have been laying the groundwork for economic growth and development in the 21st century.",
        "They've been doing it from high-speed rail lines from China to Southeast Asia and across Central Asia.",
        "They've been doing it with dams that would allow them to have major influence on the Southeast Asia and South Asia by damming the rivers that feed those countries in their own country.",
        "And they've been doing it in countless other ways.",
        "And we simply have to wake up.",
        "In the 21st century, it's not military that is the main issue.",
        "It is economic.",
        "And we need, as the caller said, investment in people in the United States.",
        "We need to tell them the truth about what we have to do to compete in a world economy that will become increasingly competitive, and we have to focus on that and not focus on a war in the far-distant place as a first resort.",
        "Obviously, you know, you can have an operation that goes after terrorists in various parts of the world, but you don't want a war like in Iraq.",
        "You don't want the long commitment that's been made in Afghanistan.",
        "You need to have the ability to respond to crises and to preempt, and you need adaptability in military matters."

        "Your experience with the seniors and their children was that they spoke a more true truth than the consultants.",
        "But why do the politicians always seem to believe the consultant over the American people?",
        "Pericles also started a war, but that's beside the point.",
        "Because it's difficult for someone who's in office to decide they're going to risk it all on following the belief they have.",
        "They want to get re-elected.",
        "The people who are in the culture of Washington - I call the members of the club, some of whom are consultants - perpetuate timidity in politicians.",
        "And by perpetuating timidity, we don't deal with the problems that we face as a country.",
        "And so I think that it's time that you don't just listen to the politicians in Washington or depend on them.",
        "I mean, look at - you know, at some point in American history, there were four or five people who said slavery is immoral.",

        "And my metaphor is the Mississippi River, which I write about in the book, which I grew up next to.",
        "And that is the Mississippi River started with one drop, then five drops, then a branch, then a creek, then a river and a bigger river, and there it is, the Mississippi.",
        "The same way with democracy, it starts with one person.",
        "And we simply have to understand democracy is not a vicarious experience.",
        "And in the Internet age, apathy should not be an option.",
        "Look at what happened in the Middle East by citizen activism.",
        "You mean to tell me there are not enough citizens in the United States that are bright enough to use the social network to create a movement that will do the things, some of which I just discussed, to create good jobs in this country at higher wages to deal with the deficit and to make sure the promise of America is available to everybody in this country?"

        "Well, who has actually tried to explain to the American people what the problem is?",

        "It's not a slogan.",
        "Yeah.",
