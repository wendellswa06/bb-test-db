        "to expand sanctions.",

        "The sanctions freeze the property and bank accounts of the targeted individuals and banned them from travelling in the U.S., Europe or Japan.",
        "Russia's deputy foreign minister denounced the moves as illegal and accused the United States of reviving Cold War tactics.",
        "But the reaction the Russian financial markets was mild.",
        "The two main stock industries actually closed higher.",
        "There were rumors and there were fears that the U.S.",
        "actually might go further and perhaps put some institutions that are more important for the economy onto the list.",
        "That's Chris Weafer from the financial consulting firm, Macro-Advisory.",
        "He says the rise in the markets was actually a small sigh of relief that the sanctions didn't go beyond targeting individuals and some smaller companies.",
        "But one individual who was targeted on the U.S.",
        "list raised eyebrows among analysts.",
        "He's Igor Sechin, a long time friend and former KGB colleague of President Putin.",
        "Sechin is now the head of the world's largest oil company, the state-run Rosneft and the decision to sanction him is the closest the United States has come to targeting Russia's oil and gas business.",
        "Political analyst Mikhail Troitsky says the move will be taken seriously by Rosneft's partners in the West, which include BP, Exxon Mobil and Shell.",
        "Rosneft was downgraded by the ratings agencies in the aftermath of sanctions against Mr. Sechin, but at this point, I think the move to sanction Mr. Sechin remains largely symbolic.",
        "Troitsky says that for now, the sanctions don't keep the multinational energy companies from doing business with Rosneft and though Sechin has been banned from travelling to the United States, he's not on the sanctions list in Europe.",
        "Still, Chris Weafer says the decision to name Sechin amounts to a warning shot.",
        "The very clear message is that if there are more sanctions, we will move into a different category and start to hurt institutions that are important for the economy and could start disrupting Russian trade and so I think Mr. Sechin's name is on the list to emphasize that point, that the next stage will be a lot more serious."
