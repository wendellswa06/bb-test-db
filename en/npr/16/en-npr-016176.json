        "So if you let the states opt out because they've got suburban districts that are doing okay and the rest of it, they may not take care of the kids who are in the districts who need help.",
        "So you can't let that happen.",
        "But I'm sympathetic with the idea that the curriculum should be more diversified everywhere.",
        "But for poor folks and for people of color in those cities, they're mainly concerned about fundamentals.",
        "Can our kids read, write?",
        "Do they know math and the rest, and then we'll worry about the rest of it later.",
        "So I hope that the Republican effort is defeated, but at the same time we do need to have some changes and some more money in No Child Left Behind, but we do need to keep it.",
        "But children are still, unfortunately, being left behind.",
        "You know, this sets up an interesting political dynamic because you have these Republicans, including some fairly big name Republicans.",

        "The House Minority Whip Roy Blunt.",
        "And they're really separating themselves from the president on this because they don't like the amount of government intrusion into education that No Child Left Behind brings with it.",
        "So interestingly, you have some liberal Democrats like Ted Kennedy and George Miller who are basically siding with the White House.",
        "Now they feel that there should be some changes in the legislation but not to the extent that these Republicans' opponents want.",
        "Because what the Republicans want, this group of Republicans at least, would essentially undermine what the president advocates.",
        "And so you have some strange bedfellows here; it's not the first time.",
        "But you have these conservative Republicans on one side and some liberal Democrats aligning themselves, at least more or less, with the White House.",

        "When I was in elementary school - and this was public - I went to public, you know, K through 12.",
        "We had an art magnet, we had music classes and there are all these theories of multiple intelligences.",
        "Is it really just that black kids need to learn the basics or is there something really extraordinary about allowing kids to experience other things?",
        "I mean, you think about the legacy of African-American music and how important it is to American music.",
        "Should there not be some room because, really, those kinds of classes are being squeezed out.",
        "Could you make an argument that the same things that wealthier Republican districts are arguing for might also work in inner-city schools?",
        "Well, it might, Farai, but I think what you touched on is what the debate is all about - flexibility on the local control.",
        "You know, the idea that we have - first of all, the idea that Republicans would still, because as we all know they were the ones who thought that the Department of Education should have been abolished completely, entirely.",
        "That was their platform for a long time.",
        "I thought it was always odd that they've become - and then say at some other point that we should federalize education, curriculum all to the extent to where you had deadlines that would be there uniformly for all 50 states.",
        "I think in terms of curriculum, I don't know whether it's - I'm not sure that I would agree completely with what you said.",
        "I think our challenge is one of competitiveness.",
        "And when you look at - the U.S.",
        "still has one of the high school graduation rates in the industrialized countries.",
        "We have three out of t10 ninth graders that don't graduate on time.",
        "Half of all the black kids, Hispanic kids, ninth graders, don't graduate within four years.",
        "Seems to me, you're talking about fundamentals here - as opposed to whether or not you're concerned about - although obviously I think that math, I mean, the arts, the other aspects of the curriculum that enrich all of our lives are important.",
        "But right now, I think when we talk about urban schools that Mary was talking about, I think we need to focus on some of the fundamentals."

        "I think I'll probably agree with your point and Nat's.",
        "The reason why George Miller and Ted Kennedy supported No Child Left Behind when Bush proposed it is because they knew that in some states they were neglecting the poor children we're talking about in the cities who could learn - we all know the horror stories about learning, so I won't detail those.",
        "And so the idea was you needed a federal law so that in fact there would be some standards that people had to meet.",
