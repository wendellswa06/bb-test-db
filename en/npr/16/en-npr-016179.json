        "Harry, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Thank you.",
        "We're talking with The New York Times foreign correspondent Anthony Shadid from Beirut.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And Anthony Shadid, how does the - well, what everybody now anticipates, the vote to sever Sudan in half, how does that play into this?",
        "Yeah, I think it shows again, if we go back to this point that I was trying to make earlier, about the failure of the state in some respects in the Arab world, I think this is another failure of that state, a failure to create or to somehow give room for pluralism.",
        "I mean, in the end what we have in Sudan is, you know, is a dismemberment of the state along - basically, along racial lines, you could argue, on religious lines as well.",
        "But it's a country that was not able to forge a greater or more universal identity.",
        "In the end, it had to separate itself in order to create any kind of viable future for either part of that.",
        "You know, I think it's a sad statement in some respects.",
        "I mean, I think it's a statement that is reflected, that reverberates elsewhere in the Arab world.",
        "Like I said, in countries like Lebanon, Iraq, even Egypt at this point, Syria, for instance, of being unable to create, you know, a broader notion of citizenship.",
        "And then you have to ask questions about the great oil sheikdoms, starting with the largest and most important of them, Saudi Arabia, which has an aged king and a royal family whose ability to continue to rule the country well, every time we think it's shaky, they seem to stagger on for another few decades.",
        "I think stagger is a good word to use, you know, these countries that are staggering forward.",
        "And, of course, Saudi Arabia and the countries in Gulf have, you know, fantastic oil revenues that are able to at least - or they can at least attempt to buy off their, you know, their citizen's loyalty, you know, to a certain level of livelihood.",
        "And I think for a while, though - and it's interesting that you raise this example of the Gulf, because I think for a while there, there was that - people might call the Dubai example.",
        "Here was Dubai, in some ways is a deep politicized society that was very economically vibrant.",
        "It seemed to have, in some ways, bought off its citizenship through this promise of a much more prosperous life, a very prosperous life, in fact.",
        "And they would accept that in exchange for not, you know, making very great political demands on their leadership.",
        "Well, Dubai failed, and it failed, you know, spectacularly so, in fact.",
        "And I think that whole idea of what Dubai represented to the Arab world has kind of gone away with it.",
        "What I think people might look to Tunisia down the road is that Tunisia offered, you know, a path at least for change.",
        "And I'm not saying that that change is going to happen anytime soon.",
        "It could be a process that plays out over years."

        "But Tunisia offered a path of change that we haven't really seen in the region lately.",
        "I think a lot of people have looked to Islamic parties as the opposition force in Arab societies, groups like Hamas or Hezbollah in Lebanon.",
        "What Tunisia said is that we're having a kind of a popular uprising that is motivated by economic grievances.",
        "They later turned into political demands.",
        "But it was popular frustration, and frustration with their government's inability to provide for better lives that, in ways, trigger that protest.",
        "And I think that's - that formula, that idea of economic grievances, frustration, anger, corruption and then political demand is something - is a formula that we see in a lot of Arab countries at this point.",
        "And yet we saw that formula in Algeria, what, 20, 25 years ago.",
        "Yet in a highly religious context and, well, it led to one of the bloodiest civil wars in the region.",
        "That's right.",
        "And I think Tunisia is a - it's a different example in that sense.",
        "And I think you're right to point that out.",
        "You know, Mr. Ben Ali very much crushed the Islamist opposition in Tunisia.",
        "It was driven abroad.",
        "Most of the exiled Islamic leaders lived in places like Paris and London.",
        "I think the events that unfolded in Tunisia took them by surprise.",
        "In a way, they were scrambling to somehow get back and involved in what was happening in Tunisia.",
        "You have a person like Rachid Ghannouchi, who was a very prominent Tunisian Islamist, who went abroad.",
        "He went to London in, I think, 1993.",
        "He's been talking about coming back, but he hasn't come back yet.",
        "And it was very clear that he was taken by surprise about - at what happened in Tunisia with the fall of Ben Ali.",
        "And another question that some have been asking, when there is so much frustration, there is so much stasis, so little seems to be happening, so many ambitions unanswered, sometimes people begin to think that the only solution is war.",
        "Yeah, I dont know if you feel this sense that the only solution is war out there right now.",
        "It's just kind of almost a disenchantment that becomes - you know, I think the risk of it is apathy in some respects.",
        "I think there are so much frustration, so much disenchantment, you know, so much disgust, in some ways, with the state of Arab politics right now by the people themselves that I think the biggest danger is apathy, is that people just give up.",
        "I think there, you know, we might see it kind of funnel itself into more dangerous paths, you know, a certain almost kind of nihilist tendency.",
        "But what you find, I think, living in the region and traveling in the region is the bigger danger is apathy.",
        "This is why I think Tunisia was such an electric example to the rest of the Arab world, that here for the first time in a long time, people saw, you know, neighbors in another country take matters into their own hands, demand change and eventually, you know, win success.",
        "That isn't something we've seen in a long time.",
        "And I think that's why the moment was so powerful and so remarkable for so many people here.",
        "Anthony Shadid, thanks very much for your time today.",
        "We appreciate it.",
        "My pleasure."

        "Right.",
        "Back in 2015, it was Mayor Bill de Blasio who was pushing for a cap on Uber.",
        "He was saying the company's growth was out of control, it was contributing to congestion and that the city needs to study what's going on.",
        "By the way, that's the same argument now.",
        "He was met with a wave of opposition from users and a million-dollar ad blitz from the company.",

        "It's not a middle-class job.",
        "In addition to stiff competition from ride-hailing apps, the value of those taxi medallions used to be a million dollars, now they're little more than $200,000.",
        "A lot of drivers took out hefty loans to pay off those medallions, to buy those medallions, but now they're struggling to pay the loans and pay their own bills, quite frankly.",
        "And this bill came out of the City Council, like you said.",
        "And many of the individuals that were pushing it do receive donations from unions in the taxi industry, which have an interest in protecting drivers.",
        "Let's hear from the head of the City Council, Corey Johnson.",
        "He's the one that really spearheaded these bills.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",

        "Yeah.",
        "OK, so you talk about the fact that taxi drivers, there have been these suicides, which is horrific.",
        "But can you expand a bit, Stephen, on why there's not enough competitive space for taxis and Uber or Lyft or ride-sharing?",
        "I mean, why is it so hard to make a living as a taxi driver in New York?",
        "Well, all for-hire vehicles in New York, whether it's Uber or Lyft or if you're affiliated with a traditional base that dispatches drivers, needs to get a license from the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission.",
        "They give it to everyone that applies.",
        "So this bill that passed the council would stop the issuing of new licenses for one year.",
        "The council wants to use that time, they said, to study the industry.",
        "They say with 2,000 new cars getting licenses every month, it's impossible to know what the dynamic is when it's constantly changing.",
        "Now they say they'll be able to look at quarterly reports on traffic, wages, where people are getting in and out of cars.",
        "And they say after a year, they'll reassess this cap, see if there's a better piece of legislation that might reduce congestion and ensure that there's still enough cars for people to get them when they want them.",
        "But, I mean, this is just basic capitalism, right?",
        "Like, if Uber and Lyft and other services have just found out a better way to provide the services - this service - and users prefer it, doesn't this mean taxis just need to figure out a way to compete?",

        "It wasn't there as pronounced, let's say, 10 or 20 years ago.",
        "I think, if you make a sweeping generalization, you could make the argument that these states, states like Egypt, Lebanon - of course, it's a much newer order in Iraq but you could say Iraq, as well, you know, have failed in creating a notion or a broader notion of citizenship, an inclusive, more universal identity.",
        "And it's one of the failures of the government that I think we're going to see play itself out over the next 10, 15, even 20 years.",
        "And a failure to do so - to have an idea of what their nation and, to a broader degree, the Arab nation is about other than perpetuating their own regimes.",
        "I think that's where the governments are at this point.",
        "I mean, we still - we're talking about an Arab country as very vibrant societies.",
