        "Sure.",
        "I wonder if your guest, Mr. Shadid, thinks that this series of events with these governments, you know, all of a sudden becoming a little more, you know, in play or in motion, do you think that, ultimately, it could become a vindication, if you will, of President Bush's policies?",
        "You know, the idea at one point was to sort of start and fertilize a democracy, an Arab democracy in the region so that, you know, other regimes might transform.",
        "You know, it's an interesting question.",
        "In fact - I mean, I think what you probably meant - the argument you probably would make is that the counterpoint to what the Bush administration was trying to do.",
        "I mean, we saw what happened in Iraq after the invasion in 2003.",
        "You know, it was a disaster with the fall of Iraq.",
        "It's a country that, in some ways, had its society torn apart and its fabric remains tattered.",
        "It's going to be a generation, perhaps, before that society comes, you know, comes to terms with itself again in a lot of respects.",
        "What Tunisia, I think, tells us is how movement - is that change is probably going to have to come from within.",
        "And the change in Tunisia very much came from within.",
        "It wasn't dictated by outside powers.",
        "It wasn't dictated by a policy that felt somehow alien to its people.",
        "It was change that came from below, from popular protests.",
        "And popular protests that weren't necessarily organized in the beginning.",
        "It was in the Islamist parties or leftist parties that triggered these protests.",
        "They tried to, you know, shape them as it went on.",
        "But it was - it felt very organic, in a way.",
        "It was a popular uprising that showed in the end the fragility of these autocratic governments.",
        "Do you think that it would have taken place, you know, if not for the American, you know, effort and presence in Iraq?",
        "And do you think that the, you know, protests in Iran were sort of another example, but in that case, it was repressed?",
        "All right.",

        "The American - the United States government was very much an ally of the Tunisian leader, of an autocratic leader.",
        "I think the United States saw it as a useful ally in the fight or at least what it considered its fight against al-Qaida.",

        "policy.",
        "We saw the administration, in some ways, try to kind of reposition itself after the fall of Ben Ali.",

        "And Anthony Shadid, how does the - well, what everybody now anticipates, the vote to sever Sudan in half, how does that play into this?",
        "Yeah, I think it shows again, if we go back to this point that I was trying to make earlier, about the failure of the state in some respects in the Arab world, I think this is another failure of that state, a failure to create or to somehow give room for pluralism.",
        "I mean, in the end what we have in Sudan is, you know, is a dismemberment of the state along - basically, along racial lines, you could argue, on religious lines as well.",
        "But it's a country that was not able to forge a greater or more universal identity.",
        "In the end, it had to separate itself in order to create any kind of viable future for either part of that.",

        "And then you have to ask questions about the great oil sheikdoms, starting with the largest and most important of them, Saudi Arabia, which has an aged king and a royal family whose ability to continue to rule the country well, every time we think it's shaky, they seem to stagger on for another few decades.",
        "I think stagger is a good word to use, you know, these countries that are staggering forward.",
        "And, of course, Saudi Arabia and the countries in Gulf have, you know, fantastic oil revenues that are able to at least - or they can at least attempt to buy off their, you know, their citizen's loyalty, you know, to a certain level of livelihood.",
        "And I think for a while, though - and it's interesting that you raise this example of the Gulf, because I think for a while there, there was that - people might call the Dubai example.",
        "Here was Dubai, in some ways is a deep politicized society that was very economically vibrant.",
        "It seemed to have, in some ways, bought off its citizenship through this promise of a much more prosperous life, a very prosperous life, in fact.",
        "And they would accept that in exchange for not, you know, making very great political demands on their leadership.",
        "Well, Dubai failed, and it failed, you know, spectacularly so, in fact.",
        "And I think that whole idea of what Dubai represented to the Arab world has kind of gone away with it.",
        "What I think people might look to Tunisia down the road is that Tunisia offered, you know, a path at least for change.",
        "And I'm not saying that that change is going to happen anytime soon.",

        "But Tunisia offered a path of change that we haven't really seen in the region lately.",

        "What Tunisia said is that we're having a kind of a popular uprising that is motivated by economic grievances.",
        "They later turned into political demands.",
        "But it was popular frustration, and frustration with their government's inability to provide for better lives that, in ways, trigger that protest.",
        "And I think that's - that formula, that idea of economic grievances, frustration, anger, corruption and then political demand is something - is a formula that we see in a lot of Arab countries at this point.",
        "And yet we saw that formula in Algeria, what, 20, 25 years ago.",

        "He went to London in, I think, 1993.",
        "He's been talking about coming back, but he hasn't come back yet.",
        "And it was very clear that he was taken by surprise about - at what happened in Tunisia with the fall of Ben Ali.",

        "Yeah, I dont know if you feel this sense that the only solution is war out there right now.",
        "It's just kind of almost a disenchantment that becomes - you know, I think the risk of it is apathy in some respects.",
        "I think there are so much frustration, so much disenchantment, you know, so much disgust, in some ways, with the state of Arab politics right now by the people themselves that I think the biggest danger is apathy, is that people just give up.",
        "I think there, you know, we might see it kind of funnel itself into more dangerous paths, you know, a certain almost kind of nihilist tendency.",
        "But what you find, I think, living in the region and traveling in the region is the bigger danger is apathy.",
        "This is why I think Tunisia was such an electric example to the rest of the Arab world, that here for the first time in a long time, people saw, you know, neighbors in another country take matters into their own hands, demand change and eventually, you know, win success.",
        "That isn't something we've seen in a long time.",
