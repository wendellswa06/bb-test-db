        "We feel that if we can get cell phones and BlackBerrys and texting and the use of cell phones out of people's hands, we can save a lot of lives.",
        "And we think when somebody is driving a bus with the safety of many lives in their hands, they ought to keep both hands on the wheel and both eyes on the road.",
        "And now, we believe that with ordinary drivers also, but particularly for those who are driving a bus or a big, huge heavy truck that can do a great deal of damage when it veers on the road or veers off the road.",
        "And we don't want these drivers to have any kind of distraction, because we think both hands on the wheel, both eyes on the road are the safest way to drive.",

        "So what we need are good laws with good enforcement.",

        "Six thousand people died in 2008 from people who were distracted while driving.",
        "And all you have to do is listen to the families who've lost children or children who've lost parents because some idiot was trying to send a message to somebody and they had their eyes on their BlackBerry texting when they should have had them on the road with both hands on the wheel.",

        "Though I suspect that if you increase the penalties for texting to include jail time or really substantial fines, probation, seizure of someone's vehicle, et cetera, that people would riot.",

        "In the state of Virginia, you go to jail for five days if you're caught with .08 - above .08 in your blood alcohol level.",
        "So - but when it comes to texting and driving, you just can't drive safely.",
        "And we need good enforcement and we need tough penalties, but we're talking about monetary penalties.",
        "And Mr. Secretary, don't we need to look forward, too, as cars -well, manufacturers want to put computer screens in cars so people can look at bigger maps of where they're going.",

        "You're saying they were reluctant to do the recall until your officials met with them?",
        "We had a lot of discussions with them, and I would say that we persuaded them that it was in their best interest - but more importantly, in the interests of the driving public, particularly those that are driving Toyota - to find a fix for these vehicles."
