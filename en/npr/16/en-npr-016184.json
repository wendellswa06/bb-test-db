        "People that have ridden high-speed rail in Europe or Asia come back and want to know why we're not in the business of providing this kind of service, and it's because our government really never made the initiative and never made the commitment of money that President Obama is willing to persuade Congress to include.",

        "Well, look, and I rode a train in Spain that went 250 miles an hour.",
        "It took them 20 years to get to that point.",
        "And as I said, we're at the starting point.",
        "There will be some speeds that will be 110 miles an hour.",
        "In some instances, there'll be trains at 150 miles an hour.",
        "In some regions, there'll be trains that will be faster than that.",
        "What we need to do is make the investments to upgrade Amtrak and freight rail lines to get us to higher speeds than we currently have.",
