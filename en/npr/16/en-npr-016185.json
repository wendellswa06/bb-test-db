        "...and that over the years, as she shifted from being a very tough, pugnacious, acerbic wire reporter, somebody who said presidents deserve respect but not awe, and therefore was willing to ask slightly more edged and pointed questions than some of her colleagues, that as she segued from the wire service of the United Press International in 2000 to become an opinion columnist for Hearst Newspapers, her beliefs became even more open and transparent.",
        "And although she retained a position in the press corps - youd often still hear her among the first people called upon to ask questions of presidents - it was clear that she had deep skepticism of President George W.",
        "Bushs invasion of Iraq, for example, in 2003.",
        "And some clarity of her position towards - particularly towards the Middle East.",
        "Theres no particular reason, for example, to believe that this is that far from her policy beliefs about the Middle East and about Israel - that is, that the Israelis are occupiers, as she does say on that videotape.",
        "And that this is Palestine and belongs to Arabs, and the Jews should leave.",
        "Correct.",
        "I mean, thats what she said.",
        "That said, I think its worth remembering, take a moment.",
        "She said shes retiring from Hearst Newspapers, and it has every sign of being a retirement from journalism in toto.",
        "This is somebody who has had extraordinary mark upon political journalism in Washington.",
        "I mean, shes covered every White House since John F.",
        "Kennedy - five decades.",
        "She was not only a tough questioner and an - shall we say, an aerobic reporter, not simply taking handouts, but she also busted up, in many ways, the old boys' club of the circles of Washington at the time: the first female to head the Gridiron Club, the first female to head the White House Correspondents Association.",
        "This may seem a little clubby and insider-y for people who are not inside those Washington worlds, but it sent a signal that women were evolving into full partners of the journalistic circles.",
        "And I think that shouldnt be forgotten in what is clearly a painful moment for both Thomas and for those who are quite understandably very critical of her this past week.",
        "The remarks that we broadcast just a moment ago were made following a White House news conference on May 27th.",
        "Much of that press conference focused on the BP oil leak.",

        "Not exactly a shrinking lily here asking the question.",
        "She's very strong, very pugnacious.",
        "And you know, she prided herself on being, in some ways, a counterpoint, and somebody asking questions that were out there but that others might not be willing to do.",
        "It must have been particularly painful for her to be criticized, as she was just today, by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, from the lectern - you know, where so many people had stood where she had been the one either offering questions or more recently, criticism.",
        "And indeed, it must also have pained her that so many journalists came forward, including the board of the White House Correspondents Association just today, which said that, you know, her remarks were insupportable.",
        "One of the things they were doing was considering whether she should be allowed to have that front-row seat - that perch right, you know, within footsteps of presidents and press secretaries - to ask those famous questions.",
        "You know, they said, we don't know that that's appropriate anymore.",
        "You know, again, for people not steeped in Washington, that may seem a very small thing, but it was stripping, really, of the dignity and of the stature that she had built over so many decades.",
        "And do we know at this point whether she was asked to leave by the Hearst News Service, or whether she offered a resignation?",
        "We don't officially know who said what, but what we do know was that, you know, her own speaking agent had dropped her over the weekend; a prominent Washington, D.C., public high school dropped her as a...",
        "Commencement speaker.",
        "...you know, commencement speaker.",
        "And it was clear that the ground was sort of yielding beneath her, that this was not going to be a supportable position.",
        "She'd apologized once or twice saying, you know, she was in favor of a time that she hoped that all parties in the Middle East would realize the need for peace.",
        "Well, it's early.",
        "You know, it's a little different to have an opinion about whether or not, for example, the time is ripe - or for peace in the Middle East, whether Prime Minster Netanyahu or whether the Hamas movement are partners who are likely to join together, than to tell people to get out - and particularly that, not only were Israeli occupiers - which is a position that some people even inside the state of Israel will articulate from time to time - but that, you know, Israelis should get back to the countries where their, you know, fellow Jews were, you know, the victims of genocide.",
        "It's just not a supportable statement for somebody in the mainstream of modern journalism, even opinion journalism, to hold.",
        "And she is not somebody who sort of stakes out a career, like a talk show a.m. host who's - you know, seemingly comes up with a one offensive thing after another just to gather attention.",
        "Although she was provocative, it wasn't seemingly for that reason."
