        "To talk more about what stymies the adults in this story from seeking justice, give us an idea of what was happening in the late '80s, that made it difficult for victims of sexual assault on reservations to seek justice; because in the early pages, you know, one of Geraldine's - one of her husband's first questions, is not necessarily who had done this to her, but where.",
        "Well, there are several kinds of land on reservations.",
        "And all of these pieces of land have different entities who are in charge of enforcing laws on this land.",

        "And the book is also about the legacy of generations of injustice, and what comes of that.",
        "Because, of course, what comes of that is, an individual needs to seek justice in their own way, when they can't find justice through the system.",

        "And I think it drew me to - to law, and what its meaning is for Native American people.",
        "The law is the basis of existence, in many ways, because reservations - and even our status within the United States - makes us legal entities because the original way tribal people were recognized, was through treaties.",
        "So I've thought about it quite a lot; and why revenge is the only form of justice in some locations, and in some terrible situations.",
