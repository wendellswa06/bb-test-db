        "Well, it raised ire, obviously, among the Romanoff backers.",

        "Michael Bennet was an early supporter of Barack Obama.",
        "We're talking 2007.",
        "I mean, he maxed out his donations to Barack Obama in March of 2007 when a number of other Coloradans here, including Romanoff, lined up behind Hillary Clinton or had not made a decision yet.",
        "So he was a key advisor to Barack Obama on education, and they have a personal relationship.",

        "What's the issues involved here, other than Romanoff's ambition?",
        "That's what people say.",
        "I don't see what the difference is between them.",
        "They've both pretty much Denver, you know - neither of them actually is a liberal-liberal.",
        "That's what's kind of interesting.",
        "In the - when Romanoff led the legislature, he stood up to the union, sometimes to their chagrin.",
        "So did Michael Bennet at Denver Public Schools.",
        "So they're a lot the same.",
        "In fact, Democrats will say, what's the difference between them?",
        "But Romanoff lobbied very hard to be named senator.",
        "He thought he should have gotten the job.",
        "And, of course, he's - for seven, six months, whatever, people said you should have been appointed.",
        "And I think he finally believed it and said why not give the people a choice?",
        "Why not run against the governor who didn't appoint him?",
        "That's what - he actually had made calls on that.",
        "That's what's interesting.",
        "Romanoff had called various Democrats and said I'm thinking of running against the governor.",
        "Now, one rumor has it that he saw a poll and thought Bennet was easier to beat.",
        "Other rumors have it that he sat down and said yeah, but the job I really wanted was senator, not governor.",
        "So I'm going to go back and go after the job that really appealed to me in the first place.",

        "I don't think Senator Bennet is qualified to be a senator.",
        "I think he's very good in education, but I think that the White House should stay out of it and just let the people of Colorado decide.",
        "Would you prefer Mr. Romanoff?",
        "You know, really, as your speaker said, there's not a whole lot of difference between the two of them as far as being a Democrat.",
        "Mr. Romanoff has proven himself working in the state legislature, and again, Mr. Bennet's expertise, other than being a friend of the president, is in education.",

        "I feel like that he just hasn't done very much to court my vote and hasn't really been around, whereas I've seen Romanoff speak and I'm very impressed with him.",
        "I think he's a young and charismatic leader.",
        "He's done an excellent job passing issues that are important to me at the state legislature, not the least of which is selling alcohol on Sunday, which is not a big deal, but he's been a really great - he's been a great leader, and I just - I really hope that Romanoff is able to pull it out, and even as an educator, I really would prefer Romanoff in my Senate seat than Bennet.",

        "And so he was - you know, so he's - I think in some ways, he's much more charismatic than Michael Bennet, but once you get to know Michael Bennet, he's very personable.",
        "He's all that, but I think on that surface of just meeting people - the other things is - excuse me - Romanoff has been - has - is everywhere in part because Romanoff's not really had - he's taught some this year, but in the entire time I've known him, the legislature's been his full-time job.",
