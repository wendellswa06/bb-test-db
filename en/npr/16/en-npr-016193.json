        "She had said in the past that she'd missed voting in a few elections.",

        "She had failed to register to vote for 28 years, and that hadn't - she hadn't registered until 2002 and had skipped some elections after that.",

        "Oops.",
        "Yeah, oops.",
        "So the - immediately, her opponent, California Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner, one of the other Republicans running, pounced on that, called on her to drop out of the race and was up on TV with a commercial attacking her for that.",
        "So it remains to be seen whether that'll be a problem within the Republican primary for her.",
        "But as voters are just getting to know her, it's a piece of information that may get some attention.",

        "So, I can't forget about him.",

        "You've said you didn't vote and that it was a bad thing and you regret it.",

        "It was long.",
        "It was sort of a recitation of ideas, a lot of which had been heard before.",
        "And so I think she may have been thinking ahead to the next hour when she gave that speech because she knew she was going to give a press conference and that she was going to get grilled over her voting record.",
        "But she did seem a little distracted.",
        "It was sort of low key.",
        "People - you know, people like her.",
        "They think she has a good chance to win in 2010 if she gets the nomination.",

        "Scott, with the economy being, obviously, the big issue in California, some Republicans felt that by picking Meg Whitman for governor and Carly Fiorina for the Senate, business-oriented Republican candidates are the way to go.",
        "But there is - after all of these years of Schwarzenegger and the budget deficit, there is pent-up anger among conservatives.",

        "They don't, and they certainly don't feel Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of them.",
        "One of the most striking things about the weekend was just how much - almost a sense of betrayal and anger there is at Schwarzenegger, even though he is one of the few Republicans who's won statewide office in the past 20 years.",
        "And so there is a concern - I think there's kind of a - almost a grand compromise, Ken, that they're going to set aside some of these more divisive cultural issues like abortion and gay rights and gun owner rights for now and try to unite around things like lower taxes, smaller government, things that the Republicans can agree on.",
        "But at the same time, as you say, there is some real doubt that Fiorina, Whitman, and for that matter, Steve Poizner and Tom Campbell are really one of them when it comes to these core principles.",
        "And I should point out, this is a really unusual set of candidates, because not only they're Republicans but all the Democrats all come from the San Francisco Bay area.",
        "And there's no serious major party candidate from Los Angeles.",
        "And there isn't like to be, either, and that's - it's very unusual.",

        "That was the last time we heard from her in 2008.",
        "So - but nonetheless, it would be appealing, they say, to have a woman running against Barbara Boxer, the incumbent Democrat who's often seen as being somewhat weak, although she continually knocks off the Republicans that she faces in the general election.",
        "But, yes, Chuck DeVore, a well-regarded Republican leader in the legislature is running in that primary, as well.",
        "And as you mentioned, at least the Democrats are united on their Senate candidate.",

        "At a downtown Manitowoc lunch counter, 41-year-old John Tobin says if the rest of the country learns more about the state in the process, that's just fine by him.",

        "This far out.",

        "Good morning.",
        "So can you explain this decision to overturn these lifetime bans?",
        "The Court of Arbitration for Sport in reviewing 43 cases - there are some - or 42 - some still pending - found 28 did not have sufficient evidence to meet an anti-doping rule violation in terms of the athletes' role in this systemic doping.",
        "This conspiracy is one of the charges under the World Anti-Doping Code.",
        "It did uphold the disqualification sanction part for 11 different athletes but did not uphold the lifetime ban.",
        "That's something that the IOC knew full well going into it was unlikely to last.",
        "So those 11 athletes, some of whom have retired, are not able to participate or go to Korea but may participate in future games theoretically.",
        "In terms of the 28 athletes in Korea, that's still very much a question mark right now.",

        "The decisions yesterday reinstate nine of them, which puts Russia back up on top of the medal count by either way that you do it, overall medals or, you know, gold medals.",
        "They are back in the lead there, assuming this stands and the IOC doesn't appeal it further.",
        "That's amazing.",
        "It, like, changes the narrative from those games in such a big way.",
        "Well, speaking of narratives, going into this game, I mean, such a narrative that Russia is said to have this huge state-sponsored doping program.",
        "I mean, there's a distinction, of course, that has been made between the program and the athletes themselves.",

        "That's why the IOC took the move to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee.",
        "And those athletes competing in Korea will do so as Olympic athletes from Russia, a neutral designation without their flag.",
        "OK, but some of these athletes might actually be able to compete, which could be extraordinary.",
