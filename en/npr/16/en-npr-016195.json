        "Despite all the talk internationally about Iran's nuclear activities, the big news topic in Iran today was Friday's parliamentary election.",
        "Several thousand candidates vied for 290 seats in the parliament.",
        "Almost all were conservatives of one stripe or another.",
        "Reformists were either banned or boycotted.",
        "For some the election was seen as a contest for power between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
        "But Iran's news media are reporting it was hardly a contest.",
        "Supporters of Khamenei were said to have soundly defeated partisans of Ahmadinejad.",
        "Local news media quoting the Ministry of the Interior said 75 percent of the Khamenei candidates won seats.",
        "Over the weekend, the interior minister announced that the turnout was 64 percent, an epic election some hardliners proclaimed.",
        "Some critics of the regime call it an invented election.",
        "The hostility toward Ahmadinejad among conservatives runs so deep now that the current parliament ordered him to appear soon to answer questions about his administration, a possible first step to impeachment.",
        "Mike Shuster, NPR News.",
        "The Boeing 787 is called the Dreamliner, and it's been billed as the airliner of the future.",
        "It's certainly critical to the future of Boeing.",
        "Its fuselage is made largely of composite material that makes it lighter and more fuel efficient than the previous generation of jets.",
        "The company has racked up 840 orders, the most of any new plane, but the Dreamliner has been plagued by seemingly endless quality issues and production delays.",
        "The first test flight was yesterday, and NPR's Wendy Kaufman was there.",
        "The maiden flight of the 787 came more than two years late, and the plane is billions of dollars over budget.",
        "But for one day, at least, the excitement of first flight seemed to eclipse everything else.",
        "(Soundbite of cheering, jet engines)",
        "A huge crowd of Boeing employees line the runway at Paine Field north of Seattle to witness the event.",
        "There were high fives and hugs as the jet rolled down the runway and disappeared into the cloud-laded sky.",
        "Matt Knighton, a senior engineer on the project, seemed close to tears of both happiness and relief.",
        "His other emotions?",
        "Proud, tired.",

        "A lot of people wrapped up a lot of their lives for the last several years making that happen.",
        "Knighton and his team have been working feverishly the past several months to fix a structural weakness in the area where the wing meets the fuselage.",
        "It was the latest in a series of problems that beset the 787 from the start.",
        "Boeing's use of lightweight carbon fiber material proved more challenging than the company expected, and Boeing outsourced not just production, but also design and engineering work.",
        "The plan to fit large sections of the plane together in just three days proved elusive to say the least, though that remains the company's long term goal.",
        "The 787 must also prove itself in terms of aircraft performance.",
        "Based on yesterday's flight, Boeing and the 787's chief pilot, Michael Carriker, are extremely pleased.",
        "Everything was, yup, that's, yes, yes, yes, rotate, yes, flyaway.",
        "I rolled the airplane left and it rolled left, and I rolled it right and it rolled right.",
        "And I stepped on the right rotor pedal, and we are good to fly.",
        "Copilot Randy Neville, who exclaimed he must have the best job in the Boeing company, had high praise for the jet as well.",
        "There were no surprises and no major issues with the airplane, which considering the complexity, that's a huge statement on the quality of the build and the design.",
        "In fact, to an extent, we tested a little more aggressively than we were expecting because of the turbulence that we encountered and the icing conditions that we encountered.",
        "If there was a disappointment, it was that the planned five-hour flight was cut back to three hours because of the weather, and some of the tests they planned to conduct had to be postponed.",
        "Still, yesterday marked just the beginning of a rigorous nine-month testing program.",
        "The idea is to find the weak links, if there are any, and fix them.",
        "Test pilots will deliberately push the jet to its outer limits, subjecting it to things such as lightning strikes, midair stalls and engine failure on takeoff.",
        "Boeing hopes to deliver the first of its new twin-aisle, mid-range jets late next year.",

        "In 2002, he released a CD of music including this piece composed just for him.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF PIANO MUSIC)",
        "You can hear musicality in Transtromer's' language and rhythm, and in names of the classical composers with whom he sometimes almost seems to collaborate.",

        "This is from a guy who says one of the best films about journalism that he likes is \"\"Broadcast News\"\" where journalist Albert Brooks, Holly Hunter, William Hurt talk about journalistic ethics."
