        "He spent his adult life not just as poet but psychologist, working with imprisoned teenagers and addicts.",
        "And he traveled the world, translating what he saw.",
        "(Through Translator) In the evening dark of a place outside New York, Lookout Point, where one glance can encompass eight million people's homes.",
        "The giant city over there is a long flickering snow drift, a spiral galaxy on its side.",
        "Starting in the late 1960s, Tomas Transtromer began to develop a U.S.",
        "following, thanks to poet Robert Bly, who was the first to translate him into English.",
        "I was reading Swedish poetry and found him.",
        "And then I wrote to him and said, wow.",
        "Bly says he was staggered, not just by stealthy brilliance of Transtromer's metaphors but by the clarity of his beliefs.",
        "Swedes tend to be a little too modern and Tomas was not like that.",
        "I felt that he was a new voice in Swedish poetry, in which a lot of spiritual energy appears - not mocking it but living with it.",
        "Transtromer's work has been translated into over 50 languages, according to Peter Englund, permanent secretary to the Swedish Academy.",
        "But in an interview following this morning's announcement, he admitted that Transtromer's output is more about quality than quantity.",
        "You could fit it into a not-too-large pocket book, all of it.",
        "So he has a very sparse and very well-contained production.",
        "He is not a prolific author.",
        "You could probably read every poem Tomas Transtromer has written in a single evening, he said.",
        "One very special evening."

        "There was a very small handful of economists who were saying there was a severe risk of a systemic breakdown in the economic system.",
        "But the vast majority did not see that.",
        "It was still very reasonable to say that the economy was not headed for recession.",
        "We now know that the economy actually was already in recession.",
        "The big themes were: China's growth will continue unimpeded; gasoline prices will stay very high; there was a recognition of a housing-market crisis, but not anything like the systemic crisis that we did witness.",
        "So, let's look to what really happened in 2008.",
        "Sort of remember flashes; it feels like a bad dream, actually: Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Fannie and Freddie.",
        "Give us the key moments.",
        "Well, the first three months of 2008, for most of that time there was this real belief, OK, we have a tough housing market; if you make your living building homes or selling homes you're probably not going to have a great year.",
        "But everyone else dodged a bullet.",
        "We're safe.",

        "The other major investment banks - Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley - certainly the big, broader universal banks like Citibank are totally safe.",
        "There were a growing number of economists saying, ooh, I'm seeing some scary things on the horizon.",

        "Well, if at the end of 2007, people were reasonably certain and entirely wrong, now people are totally confused and probably right to be totally confused.",

        "Where is the gold?",
