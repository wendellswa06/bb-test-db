        "One of the things that's really exciting about archeology is that there's history under everybody's feet.",

        "We run an organization, the Great Lakes Historical Society, and one of the things we do is to send divers down with an archeologist to map shipwrecks on the bottom of Lake Erie.",
        "And one of the reasons we do it is because it provides the state with a legal record of what is on the bottom of the lake so that in the event that treasure hunters do go to these shipwrecks, they will have a more difficult time selling their artifacts on eBay, for example, because a legal record has been established so that we know what's down there.",
        "So there are still these treasure hunters out there and in the world of archeology, I think, they are also known as bad guys, not good guys.",
        "And what kinds of wrecks are there at the bottom of Lake Erie?"

        "What's the most interesting thing you've found, Chris?",
        "Well, we actually just discovered last year the \"\"General Anthony Wayne,\"\" which was an 1835 steamboat which exploded in Lake Erie from a boiler explosion and sank, and it was thought to be a boat that would have carried gold from the Buffalo to Toledo on its way out west.",
        "But it was on its way back east when it exploded.",
        "And it doesn't have gold on it, but it has engine parts from a steam engine that - there's no plans for those engines anymore.",
        "So it provides us with a knowledge of how steam engines were made in the 1830s because they don't exist anymore in real life.",
        "So archeology is often about finding historical answers as opposed to finding gold.",
        "And one thing we already knew was they didn't make the boilers thick enough.",
