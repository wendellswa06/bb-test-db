        "So we train our system using a bunch of audio that's already been defined as either actors speaking angrily or happily.",

        "Well, the Justice Department had considered seeking the death penalty against Rudolph, but there was one big reason that they say they didn't.",

        "He buried it somewhere in North Carolina.",
        "And prosecutors were afraid that that might detonate accidentally and cause a large loss of life and a lot of injuries.",
