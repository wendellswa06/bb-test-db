        "Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins thinks so.",
        "In his new book, Dawkins lays out the case for atheism and against religion.",
        "Of course, without religion there would be no Crusades, no Salem witch hunts, no Jihadists, no televangelists, and frankly Dawkins says that's a good thing.",
        "His book argues against the existence of God, and he writes if this book works for you, you will be an atheist when you put it down.",
        "Well, this is - if this doesn't get people fired up, I'm not sure which topic we do on SCIENCE FRIDAY is.",
        "But I think that Dr. Dawkins has thrown down the gauntlet here, and I have a feeling some people will be happy to try to pick it up.",
        "But in any case, you're welcome to do so.",
        "The number is - maybe I didn't use the right expression, but I'm sure I'll get corrected - 800-989-8255.",

        "And now let me introduce my guest.",
        "Richard Dawkins is an evolutionary biologist.",
        "He is currently the Charles Simonyi Professor of Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University.",
        "He is the author of many books, including The Selfish Gene and The Blind Watchmaker.",
        "His new book is The God Delusion.",
        "He joins me from BBC Studios in Oxford, and welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Dawkins.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "It's very kind to have you here.",
        "Now, okay, you wrote this book with the hope that people picking it up - religious people picking it up will be atheists when they put it down.",
        "First of all, what do you think the chances are of that?",
        "That's a fairly ambitious hope, some might say almost ridiculously so.",
        "I know that I'm not going to change the minds of died in the wool faith heads, and to some extent, I may be preaching to the choir to those atheists who do read it."

        "I do think, though, that there probably is a large middle ground of people who have always sort of been vaguely religious because they were brought up that way but probably haven't given it much thought, probably because they've got better things to do.",
        "And maybe some of them reading my book will be moved to think again, think hard, think it through, and maybe come to the conclusion that in fact the religion in which they were brought up is a lot of nonsense.",
        "Now as I read the book, it seemed to me that a lot of the arguments were not necessarily arguments that had to be made by a scientist.",
        "I mean a sociologist could look at many of the points you make about the various, as you call them, negative aspects of religion and come to the same conclusion, not to say that a sociologist is not a scientist, I should hasten to add.",
        "But why are you as a evolutionary biologist particularly interested in taking up this topic?",
        "Well, that's a very good point, and a sociologist could indeed make the points in that part of the book, which is sort of the second half, where I discuss some of the negative aspects of religion.",
        "However, the first half of the book is dominated by an argument against the existence of God, against the existence of a supernatural creator.",
        "That I regard as a scientific argument, and I don't think a sociologist would be the ideal person to make that argument.",
        "I do think that the existence of God is essentially a scientific question in the sense that a universe that contains a God would be a very different kind of universe, scientifically speaking, from a universe that does not contain a God.",
        "That I think is a scientific issue.",
        "It's not an issue that science can prove one way or the other, but it is an issue that I believe science can give a probability to.",
        "Right.",
        "I think - I have to mention that in the last - we've been talking also on this program about the physics Nobel Prize, which was given out this year to two American scientists who were looking at the background radiation from the cosmic - from the Big Bang.",
        "And of course that's one of those places where you start to talk about the very origins of everything, and God often tends to come up.",
        "And in your book, you were talking about Einstein and his description of God, and I wonder if you can talk about the difference between the kind of a God that Einstein was talking about and the kind of a God that you're trying to disprove the existence of.",

        "His first book is just out - \"\"I'd Rather We Got Casinos: And Other Black Thoughts.\"\" It's filled with un-PC insights about black people, like why black people don't report UFO sightings, and why chocolate is a better racial term for African-Americans.",
