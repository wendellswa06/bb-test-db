        "Well, I don't mean it to sound cynical when I say that, but they are people brought in by the president to help personify heroism but oftentimes also to help with the president in setting his agenda.",
        "It could be in the middle of the health care debate on the Affordable Care Act or when the president was encouraging Congress to raise the minimum wage or whatnot.",
        "And you know, to bring someone in or to invite someone in and, you know, discuss about how a minimum wage increase would affect their lives, for example, is a way to try to push the agenda forward and try to change public opinion in the country to put pressure on Congress.",

        "It was his kind of poetic, slightly jocular way of referring to the deep problems of physics which remain to be solved.",

        "He certainly was not a theist.",

        "You've expressed exactly my thoughts.",
        "I wish I dared express them myself, but I don't dare because I would be - I'd lose my wife or my job or my parents would disown me.",
        "It's really quite shocking the number of letters to that effect that I have received.",
        "Yes, I was amazed as you were writing, some of the stories that you received.",
        "Well, okay, so is there - I mean is there a middle ground, because that is something that I, at least in my introduction to you, suggested that you were not in favor of a meeting of the minds, but maybe you can say that for yourself.",
        "This is where it gets really interesting, because the majority of my scientific colleagues, who by the way are atheists, nevertheless do respect the middle ground and go out of their way to try to, in a sense, woo the middle ground, that's to say, sensible decent, religiously sophisticated believers who are not creationists - they believe in evolution, so I mean they've got some kind of education - but they do believe in God, and they might believe that God perhaps started evolution off and then let it run or perhaps designed the genetic code in such a way that evolution would be likely to occur.",
        "Now that middle ground is a sort of contested area for the political lobbyists in the American education wars, because there is a war going on between those who are trying to teach creationism in American public schools and those who think that evolution is the only theory that should be taught in science classes about where life comes from.",
        "Right.",
        "Now in those education wars, those science education wars, the middle ground, the people who believe in evolution, are wooed by, in a sense, both sides.",
        "And there is a strong evolution lobby, a strong science lobby, many of whose individual luminaries are themselves atheist, but they bend over backwards to be nice to what I call the sensible middle of the road theists who also believe in evolution, because they want to isolate the creationists.",
        "And I think that's a - I can well see that that is a very tactically, politically savvy thing to do."

        "And I think in a way they might have a point because I have heard that some creationists love to quote people like me because it lends weight to their claim that if you are an evolutionist that means that you have to be an atheist.",

        "I am passionate about what's true, and I do actually believe that there's a very strong reason to think that there is no God.",
        "On the other hand, if you're a sensible, religious person who believes in God but absolutely hates organized religion and particularly organized religion in power politics, then I'm on your side.",
        "Well, we do have to take a short break, but we're talking to Dr. Richard Dawkins, the author of The God Delusion, and we'll have more about truth and religion when we come back.",
