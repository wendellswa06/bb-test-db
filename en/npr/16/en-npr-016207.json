        "From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "I'm Joe Palca.",
        "We're talking this hour about science and religion with my guest Richard Dawkins.",
        "He's an evolutionary biologist at Oxford University and author of The God Delusion.",
        "And, well, I know that you describe in the book some of the great debates you've had, and I think you might have had a debate with the person I want to hear from right now.",
        "This is actually - I've got a clip of tape from an interview Ira Flatow did with Francis Collins a couple of weeks ago where Francis - I mean, Ira was trying to get Francis Collins to expand on the topic of whether or not - it sort of comes out of this last question we had - whether or not an atheist, or even somebody who doesn't particularly believe in religion, can still have faith.",
        "And here's what Francis Collins said.",
        "I think they probably are required to have more faith than many people who believe in God because they have to have faith in their own intellect's ability to know so much that they can exclude the possibility of God categorically, which seems to me the greatest statement of faith, or perhaps hubris and arrogance, that one could imagine.",
        "So, yes, faith, but in what?",
        "But as I look about myself in the culture we live in and the world we live in, a world without the kind of noble intentions that arise many times out of people's hearts in the consequence of their faith, a world that misses out on a Mother Teresa or an Oskar Schindler, a world where science has to go on in a completely materialist way, does not sound like the kind of world of wonderful humanity and nobility of humankind that I hope will be evolving over the many decades to come.",
        "So I wanted to get your reaction to what Francis Collins had to say, Richard Dawkins.",
        "There were two quite separate points there.",
        "Right.",
        "The first one interests me more, the one about an atheist needs even more faith than a theist because an atheist has to exclude positively faith, categorically exclude it."

        "I think that's such a misguided thing to say.",
        "I mean, presumably Francis Collins does not believe in Thor, Apollo, Zeus, unicorns, fairies at the bottom of the garden, the flying spaghetti monster.",
        "There are any number of things that he doesn't believe in.",
        "And would he say that he has to have faith that there is no such thing as a flying spaghetti monster?",
        "I mean that's really essentially all that he said.",
        "Why single out God among that great litany of things that many people throughout the ages may or may not have believed in?",
        "Why single out God as being something that you have to have hubris and arrogant positive faith in order not to believe?",
        "There are a million things Francis Collins doesn't believe in.",
        "I don't believe in them either.",
        "I just add one more thing, which is the entity that he calls God.",
        "Right.",
        "And going on to the second point, about the - losing out on some of the - well, I know you have a slightly different opinion of Mother Teresa.",
        "Well, I mean the nobility of certain human characters - I wouldn't mention Mother Teresa in that breath.",
        "I don't think that she was a very admirable person.",
        "However, I do think that Martin Luther King was extremely admirable.",
        "I think Mahatma Gandhi was extremely admirable.",
        "I think that Jesus was extremely admirable.",

        "Plenty of religious people who are bad.",
        "Plenty of atheists who are bad.",
        "It doesn't really get you anywhere to compile a list of good and bad religious people and atheists.",
        "The question you want to ask is is there any general reason why you should expect that religion or atheism would be more likely to make you good or bad, and that's a very different question.",
        "It's not a question that can be answered by sort of counting heads.",
        "Okay, let's go back and invite our callers to join this conversation, and we'll start again with Brent in Kansas City, Missouri.",
        "Brent, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "Hello.",
        "My question is - I am not a theist, and I don't like to categorize myself as an atheist per se, but I (unintelligible) because a lot of my friends that are atheist, it almost seems as that's become their religion, that atheism is now something that they tout as a belief system.",
        "And I almost - that's why I don't really know how to categorize myself.",
        "I mean there could be, you know, the flying spaghetti monster, anything.",
        "I don't know.",
        "I don't care, really.",
        "I mean what is your view of that.",
        "I mean, has atheism become a religion unto itself?",
        "Yeah, I see what you're saying, and I think it is worry.",
        "I don't think, as a matter of fact, it has become a religion.",
        "I'm a little surprised you say you don't care, because I would have thought that that issue - and you and I agree that there is no God - but on the other hand, if there was one, it would be a tremendously important fact about life and the universe, would it not?",
        "I mean I can't imagine that you would look upon the world in quite the same way if you thought there was a God as you do now when you think that there isn't.",
        "Well -"

        "So I don't think it's something - sorry, yes, go ahead.",

        "Yeah, I think that's right.",
        "That's ridiculous and disturbing to come from their campaign, and beneath the dignity of the president.",
        "- so how do you believe the dogma of anything so that - I mean I don't mean that I don't care in a apathetic way.",

        "I mean I think we agree that there is no God, and I think we perhaps disagree a little bit on whether we think it makes any difference to us, and perhaps that's more of a - more like disagreeing about the kind of music we like.",
        "I actually was going to take that in a slightly different direction.",
        "What would happen if the atheism became ascendant?",
        "And here we are in our biology class in high school, and the teacher says, Johnny, how do you - what do you think about biology?",

        "Well, I suppose there is, but I mean, if Johnny said that he believes that the world was flat and not round, I suppose he would sit in the corner with the dunce's cap on.",
        "I don't think you'd want to call that totalitarian.",
        "I mean the evidence for the fact of evolution is just about as strong as the evolution that the world is round and not flat.",
        "So I mean, I don't want to victimize any child for what they believe, but I do think that children should be exposed to the evidence that is available, and as it happens, the evidence for evolution is massive and utterly convincing to anybody who's studied it objectively.",
        "Okay.",

        "Ariana, welcome to the program.",
        "Hi.",
        "Hi.",
        "In my school there's some of the children's parents don't let their kids go to science class if the teacher teaches extensively in evolution, and I'm wondering if you have a comment on that.",
        "Well, I better restrain myself.",
        "I think it's a form of mental child abuse by the parents on the children.",
        "I think that parents don't own their children, and there are limits to the rights that parents have over their children's minds.",
        "I think it - to really echo something I said in answer to the last question - it would be equivalent to parents not allowing their children to go to geography class because the geography teacher taught that the world was round, and so I do think it's a very bad thing.",
        "I think that there are limits to the freedom that parents ought to be allowed to have to brainwash their children.",
        "Ariana, thank you for that call.",
        "You're welcome.",

        "Dr. Dawkins, I think you're brilliant.",

        "You cannot disprove God.",

        "Either way you can't prove he does exist.",

        "There's no positive reason why they should believe it.",
        "And exactly the same is true of God.",
        "That seemed to me to be an absolute, knock down reply to the statement well, you can't disprove God.",
        "Therefore you might as well believe him as likely as not.",
        "So I guess the flying spaghetti monster is just sort of a modern incarnation of that argument."
