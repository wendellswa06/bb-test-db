        "But I was thinking more from an anthropological standpoint that early civilization, before they knew about a God, created their own religion out of an innate human need to create understanding about the world about them, because I cynically believe that everybody believes what makes them most comfortable.",
        "And so I'm looking for answers, do we as human beings have an innate need to just create these things?",

        "And so the word I would say is miraculous.",
        "And I think what happens is people have a hard time accepting the fact that such a remarkable thing can happen not by chance, as you point out, but through a selection process that would have eventually gotten to this point.",
        "And my thesis - and you can knock it down if you like - is that people have a really hard time understanding extremely big numbers, because what this - all the things that led to these events are small occurrences, lower probability occurrences, but they could occur."
