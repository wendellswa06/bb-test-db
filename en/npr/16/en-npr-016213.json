        "Well, if you had asked me a year ago, I might have said I didn't know whether there was global warming at all.",
        "But we had begun a major study, scientific reinvestigation.",
        "We were addressing what I consider to be legitimate criticisms of many of the skeptics.",
        "But about nine months ago, we reached a conclusion that global warming was indeed taking place, that all of the effects that the skeptics raised could be addressed, and to my surprise, actually, the global warming was approximately what people had previously said.",
        "It came as a bigger surprise over the last three to six months when our young scientist Robert Rohde was able to adopt really excellent statistical methods and push the record back to 1753.",
        "With such a long record, we could then separate out the signatures of solar variability, of volcanic eruptions, of El Nino and so on.",
        "And actually, to my surprise, the clear signature that really matched the rise in the data was human carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.",
        "It just matched so much better than anything else.",
        "I was just stunned.",
        "You know, you wrote in your book, even, page 75: The evidence shows that global warming is real, and the recent analysis of our team indicates that most of it is due to humans.",
        "(Technical difficulties)... And then we had these new results.",
        "I was much more cautious in the version of the book that was sent around for pre-review, and then we managed to get the new results in the new book.",
        "You know, you've been criticized on both sides of the aisle, as they say now.",
        "I think some scientists are saying: Why did you publish - why didn't you publish it in legitimate, peer-reviewed journals first?",
        "Oh, we're following the - I mean, we're following the tradition of science, which is that you distribute this widely to your peers before you publish it.",
        "Jim Hansen does the same thing.",
        "He puts his papers online.",
        "This is a tradition in the field.",
        "Peer review means you present results in a public forum, you distribute pre-prints.",
        "Most of my important papers were widely distributed to other scientists far before they appeared.",
        "It's the best kind of peer review.",
        "And you challenge anyone to come up with a better explanation.",
        "I do, and we have this record going back to 1753.",
        "That's pre-Revolutionary War.",
        "Some of the early measurements in the United States were taken by Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson.",
        "So we have this excellent record now.",
        "We use essentially all the data, nobody had previously used more than about 20 percent of the temperature stations.",
        "So we have this excellent record.",
        "And given that excellent record, now you say, where does it come from?"

        "A real surprise to me was that when we compare to this to the sun-spot record, which shows the solar variability, there's no match whatsoever.",
        "The variability of the sun did not contribute.",
        "I think that was the primary alternative explanation, and now with this really long record, thanks again to Robert Rohde, we really can eliminate that.",
        "And there's not much left.",
        "We see the volcanoes very clearly.",
        "We see the volcanic eruptions, but their effect is always short-lived, about three or four years.",
        "Well, that's true.",
        "I believe that many people who are deeply concerned about global warming feel that the public needs something more dramatic.",
        "And so take example the - NOAA recently announced that the last 12 months were the warmest on record in the United States.",
        "When I heard that, I looked it up, and sure enough they're right.",
        "We see that in our own record.",
        "But remarkably, the world had cooled somewhat in that period.",
        "It was just the United States, which is two percent of the globe.",
        "I feel that one has to be a little bit more candid with the public, and to ascribe the warming of the United States not as a heat wave but as global warming, when the globe is cooling, is not being completely up front.",
        "Well, if the globe is...",
        "The public is smart.",
        "They don't like to be fooled.",
        "If the globe is cooling, then what is global warming, then?",
        "Oh, I just mean the globe has been cooling for the last three or four years.",
        "I see.",
        "As we said, a heat wave in the U.S., but it wasn't a world event that set that heat wave."

        "One is there's an enormous amount that can be done with energy efficiency and conservation: better automobiles, better insulation in homes.",
        "The second thing that we need to do, and this is equally important, is to recognize that natural gas emits one-third the carbon dioxide of coal.",

        "By the end of this year, China will be emitting twice the carbon dioxide as the U.S., and they're growing rapidly whereas our carbon dioxide emissions have been going down over the last few years.",
        "So unless we can devise an approach where China can reduce its emissions, it won't do any good.",
        "Fortunately, there is that approach because China is building essentially one new coal gigawatt every week.",
        "That's a huge growth, and it's responsible for their increase in emissions, but they have good natural gas resources.",
        "We have to develop and devise methods for clean fracking.",
        "Clean fracking is the key.",
        "They have enormous reserves over there.",
        "If they can switch from coal to natural gas, that'll have as big an effect as worldwide energy conservation and energy efficiency.",
        "Do you think that your change of position might effect any other changes of positions among people possibly in Congress, some people who believe that global warming is the greatest hoax perpetuated on the human race?",
        "Well, I have great sympathy for such people because many of them, and I've talked to them in Congress, they knew there are legitimate concerns.",
        "They knew the data, not all the data had been used, it had been selected.",
        "They knew there had been adjustments to the data.",

        "And not only that, it's legitimate, and it's even tax-free because you don't pay taxes on money you save.",
        "So that, and unfortunately too many people in the community, too many of my friends who are worried about global warming, have already taken a position on fracking.",
        "The fact is that natural gas can be made clean.",
        "It's not hard.",
        "It's much easier to do clean fracking than it is, for example, to make cheap solar.",
        "So I'm hoping that the environmentalists who have started to oppose fracking, I think prematurely, can be won over and recognize that this has to be part of a worldwide energy policy.",
        "Natural gas also helps the Chinese because their citizens are being choked by the soot and other emissions of their coal plants.",
        "So expediting a shift, this should be U.S.",
