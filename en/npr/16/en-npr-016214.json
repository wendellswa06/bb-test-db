        "People are out doing their business, shopping.",
        "We went out, no roadblocks, no trouble at all.",
        "I can't say the same for the last few days.",
        "Yesterday was manageable.",
        "There were a few roadblocks, car fires, things like that, but it felt like the fire was dying down, so to speak.",
        "The last few days before that, things were very tense.",
        "Just coming in from the airport, we hit about a dozen roadblocks, burning tires, dumpsters, trash, with mobs of people that would come around the car.",
        "Our cameraman was sitting in the front with the window rolled down, and a man approached him with a huge stone - a stone he had to hold with both hands and was going to hit him with it, and our driver had to talk to out of it.",
        "So it was very tense earlier, and I imagine it was like that in other parts of the country as well.",
        "High food prices have become a global issue, but it seems worse in Haiti.",
        "Why is that?",
        "Because it's such a poor country.",
        "As you mentioned in your intro, it's the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere.",
        "80 percent of the population lives on less than two dollars a day.",
        "So when you have food prices that increase 50 percent in one year, that's going to be felt a lot more by people who are already really poor.",

        "It's not that the food isn't here, it's that people can't afford it.",
        "Here, it's not that they're broke - they can't eat because they have no reserves to go to.",
        "They have no discretionary income, so this is really a matter of survival for them.",
        "What is the government proposing to fix the problem?",
        "Well, the thing is, is that the people were pretty clear about what they wanted to hear from the government.",

        "Some people were calling for Preval's resignation.",
        "Other people wanted to have the Prime Minister.",
        "And people wanted to see, most importantly, an immediate reduction on food prices - something that, maybe for the next three months, prices would be cut.",
        "I mean, they wanted to see a difference right away, and they got neither.",
        "The president made a speech asking for calm.",
        "He obviously didn't step down.",
        "He didn't make any big changes in the government.",
        "He offered food subsidies for farmers, which, you know, I guess will help in the future, but it's not an immediate affect, especially, it's not going to be felt immediately by the people in the street.",
        "And so, we'll see what happens with that because I think people are hopeful that more change is coming.",

        "They are, yeah.",
        "There are reports that the Coast Guard is looking for people and thinking that perhaps they'll have more interdictions because of what's happening here.",
        "But you have to remember that what's happened in the last week has been people expressing their anger over an existing situation.",
        "The situation hasn't gotten worse for them.",
        "They just got fed up enough from it that they decided to take to the streets.",
        "So, so far the coast guard hasn't seen any increase in people that are leaving Haiti.",
        "They're just being cautious about it."

        "He's always talking about Canadian football.",
        "And he mentioned to Belichick that he had seen Flutie when he was in Canada do a dropkick.",
        "And so Belichick called Flutie into his office to find if that's true and Flutie told him he could make it if the opportunity arose.",
        "I mean, you know, Flutie said he had about 80 percent confidence in himself in it, which for an extra point you should have about 99.9.",
        "So clearly they were having some fun there.",
        "But it was Chris Berman's idea in the first place, who told Belichick, who told Flutie and here we are talking about it the next day.",
        "Yeah.",
        "For those of us who weren't around in 1940 to see the last dropkick, tell us, what is it exactly?",
        "And, you know, I had to go on the NFL rule book to see how they--I mean, you know what it is--but how they describe it.",
        "And so the NFL describes it as Rule 3, Section 8, it's a kick by a kicker who drops the ball and kicks it as, or immediately after, it touches the ground.",
        "So basically, you bounce the ball off the ground to yourself and kick it.",
        "And the reason it's was so popular, you know, back before 1941, the ball--the football was more rounded back then and then they changed the shape of the ball.",
        "Most dramatically the shape of the ball changed in 1934 so we started seeing fewer and fewer obviously because of the ball is not bouncing the right way.",
        "But it was real common when football first began when the ball was round."

        "Yeah.",
