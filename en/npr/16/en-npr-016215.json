        "Yes, and the Patriots have--you know, they're 10 and 6 this season.",

        "I mean, they didn't win yesterday but that wasn't as bad as it sounds, that wasn't their concern.",
        "They've won, you know, three of their passport games convincingly and they head into the playoffs now with some momentum.",
        "They have a home game against the Jaguars, but Jacksonville's an inexperienced playoff team, a lot of young guys.",
        "But New England should be able to win that.",
        "And then I think they'd be matched up with Indianapolis.",
        "It's a very good chance in the second round.",
        "So we'll see if Manning can get over that hump right away.",
        "It's a nice way to break into the playoffs for them.",
        "But if they were to play the Colts, they would play in Indianapolis under the dome and not in the snow and the wind that the Patriot--that the Colts have had to experience playing in New England when New England got the better record and the home field advantage.",
        "Yeah, and that's the difference.",
        "And everyone said, `Well, give the Colts, you know, a chance to play in their stadium.",
        "Well, here it is.",
        "Here's their chance.",
        "Here's their opportunity.",
        "I think they--I mean, they already beat New England outdoors earlier in the year but that was a whole different Patriots team now.",
        "Now so we'll see if Tedy Bruschi is healthy, the linebacker for the Patriots, that defense is going to be as good as it was a year ago or close to as good as it was a year ago and Indy will have a great challenge.",
        "It'll be--it's just great for football to see that.",
        "It's everything you want in a football game.",
        "And, of course, if they play indoors in the dome, that will give Flutie no problems with the wind if he tries another dropkick.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I'd love to see Bill Belichick try a dropkick in the playoffs.",
        "That'd go over real well, especially if--imagine if Flutie shanked it because they said he was shanking a lot of them in practice leading up to the game.",
        "Andy Benoit, thanks very much for being with us today.",
        "Thank you for having me.",

        "The Prime Minister, his lifeline is very short at this point.",
        "So maybe if he's replaced, it will buy the government some time to say to people look, we're doing things, and we're making moves and changes so that people will settle down a bit.",
        "But if they get the sense that nothing is being done and their lives have not changed, they're going to be back to square one, and you get the sense that this is a very fragile calm.",
        "Is there a sense there that the problem from the Haitians who you've spoken to, is this across the board, or is it just the poorest people in Haiti, and that there are some people there that are having no trouble buying and acquiring food, or is it almost everyone?",
        "Well, here's the thing.",
        "The statistic is that 80 percent of the population lives in poverty and that more than half of the population lives in abject poverty, which means they're living on less than one dollar a day.",

        "So you cannot exaggerate how bad things are for the people here.",
        "But once that genuine, kind of, grassroots movement started and people got to the streets and started asking for political change, then you have a lot of people with other motivations coming on board.",

        "Others protest a form of gentrification, which steals precious parking places in neighborhoods where cars matter most.",
