        "But they're not always an easy sell.",
        "Some communities resist them based on cost or loss of parking spots, and maybe the very people who stand to benefit from them, that's to say cyclists themselves, are their own worst enemies in the debate.",
        "That's what an article in Bicycling magazine proposes, anyway, that in public meetings around the country the issue of bicyclists behaving badly, ignoring signs and signals, sideswiping pedestrians, comes up.",

        "There was a small soft shoulder, and I was going from side to side depending on what traffic was doing.",
        "And you're supposed to ride with the traffic on a two-lane road, and you're supposed to ride with the traffic anyway, and did the officer buy your explanation?",

        "Thanks very much, Bob.",

        "Well, it sort of does in one regard, in that there's a certain wiggle room on the part of every person out there on the road.",

        "And this is, in fact, how, you know, engineers actually set the speed limit.",
        "They don't sort of pick a speed limit and then make everyone drive it.",
        "They see which speed everyone wants to go at, and then they set the speed limit.",

        "Bill Strickland, as I understand it, if, for example, he's writing(ph) about a two-lane blacktop, bicycles are entitled to their lane.",
        "Yeah, in a lot of states you can actually ride two up, you know, side by side.",
        "Some states, you can't.",
        "But even then you're entitled - you know, most of the laws say that if you're impeding traffic, the flow of traffic, you have to move as far to the right as practicable.",
        "That's not possible.",
        "Not as far as possible - as practicable.",
        "Which means if there's a lot of glass in the shoulder, or if you feel it's unsafe, you know, you can stay out there in the middle of the lane, and you're a vehicle."

        "None of the times have I ever received a ticket from the officer, and I do have to say I kind of expect that now, that I will just get kind of a verbal warning.",
        "But if I were actually given, you know, a significant fine for breaking a bike law, I'm pretty sure I would never do it again.",
        "But I kind of expect that leniency from the officers.",
        "And so I do agree that I am my own worst enemy with bike riding, but at the same time, obeying the laws, it's when I ride, obeying the laws completely have been the times where I've almost been - almost been hit by a car.",
        "And so it's kind of a situation where I'll obey the laws, I'll almost get hit by a car, whereas if I don't obey the laws and I think that I have complete control, it seems that I'm more safer on the road.",
        "We've got an email along that same line from Smokey(ph) in Fairfax, California: As a lifelong cyclist, I've come to understand that following traffic laws as they current stand is a good way to die.",
        "They are written for cars, don't account for the differences in the vehicles.",
        "Additionally, many people in cars don't believe bikes belong on the road and act aggressively toward them.",
        "Not to say we shouldn't be careful and courteous, but following rules meant for cars while on a bike is not always possible nor practicable.",
        "And Tom Vanderbilt, I think you're saying that may be right.",
        "Well, and I think there's a larger issue here beyond the law, even which gets into psychological theory, something called social categorization.",
        "When you have sort of a dominant in-group, which would be in this country drivers, they tend to generalize the negative behavior - over-generalize the negative behavior of the out-group, which would be cyclists.",
        "At the same time, they under-generalize the behavior of their own group.",
        "So I think we see that reflected again and again.",

        "But I waited, and I let her go by.",
        "And I think if car drivers obey the laws and bicycles obey the rules of the road too, and I know there's some flexibility there, that I don't think we need bike lanes because I find bike lanes sometimes with their 10-mile-per-hour speed limits are too slow, and so I prefer the street.",
        "And - but that can also, if there is a bike lane, you still ride in the street?",
        "Well, if I'm in - I ride from 15 to 23 miles an hour, and the bike lane has – say, in Minneapolis, some of the bike lanes like have a 10 mile-per-hour speed limit, when I visit there.",
        "That's too slow.",
        "I don't want to disobey that law.",
        "So I'd rather do my 20 out in the street, where I'm more moving with traffic than be on the bike lane.",

        "There's kind of a - there's a slight move afoot to make it legal for bicycles to yield at stop signs but otherwise do a rolling stop, because, you know, once a cyclist has to come to a complete stop and put a foot down, and say they're in a group of 10, that's just going to drive the person behind them crazy if that's a person in a car.",

        "Both have a right to the road and to the bike path, but I have observed the more fancy geared bike riders tend to ride on the road in traffic, even when a perfectly good, million-dollar asphalt bike path runs parallel.",
        "What conclusions, if any, can we draw from this?",
        "And, well, we just heard one explanation, it's a simple matter of speed.",

        "I mean, I sometimes go on these road cycling expeditions, like I'm sure Bill does, and using something like the multi-user greenway in New York City, you know, my speed, desired speed is a little bit different than the person on the commuter bike, the person with their kid on the back of a tandem bike, and, you know, we sort of all have to make it work and get along.",
        "So even within that out group, there are - but I think, again, it gets back to that social categorization.",
        "We're always looking to tar cyclists with a certain kind of brush, and they're either elitists riding these expensive bikes, they're called elitists by the people driving, you know, $50,000 cars.",
        "Or they're sort of crazed anarchist bike messengers who are - who can't afford a car.",
