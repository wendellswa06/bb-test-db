        "And there are bike riders who also use the path as kind of like a sidewalk, and they just blow past me.",
        "I mean, they are flying.",
        "Every once in a while, there's a polite bike rider who, you know, beats the bell or, you know, says, on your right.",
        "And for that person, I'm very grateful, but most of them just fly on past, and it's startling to me and probably, you know, a safety-risk.",
        "So far, we haven't collided, but it won't be pretty if it happens.",
        "Bill Strickland, that's a common problem on those multi-use paths in parks like she's describing, where you're supposed to - at least in my state, there's a sign that says you have to give a warning before you overtake anybody.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The paths, particularly, you know, have - you'll have someone out, stroller with their baby and a Rollerblader and a kid on training wheels, and then the people in spandex trying to get their training.",
        "Those are - I think paths often can be more hazardous than city streets.",
        "I agree.",
        "Diane, it's also scary when suddenly you - if you're visually impaired - just hear the sound of somebody slamming by you.",
        "Oh, yes, very scary.",
        "It's like whoosh, and you have no idea what's coming by you.",
        "Well, good luck, continued good luck on the multi-use path.",
        "Well, thanks so much.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Neal, if I can just interject for a second, I think one issue here that we haven't talked about, too, is that, you know, in many cities, pedestrians and cyclists are left sort of squabbling over these, you know, minor scraps of space that have been allocated to them while, you know, motorists enjoy these huge expanses."

        "And, you know, at the end of the day, I just wonder, you know, whether we shouldn't have some larger segregation where - which is actually happening in a place like Prospect Park in Brooklyn where we're not going to have a lane dedicated expressly for cyclists, a lane for joggers and people walking.",
        "And the city of Philadelphia just announced they were going to have a walking lane for distracted pedestrians, and that was an April Fools' joke.",
        "But you do wonder if we're sort of hitting that point, eventually.",
        "Well, Bill Strickland, that was in part what your piece, the piece you edited in Bicycling magazine, was about.",
        "But it seems that if there's a fury over a bike lane in Brooklyn, having to come up with different paths, which are expensive, for walkers and cyclists - it's going to drive people crazy.",
        "Maybe.",
        "You know, maybe the craziness is already over.",
        "There - time after time, what we're seeing now is that there's this initial resistance and this outcry, this furor to try to stop the bike lanes.",
        "And then they get put in, and what happens is the streets just become more inhabitable.",
        "It becomes more like - even for the people who live there, it becomes more of an extension of their front yard than the sort of raging torrent of danger right off their porch.",
        "And the community, overall, improves.",
        "It's - you know, it's not just about giving bikes a place to go.",
        "It's about making the street inhabitable and calming traffic - pedestrian, bike and car - and everything improves.",
        "And we're seeing this time after time after time.",
        "And so, you know, what we're trying to say is bike lanes are coming to cities and to other areas, so, as cyclists, let's do what we can to speed this along.",
        "We're talking with Bill Strickland, editor-at-large of Bicycling magazine, and Tom Vanderbilt, author of \"\"Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do (and What It Says About Us).\"\" You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And, Tom, some of the pushback against the bike path is not necessarily from drivers, but from parkers.",
        "You've stolen my parking places.",
        "I drive around two hours a day trying to find a place to park, and now they're being taken away.",
        "There is also some resistance, at least in some places, from communities who say, these bike paths aren't for us.",
        "We live here.",
        "We drive cars.",
        "These are for outsiders who go through our neighborhoods.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, you sort of mess with urban parking at your own political peril, and New York City in the 1950s, it was incredibly - incredible controversial period.",
        "What happened is they actually introduced on-street parking meters.",
        "This was previously considered, you know, anathema.",
        "This would never happen.",
        "That it takes away people's rights.",
        "And now it's a norm.",
        "So I think the historical tide is sort of there where we're sort of realizing that cities, you know, aren't going to be able to accommodate everyone who wants to own a car, and that maybe instead of having all that parking - cars do spend more than 90 percent of their lives simply parked - it would be better to have solutions like shared cars that you can just grab on a street corner like they're trying in Hoboken, New Jersey, and, you know, that there might be better use of that valuable urban street space, which is, you know, New York City parking spaces are now valued at more than the average U.S.",
