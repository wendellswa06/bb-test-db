        "Yes, I wanted them to win, you know, for Pat, but they did - like Holly said last night, they gave 100 percent, you know.",
        "And last night, you could tell it wasn't about Brittney Griner.",
        "It was the gals, you know.",
        "They just never gave up, and it's heartbreaking to watch.",
