        "That's Interior Secretary Sally Jewell.",
        "But if the president wants the protected Alaskan wilderness, or ANWR, to be part of his legacy, he'll need congressional approval.",
        "And that will be very difficult, says Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski.",

        "I can almost guarantee that this Congress will not approve placing ANWR into wilderness status.",
        "Murkowski was also unhappy about the administration's announcement yesterday to ban offshore drilling in large areas of the Arctic.",
        "But the Interior Department, in what it called a balanced approach, also decided to open offshore drilling along the Atlantic Coast from Virginia to Georgia, giving the oil and gas industry a victory.",
        "That seemingly contradictory package of drilling regulations had environmentalists cheering and jeering at the same time.",

        "Previous studies have used pedometers to estimate how many steps dog walkers get from their daily routine.",
        "But Daniel Mills, a researcher at the University of Lincoln in the U.K., decided to do something more to measure the intensity of exercise.",
        "What we did is we actually used a much more sophisticated activity monitor in order to assess the effects.",
        "Mills and a group of colleagues recruited volunteers - some who had dogs, some who did not.",
        "All of them were in their 60s and older, and they agreed to wear an activPAL monitor for three weeks.",
        "The device measures speed, distance and other factors that help scientists calculate the intensity of exercise.",

        "By moderate, he means brisk.",
        "The dog owners were at times walking at a pace of 3 miles per hour, getting their heart rates up.",
