        "Over the course of the last three weeks, we've had a series of promises that the laws would be lifted.",
        "The first one suggested - this is weeks ago - that it would take 48 hours out and now the latest timeframe given by the president has been this week or perhaps next week.",
        "And it's still a little unclear.",
        "So I think it's kind of gone beyond that now.",

        "It's very significant because it's the first large urban area in Syria that's really been taken in this kind of massive way by protests.",
        "And there were reports yesterday of 20,000 people in the city, and overnight and this morning they decided to stage a sit-in, which we hear was broken up by security services with live ammunition and tear gas.",
        "Again, really significant because it's an urban area and it's also something of a microcosm to Syria.",
        "It has all the different sects and ethnic groups in Homs.",
        "And the Syrian government, how is it characterizing these demonstrations?",

        "He says they had more than 50 years of World Bank experience between them.",

        "Many of the poor countries it helped for decades are now middle-class and have access to different streams of funding.",
        "The question was for the bank was: Does it continue on its current path and become less and less relevant to its client countries, or does it launch some kind of change to make sure it continues to be relevant?",
        "Morris says Kim likely laid out his plans while campaigning for his job, and he does have the endorsement of the board of governors and the 188 member countries.",
