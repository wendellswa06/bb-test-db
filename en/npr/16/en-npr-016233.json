        "Nobody knows what happened, because they tried to impose their views and you should believe that you live in the paradise, because everything was manipulated - the figures, the statistics, everything.",
        "And they used to tell us you are in the best country.",
        "It's the country of freedom; it's the country of economical miracle.",
        "And people, they cannot believe that because they live every day in a very difficult reality.",
        "So, when you compare the figures and the statistics with what you live, you feel as if you are in a very strange nightmare.",
        "So, that was our situation before the departure of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.",
        "We had the Al Gore film and all the publicity that surrounded it.",
        "There was a spike in energy prices, and that got everyone - and the Arctic, there was a lot of news out of the Arctic, some of which I - I wrote a lot about, too, that, you know, the sea ice had pulled back a record amount.",
        "And now though, again, you look at the window and Europe and North America, it's - we're having an unusually cold winter - not record breaking, not a sign we're going into an Ice Age, as Pravda recently (Laughing) said we might be.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But you know, it's the kind of thing that makes us all...",
        "Well, it's not just Pravda.",

        "That's right.",
        "You'll see on that program also.",
        "Yeah, in fact, I alluded to that recently when the climate science blog \"\"Real Climate\"\" complained about Dobb's treatment of the issue.",
        "So it's - but again, for most people - and you know, really in the end, as I've been writing a lot well as, you know, this is still - the impacts are still some day and somewhere, not here and now.",
        "They're more likely in sub-Saharan Africa and places like Bangladesh to have big, harmful impacts in the short run than they are here.",
        "And as soon as you get to the near term, the uncertainties get larger.",
        "We don't know how fast sea levels are going to rise between now - or how far - between now and 2100.",
        "We do know - there's lots of work showing, you know, warming world, less ice, less ice, higher seas, but that's again, kind of a disposable thought.",
        "And the sociologists - I wish I could've had a longer story in the paper today about this - there's a lot of work saying, you know, there is an argument for urgency, but it's based on starting to reduce these emissions, which are cumulative, and if you don't start promptly - it's like if you leave all your homework till last day before the test, you're in deep doo-doo."

        "And so, are people saying, what the heck, I'm in deep doo-doo any how, why should I worry about it?",
        "Well, you know, again - and you've looked at this issue for a long time to, but the longer I look at it, the scariest science by far is not the glaciology or what's happening with Antarctica or how the ocean is responding it.",
        "It's the sociology.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's how people deal - human nature and looming risks that are cumulative are not a good mix.",
        "I recently wrote on \"\"Dot Earth\"\" somewhere that essentially, a lot of people have the perception - well, if we slow emissions, then we'll be fine.",
        "But it's kind of like thinking if you slow your credit card spending, that makes the debt go away.",
        "It just doesn't work that way.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "You wrote about the American Meteorological Society giving it's top honor to James Hansen, the famous climate scientist.",
        "It's interesting there, because there's seems to be a little friction between weather scientists and climate scientists about who should be chiming in when it comes to global warming, doesn't it?",
        "Yeah, well, there is.",
        "I'm not sure I've seen studies, but I sure have a strong perception that the typical meteorologist, focused on week-to-week forecasting, has a very low confidence in the long - the forecasts for greenhouse gas driven warming and everything that would come with it in the future.",
        "They use models differently.",
        "You know, climatologists have been so imbedded in their simulated - in their simulations, I think.",
        "And they're very complicated, this stuff is very hard, so, you know, there's some sense that, well, we know.",
        "(Laughing) We understand; we just can't quite translate it for you folks out there.",
        "And they really don't think the meteorologists have gotten it.",
        "Obviously, they're - that's not a uniform pattern.",
        "But the other culture of scientists, I think that - there has been some polling that shows there's geologists, who deal with very long time scales, who have seen the earth, you know, through their work, when it had 10 times as much CO2 in the atmosphere and temperatures and seas hundreds of feet - seas hundreds of feet different in height and temperatures very different, they also have low confidence in this, which doesn't help the public because the public sits out there going, well, you know, I hear all this yelling and whether it's on Loud Dobbs or on blogs or it - a little uncertainty on an issue like this goes a long way toward pushing it - for most of us, toward a back burner.",
        "Well, it is amazing to me how politically polarized this is.",
        "Oh, yeah.",

        "The Pew Research Center last year at this time, did a pretty in-depth look at what Republicans and Democrats think, and they found - and this is kind of startling, initially at least - if you're a Republican with a college degree, you're more likely to be skeptical of the Al Gore view - or not just Al Gore, but the view that global warming by human causes a danger, than if you're a Republican without a college degree.",
        "Now, if you're a Democrat with a college degree, you're substantially more likely to be convinced that global warming is dangerous (Laughing) than a Democrat without a college degree.",
        "So, it's kind of like the more - once you're in a silo, intellectually, you kind of go out into the universe and choose information that helps you reinforce your silo.",
        "That's one interpretation.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I - when people ask me, how do you explain this?",
        "The only thing I can point to is going back to Ronald Reagan when he took the - ripped the solar panels off the White House.",
        "And that create - I don't remember or recall before then that the climate had been, well certainly not discussed a whole lot but that energy conservation - whatever - had become a political football.",

        "(Laughing) Yeah, that's true.",
        "So, it's like we all lost interest.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's true.",

        "Oh, I do think so.",
        "And the reason is this isn't just about climate.",
        "There are so many reasons that an energy quest in this country, from your light bulb in your house to the laboratories - the federal labs - and corporate boardrooms and the White House, is something that will have multiple benefits.",
        "You know, even if you're a climate doubter, there's many reasons to see those benefits.",
        "On Dot Earth, I hear from skeptics and, you know, people who are very worried about global warming all the time.",
        "And there are a number of climate skeptics who are totally focused on energy efficiency and advancing technology.",
        "So, there's a political and obviously just a basic economic and ethical imperative to come up with cleaner, non-polluting energy choices in a growing world."

        "And I just - I don't know when people are going to realize that we're going to have to see about preserving our planet in order to preserve our way of life, but it seems like they keep putting the cart before the horse and money seems to speak, even though they don't realize that by putting in energy-saving standards and standards that would help the CO2 emissions and carbon footprint, they could actually save money in the bargain as well, so…",
        "Yeah, it's a good point.",
        "And you know, I think when - I think part of the blip on the radar that disappeared was when the price of gasoline dropped from $4 to $2.",

        "And I blogged on that, and that relates even more to climate, because as we've been saying, you know, energy costs are right in our face.",
        "Climate costs remain sort of a moral sense of what do we owe our children and grandchildren?",
        "Right.",

        "So they say, even for my children's sake, why shouldn't I just get richer, have more money to give to them and spend on their college education and worry less about this looming risk that may or may not be catastrophic?",
        "So it's - again, if it isn't cast - one thing I tried to get at on the blog off and on and in the paper, too, is that if the argument for action on climate is built round a false urgency - that this is happening right now, look out your window, that's why you need to act - that kind of argument is always doomed to fail because nature's complexity and vagaries guarantee it'll be cool and warm spells on the way to a warming world.",
        "And of course, there'll be higher and lower energy costs, too."
