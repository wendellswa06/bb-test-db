        "Hmm.",
        "That's pretty good, actually.",
        "But - no, I wish I knew more about the subject, but - to debate it with people - but the one thing I think that stands out is that the entity that has bought into this as simply a fact is the United States military, and I know they've done millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars of research on what will be geopolitical changes forced by climate change.",
        "And if there's any group that normally seems to be respected by more conservative people, it's the military, and it seems like they've already placed their bet that it's inevitable.",
        "Absolutely true.",
        "I actually have written about this a little bit on - both on the blog - I think just on the blog so far, but yeah, the Defense Department is a good place to watch for things to be concerned about.",
        "They're very concerned - mainly about energy and having secure supplies for fighting wars.",
        "They also increasingly have made doctrine to include - this just happened in the last month or two - the Army came out with a new doctrine that says, fostering stability in troubled places is as important as being prepared to fight wars in troubled places.",
        "So, there's - that's a sense of what can you do to limit turmoil from famine or from water - inadequate water supplies as a way to prevent conflict is becoming part of our definition of how we defend the nation.",
        "That's an interesting twist right there, too.",
        "And they're also - they and the CIA have recently come out with security studies related to how climate change in different places could amplify conflicts that matter to the United States.",
        "So, they're definitely in the loop."

        "The Senate, particularly on - not just on legislation, but on a treaty - remember, the Senate has to give two-thirds support to anything that we're - any treaty we're going to sign, and that really binds President Obama's hands to some extent, in terms of how he can approach this year, which comes up to Copenhagen in December - a big meeting trying to carve out a new climate treaty."
