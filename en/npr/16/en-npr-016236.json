        "Is the Arab Spring an Islamist spring or is it an Arab Spring or is it more likely some hybrid in-between?",

        "And this will be the sticking point, whether we stick with the Morsi government or whether we try to nudge it and become a little alarmed about what's happened there over the last day or two.",
        "E.J.?",
        "Yeah, I'd say this is a week of good news and bad news.",
        "The bad news is, obviously, Morsi asserting all these powers and what he did just has to be disturbing.",
        "Call me a liberal, but I just mistrust leaders who claim absolute power, even for what is supposedly a temporary period.",
        "And this is a really tricky issue for the Obama administration because that plays into the good news.",
        "Morsi has shown this week that he's someone who can work with us, who is willing to work with us at least on this cease-fire and he, effectively in working with us, he worked with Israel.",
        "You wonder if Morsi isn't in a peculiar way creating an Islamist version of President Mubarak, somebody who buys our cooperation by standing with us on immediate Middle East issues, but then proceeds to aggrandize his own power.",
        "But the other thing is, you wonder - and this could be optimistic, if having acted in this situation, the Obama administration might be drawn in more to a new American effort to have broader negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.",
        "That was my next question.",
        "That's obviously something, foreign policy-wise, during the election the Obama administration was criticized for, that when it came to this area of foreign policy, they hadn't gotten very far.",
        "Is this a reset?",
        "Well, this is an opportunity for a reset if they want to take it.",
        "I mean, these are not the optimal circumstances for it, but there are a couple of things that might be working in favor of the U.S.",
        "getting more involved.",
        "One is President Obama has been re-elected, so his hand is strengthened.",
        "And President Netanyahu knows he doesn't - he and Obama haven't gotten along, but he knows he's going to have to deal with President Obama for the next four years.",
