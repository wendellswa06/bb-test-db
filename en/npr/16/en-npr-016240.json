        "There's a projected budget deficit close to $25 billion, and one out of seven workers in the state is unemployed, the third highest rate in the country.",

        "Now, the California governor is unlike any other in this country for one simple reason: The state, on its own, is one of the 10 biggest economies in the world.",
        "So I asked Joel Kotkin - he's a California scholar and author of the book \"\"The Next Hundred Million\"\" - whether America's economy can bounce back without the Golden State driving it.",
        "I don't know if we could have a full recovery without California, but you could have a recovery in many parts of the country.",
        "I just did this piece for Newsweek and we identified cities that I think are going to come out of the recession.",
        "Some of them may already be out of the recession.",
        "And most of them were in Texas - about four of them were in Texas, some of them were in parts of the heartland, and also Salt Lake City.",
        "So, I mean, you could have a recovery that takes place elsewhere and California sort of brings up the rear.",
        "I don't see how California is going to lead the recovery, particularly given the change in Congress.",
        "California was very much counting on President Obama's green programs, subsidies for green industries, money going to major research universities, high-speed rail, all these kinds of things that many of the progressives, as they call themselves now in California, were desperate for.",
        "Well, I very much doubt that most of those programs will now be funded by the Republican Congress.",
        "So California is going to be sort of out of sync with the rest of the country for the next few years, and that's going to be a really major challenge.",
        "Joel Kotkin, in the past, pundits have written off the state, you know, during the recessions in the '70s.",
        "And then in the '90s, there was the decline of the defense industry.",
        "There was the tech bubble.",
        "And now, there's been housing bubble.",
        "But each time, the state seems to have come back even stronger.",
        "Is it just a matter of time?",
        "Well, first of all, I don't think that's true.",
        "I think California probably hit its peak in the mid-'80s.",
        "And as we've recovered from the various bubbles, we've recovered somewhat weaker.",
        "In other words, our income growth, our job growth has generally not really been above, and in many cases, been below the national average.",
        "So we've come back from being written off to the point of oblivion, but we really haven't come back to what we were in the 1980s.",
        "Unfortunately, I'm old enough to remember what California was like in the 1980s where everything was possible, in which immigrants were coming and getting good jobs, and moving up and starting their own companies, en masse.",
        "California still has enormous assets.",
        "And I still think it's the best piece of property in the United States in terms of climate, fertility, the mix of people.",
        "So I'm a great believer in California, but I think that we cannot take for granted that California will continue to be a leader in the next 10 to 15 years.",
        "That's going to have to be earned.",
        "And right now, we're doing nothing to earn it.",
        "And so can we, in 20 or 30 years from now, look ahead and say, well, this is the end of the California era and the beginning of the Texas era?",
        "That is entirely possible if Californians don't wake up and understand that the most important thing we need to do is create jobs, build up our economy so that we can invest in our infrastructure and move forward."

        "What that means is that the legislature is going to have to play a role to which they have not become accustomed, and that is living within their income.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I appreciate it.",
        "They have, for a decade now, been spending money that they did not have.",
        "And the result has been, from the standpoint of the fiscal health of the state, not just a slippery slope, but one that has put California in a very dangerous position.",
        "Is it a possibility that the national recovery might happen more quickly than California's recovery, that California might actually be left behind?",
        "It is not only a possibility, but a probability unless the new governor and the legislature have to do - or do do - what they are responsibly required to do, and that is to cut spending and to make the changes in the California business climate that will allow California to once again compete for jobs."
