        "And, David, it is a kind of complicated dance that some Democrats are engaging with in the president as we head towards Tuesday.",
        "Yeah.",
        "One of the crucial issues that I'll be looking for Tuesday is the health care vote.",
        "If you look at the polls of the Democrats who are allowed to vote against the health care bill, the ones who voted against are doing pretty well, about two-thirds of them are ahead in the polls.",
        "The ones who voted for the bill are just getting destroyed.",
        "And so that's not going to be the major issue of the election.",
        "But it seems to be a significant issue.",
        "Some are sort of backing away from that.",
        "There's a guy named Earl Pomeroy who's a member from North Dakota who's run an ad which has been seen around the country where he says, I'm not Nancy Pelosi, I'm not Barack Obama.",

        "I'd like to take the discussion to Florida and look at the case of another Democrat who finds himself in a tough spot today: Florida Senate candidate Kendrick Meek.",
        "He's denying reports that former President Bill Clinton had asked him to drop out of the race.",
        "Meek is not doing very well in the polls.",
        "The fear is that among Democrats is that he and the independent candidate Charlie Crist will somehow split the Democratic vote.",
        "And this morning, Meek spoke about his conversations with the former president.",
        "Here he is on CBS.",
        "(Soundbite of CBS broadcast):",
        "We talked about it.",
        "I told him that I wasn't interested.",
        "He didn't push me to do it.",
        "He said, listen, whatever decision you make is a decision that you feel that's a right decision.",
        "And I made that decision.",
        "It was that I'm staying in the race.",
        "That was Senate candidate Kendrick Meek.",
        "And we should note that President Clinton released a statement, former President Clinton, saying that they did indeed talk, but that he did not ask Kendrick Meek to drop out.",
        "David, I want to begin with you.",
        "The White House has been making this full-court press to turn out black voters in large numbers, what's the impact of this beyond Florida?"

        "Well, it is kind of demoralizing when you're in basically your final weekend of the campaign and the debate is over whether you're going to surrender before the vote.",
        "That's just a mess.",
        "I'm not sure it'll have huge spillover effects.",
        "I mean the evidence suggests they've done - in the last couple weeks, if you look at what's happened in the polls, there has been some greater energy on the Democratic side.",
        "And if you look at the polls, I think what it's done is it's neutralized the Republican advantage.",
        "So we've basically seen the polls stall for the last two weeks, but not totally turn around.",
        "I'm not sure this event - it certainly won't help - I'm not sure it'll hurt tremendously.",
        "And what does it say, E.J., about the complicated relationship between the current president, his party and the former president?",
        "Well, there is that.",
        "But I think a lot of Democrats would love to have Kendrick Meek drop out because Charlie Crist has closed the gap by taking votes away from Meek.",
        "He had been running way behind Marco Rubio.",
        "Now he seems to be within seven points and Democrats would love Crist to beat Rubio.",
        "However, Kendrick Meek's been a very loyal Democrat.",
        "State Democrats may want him to stay on the ballot because they want African-American votes to help elect Alex Sink, their candidate for governor, who's in a very, very tight race.",
        "So it's a - there were almost contradictory interests involved in this race.",
        "But I think that secretly a lot of Democrats would like to publicly support Meek and pray that Charlie Crist wins.",
        "One last hurrah before Tuesday, so we can talk about the broad contours of this campaign season, and E.J., what are your thoughts as you think about the narrative that's been established?",
        "Big lessons learned in 2010?",
        "Well, you know, I've been - I've never felt so confused about a mood in a midterm election.",
        "And, you know, in '98, in '02, '06, I had a really clear sense of where those races were going.",
        "This is very odd.",
        "First of all, I think there's been a lot of complicated and bad polling.",
        "And there is also this great contradiction in a lot of the polls between registered voters who seem to tilt Democratic and then there are likely voter models that tilt Republican.",
        "For who will show up.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And then some of that comes from real Republican enthusiasm.",
        "But then you have all these predictions of a big Republican night, yet the country itself clearly has not been persuaded to like the Republican Party.",
        "I think in the end there's not going to be an ideological verdict, except in a small number of conservative districts where Republicans kind of went off the reservation because they didn't like President Bush and are now coming back.",
        "And so some Democrats will get voted out in those districts on ideological grounds.",
        "Course."

        "You also had this vast movement of the Independents.",
        "And now the Democrats are losing - the Independent voters by 20 percentage points.",

        "But that's why I don't think this is an ideological election because when you look at moderate Independent suburban voters, this morning I was in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, they're much more worried about getting the country in the right direction than they are about big government or small government or the issue that the Tea Partiers raised.",

        "Now, to put your story in the context of a timeline: as early as 2001, Barron's had published an article questioning Madoff's methods.",

        "She left, of course, in 2006.",
