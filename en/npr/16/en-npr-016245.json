        "I've been through a World War, a revolution in Iran.",
        "I've seen a lot of truth and a lot of fiction.",
        "And I think this is a time when the fiction is starting to disappear, and the truth is starting to appear.",

        "The age of Lincoln III.",

        "That does seem to have--need a certain drama and perhaps a certain poetry, don't you think?",
        "I think it does, and I think it has to capture not everything, but, in fact, it's got to capture the principal or defining feature of the period.",
        "When we use the phrase Cold War to describe, say, the four decades from the late '40s to the late '80s, it didn't necessarily account for everything going on on the planet, but it clearly captured what you might call the principal international dynamic.",
        "So I do think we need something that's pretty succinct.",
        "And, again, while it doesn't get everything--that's impossible--it's got to capture essentially the principal trend or the principal characteristic.",
        "And to me, the choice--I've suggested that there's potentially three.",
        "One is that this does turn out to be a remark--the period of international cooperation, and I've used words like `integration' or `a global concert,' going back to the early 19th century for a parallel.",
        "A second possibility is that we will look back on this period as an inter-Cold War era between a US-Soviet Cold War, on one hand, and potentially a US-Chinese Cold War on the other.",
        "And the third possibility I've already alluded to is even worse, which would be something of a new Dark Ages, in which the bad aspects of this world would gain the upper hand.",
        "And the challenge, obviously, for foreign policy makers is to see that aversion of the first..."

        "Right.",
        "...some type of an international collective effort that beats back these dark forces wins out.",
        "The--you also suggested in your article that there really are some names that we've seen here and there in print, terms like the age of sacred terror, the information age.",
        "What's wrong with those?",
        "Nothing, except I don't think they capture a big chunk of things.",
        "To call this the age of terrorism ignores so many other dynamics.",
        "For example, yes, there's terrorism; on the other hand, an even more fundamental reality may be that here we are in the year 2006 now, and it's quite remarkable that war between the United States and any one of the other major powers in the world--Europe, Japan, China, India, Russia--is remote for the foreseeable future.",
        "And that distinguishes this moment from virtually the entire preceding century.",
        "So to call this the age of terror, or whatever adjective you want to use, seems to me just to capture too negative a glimpse of this ear.",
        "You--the title of your book is \"\"The Opportunity: America's Moment to Alter History's Course.\"\" It suggests that we have an opportunity to change history.",
        "Do you think that we have an opportunity to change something else?",
        "What do you think that would be?",
        "Well, it's exactly that.",
        "I think we have a chance not to change human nature or the nature of how states interact, but I do think we have a rare moment to lock in this reality that I just alluded to, where the major states are not likely to go to war with one another.",
        "And what that would do is free up or liberate the United States and these other countries to tackle the challenges that confront us all.",
        "What I don't know is whether we will take advantage of the opportunity or, as I'm afraid, that--whether we will squander it, in which case historians will look back on us and will be rightfully critical.",
        "We have time for one more call.",

        "As victims of hurricanes Katrina and Rita piece together their finances, many of them may choose bankruptcy as an option to try and clear the decks and begin anew.",
        "The bankruptcy laws will change when the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 goes into effect on October 17th.",
        "With the new law comes tighter requirements, which include credit counseling and means testing.",

        "Well, sure.",
        "The new law is just about 10 days away now.",
        "It has been in the works for several years in Congress.",
        "And it represents a fundamental change in approach in particularly consumer bankruptcy, although there are some significant business bankruptcy changes as well.",
        "The law imposes some new requirements at the front end in terms of counseling as a precondition to being eligible to even seek relief under the Bankruptcy Code.",
        "And then, for those who have the ability to repay some of their debts to creditors over a period of time, the law provides a mechanism to more easily shift them into repayment plans where, over a period of roughly 60 months, they will repay a portion of their debts to their creditors.",
        "The bill does much more than that, but by and large it represents a statement by Congress that bankruptcy laws were previously too easy, too readily available, too forgiving in terms of the scope of relief provided.",
        "And in terms of those who are affected by hurricanes Katrina and Rita, what are the motions that were made yesterday and how are they tailored to help those people?"

        "Well, what was done yesterday was fairly significant.",
        "The Justice Department, within their discretion to enforce some of the key provisions of the law, has announced that they will relax certain of the enforcement guidelines for victims of the hurricanes in the Gulf Coast region.",
        "They've relaxed things like document requirements.",
        "The law provides, for example, that filers would have to provide copies of tax returns and pay stubs to verify their income and expenses, and the Justice Department has said that they will relax certain of those requirements if the person's otherwise eligible to file for bankruptcy.",
        "They also announced that they would consider income loss and expense increases that are directly related as effects of natural disaster when calculating the means test under the bill, which determines whether or not an individual is eligible to file for either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code.",
        "And they also allowed more discretion and flexibility in terms of where the case could actually be filed.",
        "After all, many of the Katrina-related victims are not located in Louisiana or Mississippi or Alabama anymore.",
        "They're in different parts of the country.",
        "To the extent that they are relocated and still want to file for bankruptcy in a local court where they are now, the Justice Department has announced that they will not raise or support an objection to what's called the venue, where the matter was filed in those cases.",
        "So they're going to allow people to get into the system and then perhaps transfer the venue at a later time that's more convenient to the rest of the parties.",
        "That's one of a number of things they have done.",
        "And then the previous day, they had announced a relaxation of the credit counseling requirement.",
        "Yeah, let me ask you about that.",
        "I mean, credit counseling is really an important part of people who are filing for bankruptcy, and this would allow people affected by the hurricanes to do--not to have to go through that.",
        "Why is that?",
        "Well, that is an acknowledgment by the Justice Department that, at least on a temporary basis, some of those providers of those services are simply going to be unavailable in the affected regions.",
        "Counseling can be done, under the provisions of the law, by Internet and by phone, but there also is contemplated the ability to get counseling face-to-face, in person, in terms of being an effective way to provide options to individuals who are facing financial problems.",
        "What about--there were some proposals to offer a year's grace to victims of the hurricanes and that didn't happen.",
        "Why not?",
        "Well, that's because the Justice Department doesn't have the authority to unilaterally change the effective date of the provision.",
        "That would require a statutory change which, of course, can only come from Congress.",
        "And there are bills pending in both and the House and Senate that would do just that, that would delay the October 17th date until some date in the future, six months, one year, even more than that.",
        "So that may still happen?",
        "That still is a possib...",
        "Which means that it's as hard as any problem that's considered to be an artificial intelligence.",
        "It's possible, but I wouldn't count on it.",
        "I would--for all parties involved in the system, whether they represent debtors or creditors or whether they're a potential debtor themselves, I think that everybody needs to count on October 17th as the starting date."
