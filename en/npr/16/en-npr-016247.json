        "I think our ultimate interest is to have Iran as a stabilizing regional power: a power that is not hostile to the United States, a power that can be a friendly partner, a power that can incidentally can also return to the status of a friend of Israel.",
        "I think that is the long-range interest.",
        "The more immediate interest is to avoid either an Iranian nuclear bomb, which contributes to instability in the region, or more generalized hostility between Iran and the United States.",
        "Where in the set of our interests in Iran do such things as its treatment of minorities, its treatment of women, its ability or inability to run a fair election, where do those things figure?",
        "They're as important in that relationship as they are in some relationships, whether it be, for example, with China or as was in the past decades with the Soviet Union.",
        "That is to say these are things we don't forget about, that we try to help, but they don't dictate the nature of their external relationship with the country, because the external relationship with a country involves more fundamental issues of stability and security."

        "I think first of all we have to be patient and avoid some arbitrary deadlines.",
        "Because if we start being impatient, we're transforming the negotiations from negotiations into the issuance of ultimata, and that's not going to work.",
        "Secondly, we ought to have, if possible, a wide agenda so that a number of issues are being negotiated at the same time: regional security, economic relationships, the benefits of the lifting on sanctions and other sort of benefits which would accrue from the flow of Iranian oil westward, thereby also driving the price down, as well, and of course very importantly so, the nuclear issue.",
