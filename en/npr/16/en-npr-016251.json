        "Now that said, President Pena Nieto of Mexico did say yesterday he would cooperate, and he's asking the attorney general's office to go back and look at these discrepancies.",

        "But I must say here that it's important for us to understand that the way politics has been organized since the United States occupied Iraq reinforce sectarianism because in a way if you remember that Governing Council that existed for a while, the way its members were chosen was according to their sect.",
