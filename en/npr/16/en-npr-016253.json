        "Give me an example of something that might fall under that category?",
        "One of the big ones is the treatment of federal research dollars that go for supporting research to attack certain diseases.",
        "Those dollars have been prohibited up to now by the Bush administration from going to any research that's based on stem cells taken from human embryos.",
        "If human embryos were involved, the Bush administration did not want that research to go forward because it destroyed those human embryos which potentially - although most of them were on their way to being destroyed as medical waste - potentially, those could develop into human beings.",
        "So the Bush administration took the view that that was a kind of sacrifice of life, and therefore they didn't want to fund with federal money any such research.",
        "So they went forward, of course, with private money.",
        "And the Bush administration was more than willing to fund stem cell research as long as the stem cells came from some other source other than human embryos.",
        "That is a controversial position because, of course, it greatly restricts the amount of research that can go on in an area that many scientists regard as highly promising to cure many different diseases.",
        "And so we expect, given his position in the Senate and what he has said in his campaign, that will be one of the first policies Barack Obama reverses.",
        "Financial Times columnist Lucy Kellaway recently did a little investigation of the contents of her colleagues' desk drawers and wrote a column about what they revealed.",
        "We reached her in London to hear the details.",
        "Good morning.",
        "Good morning.",
        "What prompted you to peer into one of your colleague's drawers?",
        "Well, I was wearing a new pair of shoes that was slicing into the back of my ankle and I needed a Band-Aid.",
        "And so I asked around the office and a colleague pulled out her drawer and I looked inside and there were pills, there were lots of plastic spoons and forks, they were pair of tights, there were all sorts of things in this giant tangle, and eventually she did find a so slightly crumpled Band-Aid with a leopard skin print and handed it to me.",
        "And I thought, my god, there's some serious (unintelligible) in there about our workmates that we never really think about.",

        "And I thought that told me quite a lot about what he's like in a colleague, which is really jolly decent, if maybe a tiny bit lacking in imagination.",
        "So you decided, I gather, that you could really shortcut opinions about your colleagues, people that you might have developed a sense of who they were over the years, you could pretty much just open the drawer and that says a lot.",

        "When you decided to think about this a little more in-depth, I gather you asked any number of your colleagues to report back about what was in their drawers, and people did.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Although, did they own up to putting it in the desk drawer?",
        "No.",
        "Well, you see, that's just the lovely ambiguity of the desk drawer because in the modern office everyone moves around all the time.",
        "So quite often when you go to a new desk, you may claim that you've inherited various unsavory items from your predecessor.",
        "Well, I know that when I moved into this office here 10 years ago, I did open a door and it was just filled with piles and piles of people's business cards.",
