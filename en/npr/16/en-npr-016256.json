        "I kind of think of string theory as being like a promising young assistant professor, you know, who looks really smart.",
        "But we usually don't give them 30 years to produce something.",
        "Sure, he says, their ideas are provocative.",
        "The problem is they are all unproven, and may be untestable with the current technology.",
        "By some reckoning, you'd need an atom smasher the size of the galaxy to see strings directly.",
        "As I like to say, there's at this point as much experimental evidence that quarks are made up of little pink elephants as they are of strings.",
        "So I think that it behooves us to be honest and not claim for our theories more than we produce, because ultimately that's going to come back and bite us.",
        "And string theory has grown vastly more complicated over the past few decades.",
        "Every time a new problem arises, string theorists weave astonishing new and complicated explanations to get around them.",
        "For example, the theorists get around one problem by saying there are more universes out there than there are atoms in our universe.",
        "Krauss says it's hard to know whether to be amazed that we live in such a bizarre place or worried that theorists have lost their way.",
        "To the extent that we even understand string theory, it may imply a massive number of possible different universes with different laws of physics in each universe and there may be no way of distinguishing between them or saying why the laws of physics are the way they are.",
        "And if I can predict anything, then I haven't explained anything.",
        "If I have a theory of everything, then in some sense, I have a theory of nothing.",
        "And on the field, the string theorists are still out of sync.",
        "Okay.",
        "That's the first half.",

        "At the half, the score is two to one, with the string team losing and looking none too happy about it.",
        "Referee Bob Kirshner comes to the sidelines for a beer.",
        "There was actually a brief moment where someone was playing with skill, and I blew the whistle immediately to stop the game, because that was way overboard.",
        "David Gross, the director of the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics and the picnic's benefactor, is concerned that the game will end before the meat is off the grill.",
        "We've got to keep going until 5:00.",
        "I know that.",
        "We'll give them 10 minutes.",
        "And then we'll play.",
        "You know how it is.",
        "It's not only the time on the clock, there's the out of bounds time, there's the injury time, there's the relativistic correction.",
        "The institute director occupies a curious place in the string theory debate.",
        "Gross won a Nobel Prize a few years ago for work in a conventional branch of theoretical physics.",
        "But now he's a strong proponent of string theory.",
        "Even those of us who work in the field aren't really sure what string theory is or what it's going to be.",
        "So when you're in this kind of speculative, exploratory science, it's important to have faith, because you're out on a big limb.",
        "So I think it's really a question of whether we believe this is the right direction.",
        "And that I do believe rather firmly.",
        "Gross has heard all the criticisms of string theory and he has ready rebuttals.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "One is rather flippant but correct, and it's that there's nothing else.",
        "There's no other game in town."

        "Getting nervous, Steve?",
        "We'll give them some more time.",
        "We'll start using the extra dimensions to catch up.",
        "Okay, so string theory jokes tend toward the obscure.",
        "Giddings is actually feeling somewhat more optimistic about the fate of string theory these days.",
        "That's because in a year or two, a powerful new atom smasher will open up near Geneva, Switzerland.",
        "And there is at least a remote chance that the accelerator can finally provide some real evidence for string theory.",
        "The best we'll probably do is get some indirect hints for what string theory is all about.",
        "But then there's always this jackpot scenario where we could actually start seeing direct evidence.",
        "Giddings says if the strings turn out to be relatively large, particle collisions in this accelerator could start to pluck the string of gravity, if you will.",
        "And if the scientists are extraordinarily lucky, Giddings says black holes could form and then quickly evaporate."
