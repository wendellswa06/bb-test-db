        "The brain produces about 200 billion cells, you know, many more than an adult has, and unless there's proper connectivity, some of those cells kind of die off because they don't connect well and they don't stay ion the brain system.",

        "And around that is the social and emotional factors that are important in the development of the child, so the nurturing of the child is just a s important and can even alter genes, you know, because that's part of the environment in a growing child.",
        "So I think there's a lot of factors here that are involved in a baby's growing and the maximum stimulation that clearly should be given to a child is in those first three years of development.",
        "What is it that's so important about the first three years?",
        "That is when the brain is growing maximally, the brain is almost like a sponge, it absorbs everything that can be given to a brain.",
        "Now once you do not really intervene during these first three years, then people have shown in the studies that the brain actually is a smaller brain.",
