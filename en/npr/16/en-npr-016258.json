        "Well, that's their right, but of course, what I'm saying is two things.",

        "Secondly, don't forget the rest of my record, a very progressive record, particularly on domestic questions.",

        "You cite him with the sentiment of keeping your eye on the future.",
        "So long as the future is in July, President Clinton supports you in the primary.",
        "But after the primary, after August, we expect he and many other prominent Democrats will support the winner of the primary.",
        "That could be you.",
        "It could be Ned Lamont.",
        "Why not respect the Democratic Party leadership and say I'm a Democrat, I'll support the Democrats?",
        "Well, I expect the winner of the primary will be me.",
        "What I have done, as you know, is to open up an option.",
        "And I do that with all respect to my fellow Democrats.",
        "I've been a devoted Democrat for four decades now.",
        "But my - I have a devotion higher than to my party and that is to my state and to my country and that I want to give the final choice to all the voters of Connecticut on November 7, not just a minority of Democrats who come out on a hot day in August.",
        "To go back to Iraq before I let you go.",
        "Okay.",
        "Senator Rockefeller, Jay Rockefeller, fellow Democrat of yours, said quite some time ago, he said, very simply, if I had known then what I know now about the absence of weapons of mass destruction, about the absence of connections to al-Qaida before the U.S.",
        "invasion and about the pretty stiff resistance we've met with in the breakdown in order there, he wouldn't have voted to approve the war.",
        "It appears that there's nothing of significant regret that you feel, despite those very erroneous forecasts of what this war was going to be all about.",
        "Am I right?",
        "Oh, no, no, no. I am very upset about the poor intelligence and poor judgment about what was going to happen after we overthrew Saddam Hussein.",
        "That's probably the most colossal failure - consequential failure - of intelligence and leadership by this administration.",
        "In Iraq, we weren't prepared for what was going to happen, but on the fundamental question of whether we were right to go in to overthrow Saddam Hussein, I believe we were."

        "It wasn't until the following year, when wildlife biologists started finding the carcasses of starved musk oxen, that they realized something had gone terribly wrong out there in the snow.",
        "Putkonen has since discovered a few anecdotal accounts of big rain-on-snow events that killed reindeer in the Arctic and Scandinavia.",
        "But he says it's hard to actually study them.",
        "Even if you put down instruments to record one, they freeze up or get snowed under.",

        "There are other places around the Arctic that have these things, like Finland and Russia, where people herd reindeer or caribou and depend for their livelihood on these things.",
        "But so far no one knows if these events are increasing or not.",
        "No one has ever checked.",
        "That's what Putkonen and Grenfell are planning to do next.",
        "They've figured out what rain-on-snow looks like on a satellite image.",
        "Now they've got 30 years of images of the Arctic to look through.",
