        "I'm talking about challenges such as the health challenges, specifically focusing in on our high infant mortality rate in comparison to other ethnic and racial groups.",
        "I'm talking about the specific health challenges that African-American children are confronted with, such as sickle cell anemia, lead poisoning, all of those that have a direct impact on their cognitive develop, as well as their psychosocial, emotional development.",
        "Areva, you and your husband are professionals who no doubt are in a position to really be able to apply certain resources, whether it's time or money, to the care of your children, including your son with his special needs around autism.",
        "But that doesn't mean that the problem disappears.",
        "And you also are working with this Special Needs Network that really tries to help people who don't necessarily have the resources that you might have.",
        "Tell us about the work that you're doing with that.",
        "It's very exciting work, and I get really passionate about talking about it, because one thing that our organization does, we go into communities where families don't have access to information, they don't have access to resources or to services, and we educate them about the very topics we're talking about this morning.",
        "The need to be involved with their children at very young ages, the need to know what the developmental milestones are.",
        "Often times, African-American families don't know what to look for in a developing child.",
        "So you won't necessarily know that at the age of two, children should be speaking.",
        "And so I often see families that come into my organization that are five and six years old, and the children have no language.",
        "And the family hasn't taken any steps to get intervention, to get an evaluation or to determine what's happening with that child.",
        "So Special Needs Network looks to bring that kind of information and those kinds of resources into communities of color, into poor communities, into low-income communities so that families will know what to look for and how to then access services that can make a tremendous difference in the lives of a developing child.",
        "Professor Harris, in terms of identifying kids who may need some either additional help or some special educational coaching, how's that going, broadly, in terms of, you know, the African community - African-American community?",
        "Do you think that people know what to do?",
        "I think there are some people who do know what to do, and those are typically your high-resource people.",
        "But we're talking about a segment of people who are low-resource people and high risk and, you know, live in the most at-risk environments.",
        "And that group can be young and teen mothers who probably have limited knowledge about where to seek out services.",
        "You know, so therefore, groups like the one that Areva just talked about are so very, very important, especially targeting those young mothers and those poor mothers.",
        "You know, kids...",
        "Well...",
        "Please, go ahead.",
        "I was just going to say, we do know statistically that African-American and Latino children are often diagnosed with conditions like autism one to two years later than their typical counterparts.",
        "So we know that that information that our communities so desperately need is not getting into the hands of those parents that can then take some steps to do something about it.",
        "So our kids are lagging behind because they are not getting diagnosed timely.",
        "Therefore they are not getting intervention timely."

        "Professor Harris, give me just two or three bullet points of things that might be the red flags.",
        "If your child does or doesn't do blank, you might want to go see a doctor.",
        "Language delay.",
        "Alright, I think knowledge of developmental time tables, but definitely language delay.",
        "And we're talking about, for example, autism language delay.",
        "If your child is not speaking, let's say, comparatively with other children, then you know that might be a red flag for you.",
        "If the child has any kind of motor delay, or any kind of repetitive behavior, you know, that might be a red flag for you.",
        "What on the other hand are things that you would consider doing for a kid who showed early promise, like an early reader or a kid who was musically gifted?",
        "You mean in terms of...",
        "Yeah, what should you do in terms - like if you see a kid who's kind of got the ball and running with it, what do you do with that kid?",
        "Oh, if it's a kid who's got a particular leaning toward reading, then you keep stimulating that, you know.",
        "You keep encouraging them to - you provide them with the opportunities to develop those more advanced reading kinds of skills.",
        "Now, Areva, we only have a little bit of time, but what have you learned from being a mother to children with different perspectives on growth?",
        "Well, what I've learned as both a mother, a lawyer and an advocate for children is that all children are different.",
        "They're all so incredibly special.",
        "And no matter if your child has a language delay or your child is gifted, as that child who's an avid reader, but we as parents play such a critical role in nurturing that child.",
        "And when we embrace that role as being the final arbiters of how our children will develop, that we can see our children just make incredible progress.",
        "I want to thank both of you so much.",
        "Thank you."

        "Hudson argues that tinier seats are not just unsafe for evacuations but can cause blood clots and other health problems and lead to more passenger conflicts.",
        "Mandatory minimum sentences, sentencing guideline systems, some other movements over the last couple of decades in sentencing reform were a valid leap for trying to create a more uniform system of sentencing, trying to prevent different judges from coming up with disparate results often driven by liberal forces saying there's a risk that…",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "…white offenders would get the benefits if judges had a lot of discretion.",
        "The problem has been to try to regulate the discretion of judges alone isn't sensitive to the discretion that prosecutors have, the discretion that other actors in the criminal justice system have and even more, generally, some of the structural realities that influence how the criminal justice system operates so that disproportionately it ends up being African-American offenders who are subject to the harshest of these mandatory sentencing terms.",
        "And by structural factors, are you talking about things like poverty?",
        "Poverty, urban-versus-rural realities.",
        "One, for example, that's so interesting comes from a recent report by a terrific commission in New Jersey.",
        "The New Jersey Sentencing Commission did some dramatic report about drug-free school zones - we think makes perfect sense - increased the penalties in the vicinity of a school for any drug dealing there.",
        "But in urban areas, schools are more closely packed together, and there are some inner city regions where you can't get outside of a drug-free school zone.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And so it ends up being that anybody who lives in those urban areas at any point, even if they're not trying to sell the kids or not trying to be near a school, are subject to these enhanced penalties based on this desire to make school zones a special place deserving with special punishments."

        "Another example that people point to is death row, and the disparities there are equally shocking.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And there, what's interesting, particularly, is the way in which the race of the victim has a profound impact.",
        "And one of the things that's, again, sort of, hard to understand and yet important to appreciate is often times it's not discrimination in terms of being uniquely severe to African-American offenders as much as it is being uniquely lenient to white offenders or perhaps disturbingly lenient when a white offender is guilty of having a black offender as a victim.",
        "And so, what we really see the most dramatic statistics come in sentencings, when we have a white defendant who kills a black victim.",
        "In fact, in the modern history of the death penalty, where there's been close to eleven hundred executions, there have only been 15 white defendants who have been executed, having committed a crime in which they kill a black defendant.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But when we changed the racial dynamics, a black defendant having killed a white victim, we now have 223 such executions when it's that ratio.",
        "And so in other words, it seems, though, if you just look at the execution numbers, it's, you know, 10 to 15 times more likely that you'll end up executed if you are a black defendant who kills a white victim rather than a white defendant who kills a black victim.",
        "And I wonder, is there any analysis that shows that African-Americans get better treatment from African-American judges?",
        "Not really.",
        "In fact, there are some interesting statistics that suggests that African-American judges will sometimes be harsher, and there are some particularly notable research that's now coming out that is not necessarily skin color as much as it is sort of relationship to visions of racial threats that having, quote, unquote, \"\"certain kinds of facial features.\"\" They're seen as more threatening than others - in part, can account for how some of these plays out.",
        "And again, that reminds me when I look at this that there's a deeper psychology at work and there are these structural issues that I think are hurt if we try to interpret this data and say, aha, the system racist and the problem is, you know, the whites are making rules that they're treating blacks unfairly.",
        "I think it - these statistics demand nuance to understand how they come to be and will require nuanced solutions to deal with the problems that they reveal.",

        "The Honorable Anita Josey-Herring is a Superior Court judge here in the District of Columbia.",

        "Thank you very much.",
        "And I know judges look at these same statistics, and they must be shocked as well.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "It's, obviously, very concerning because the justice system is really designed to promote justice and equality to look at the data that comes out of that system, which is skewed in a way, that let's us all know that there's a lot of work to be done to make the system ideal.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And so, I think the data refer to is correct and we all are, hopefully, working hard to figure out what we can do to more positively impact the system.",
        "More recently, just last week, the family Court of the District of Columbia had an inter-agency, interdisciplinary conference with all of the family-serving agencies and some members of the private bar and public sector to talk about juvenile, delinquency cases and really the state of the African-American youth…",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "…male, in particular, as it relates to disproportionate minority representation in the system and more specifically, disparity.",
        "And I think it's pretty clear from being a judge in the Family Court of the District of Columbia that we rarely see a non-African-American individual in our system.",
        "We do have small percentages of Hispanic youth in our system that are more substantial - not more substantial than the African-Americans.",
        "I think we basically see about 95 percent African-American youth in our system and a small percentage of Hispanics and hardly ever a white youth."
