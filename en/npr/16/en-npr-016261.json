        "Because, I think, the example or the social experiment that was done with the black and white dolls and the Brown versus Board of Education experiment, which has been updated by a group of people recently just a few years ago, shows you the extent to which black children at a very young age are influenced by societal cues and information that they're receiving, really, almost on a subliminal level and how that impacts their sense of value as young people.",
        "And I would dare say that we all, black and white, young and old, are impacted over the course of life in the same way.",
        "And therefore, when a black respondent in a juvenile case or defendant in an adult criminal case comes before the court, black judges as well as white judges are impacted by all of these societal things that impact their perspectives.",

        "And, you know, all night long I would be involved with these, you know, prostitutes and drug dealers, crack dealers specifically, mostly black, mostly young.",
        "And at the end of the night, they'd be partying with these young art students and, you know, they were heroin addicts and dealers.",
        "And I think the most striking contrast with, you know, like at 4:00 in the morning, the guy, the, you know, segundo(ph), the guy who directly steps down, gets his drugs from the main dealer, distributing the drugs in just a very ordinary, you know, college student, which he was, you know?",
        "And out of his backpack comes the digital scale to weigh the grams of heroin.",

        "The new guidelines reduce the top sentences by up to 30 months because it takes much more cocaine to get the same sentence, much more powdered cocaine.",

        "and I think that's, itself, another sort of interesting dimension of the story because you could also say that education matters more than race, because you look at the statistics and you see a profound relationship between those who have dropped out of high school or haven't' had the chance to go to college and their incarceration rates.",
        "And again, it's obvious that class and education attainment correlate in a variety of ways and influence each other.",

        "Does that something that influences you when you're making a judgment?",
        "Well, I think it's fair to say that having a stable family background and a support network or safety net in terms if family members who are willing to take responsibility for properly monitoring and supervising and addressing the behavior bringing the juvenile into the court system, is going to be critically important.",
        "And oftentimes, you see that in middle class families, regardless of race, you have stronger family factors that will lead you to believe that any orders issued by the court in terms of probation or sentence will be carried out.",
