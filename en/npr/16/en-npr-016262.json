        "And I wonder, Professor Berman, as you listened to what Shawn has to say, clearly, these are all factors, too.",
        "Absolutely.",

        "Those from higher economic classes will typically have better access to lawyers earlier in the process.",
        "Those lawyers, especially for low-level matters, can sometimes convince prosecutors to not even pursue a serious charge or not pursue a charge that might include a mandatory minimum term that may or may not be avoidable once we get into court.",
        "Likewise, in terms of presenting the picture to the judge about what the alternatives are.",
        "Hmm.",
        "One of the things that's fascinating is I go around the country and oftentimes hear from the most sophisticated and capable defense attorneys.",
        "They're talking about developing mitigation evidence that is just beyond the reach of the vast majority of defendants.",
        "Talking about, oh, make a DVD of the home life of this particular defendant to show that it's, you know, healthy and stable, and making presentations to the judge that requires an extraordinary amount of resources to even put together.",
        "And again, that's just another way in which class and economic realities can impact the information that goes into the system and the way in which decision makers respond to the information they get.",

        "Lisa is on the line with us from South Dakota.",

        "And that really does affect a lot of sentencing.",
        "And they can sit until -tell you until they're blue in their face that they don't, but I've seen it personally time and time again.",
        "Right now, I work in the tribal courts on a reservation representing Native American clients.",
        "And I don't see that same kind of - a lot that same kind of bias in the tribal courts.",

        "Hmm.",
        "But I really do think there's a lot of bias, whether they'll admit it or not, or just even admit it to themselves or not.",
        "A couple of different questions there.",
        "One of which, I guess, goes to Professor Berman.",
        "When in - Native Americans are dealing with state or federal courts, they, too, go to prison in a much higher percentage than their population numbers would suggest.",
        "Yeah and that highlights that there are lot of complicated intersecting factors there and in other regions as well.",
        "One of the points that's often made in the context of federal sentencing debates is the possibility that the states can always prosecute most of these crimes using their laws that are often aren't as skewed as some of the federal laws that you mentioned earlier…",
        "Hmm.",
        "…have been changed related to crack and cocaine.",
        "And so, it's another dimension.",
        "Another point I'd like to make in light of that recent call is to encourage people, especially in the wake of the Jena Six and the Genarlow Wilson case, to not think, oh, well, this is a southern problem.",
        "And this is just the remnants of southern biases and the unfortunate history of discrimination in the south.",
        "There was a recent report by the sentencing project talking about disparities in incarceration levels.",
        "And one of the most interesting findings was that the states with the highest black-to-white ratio are disproportionately located in the northeast and the Midwest, including Iowa, having the most disproportionate incarceration rates with more blacks relative to white, and then that being followed by Vermont, New Jersey, Connecticut and Wisconsin.",
        "And that can be a byproduct of either those states having lower than average incarceration rates for whites or higher than average incarceration rates for blacks.",
        "But it's telling and important.",
        "And I think that last caller, in a sense, suggested it, that this is not a phenomenon unique to certain regions or a distinctive when there's been a particular past history of racial discrimination.",
        "It's something that can impact and, in fact, have a greater impact in some regions that like to take pride in having gotten beyond the more notable versions of discrimination.",
        "And I need to ask Judge Josey-Herring, Lisa said, in her experiences, judges seem to act on biases, whether they are aware of them or not.",
        "This has got to be a concern.",

        "We just had this conference on disproportionate minority representation, and we had a wonderful facilitator who really had a very interesting way of enlightening us about how we go about making decisions, particularly discretionary decisions.",
        "And really, she invited us to consider, in addressing various problems in the juvenile justice system, how we might decide the issue if we were dealing with a white person, and to use that as a mental sort of a - it have that as a mental image as you are tackling a problem to figure out whether you're going to be more energetic and looking for options, whether you are, in fact, bringing to bear inappropriate considerations.",

        "And it's - in terms of time and effort, it's a lot easier to arrest 150 street people and charge them with drug violations than to take the weeks, months and years that it takes to work up the ladder and nail the big-time drug dealers.",
        "And it's -in the past, it's not unusual, for example - they don't do it so much anymore -but people in charge with law enforcement would wait for a series of, say, 30 or 40 individual street-level dealers and announce the arrests all at one time, calling it a, you know, a big…",

        "I'll investigate.",
        "Well, let me ask Professor Berman.",
        "Do the statistics suggest to you - and I don't know if they're broken out in this way - but that if you took the drug crimes out of this, are the statistics correct?",
        "It's certainly true that perhaps the single easiest factor to identify that's driven a lot of these developments has been the war on drugs and the way in which not just as a mentioned, you know, drug-free school zones, mandatory minimum sentences, prosecution policies, part of that is not just about the war on drugs, but the belief that the way to tackle the war on drugs is to ratchet up sentences even for the small fries on the theory that by threatening long sentences, you can then get them to cooperate and help the police and prosecutors get to the bigger fish.",
        "The problem is that's often hard to do.",
        "The problem is that the most sophisticated drug dealers know how to distance themselves from the street-level dealers so that there isn't this…",

        "And yet, my experience as a social planner, including criminal justice as well as a cultural anthropologist, is that we don't slice the dice in - and dice the data in the United States on the basis of education and economic status sufficiently; and we tend to take the easy course and say, oh, this is racial bias and I'm sure we'll hear that tonight on all kinds of sound bytes on the national news.",
        "We also create a self-fulfilling prophecy for minority groups when we point out that there seems to be a correlation but not a causation, a correlation between race and these phenomenon.",

        "Yeah.",
