        "When you think about the overall patterns of addiction in society, what do you think and I'm going to ask you as well, Dr. Fong, in a second, but Dr. Grant, what do you think it costs this country that so many people have addictive behavior patterns.",
        "Well, the costs to society, I think, are really great.",
        "You know people are unable to function at the highest level of productivity.",
        "As Dr. Fong mentioned how depression can also lead to some of these.",
        "Actually, depression can be a byproduct of many addictive behaviors.",
        "So that you also get people who are feeling so guilty and embarrassed by their behavior that they become severely depressed, that they need to be hospitalized and families are torn apart by these behaviors.",
        "So, I think the ripple effect of addictive behavior is enormous.",
        "Dr.",
        "Fong, I'm going to change this question a little bit.",
        "Given the cause of addictive behaviors, what is the medical world doing about it?",
        "You are part of that medical world.",
        "Well, I will just tell you a brief story.",
        "I mean when I went to medical school in psychiatry residency training, very little training on substance abuse and very minimal and essentially non-existent training for behavioral addictions like gambling, video game addiction, and sexual addictions.",
        "And one of the things that Dr. Grant and I are really kind of pushing forth is idea of really training all health care professionals to understand that the impact of addiction, whether it be substances of non-substances, actually can have a very profound medical and psychiatric impact on individual, on family, and on society.",
        "And just some statistics, we know that 500 billion dollars a year is lost to American society for drug-related addictions.",
        "We don't know that global number for behavioral addiction because many times these are hidden addictions.",
        "So, when you have for instance with gambling, when you have suicides or even homicides or crimes committed or drug overdoses, many times the root cause maybe the gambling addiction.",
        "It's not very much - it's not very clearly spelled out or obviously linked from the action to the behaviors and consequences.",
        "Dr.",
        "Fong, we're actually going to be talking in a moment with a recovering gambling addict in the Los Angeles areas, and here in Los Angeles, certain parts of south L.A., for example, have casinos and a lot a casinos are in more working class neighborhood.",
        "So, does the concentration of what you are addicted to?",
        "Like a casino, like gambling, how does a concentration of availability affect someone who may have a problem.",
        "Well, you know, a question that people have been looking out for a long saying that if we introduce new casinos in new areas, well, that drive up the rate of pathological gambling or gambling addiction.",
        "It's very much when you think of out of all the addictive behaviors, what's the most available.",
        "Cigarettes.",
        "But also spending and now gambling.",
        "Here, as an example, in Los Angeles there are several casinos located in the urban settings, but there are several casinos located in rural settings or high socioeconomic settings as well.",
        "Well, I can tell you that what the data shows in California, they're roughly about four percent of all Californians have some sort of problem controlling their gambling.",
        "But the highest rates are those who are African-Americans, disabled or unemployed, and those rates are actually significantly higher than the four percent.",
        "But what we don't know is that because these casinos are located in urban environments or are there some sort of biological and cultural and social risk factors that predispose those groups to develop higher rates of gambling addiction.",
        "I had no role whatsoever in the management of Bain Capital after February of 1999.",
        "I think most Americans figure if you're the chairman, CEO and president of a company, that you are responsible for what that company does."

        "Well, you know, to build on what Dr. Fong had said, you know there is a disassociation with higher rates of, for example, gambling addiction among our socioeconomic groups.",
        "And these are the people that can, you know, are least available or least able to really deal with the repercussions of their gambling.",
        "And yet, the gambling is sort of marketed as this enticement of you can get out of poverty.",
        "You can get out of update.",
        "You can go out of poverty.",
        "You can get out of your bad financial situation if you win big at the casino.",
        "So, in part, much of the gambling is marketed toward these people who again can really not afford to take a part in it.",
        "And I think that to get back to your point about what the medical establishment can do, I don't think that we do enough to educate people particularly who are going through financial difficulties and lower economic brackets about the real potential addiction of many of these behaviors particularly gambling.",

        "In the House, we will probably see a requirement that up to 20 percent of the nation's electricity come from renewables, these sort of strong environmental provisions that are so contentious that, you know, most Republicans can't support them, and combined with this small, modest offshore drilling.",

        "And by that, I mean making something that a candidate had assumed to be his strength - which in John Kerry's case, was his military background - into a weakness.",
        "And so if the Obama campaign can make Mitt Romney's business background not the presumed basis of his campaign but instead, a source of controversy, a source of potential weakness for him, that really does make problems in the campaign for the Romney team."
