        "Well, no, it's still sort of very much a sort of militia country.",
        "It was noticeable yesterday that when the militia - when the former rebels took control of the office, that it was other rebel groups which surrounded it.",
        "There really is no government force.",
        "And they had to sort of be basically rousted out of bed to come and confront them, and I think that is the main - well, one of the main problems with the government at the moment.",

        "Is there any effort underway to provide some legitimacy for this government, through, for example, elections?",
        "Well, indeed, I met with a couple of NTC people tonight, and they're really sort of hanging on by their fingernails for this election, which comes in June.",
        "They're buoyed by the fact that so many people are registering, and people really are very excited to be able to vote for the first time.",
        "And I think what they're hoping is - I mean, I think that the NTC is feeling exhausted, and I think it thinks, well, come June we'll have an election, and then we'll have a democratic government, and then they'll have this force that we don't have.",

        "There are dozens and dozens of parties, but it's very unclear which parties have which sort of support and also what their programs are.",
        "And when you go and see these fledgling parties, they all say, well, on the one hand we're liberal, on the other hand we're Islamic, and there's no real ideological spectrum.",
        "And I think that's one of the problems of post-Gadhafi Libya, that people, for 42 years they didn't really think about what their politics were.",
        "They just wanted to get rid of Gadhafi.",
        "And I think now that that's a real problem, is trying to work out, you know, what is the political divide.",
        "Well, one of the major divides in the country that we heard about so much during the conflict was the divide East and West, the people from the Benghazi area, who were I guess the leaders of the NTC, and then the people out in the western part of the desert who were more supportive of Mr. Gadhafi.",
        "Yes, indeed, and as you point out, the East was liberated very quickly, and then the West was the great battleground.",
        "The confusing thing about all this is that the NTC comes from Benghazi, and everywhere else in the country they say, well, these people are from Benghazi, they're not a national government.",
        "But actually, Benghazi is perhaps the biggest opponent of the NTC, and Benghazi's leaders have met in the last few days to say that they may boycott the elections because they don't feel they have enough representation, and there are separatists in the East who are saying that the Cyrenaica, the eastern province, should be its own country."
