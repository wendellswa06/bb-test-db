        "And Tripoli, of course, says on the one hand we want to try him here, but on the other hand we can't get him, he's still in Zintan, and we haven't got the troops to, you know, to get hold of him.",
        "And finally, the fighting that erupted yesterday, out of the blue you said, is it unusual, is it - is the country seething, or is the country just, as you say, exhausted and waiting for these elections?",
        "I'd say it's not seething, but it's - because it's a very, there must be like 500 militias, I mean some of them 10-strong, across this country.",
        "And most of them are pretty well-behaved and have become sort of district police and so on.",
        "The problem is the minority of militias who are - who do their own thing, or break the law or do things like that, there's no one else to police them.",
        "And I think that's the problem.",
        "And I think yesterday, I think what put people on edge is that this militia were obviously very angry and obviously needed money and weren't getting money.",
        "And I think the fact that they could do it and get away with it, I think that's what's making people nervous about, you know, what comes next.",
        "And it's not been mentioned, the prime minister is all right, and such as it is the NTC is going ahead?",
        "He seems to be all right.",
        "We're not quite sure where he is.",
        "The other feature of this government is it's obsessive secrecy.",
        "It doesn't hold its meetings in public.",
        "There's no press office.",

        "Thank you.",
        "And as we've seen this - what's happened in Libya was not exactly the vision that many people had for the post-Gadhafi world.",
        "That's certainly true, but it was actually inevitable, and it was inevitable because of the nature of the conflict.",
        "And to understand that, I think you need to bear in mind that Libya is a very peculiar state in that the population is concentrated in two areas: around the eastern town of Benghazi and around the capital in the West, Tripoli, on the coast.",
        "Now, that's meant that although the revolution began in Benghazi, and although there was a militia in Benghazi that was supportive of the National Transitional Council, the revolution in the West that took Tripoli was actually quite independent of that, and therefore the militias that carried that out, the militias of Misrata and particularly Zintan, are not prepared to accept what the National Transitional Council may say.",
        "And yet the National Transitional Council is recognized by the international community as the official representative of Libya, and it's that contradiction that I think explains a large part of the problems that Libya is facing at the moment, and it's that that causes the issue of the elections due in June to be so important, because if they're successful, then there could be a central authority, and the militias have said that if there were such an authority, they would accept it.",
        "We don't know whether that's true of course, but it gives us an indication of a way out of the crisis.",
        "The legitimacy of elections.",
        "The legitimacy of elections, yes.",
        "Now, it should be understood those elections are not really to create a new government.",
        "They're really to create an assembly, which will draw up a constitution, and then there will be new elections for a legislature after that.",
        "But nonetheless, it's the beginning of a constitutional process.",
        "It's the beginning of creating a system that all Libyans could then regard as legitimate, and that's the crucial step.",
        "There is at the moment no army of the state.",
        "There's no central authority that could impose order and structure on Libya, and until that can be done, this sort of crisis and these sorts of tensions are bound to emerge.",
        "We're talking about unintended consequences in Libya after the revolution, internal rivalries, armed militias, mercenaries.",

        "After 40 years under Moammar Gadhafi, Libya's revolution was hailed as one of the great successes of the Arab spring when it finally succeeded last fall.",
        "And the country moves forward towards elections in June.",
        "Many questions, though, remain about rival tribes, heavily armed mercenaries and large stockpiles of advanced weapons.",
        "Today we're talking about the ripples of revolution.",
        "Our guest is George Joffe, a research fellow and lecturer at the Center for International Studies at Cambridge University.",

        "Yes, Neal, good afternoon, a big fan here.",
        "Thank you.",
        "My question is basically is - the oppressive regime of Gadhafi took 42 years to brainwash and just destroy the country.",
        "Freedom is a brand new thing for Libyans, and they didn't know what to do with it, I believe.",
        "But I believe the U.S.",
        "and the E.U.",
        "have vested interests to monitor the situation there.",
        "Otherwise they're going to have 500-plus militia on the loose.",
        "Another Iraq, potentially dangerous to the world as well.",
        "George Joffe, obviously the United States, its NATO partners and a couple of Arab states as well, provided the air cover for the revolution.",
        "What's their role now?",
        "Well, they provided the air cover.",
        "They also, some of them, provided military support too.",
        "That was particularly true of the Arab Gulf states such as Qatar, but also true of France.",
        "And in a sense, therefore, they're responsible for the way in which the militias in the west of Libya now operates as autonomous units.",
        "But the irony is that once the Gadhafi regime had been removed, there's not much evidence of engagement by those who were responsible for the NATO operations or indeed for arming the militias that then developed, and in reality Libya has had to work out its own way alone."

        "For example, Libya had $150 billion worth of assets abroad.",
        "They were all frozen by the United Nations.",
        "The Libyan government, such as it is, needs money, but the unfreezing of those assets still is not complete, with the result that the funds that it's got aren't really available to it, and indeed there's been very little help in terms of trying to organize the elections very effectively.",
        "There are teams there to provide technical advice, but there's no coherent attempt to try to create a post-conflict situation.",
        "And in part that's due to the nature of the United Nations resolutions.",
        "It didn't allow intervention on the ground, and that's been a major problem.",
        "And it should also be said, and here I agree with your caller, there's obviously a question of interests too.",
        "And Western states, in Europe in particular, have got interests in Libyan oil, in Libyan reconstruction and so on, and they're more concerned with that, perhaps, than they are with reconstructing the country.",
        "The income, though, from oil that's being sold now, who controls that?",
        "That goes, in theory, to the National Transitional Council.",
        "It actually goes to the Libyan Central Bank.",
        "The Libyan Central Bank is then supposed to disperse that money, but in effect it's under the control of the National Transitional Council.",
        "But again, you can see the problems.",
        "The arguments last night that resulted in the firefight outside the prime minister's office were about the fact that the government had promised to reimburse those involved in the militias for the sacrifices they had made, and the militia was complaining about the fact it had not been paid.",
        "And the prime minister's office has said actually they don't have the funds available to pay them.",
        "So there's clearly a problem in gaining ready cash of the kind you need to keep a country in these circumstances.",

        "Yes, I saw a picture, when the fighting began, the civil war began, and I thought it was an SA-18 missile, which is pretty advanced.",

        "In this case the flow of traffic was reversed, and it was going to Port Sudan and then up to - then up to Egypt, where it's handed over to the Egyptian smugglers and then out through Gaza.",
