        "And what are these missiles capable of?",
        "They're...",
        "They are the top-of-the-line surface-to-air missiles for - and there was quite a bit of worry about the relief flights in Libya, that they would be used by someone to shoot at the commercial traffic that was coming in, in the relief.",
        "But there was simply no sign of the SA-24s, and that's when we started realizing that these things are disappearing.",
        "So roughly equivalent to the Stinger missile?",
        "Better.",
        "Better.",
        "That's scary.",
        "It is.",
        "It is indeed, and there was some concern that it was - that they might show up in Afghanistan, but they have not, and so I was - I was not near as surprised, though, to see that they had shown up in Gaza and southern Lebanon.",
        "Well, they know what they are.",
        "You know, the experience that we've had over the years, that there have actually been very few military planes shot down by - well, at least since the Vietnam War - by these aircraft, usually what they kill are airliners and transport aircraft.",
        "And they are - they usually hit them when they're on the approaches to runways or taking off.",
        "If you'll remember in Iraq, the transport aircraft that was hit and put on fire and safely landed was struck on takeoff.",
        "They were effective, though, against Russian helicopters in Afghanistan.",
        "Indeed, and they were also - had shot down in Somalia a Russian independent transport with an SA-18, which isn't near as advanced as the SA-24."

        "David Fulghum, senior military editor for Aviation Week and Space Technology.",
        "And George Joffe, that's just one of those reports about where those Libyan stockpiles are showing up.",
        "Yes, and I think one needs to be rather careful about this.",
        "I've no evidence, of course, to say whether what David Fulghum said is true or not, but don't forget that actually Iran and Syria, for example, have direct access to Russian-made weapons because they have weapons agreements with Russia, and they've been supplied recently, certainly during the Syrian crisis, with weapons of that kind.",
        "So in fact we don't need a long chain coming from Libya to explain those weapons appearing with Hezbollah, if indeed they do, or indeed with Hamas.",
        "But again, to what extent they actually have, I don't know.",
        "There is another dimension to this, which in a sense is more important, and that is that there was undoubtedly a leakage of weapons from Libya, a significant leakage of sophisticated weaponry and much simpler weaponry too.",
        "And it leaked westwards.",
        "It didn't leak eastwards.",
        "And it leaked westwards into the (unintelligible) region, and if you're looking for an explanation of the renewed militancy of the Tuareg, for example, in Mali, it's related to that leakage to the west.",
        "It's also believed, and the Algerians have been particularly anxious to demonstrate this - that many of the weapons also ended up in the hands of al-Qaida and the Islamic Maghreb.",
        "In other words, the real flow has been westwards.",
        "And I think that's probably more plausible than the argument that there was a complicated flow through Sudan into Syria, into Iran and, indeed, into Hezbollah and to Hamas.",
        "We know, for example, that the Israelis have been very carefully monitoring what happens in Sudan.",
        "There was a report about six months ago of an attack on a convoy in Sudan, said to be taking equipment to Hamas, which was highly successful.",
        "I really wonder to what extent that argument about the leakage eastwards is more significant than the leakage westwards.",
        "I think it's probably the leakage westwards that we should be more concerned about.",
        "Let's get another caller in.",
        "This is John(ph), John with us from Fort Wayne.",
        "Yes.",
        "I have a Ph.D. in African history from Indiana University, and I did my field work in Mali as a Fulbright fellow.",
        "And, you know, Mali is, you know, one of the real unintended consequences of the collapse of the Gadhafi regime as many of the Tuareg were militia enlisted, and they just filtered back across the Sahara, and then destabilized Timbuktu and Gao.",
        "And so I'm wondering if the caller could just talk a little bit more about that, and I'd be happy to take his response off the air."

        "OK.",
        "John, thank you.",
        "Well, let me comment on that.",
        "I completely agree.",
        "I think it's a much more significant development.",
        "It's true that there were elements of the Tuareg that were recruited by the Gadhafi regime.",
        "And it's true, too, that after the regime was defeated, they filtered back in Tunisia and into Mali.",
        "And indeed in the last few months, they've created a rebellion inside Northern Mali.",
        "They've demanded a separate state, the state of Azawad, that they want to create as a Tuareg state to the north, and they've been very successful.",
        "And in conjunction with some of the extremist Islamic groups - and their complexion is extremely complex - they have indeed taken control of Timbuktu.",
        "And in Timbuktu, those groups have been responsible for the desecration of World Heritage sites.",
        "So that seems, to me, to be a very effective way of demonstrating the consequences of the collapse inside Libya.",
        "And there's insecurity inside Libya too.",
        "The western border region, for example, is extremely insecure.",
        "And because there's no central authority in Libya, it's not possible to restore order there.",
        "And so, in a way, it's a much more localized problem than the wider influence and implications of the problems inside the Middle East and particularly inside the Levant.",
        "I think we should be much more concerned about these local developments because next in line after Mali, there will be Niger, and after Niger there will be a threat to Mauritania.",
        "And that actually does directly influence Western concerns and strategy because beyond that and further south is Nigeria, and Nigeria is the really big concern.",
        "If weaponry starts floating in there, then you could have a major crisis in one of the major oil producers in South Africa and one of the major suppliers to the United States and the oil it consumes.",

        "Hello.",
        "I wanted to ask if there was any linkage between the weapons coming out of Libya and the violence from Boko Haram in Nigeria.",
        "Well, the short answer is that no one is quite certain.",
        "There are believed to be links, but they've never yet been proved.",
        "Boko Haram, in effect, operates entirely inside a national context.",
        "And although it's believed to have links with al-Qaida and the Islamic Maghreb, there's no firm evidence that that's the case, and there's no evidence yet the weapons have filtered down from Northern Africa into that region, that part of Africa.",
        "Now it could, of course, occur - undoubtedly it will, insofar as insecurity reigns in the Sahel region - and that's going to create a major problem, too, in terms of control of Northern Nigeria.",
        "But at the moment, we just simply aren't certain.",
        "Leslie, thank you very much.",

        "In that short time, Tea Party Republican Ted Cruz has already made a mark, and in doing so he's neglected a tradition of new senators of being seen and not heard.",

        "If the newly minted junior senator from Texas was holding back at all in his first weeks on Capitol Hill - and it's not clear how much he really was - this week, he let Ted Cruz be the full-throated conservative Ted Cruz his Tea Party backers sent to Washington.",
