        "During his upstart Senate campaign last year, Cruz referred to other Republicans as spineless jellyfish and graybeards.",
        "University of Texas Senate expert Sean Theriault says Texas Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst had been the pick of the GOP establishment for that Senate seat.",
        "But if you wanted someone to go in there and shake things up, then Ted Cruz was your option.",
        "In fact, he's gone there and he's shaken things up.",
        "That became clear late last month when Cruz, who was a champion debater at Princeton before getting a law degree from Harvard, suggested that then-defense secretary nominee Chuck Hagel might be on the take from disreputable regimes.",
        "It is at a minimum relevant to know if that $200,000 that he deposited in his bank account came directly from Saudi Arabia, came directly from North Korea.",
        "That allegation brought Cruz a scolding from fellow Republican John McCain.",
        "I just want to make it clear: Senator Hagel is an honorable man.",
        "He has served his country and no one on this committee at any time should impugn his character or his integrity.",
        "Cruz drew another public rebuke Thursday from California Democrat Dianne Feinstein.",
        "The former Texas solicitor general had been explaining to her the fine points of the Bill of Rights at a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee.",
        "Feinstein caustically thanked Cruz.",

        "We're talking this Thanksgiving week about what it means to become American.",
        "And we've heard about the often wrenching experience of immigration.",
        "It was wrenching for the writer Junot Diaz and for the writer Jhumpa Lahiri.",
        "She says that after decades here, she still feels only half American.",
        "It was a bit different for the writer Joseph O'Neill who wrote a novel called \"\"Netherland\"\" about immigrants like himself in New York.",
        "Mr.",
        "JOSEPH O'NEILL (Author, \"\"Netherland\"\"): I had no grand intention to become an American citizen, but then I stayed.",
        "In fact, it was my plan to go back after a couple of years, but then I stayed and stayed.",
        "And then there just came a point where I had no real desire to go back to some other place.",
        "And I realized, you know, that I'd become an American.",
        "Maybe not exclusively an American, but in addition to what I was already, I was also an American.",
        "Joseph O'Neill was already Irish because he was born there.",
        "He's also Turkish like his mother.",
        "You could even say he's Dutch, since he grew up in the Netherlands.",
        "People like O'Neill straddle the borders between nations.",
        "Mr.",
        "O'NEILL: When you ask somebody are you an American or are you an Irishman, or are you, you know, from South Africa, or from wherever, I think the meaning of that question has changed so much in the last 15-20 years, simply because the meaning of nationality and nationhood has changed so much.",
        "I think that the age of globalization has completely emptied, essentially, the kind of geographic distances that were so significant in the past.",
        "Well, how has that changed the meaning of nationhood or nationality?",
        "Mr.",
        "O'NEILL: Well, because - let's take an immigrant.",
        "It used to be the case - I mean, I'm thinking of Ireland where I'm from - that for an Irishman to come to the United States involved a perilous journey by ship over the sea.",
        "And it involved singing lots of songs before you left, saying goodbye.",
        "And once you were in the United States, it involved singing lots of songs about how you were never going to set foot in Ireland again.",
        "But nowadays the transfer of people from country to country is not irrevocable in the way that it used to be.",
        "You can go backwards and forwards as often you like, subject to legal and financial restrictions.",
        "And furthermore, you can stay in touch with everyone back home.",
        "You can read their blogs.",
        "You can speak to them on the phone.",
        "You can - there are all sorts of ways.",
        "So that there's this enormous collapse in the very idea of migration, so that migration becomes less traumatic and less decisive than it used to be.",
        "And you have these rather fused and rather blurred identities that emerge as a consequence.",
        "Was there something when you came here and began interacting with Americans that you thought people didn't get about you and your experience?",
        "Mr.",
        "O'NEILL: Well, of course they didn't get anything about me or my experience.",
        "But in a way I didn't mind.",
        "I mean, in fact one of the great pluses of being an immigrant is that you get to start again.",
        "In terms of your identity, you get to shed the sort of narratives which cling to you, where you come from.",
        "And at the same time, I felt in New York City that I - you know, that people were just interested to take me at face value.",
        "And so I was free to sort of say what I liked about myself and to say as much as I liked about myself."

        "And so I don't think he's trying to reinvent the wheel, but merely trying to find himself a place on the wheel.",

        "He discusses this thing in political terms, which is to say that if America can't understand cricket, how can it expect to understand the world?",
        "And so I suppose what he's trying to do, what a cricket entrepreneur in this country - cricket immigrant in this country is trying to do, is trying to make a contribution and is trying to kind of continue in the tradition whereby America receives a constant enrichment from the newcomers who arrive to it.",
        "You mentioned that at one point that this character you write about, this West Indian immigrant, is involved in the classic American story, rags to riches.",

        "O'NEILL: Well, I think so.",
        "But I think, more specifically, Chuck Ramkissoon himself, the character, is thinking about it.",
        "He lives in the United States for a number of years.",
        "And he becomes aware of this very specific kind of narrative in American life which essentially authorizes people to do whatever it takes to climb up by their boot straps and to make something of themselves, even if that means cutting corners from time to time - which is what Chuck ends up doing - and even if it means being a bit of a rogue, because I think there's a sort of tolerance within the culture for this sort of irregular kind of self-enrichment, because it's not a perfect society, the United States.",
        "It doesn't provide everyone with the same start in life.",
        "And therefore if someone wants to do better for themselves, people kind of turn a blind eye and in fact have a smile, even if they've broken a few rules along the way.",
