        "I really liked the couple that had the baby and put the baby up for adoption, and how they followed the continuing process of healing for this particular couple.",
        "And I would really like to see more of the teen moms that choose to put their babies up for adoption.",
        "You'd like to see more where adoption is the choice.",

        "Sarah?",
        "Well, you know, adoption used to be a more common choice.",
        "I mean, I'm old enough that I remember how many young women in my high school, and in the neighborhoods, sort of disappeared for a few months to places unknown.",
        "And I realized years later, of course, that they were having the baby and placing it for adoption.",
        "But the current number is that less than 2 percent of teen mothers place their baby for adoption.",
        "So it's a very important aspect of this whole situation, but it's still quite unusual and increasingly so.",
        "That's a shame, because there's a lot of families out there that aren't - you know, couples that can't have babies, and it would be really nice to see, you know, if there was more support or counseling for these young moms on the benefits of adoption for these families that are unable to have children of their own.",
        "I completely agree with you, and there are a number of efforts now that we fully support, to sort of raise the profile of the adoption option.",

        "You know, having a child already was very, very challenging.",
