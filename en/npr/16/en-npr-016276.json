        "Demeaning teachers is not what school officials say they are trying to do.",
        "Providence Public Schools spokeswoman Christina O'Reilly says the goal was to put all of the displaced teachers on an even playing field and give principals a chance to find a good fit.",
        "We certainly recognize that teachers are not interchangeable.",
        "They are not widgets.",
        "They're people and they're professionals.",
        "And doing this sort of an open match hiring process gave a chance for each teacher to make their best case about their own professional credentials to a principal who's looking for someone to fill a position.",
        "Teachers had a chance to browse openings before the job fair.",
        "The teachers and principals will rank their top choices, and a computer program will try to match everyone accordingly.",
        "Fortunately, very little of this will be manual.",
        "Carleton Jones is Chief Operating Officer for the Providence School District.",
        "He says the process was designed to fill a large number of vacancies in a short amount of time.",
        "And the goal is to have mutual consent so that principals are receiving teachers that they have consented to and you don't get people going, oh, I ended up where I didn't wish to end up, and be ready for school to open in September.",
        "School officials see this as a compromise - the teachers do not have to compete with candidates from outside the district.",
        "But many Providence teachers have deep misgivings.",
        "They say none of this addresses real problems, like how to get rid of bad teachers or how to reverse a long history of low test scores for thousands of students in this urban school district.",

        "And she said that those who violate human rights should be punished.",
        "But she's also said that Myanmar is a very young country and stressed that they face many, many problems.",
        "There are long-running civil conflicts.",
        "So she's trying to appease the international community while really not coming out and saying that there are terrible things going on at the hands of the military, which is what many people want.",
