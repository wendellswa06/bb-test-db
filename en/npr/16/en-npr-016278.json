        "The U.S.",
        "and Russia have the vast, vast majority of nuclear weapons.",
        "And if an agreement like this fails, the next in line might be the new START treaty, which limits the number of nuclear warheads the two nations can have.",

        "It can be extended for another five years, but the Trump administration has given no sign that it has any intention of doing that.",
