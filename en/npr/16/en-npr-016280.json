        "Because, as we're about to hear, floating asparagus contributed to Darwin's theory.",
        "This true story can now be told by NPR's Robert Krulwich.",
        "A hundred and fifty years ago, when people asked how come you can go to Australia and there are kangaroos hopping, hopping around everywhere - but you go to places that look almost exactly the same, say on grasslands in Africa - and there are no kangaroos?"

        "Now, why is that?",
        "Why don't the same kinds of places have the same kinds of animals?",
        "Well 150 years ago, there was an answer.",
        "It was simple one, says science writer David Quammen.",
        "God has made kangaroos and put them in Australia.",
        "So God did it.",
        "He decided?",
        "That was what He wanted to do.",
        "God created every species individually and put them down wherever they are.",
        "And actually I call that special creation plus special delivery.",
        "So that was the explanation.",
        "Even among some of the most learned people around.",
        "But then, says Quammen…",
        "Darwin came along and said wait a minute, I don't think that's the explanation.",
        "I think these things all evolved from common ancestors.",
        "So the reason you find kangaroos only in Australia and New Guinea, he said, it's not God's doing - it's because the earliest kangaroo ancestors evolved there and then they spread out but they couldn't get across the water that surrounds Australia.",
        "They went about as far as they could go.",
        "Every plant, every animal that you see, Darwin proposed, got where it is today, on its own.",
        "Animals and plants must disburse.",
        "They must be capable of disbursing in order to explain what we see on the planet by way of evolution.",
        "So it was critical to Darwin's theory to show how living things got to where they are today.",
        "And this can get kind of tricky.",
        "For example, cabbages - you can find cabbage plants on islands near Antarctica.",
        "Now, how would a cabbage get there?",
        "Well, either God put it there, or it got there on its own."
