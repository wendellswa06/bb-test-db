        "Chavez and his cohorts were outraged by the social inequality in Venezuela.",
        "It's an oil-rich country and yet most of that wealth was controlled by a very small, elite, ruling class.",
        "At the same time, you had millions of poor people living in shacks and barely making enough to eat.",
        "So Chavez and his cohorts in 1992 launched an coup against the president at the time, Carlos Andres Perez.",
        "The coup fails militarily but it succeeds politically.",
        "Chavez who is unknown up until that time becomes a hero to all these poor people in the slums who are happy that someone has risen up against this what they view as a corrupt government.",
        "Three years prior to that, there were - there was a huge massacre in Venezuela in which the government literally mowed down hundreds if not several thousand people in the streets after food riots broke out following the implementation of an IMF economic shock program.",
        "So Chavez had widespread support fro this 1992 coup.",
        "He goes to jail for two years, gets out, spends several years crisscrossing the country, trying to kind of figure out what to do next, but in 1998, runs for president.",
        "He runs against a six-foot-one blonde, former Miss Universe.",
        "This campaign was known as the beauty and the beast, and obviously Chavez was the beast.",
        "The former Miss Universe was actually a very popular politician in Venezuela at that time.",
        "Venezuela is the beauty queen capital of the world and people take it very seriously down there.",
        "And she was actually doing a pretty good job of running the district of Caracas at that time.",
        "So Chavez wins the election, obviously, in 1998, and goes on to become president.",
        "Such really his life just up until a time he becomes president, all this kind of life and death action which even if you really despise Hugo Chavez, I don't think you can deny that his life has been really quite fascinating.",
        "He's…",
        "I'll probably just going to ask, some people draw a parallel between him and another former pretty decent ballplayer named Fidel Castro.",
        "That's exactly right - many people do and, however, I think it's fair to point out that there were some clear differences between Chavez and Castro.",
        "In Venezuela, people - thousands of people take to the streets to protest against Chavez.",
        "That doesn't happen in Cuba.",
        "People go on television and called Chavez a dictator.",
        "Again, this is not something that goes on in Cuba.",
        "He has been conducting free and fair elections in Venezuela and actually lost last December in a national referendum and accepted the results.",
        "So that's really not quite the type of thing that a dictator normally does.",
        "Though the election - the basic question of the election was can I be president for life.",
        "That's right.",
        "That was one of the essential questions and Chavez clearly does not dislike power.",
        "I mean, he likes being there, but the people said no. And Chavez up until now, at least, is abiding by their votes.",
        "So there are some differences with Castro.",
        "There are obviously some similarities too.",
        "The both say and claim they are fighting for social justice in their countries and trying to empower these masses of poor people, which have been left out of Venezuela's oil wealth for decades.",
        "In public, he sometimes comes across as flamboyant.",
        "He's sometimes bombastic.",
        "You've had the opportunity to meet with him privately to interview him, and what's he like in person?"

        "Well, he's not quite as flamboyant in person.",
        "You know, he really does kind of change when he gets up in front of 50,000 people, and the rhetoric is quite fiery.",
        "In person, Chavez is really much more of reflective and soft-spoken.",
        "I was able to interview him twice over two-day period last year, in the presidential plane, in palace.",
        "And he's a much more kind of thoughtful guy than he might appear to be sometimes in public and some of these are very incendiary rhetoric.",
        "And again, while we focus a lot on his confrontations with the United States and particularly with President Bush, he's had a lot of confrontations with his neighboring country, Colombia.",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "Chavez ran into some conflict with Colombia over the negotiations of hostages being held there by the leftist guerrillas, the FARC.",
        "Just when it seemed that Chavez was on the verge of winning the release of three of these hostages, President Uribe in Colombia kind of pulled the plug on it due to some conflicts they were having.",
        "So, you know, there are things that really heated up with Colombia.",
        "And again, though, I might, you know, I think we might want to mention here, you know, Chavez is always kind of seen as the bad guy.",
        "And you know, he certainly has some flaws that's quite apparent.",
        "And yet, you know, you never really hear about President Uribe and his government's apparent ties with paramilitary death squads.",
        "You know, there's no evidence at all that Chavez is involved in anything like that.",
        "And yet he seems to be the guy with this international image of this evil monster who's destroying democracy in Venezuela.",
        "Well, does - is that an accurate representation?",
        "Is there democracy in Venezuela, where you mentioned the election last year, but other people have called him a bully?",
        "Well, I think, if we look at some of the basic definitions of democracy, there is a functioning democracy in Venezuela.",
        "And even some top U.S.",
        "officials have recognized that the elections are free and fair.",
        "I mean, I don't think we can deny that at this point, Chavez lost last December and accepted the results so that would indicate that these elections are fair.",
        "As I mentioned, you know, people go on television and call him a dictator and nothing really happens.",
        "So there is certainly a generally free press in Venezuela, free elections.",
        "There's no doubt that Chavez is a strong president, however, let's not fool ourselves, and does have a large amount of power in Venezuela.",
        "But I think, to call him a dictator really doesn't fit the reality or the definition of a dictatorship.",
        "And let me ask about his economic policies.",
        "He has nationalized some of the holdings there and this is the basis, I guess, of the dispute with ExxonMobil, is the way he treats the oil industry; also has the - have the benefits of, well, oil has been at record-high prices for the last couple of years.",
        "Have does benefits actually flowed to the poor?",
        "Has their lot improved?",
        "That philosophy gets extended and seeing a decentralized government apparatus that is not top-down issuing dictates delivering unto the people but organizing networks of various scales across the nation, across the distinct communities to engage in changing the quality of their lives.",
        "Well, right, I mean, on the first question, again, there was a lot of hysteria when Chavez made these moves against the oil companies last year.",
        "However, Venezuela's had nationalized the oil since 1976, so he wasn't really taking over the oil industry.",
        "What he was doing was saying that in these joint projects we have with some international companies, we want to be the majority owner in these projects.",
        "So he was not throwing them out of the country, he was saying that we want to majority control and we will compensate you for any losses that may take place as part of that process.",
        "So again, a little bit different than him simply seizing and expropriating with out any compensation."

        "They have launched education programs in the poor barrios and slums where they have taught 1.5 million people to read and write.",
        "And they have also stationed Cuban doctors in these poor neighborhoods where they live and provide preventative medical care 24 hours a day.",

        "He may well, however, they have also banked some of this oil money, you know, for a rainy day.",

        "It was the major exporter by 1928.",
