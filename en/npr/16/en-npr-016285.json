        "Bart Jones, can you help you us out there?",
        "Well, this is not anything new really in Venezuelan history.",
        "Many other presidents have also set controls on prices of main - food basics down there.",
        "Once again, though, when Chavez does it, it becomes a controversy.",
        "You know, he's the evil guy again.",
        "We see this kind of double standard when it comes to him.",
        "But you know, he and many others have done it.",
        "It you know, it has certainly created some problems down there, though, there have been shortages of some basic food goods down there - milk, sugar, eggs - things like that.",
        "And I think the government is now beginning to backtrack on some of these food price controls, lifting some of the controls on milk, for instance, in order to try to get it back on the shelves.",
        "So, you know, he has implanted some economic policies which have not helped the country certainly.",
        "And his opponents will point that out.",
        "I just wanted to mention, too, on the referendum issue.",
        "Again, this was not voting Chavez in the office for life.",
        "He would have had to stand for reelection each time in a free and fair election.",
        "And he could also have been recalled at any time half way through his term.",
        "He and his allies actually put into the 1999 constitution, a recall mechanism where if enough petitions are signed by people, they can put the president up to a vote and basically throw him out of office.",
        "So he would not have been, you know, reelected for life, he would have had to continue to…",
        "To enter period reelections.",
        "Yeah, just to be fair about it and accurate and about it.",
        "That's how it would have been."

        "What does he like?",
        "He's a very affable guy.",
        "One meeting him personally as opposed to seeing him on stage, you get a different measure of the man.",
        "He's an organic intellectual as I have often described him which means that he is someone who reads constantly and reads very widely.",
        "So he's a very engaging personality about substantive issues to hear him quote 10 to 12 Latin American poets and novelists without a piece of paper is quite an impressive feat for a head of state who is preoccupied with the daily business of politics.",
        "But it's an indication of his very broad reading.",
        "And I know that you've had some philosophical discussions with him, as well.",
        "What - can you characterize his philosophy?",
        "Well, I think you've heard accurately described by the previous people that you've interviewed that from a philosophical view, he's a man of very deep humanistic perspectives, which means that he is very concerned and engaged with the state of the most marginalized citizens.",
        "But I think one needs to expand that he himself have stated quite frequently publicly that this is not a manner of Christian charity, it's a manner recognizing the capacity inherent in each individual not withstanding how marginalized or what they're suffering state might be, to act on their own and to collaborate with officials of government to change their lives, not for government to change their lives for them.",
        "And that's a different construct of democracy, if you will, which is it encapsulated in the phrase that you see emerging across Latin America, not a result of Hugo Chavez.",
        "It actually predates Hugo Chavez, and that is the construct of participatory democracy, a construct that even here today in Cuba, which means that, again, the capacity of citizens to be creative to envision possibilities to do things in collaboration with officials, is very much the humanistic philosophy that then forms his ideological outlook as well as the political policies unfolding."

        "Indeed, people do have access or that is an optic through which people look at Venezuela.",
        "But I think beyond the deeds of Joe Kennedy in this regard, people again need to look at the broader participatory dimensions.",
        "Obviously, Joe Kennedy just cannot show up in a community in a particular state identify on his own, someone who should be the recipient of this.",
        "It means that people on the ground, people like Charlie Rangel in New York City…"

        "Well, I would like to comment on those issues, I mean, because one of the problems with, you know, about talking about Chavez as you said yourself that, you know, is a larger than life persona and he produces very polarized mages of Venezuela and also of himself.",
        "And I think, it's important to have a more nuance, understanding, a more complete understanding of what's happening in Venezuela.",
        "You know, on the one hand, one can appreciate the fact that there's the mobilization and popular participation.",
        "And the previous caller talked about, you know, her enthusiastic appreciation of how people are very involved in what's happening in Carora in Venezuela and also how you could watch, you know, the television station whose license was closed down in bars.",

        "But most Venezuelans cannot watch it any more.",
        "And it terms of, you know, popular participation that James Early, you know, adequately, emphasized that one of the, you know, the major goals of the Chavez regime is participatory democracy.",

        "It was not, you know, if it was based on popular consultation, it would not have been closed down.",

        "He did replace the judges, and he did it, I mean, in fact, the judges were nominated largely after the coup, there was an expansion of the judges because the, you know, the supreme court was first nominated by people who are very closely connected with the, you know, the Chavez government which had actually placed in key positions.",
        "Many people who support the government, so in terms of the foremost - I mean, the formal separation of powers in Venezuelan - that says it lacked democracy but in terms of the political affiliations of the people who are, you know, in those positions, they intent to be supporters of the government.",
        "And in the particular case of the supreme court, many of the people had been appointed by Luis Miquilena who was one of the major leaders of Chavez and tutor of - personal tutor of Chavez when he was in - before he became president.",
