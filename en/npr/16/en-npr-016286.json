        "And the devices that you build with them are quite a bit larger also because they involve electrodes and dialectrics(ph) and other components.",
        "So there's a range of size scales involved in the devices.",
        "And then, you know, several of those devices are assembled together to make the radio.",

        "The active components are quite a bit smaller.",
        "But, you know, when you think about a radio, you got to have an antenna.",

        "I mean, we're focused on the nanotube transistors themselves in showing that we could make amplifiers with gain and mixers and filters and so on.",
        "But the radio that we demonstrated, because, you know, we weren't focused on building a new kind of radio per se or a nanoscale radio, we actually assembled the other components of the, you know, final device, the resistors, capacitors, inductors, using a breadboard that we obtained at RadioShack.",

        "This is the first nanotube transistor radio.",
        "The area of nanotubes is a highly competitive field.",
        "There are many groups worldwide that are working on nanotubes and trying to integrate them into electronics.",
