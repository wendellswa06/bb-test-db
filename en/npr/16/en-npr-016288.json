        "And I think, you know, from our standpoint, this paper is most significant in that sense is that it really demonstrates a realistic way to exploit tubes in circuits in a manner that fully, you know, takes advantage of their, you know, remarkable, intrinsic electronic properties.",
        "And again, you know, the radio is just a demonstration of, you know, where we are in the state of development of the technology.",
        "In terms of the actual devices - and they're size scale and their performance - it's about where silicon was 15 years ago, in terms of the size scale.",
        "We don't think there's any fundamental reason why you can't, you know, push it to much higher levels of performances.",

        "Yeah.",
        "And they were a crystal - called crystal radios, and they called it cat's whisker because it had a little whisker that you pushed on top of the crystal to make the contact.",
        "And it didn't have any batteries or anything in it.",
        "It uses - it used the electricity from the radio signal itself.",
        "That's right, yeah.",
        "You can build a radio without an amplifier.",
        "I mean, ours incorporates an amplifier, so…",
        "Yeah.",
        "…you know, it produces a pretty, pretty audible, you know, loud output if you want that.",

        "And you're right, they don't have to be very sophisticated.",
        "You can listen to the radio waves directly that way.",
        "Now, in the silicon world, when you build a transistor, you put down a layer of semiconductor silicon material and you sort of etch into it the circuit board on top.",
        "That's true.",
        "Is that what you do in the nanotube world?",
        "Well, almost.",
        "And so, you know, the reason why it's taken 15 years to sort of get to the point that we are now is that it's very difficult to control where the tubes are growing, you know?",
        "So the tubes are great.",
        "You know, a lot of their, you know, remarkable property is derived from their nanoscale dimensions.",
        "But ultimately, you have to build a device that interfaces with humans, you know, at human scale dimensions.",
        "And figuring out how to go from the nanotubes in their usually as grown configuration, which is quite frankly a tangled rat's nest of tubes, to something that's more coherent and rational that would allow sort of scalable integration into circuits is a big challenge."

        "So the way that we've tackled that problem - we've been working on it for a while.",
        "And we really just kind of, by chance, stumbled onto to a solution is to grow the nanotubes on a crystalline wafer that kind of guides their orientation.",
        "So when we grow on a quartz wafer, in fact, the tubes, instead of growing in this kind of rat's nest will grow in perfectly linear, perfectly aligned arrays, sitting on the surface of the quartz, you know, over the entire wafer in a single growth step.",
        "And so once you've grown the nanotubes in that configuration, you don't care that much that they're nanoscale in dimension anymore.",
        "You view that aligned array of tubes as a uniform thin film of a semiconductor material that, you know, has properties that are much better than silicon, and therefore, the interest in it.",
        "And so once you've grown these aligned arrays, the rest of the processing to build circuits and devices and systems looks pretty similar to the way that you would process silicon in a sense that, you know, you deposit your metal, you put your dialectric down, you can etch away the nanotubes where you don't want them, you can do all the kind of photolithography processing that has been built up around silicon technology over the years, and really do things in a batched process, in a really sort of rational engineering controlled manner.",
        "Now, you made two interesting points - let me get to both of them.",
        "One, you said that have advantages over silicon.",
        "What do nanotubes have advantages?",
        "Well, they're charge-carrier mobility is quite a bit higher.",
        "And so this was made clear, I think a few years ago, by a group at Intel.",
        "I got - I have to put a jargon alert in here.",
        "Okay.",
        "I'm going to explain on the mobility, so I'll get to that.",

        "(Soundbite of bell ringing)",
        "That's the jargon - it's our jargon alert.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "...where they kind of benchmarked all, you know, different kinds of nanomaterials against silicon.",
        "Of course, they're interested in, you know, what comes after silicon.",
        "And they found that, you know, of the nanomaterials that they investigated at that time, carbon nanotubes were the one clear example of a class of nanomaterial that significantly outperformed silicon.",
        "And when I mention charge carrier mobility, basically, it tells you for a given device geometry, how fast can you switch it on and off?"

        "Yes.",
        "And that switching speed - and together with the overall current output is telling you, you know, what level of sophistication you can achieve in terms of a circuit system.",
        "And the intrinsic mobility, that parameter that determines speed is about a factor of 10 higher than silicon.",
        "And so there's a general belief that if you can figure out a way to build circuits out of nanotubes, there would be advantages than over silicon.",
        "And I think, you know, what we've tried to do is take a step down that path, to really build nanotubes out as in engineering level, you know, electronic material for next-generation circuits.",
        "And so I think we've taken a, you know, important step in that direction.",
        "There's still a lot of challenges and, you know, a lot of work that still needs to be done.",
        "But at least it begins to look like something that's not, you know, science project.",
        "You know, it begins to look like a piece of technology.",
        "And where we think we really begin to get some traction here is we have the tubes now in a configuration that we can hand it off to electrical engineers such as our collaborators at Northrop Grumman, who know everything about RF electronics, can actually build radios and other kind of communication devices.",
        "And I think when you get to that level, you've moved the ball forward in kind of a qualitative way and moved it into the hands of the people that need to work with that material if you ever want to achieve a sort of commercial level success.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "You also said something that you stumbled on this by accident.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So, you know what, I think a sort of random discovery, at least in my lab, it's sometimes a good thing, you know?",
        "And so I always tell my students, you know, the way to be successful is to stay active in the lab and be observant of what's going on.",
        "And so in this particular case, I have a student who was growing nanotubes in the standard, you know, rat's nest configuration.",
        "We're growing it on quartz because we were doing a laser type of processing of the tubes, where you can shine high-powered laser pulses through the tubes to burn them out.",
        "And we try to selectively burn certain kinds of tubes.",
        "And we decided we had to grow on quartz because we wanted a substrate that was highly transparent to the laser that we were using.",
        "So we're growing on quartz.",
        "And you'll see mostly the rat's nest.",
        "A student came by one day with, you know, a micrograph image of a certain region of that quartz substrate where he pointed out that the tubes were aligned.",
        "And we thought, well, that - yeah, that's kind of neat.",
        "And we begin to work on it.",
        "And, you know, two years later, we had fully optimized and developed a, you know, a good level of understanding of what was going on and it becomes a platform for, you know, doing circuits and the sorts of things that we describe in this paper.",
        "So you basically have discovered and created the template that everybody now can use to use nanotubes to create devices.",
        "Well, we think so, you know?",
        "And I think our work demonstrates that we now ship out wafers to other people around the world.",
        "We, you know, we've hosted people who've come here and learned the growth techniques.",
        "People from Northrop Grumman for example have come here and they've learned how to do it.",
        "Our collaborators, Motorola learned how to do it and take it back to their own labs.",
