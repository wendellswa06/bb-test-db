        "Well, so this is a very interesting question.",

        "So you can make a useful RF analog circuit that has hundred transistors, whereas in digital logic, you'd have to build hundred million transistors to make something that's competitive.",

        "Having said that, we receive funding from Intel, and we do digital logic.",

        "So in many orders of magnitude from a pentium(ph), for example, but, you know, kind of trying to move the ball in that direction as well.",
