        "Now I knew too, but I didn't start acting crazy.",
        "And I didn't cry and scream like Mommy.",

        "And I have to be honest with you that it was, in a way, hard to get through because every couple of pages, you know, my eyes would fill with tears.",
        "And one of the things I think that stands out for me is that these people are not, you know, all perfect people.",

        "And their grief is going to make them do things that they wouldn't want to do, but they're grieving.",
        "And they're terrified.",
        "And sometimes they're lashing out.",
        "In art, just as in journalism, sometimes there's a line between observing something and being felt to be exploiting it.",
        "And I wondered if you considered that in any way that you might be exploiting something that you have not, thankfully, had to experience yourself.",
        "You know, I - especially, obviously, in the last few days, that's been very much at the top of my mind.",
        "You know, when I wrote this story, I had the hope that by telling the story, I could share my journey with other parents who have the same kind of fears and worries that I have.",
        "But of course I am very sensitive to the fact that it could be seen as me trying to exploit, you know, a tragedy.",
        "But I feel this incredible sense of urgency that I want to be helpful to hopefully change.",
        "And to that end, that was going to be my question.",
        "What do you think you learned as a result of taking yourself on this journey?",
        "Is there something that you would hope people would draw from this?",
        "I hope that the story that I told and that the perspective that I chose will remind all of us - I know it reminded me tremendously - of kind of the emotional depth and wisdom that our children and our young people possess and that they have to share if we take the time to listen.",
        "And I hope that after my readers grieve with Zach and his family that they come out at the other end and that they feel hope and that they discover that there is a chance that we can heal together and move forward and create a safer future for our children.",
        "And I think it really begins with our children, that we take the time to listen, hear their voices, have them help guide us and support them - that we come together and we support our children."
