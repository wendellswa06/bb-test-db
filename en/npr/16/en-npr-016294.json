        "Now, as we said, Kadima will not be able to form a government of its own, what might that coalition look like?",
        "Well, it's early, but they're almost certain to reach out and try and form a coalition with Labor, but they'll still need support of at least one or two smaller parties in order to form a majority.",
        "Perhaps Kadima would join with one of the smaller leftist parties such as Merit, whose leader tonight said they were open to joining Kadima, but \"\"not at any price.\"\" And Kadima's strategists tonight said the Pensioner's Party, this new group advocating increased benefits for the elderly, would be a natural coalition partner.",

        "David Greene, is the president thinking about David Souter perhaps, one of his father's court picks, who, it's claimed, drifted to the left on the bench?",
        "Well, Alex, I think we have every reason to believe that, except for the president actually coming out and saying it.",
        "It seems that was the worry this morning from the White House, that conservatives might view this nominee as another Souter, especially because they just don't know anything about her.",
        "And conservatives seem very edgy about the nomination.",
        "And the president came into this news conference--the question was what could he do to reassure them.",
        "He's certainly not going to talk about her views on abortion or other views that might make them happy.",
        "So the message he could give was, `Trust me.",

        "He would bring it up himself sometimes.",
        "And another reassurance was, `She's not going to change over time,' and that, of course, was the big worry among conservatives who look at Souter and think that he is no longer an ally.",
        "The funniest moment was when a reporter specifically asked about David Souter and whether that nomination, in retrospect, was a mistake.",
        "The president said, `You're trying to get me in trouble with my father?",
        "and suggested, you know, `You better call him yourself.'",
        "All right.",
        "Well, he was asked about abortion and about Harriet Miers, his White House counsel.",
        "And the question was: Did you ever talk to Harriet Miers privately, in a private conversation, not having to do with her Supreme Court nomination, but privately about abortion anytime in the past?",
        "Here's what the president said.",
        "I have no litmus test.",
        "That's also something I've consistently said.",
        "There is no litmus test.",
        "What matters to me is her judicial philosophy, what does she believe the proper role of the judiciary is relative to the legislative and the executive branch.",
        "David, that's not really an answer to the question, is it?",
        "Not really.",
        "And `litmus test' is one of the president's buzz phrases that he'll bring up time and time again when talking about judicial nominations.",
        "And, you know, reporters pressed him on the question, said, `You know, since you two are so close, as you say, you must have spoken about abortion at some point.",
        "The president slipped around that question, said he'd never ask a nominee in an interview about abortion.",
        "And reporters pressed a little more and said, `Come on, you have private conversations.",
        "Didn't the topic come up?",
        "He finally said, you know, `I've never sat down with her.",
        "And it was in a bit of the kind of speak that the president often uses.",
        "I think what he meant was, `I've never sat down with her to discuss this topic' so that the question of whether he's ever spoken to her about the topic of abortion is still an open question.",
        "Of course, bringing up his relationship with Harriet Miers and how well he knows her in a strange way fed into the criticism coming from the other side, which is that this nomination had a lot to do with cronyism, and the president had to respond to that as well and reassure Americans that Harriet Miers was viewed by him and by this White House as the best qualified person and that it was not about the friendship that he keeps stressing."

        "Now remember the church attorneys in this case said that because of church governance, because the canon law says that parishes are separate from the archdiocese and they are stand-alone entities, that that means that it would be a violation of the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act if a judge were in this case to say that parishes are subject to liquidation.",
        "The judge now has said that the question of who owns the property is quite simply not a matter of theology, and that has ramifications for every diocese across the country."
