        "We are a national organization supporting beginning farmers from coast to coast.",

        "So this is a very pertinent issue to us, which I know you've been discussing.",
        "And, Pete, I just want to say thank you for your work on the Colorado River.",
        "And as an organization, we support conservation of our crucial water resources here in the West, and really hope that we can work together as farmers and consumers in cities and rural communities to conserve the Colorado River.",
        "Is that one of the things you try to teach young farmers, how to conserve, how to use that water better?",
        "You know, the thing with young and beginning farmers these days is that we're already inclined toward conversation.",
        "We tend to use water-efficient irrigation systems and really look for soil health and other management techniques to improve water efficiency.",
        "So it's definitely on our radar.",
        "Kate, thanks very much, and good luck.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Pete McBride, is water wasted in the Colorado River?",
        "I believe it is.",
        "There are plenty areas where we could be more efficient.",
        "And I grew up with an agricultural background in Colorado, so I'm a supporter of ag.",
        "But I think ag takes about 70 to 80 percent of the river, and we can find much greater efficiencies with that.",
        "My big questions around that are: What are the most important crops we should be using that water towards?",
        "We want to eat locally.",
        "But, for instance, we grow a lot of cotton in the Colorado River Basin.",
        "Could we be growing that cotton elsewhere, where water isn't such - in such shortage?",
        "And I think just to add on to that, what I think I don't hear very often is: Have we reached the carrying capacity for the Southwest in terms of water?",
        "And I don't hear people raise that.",
        "Everyone either thinks we have enough water and we can find more efficiencies and more infrastructure to solve this problem, or we're just going to start augmenting through desalinization or piping in water from other rivers.",
        "And I just wonder if that's always - if we need to start addressing the population."

        "And when we bought our house, we also acquired an 1889 water right.",
        "Our ditch is over 100 years old.",
        "It's carried about the same amount of water since the last rights were granted in 1926.",
        "And then a few years ago, a neighbor below me who doesn't really live in the county - he just owns property here - he bought some water rights.",
        "He had new water rights created by the court, and his capacity is about five times what mine is.",
        "And I have ample to supply my garden and orchard, and I have water left over.",
        "So he's bought up this incredible water right, had it created out of thin air and money.",
        "And I just wanted to point out, that's an interesting dynamic.",
        "When we're talking about drought, I think my neighbor has positioned himself for an investment.",
        "It's certainly not used for agriculture or things like that on his land.",
        "Can those sorts of things be transferred?",
        "Can he sell that water?",

        "But I just wanted to comment that we are up here.",
        "We're actually going in the opposite direction of where we should be going.",
        "We have an unincorporated town that's 10 miles west of Vail.",
        "And oddly enough, they have three new roundabouts that they just switched from xeriscaping drought tolerant to installing sod and perennials, because the locals complained that they didn't like the xeriscaping.",

        "I'm saddened to hear about that change of direction of xeriscaping - smartscaping, as it's called in some places.",

        "American rivers listed the Colorado River this year as the most endangered river in the country to try to raise awareness.",

        "It was historic and maybe a little awkward.",

        "It's not just the tenants of the White House that are changing.",

        "So Senator Obama hasn't been particularly supportive of President Bush's administration.",
        "He's referred to eight failed years of policy when he was on the campaign trail.",
        "But now he said it's time to put politics aside and given what's been going on in the tensions between these two men and their philosophies, what kind of transition can we expect?",
        "I think we're going to see a relatively orderly transition.",
        "This is something we've come to be spoiled about in the United States because compared to most countries in the world, our system almost celebrates the transfer of power as a kind of happy ritual in which we are glad that we don't have any more contentious back-and-forth and tests of power and strength to get there.",
        "On the other hand we have seen - for example the year 2000 - that it can take a little longer than the system is set up to normally expect, and under circumstances such as those eight years ago, of course it took five weeks to determine the winner of the presidential election.",
        "Then it can be strained and truly difficult, particularly when you have a change of power between the two parties.",
        "But I think given the economic situation the country's in right now, the financial meltdown, also the two wars that are continuing, the rather large number of people - six figures - who are in combat around the world for the United States, in times such as these the transition really needs to be as cordial and as respectful and as orderly as possible.",
        "What about rollbacks of policies?",
        "Because there are a lot of different policy approaches, everything from big ones like the Guantanamo prison camps in Cuba to smaller ones that Senator Obama disagrees with.",
        "What do you think he's going to focus on changing, say within the first hundred days of his term?",
        "The first thing he'll need to do is to look down a list which is being prepared even now of executive orders that have changed federal policy over the last eight years.",
        "These are things the president can do on his own.",
        "Things the president can do without asking Congress for anything, for authority, for money, for confirmation of an appointment.",
        "So when the president can simply say, the federal government will now do X, or Y or Z, or the opposite of what it had been doing, wherever that's possible that's the first place where a president can have some impact and it's also sometimes the last place a president can have some impact.",
        "In the final weeks of this presidency we expect George W.",
        "Bush to try to issue a lot of executive orders to set certain policies in place, and those will probably be among the first ones that Barack Obama tries to reverse starting January 21st, the day after he takes the oath of office.",
        "Christopher, thanks.",
        "One of the big ones is the treatment of federal research dollars that go for supporting research to attack certain diseases.",
        "Those dollars have been prohibited up to now by the Bush administration from going to any research that's based on stem cells taken from human embryos.",
        "If human embryos were involved, the Bush administration did not want that research to go forward because it destroyed those human embryos which potentially - although most of them were on their way to being destroyed as medical waste - potentially, those could develop into human beings.",
        "So the Bush administration took the view that that was a kind of sacrifice of life, and therefore they didn't want to fund with federal money any such research."

        "So they went forward, of course, with private money.",
        "And the Bush administration was more than willing to fund stem cell research as long as the stem cells came from some other source other than human embryos.",
        "That is a controversial position because, of course, it greatly restricts the amount of research that can go on in an area that many scientists regard as highly promising to cure many different diseases.",

        "Yes I do.",
