        "Well, you know, for me, I knew that the 1984 Olympics were really going to be my swan song, that afterwards I didn't really have a way to support myself.",
        "This is in the days of true amateurism.",
        "And I knew that my - the next step in my life was going to have something to do with academics.",
        "I still had a year and a half left of college at Duke University, and so, you know, I - in my mind, I always knew that was next.",
        "What's difficult about going from being very, very, very good at something, being blessed and graced and feeling strength and pride in what you're doing is finding something else that is worth giving yourself over to.",
        "And for me and for most other athletes, that is the hard part.",
        "First of all, what's worth it?",
        "And then two is just the struggle of starting at the bottom and not knowing if you're really going to become good enough at something that you feel that same graced quality that you do when you're really good at something.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I love that way you just put it, that same graced quality, which maybe something that not all of us experience, at least to the heights that an athlete does, particularly at something like the Olympic Games.",
        "And there are certain sports, of course, that really we only see - we the public only see during the Olympics or pay attention to during the Olympics, whereas people have been laboring in obscurity for years to get there.",
        "And I wonder for young people in particular, who have worked so hard, and maybe they didn't, you know, get that gold medal and then they come back and they're - they're 18 years old.",
        "Maybe they didn't prepare for an academic career.",
        "Do you know of any stories where people have really had trouble adjusting?",
        "I'd say all of us have had trouble, honestly.",
        "I mean, it's something that when Olympic athletes get together, that we talk about, sort of that, you know, what's-next-for-us kind of a thing, that, you know, this is - Neil Armstrong really struggled with this after he was at the top of the moon.",
        "I mean even if you don't win in the Olympics, just to be on that level is a real - I just can't tell you the feeling of when you spend so - you know, Malcolm Gladwell talks about the 10,000 hours.",
        "And when you've got your 10,000 hours in, what that feels like to be at the top of your game and to really have it feel effortless and graceful and powerful and strong at the same time and then sort of having to find something else, I mean, I - in that Deadspin article, I talked about trying to get into broadcasting, much like you, Lynn.",
        "Oh, that's right.",
        "That's right.",
        "And I was terrible at it, primarily because, like, I didn't care who won and who lost.",
        "And that seems to be a part of, you know, the job criteria, is that you care about, you know, when you're commentating.",
        "Somebody like Rowdy Gaines, I mean, he is somebody who really has found his niche, his zen, his something.",
        "He's good at communicating his passion for the sport.",
        "He really does care who wins and loses.",
        "You got it, Farai."

        "And, you know, how do you find the second act?",
        "And that may apply to other endeavors, as well.",
        "So if you've had that experience of reaching a really high peak in something and then had to figure out what to do next, give us a call to join the conversation here.",
        "The number is 800-989-8255.",
        "And I was talking, Nancy, you know, athletes are so disciplined that I can't help but think that that discipline will ultimately help them even if they do go through a struggle right after, you know, they decide that they're going to leave athletic competition, that they can apply that to anything they do pretty much, huh?",
        "I - absolutely.",
        "I think that the discipline that you learn as part of athletics - there's actually a lot empirical research that backs that up.",
        "I'm now - I'm the senior director of advocacy for the Women's Sports Foundation, and there's a lot of - when you look at, kind of, the gestalt, the big picture of what it means for a girl just to play sports, not to be in the Olympics, but it is really powerful stuff.",
        "And I'd also say that, in my work at the Women's Sports Foundation, that so many other women athletes use their athletic career as a platform for giving back.",
        "I can't - the social good that Olympians are doing out there, trying to use their Olympic fame as a way to help so many causes from, you know, diseases to social causes to, you know, all kinds of things.",

        "We owe so many of those gold medals to all the background work that Benita does behind the scenes.",
        "So it sounds like you're saying you have to find another passion is really what you're saying.",
        "I mean, your passion is about women sports, you can - and you can channel all of that great energy and discipline you have into something the usual passion is about.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "You do have to start at the bottom, though, and that's hard.",
        "I mean, as any 22-year-old graduating college will tell you that, you know, and then you find something.",
