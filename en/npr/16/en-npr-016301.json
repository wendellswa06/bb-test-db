        "Well, they change quite a bit.",
        "But I decided that I wanted to pick people who were accomplished as writers, who wrote beautifully and meaningfully and passionately, but also people who had a great deal of influence on other writers and on readers as well.",
        "So those were my primary criteria.",
        "Consequently, the list ends up being fairly conservative and that they're all well-known writers.",
        "But that's because I thought they would have a broader influence on other writers and that they would be familiar.",
