        "The police were looking for him and wanted in connection with the murder of a police officer.",

        "We were around the same age.",
        "And so I started thinking to myself, so how does this happened?",
        "How do you get two kids from similar backgrounds and similar circumstances who - as I'm getting ready to head 3,000 miles away from home on a scholarship, he's getting ready to head 25 miles away from home to a maximum security facility for the rest of his life, and so I ended up reaching out to him.",
        "This is awhile ago, well before even the idea of a book came about.",
        "And really, what the book is it's an evolution of these two lives and what eventually happened that can happen that causes this split.",
        "And let's ask our audience.",
        "If you've read \"\"The Other Wes Moore,\"\" what lessons do you think it has for a freshmen read context?",
        "The number is 800-989-8255.",
        "If you haven't read, what suggestions do you have as a - something that would make a good freshmen read book: the idea of an entire incoming class reading a book together and then talking about it when they get to campus together?",
        "You can send us an email, talk@npr.org.",
        "Did you have a freshmen read when you went to Hopkins?",
        "You know, it's interesting, I didn't.",
        "And when I first started hearing that, you know, these - you know, dozens of schools are picking the book as a freshmen read, I remember asking my publisher, so what's a freshmen read?",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Yes.",
        "And he explained it, like that's when all the freshmen, you know, will pick a book and do something with it and then they'll have a Q&A with the author, et cetera.",
        "And it's interesting because when I first started hearing about these requests, I immediately thought to myself, you know, it's great.",
        "And, of course, I'll go do a Q&A with the students and that's fantastic.",
        "But the intent of the book is that I didn't want people simply to pick it up and throw it off to the side.",
        "I wanted people to see this is a much larger call to action.",
        "And so one of the things we've incorporated into the University of the Louisville, as Sirena was alluding to, and also other schools, is that for schools to pick the book up as a freshmen year, I'll obviously go visit, (unintelligible) with the students.",
        "But in the addition to that, we're doing service projects around the country with all the individual schools.",
        "And each one of them are individual and tailored to the demographic that the school finds itself in.",
        "So some people are focusing on education.",
        "One school is focusing on juvenile justice.",
        "One school is focusing on immigration issues.",
        "But all of them are doing a larger service project with their freshmen class.",

        "They know, you know, at a time like now in particular, to have an opportunity to attend a college university is just an extraordinary honor.",

        "You know, we received a letter - received thousands of letters - received a letter from a young man in Chapin, South Carolina, who got into a fight when he was in school, and then he got arrested for this fight.",

        "And - but he said, when the person turned around, he started flipping through the book.",

        "We were talking about Baltimore.",
        "And he said to me - he said back to me, he said, actually, I think we're products of our expectations.",

        "We're products of our expectations.",
