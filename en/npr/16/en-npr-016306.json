        "I end up someplace closer to the overall NPR audience, which as you said is pretty mixed.",
        "Because on the one hand, on the one hand I think it's right to publish this kind of documentation the way the mainstream media that WikiLeaks used to say it despised is doing, which is checking with the government about what's really sensitive, about redacting the names of people, cutting them out if they really would put somebody at risk, and that overall, us knowing more about what our government does is a good thing.",
        "But there's a necessary tension, and I'm coming from the standpoint of a journalist, and Mr. Baer's coming from the standpoint of a former government official.",
        "And there is a necessary tension between us.",
        "It's my job to try to get these documents loose.",
        "What I disagree with in terms of the WikiLeaks methodology is the recklessness of it.",
        "They're not about creating a rule-of-law process or making the Freedom of Information Act work, where you have that dialogue with the government, the government gets a chance to censor the stuff that would put anybody at risk.",
        "Well, let me try to make sure that I'm following the both of you because it sounds as if you agree and disagree at the same time.",
        "If I'm understanding you, Mr. Baer, you are opposed to the leaks of these documents on the basis that it does harm to the government and that the government has the right to withhold certain sensitive information.",
        "Is that a correct assessment of what your position is it?",
        "Not just a right.",
        "It has the necessity to withhold certain information.",

        "But one of the things this leak shows, in these 251,000 diplomatic cables now remember, we've only got 291 of them on the Web actually as of about 30 minutes ago, when I checked, and we have the excerpts and selections that the mainstream news people have put up.",
        "So we don't know the full dimensions of the problem.",
        "We've only got summaries of most of it by reporters who have tried to go through it.",
        "But one of the things I think we're going to conclude, when we come to the end of the process, is yet again, this leak proves that the government massively over-classifies information, that the system just is on a knee-jerk reflex to stamp secret on documents and that much of what even is in this release, should have, could have been out in public years ago.",
        "Let me come back to you, Bob Baer, to ask this question because of your stated position with regard to the release of these documents.",
        "Where do you draw the line on what should or should not be published?",
        "Oh, that's the difficult question, and that's the question we can't answer very well.",
        "There should be leaks out of the government.",
        "The government is - often acts incompetently or dishonestly, and the press needs to get that out.",

        "Let me go back to the WikiLeaks.",
        "I disagree with putting out messages about what the Chinese are telling us about North Korea.",
        "We depend upon the Chinese to protect our troops in Korea during these maneuvers, and the only real insight we have into Pyongyang is through China, is through Peking.",
        "And now the Chinese are going to be reluctant to talk to us, and that was a decision that WikiLeaks and The New York Times shouldn't have made.",
        "In this case, it should have been the government.",
        "And of course, the problem is the government is reluctant to release anything.",

        "I just take specific examples out of these WikiLeaks and point out how damaging they are and how truly unnecessary they are, the leaks, because most of this stuff we already knew.",
        "The embarrassment is that these Arab leaders or East Asian leaders, their opinions were put in the public domain, and they don't have any trust in us anymore.",

        "We understand what happened.",
        "And then...",
        "But China's a different situation.",
        "China's a different situation, and with the authoritarian countries it's a tougher call, but then somebody in the Turkish foreign ministry said, on background to some reporter: And you should see what we say about you in our cables.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Here's a question for you, Tom Blanton, since you are involved in trying to get information that the government doesn't want out, to get it out into the public domain.",
        "When you do that, as has been done in this case, is there not the danger, the ever-present danger, of collateral damage, diplomatically or otherwise?",

        "That goes to your very tough question.",

        "But there are some good common-sense approaches, and it was interesting to me to read The New York Times editors' notes and their back-and-forth with readers about where they draw the line because they say they draw the line - they're journalists, they have a code of ethics.",
        "It requires them to reach out to the other side of stories or the multiple sides of stories.",
        "It requires them to consult with government about these documents, about what damages.",
        "They say if it's a person identified who'd be at risk, if the documents say strictly protect this information source, if it's a negotiating bottom line before the negotiation, if it's a weapons system design, those are real secrets.",
        "Anybody would recognize them.",
        "Those should be withheld and, from these leaked documents, redacted.",
        "So The New York Times is in the censorship business, which is fascinating.",
        "But then they say: Where we don't draw the line is we won't cover official embarrassment.",
        "And there I think Bob Baer is on to something where he talks about that China document because it's extraordinary.",
        "It's the deputy secretary of state, Jim Steinberger(ph) Jim Steinberg, just a year ago meeting with a top state council guy in China, where they talk about North Korea.",
        "And I think there's a good argument The New York Times published it and addressed it directly when they said: We, you know, we believe this is of such importance to matters of war and peace that it should not just be discussed in secret."
