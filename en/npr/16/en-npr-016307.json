        "From what you know about this, and if you don't have enough time to answer it before we go to the break, I'll give you a chance to on the other side: Is the in the main, this material that we are seeing and hearing and hand-wringing over, is it that important?",
        "No, it's not that important.",

        "Well, before we take a call, and Matt(ph) in Fort Myers, Florida, hang on, we're coming to you next, before we take a call: How can you rely on the government to issue these kinds of documents when it takes, apparently, people like Mr. Stanton(ph) here or WikiLeaks in this instance to get out information that we might not otherwise have found out about?",
        "And I think this is I think there was some damage to that ability to have diplomatic communications, but I don't want to overstate that damage because back when the Freedom of Information Act was passed, this was one of the major arguments against it: Wait a second, no foreign country would talk to us anymore.",
        "And yet we made a judgment as a society that it was more important to keep our government accountable and have actual, public debate about questions of war and peace, than to leave them inside little compartments that would lead to things like the invasion of Iraq, for example.",

        "WikiLeaks has had a pretty interesting trajectory, and if you took them a year ago and today, you'd see two different modes of operation.",
        "A year ago, they were closer to the old anarchist model, like the guy who shot Archduke Ferdinand in 1914 in Sarajevo.",
        "You steal the secrets of the powerful, and you throw those secrets in those faces, and somehow that's going to bring down the system.",
        "That's the kind of anarchist view.",

        "It changed so WikiLeaks started working with mainstream media outfits to validate and check the information they were being given.",
