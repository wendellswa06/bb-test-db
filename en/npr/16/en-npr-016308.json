        "Well, other people if Bradley Manning, the Chinese version of Bradley Manning, the Army private who supposedly leaked these, if there was a Chinese version, he'd probably already have been shot.",
        "So it is a fact that open societies leak more than closed societies.",
        "And it sure would be nice for all of us to put more pressure on getting the stuff out of the Chinese side.",
        "And I have to say - and this is the counterargument, even on Bob Baer's example of that Chinese document that's going to make him so upset - it's so rare for the actual words of the authoritarian leaders of regimes like this to be out there and to be on the front pages, that in a way you can argue that that's a service, that that's a - it reduces their power to a certain degree.",
        "And it may turn out in the long run like the Tiananmen Papers leaked from inside China, like the transcripts we got loose through the Freedom of Information Act of Mao Tse-tung's meeting with Henry Kissinger.",
        "You know, our website got blocked in China because they didn't want the Chinese people to read what Mao Tse-tung had said and the deals he brokered.",
        "Well, let me bring Bob Baer in to get your comment, and Bart(ph) in Kansas, hold on.",
        "Your point is what we want to hit as well.",
        "What's your reaction to the suggestion, Bob Baer, that the United States is being specifically targeted by WikiLeaks with these kinds of disclosures?",
        "Well, I think it's - I don't think it's - I think they would have gone after Britain as well, but they've got a tighter hold on information.",
        "They're not as sloppy as we are, but we - you know, and I think it's a mistake to blame the press or The New York Times or anybody for releasing these documents.",
        "What we need to do is find a way to conduct secret diplomacy where we're avoiding the chances of this getting out.",
        "And let me be very specific.",
        "At some point, the West is going to decide whether it's going to go after Iran's nuclear weapons, its sites and bomb them.",

        "At no point, we should.",
        "But at some point, we're going to seek overflight clearance.",
        "And there's going to be diplomatic exchanges between Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and so forth, whether they're going to give these clearances.",
        "And does the public have the right to know, to read this traffic before a strike, putting our pilots in danger?",
        "And I think the answer - 90 percent of your listeners - will be no. They don't need to know, and probably also we don't need to attack Iran, but that's another question.",
        "Bob, hold on for a minute.",
        "We've got to do this.",
        "We are talking about WikiLeaks.",
        "Should the site have released that massive trove of secret government documents?",

        "These are documents that did not belong to an individual.",
        "They belonged to a government, OK?",
        "So taking them does not give you ownership and allow you to give to someone else to publish.",
        "I don't see why that's not - that's a huge point that's being missed, I think.",
        "Well, thank you for the call.",

        "And you, Tom Blanton, say that if they had done it the right way it would have been OK, but the way they did it makes it all wrong.",
        "No, to the extent that it was an attack, and I think in their anarchist mode, they meant it as an attack.",

        "I think in their journalism mode, that's a different matter, and that's something we're all working on.",
