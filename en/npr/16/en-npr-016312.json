        "You have come out, as well as the organization, very strongly against what we talked about in our first segment, and that is the nomination and the confirmation of Samuel Alito.",
        "Give me a sense of why you decided to take this perch?",
        "Well, I think the major civil rights organizations are fairly unified in this, that after looking very carefully at Sam Alito's record as a judge and as a lawyer, it's clear that he's not supportive of or sensitive to civil rights, civil liberty, voting rights and economic opportunity for all.",
        "And since he has been nominated to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who's cast crucial votes in close cases on the court, I think we concluded after a very careful review of his record that if he were, for example, on the courts when the Michigan case was heard, he would not have ruled in favor--or voted in favor of affirmative action.",
        "So I think we're compelled by principle to say to our constituency that after careful review, we do not believe the Senate should confirm him.",
        "Bruce, let me turn our attention quickly to the idea of what we saw you most recently in the news about and that, of course, was the execution of Stanley \"\"Tookie\"\" Williams.",
        "You took a very front and center position on that and you said the organization would indeed continue the fight.",
        "Talk to us about where you are.",
        "Well, we have facts that are very clear.",
        "We represent, as African-Americans in this country, roughly 12 percent to 13 percent of the population, yet 42 percent of folks on death row are African-Americans, which tells you that the criminal justice system and the application of the death penalty is biased in many regards.",
        "Stan Williams was a highly visible person who, among other things, demonstrated redemption while he was on death row, and that's why I think--one of the reasons why I think we've sent people to prison is to see whether they can correct their past sins.",
        "And even in that case, clemency was not granted.",
        "What we intend to do is to continue to seek on a state-by-state basis where the death penalty is legal a moratorium until it can be absolutely proven that there is no discrimination in the death penalty process, and that means I'm gonna monitor every single case in every single state and communicate with governors and other lawmakers until we get a turnaround in what is a--at this point in time a barbaric way of disciplining crime that is really exceptional in the world."

        "There are some disturbing movements on some of the commissions down there to suggest that some neighborhoods should not be rebuilt, and those neighborhoods just happen to be African-American neighborhoods.",
        "So the nation must focus on the fact that a rebuilding for the Gulf Coast has to be inclusive of neighborhoods.",
        "It's got to be inclusive of all workers having an opportunity to participate.",

        "But make no mistake about it, the Gulf Coast and New Orleans are still in crisis.",

        "Well, I'd like to see an organization that is substantially larger in membership than it currently is, just to demonstrate to those that we seem to influence that the vast majority of African-Americans in this country want civil rights to be front and center in national politics.",
        "One of the things that requires me to do is to spend a lot more time with that generation that we seek to include, and I've spent some time this weekend doing just that.",
        "What I find is that it's not just a matter--we accuse this generation of not being tuned into our history.",
        "I'm not satisfied that that's totally the case.",
        "I think the other issue that they're trying to sort out is how do they get engaged, what should they do, and how do they make sure that my organization and others are really focusing on issues that are relevant to them?",
        "They are entrepreneurial in spirit.",
        "They have a priority placed on economic justice.",
        "And these are things that are front and center, and what I think my organization has to do is to recognize those interests, engage these young folks in those interests and really build a much more active population of members that represents a much broader demographic.",
