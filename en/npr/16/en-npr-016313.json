        "DR. ARJUN SRINIVASAN: Thank you so much for having me.",
        "We heard in Rob Stein's piece that overprescribing antibiotics is one of the problems.",
        "What do you do about that?",
        "What do you tell doctors - or patients, for that matter?",
        "Well, there's a lot that we can do about that, fortunately.",
        "I think there's - obviously - a shared responsibility, both from patients and from doctors.",
        "As patients, we need to be informed consumers.",
        "We should never demand antibiotics when our doctors don't think we need them.",
        "And as medical providers, we need to consider very carefully, when we are writing a prescription for an antibiotic.",
        "We need to make sure that the patient actually needs the antibiotic.",
        "And if they do, we need to make sure that we're up on the latest information so we're giving exactly the right drug for - at exactly the right dose, for exactly the right time.",
        "And when an infection becomes increasingly drug-resistant, as we're seeing, what else can doctors do besides cutting back on prescribing antibiotics?",
        "Yeah, that's a great point that you're raising because there's a lot that can be done.",
        "In addition to improving the way we prescribe antibiotics, we need to improve the way we control infections, particularly in hospitals and other health-care settings.",
        "We can do a lot to prevent the spread of these organisms.",
        "And what we commonly see is that one patient will develop an infection with an antibiotic-resistant organism, but then that organism will get into the environment.",
        "It'll get onto the hands of health-care workers, and then it will be spread from one patient to another.",
        "So another very effective step is to ensure that we're following what we call good infection control in our health-care facilities.",
        "And that means starting with hand-washing; making sure people wash their hands, and use the alcohol-based hand sanitizer.",
        "It's encouraging people - requiring them to wear gowns and gloves, when those things are required.",
        "And what's been shown, time and time again, is that if we're very aggressive about following these measures, we can really reduce the spread of these organisms in health care.",
        "Dr.",
        "Srinivasan, do you agree with people who say that the practice of giving antibiotics to livestock - you know, putting it in the food chain - is contributing to this?",
        "Well, I think that it's a complex problem - anti-microbial resistance and the relationship between, you know, human use and agricultural use.",
        "And I think that while we need to improve the way we use antibiotics in livestock, we can't say that that's the exclusive solution to our problem.",
        "We know that there is a great deal of overuse of antibiotics in people as well.",
        "What about the role of drug companies in this?",
        "Are they doing enough to develop new drugs that would help with this problem?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, you know, in talking with people who are familiar with drug companies, I think what you often hear is that first and foremost, this is a very complex issue.",
        "It's not simple to develop new antibiotics.",
        "Another thing that you hear from drug companies is, of course, that these are drugs for which there is not a substantial profit margin.",
        "And as drug companies, they have shareholders to whom they are responsible, and they have a duty to try and develop drugs that are going to make money for their shareholders."

        "Would you say that there's a role for government in convincing the drug companies, through one form or another, that it's worth their while to come up with these antibiotics?",
        "I think there's a growing sense that all of us - it's a shared resource; you know, all of us need these antibiotics.",
        "We liken them to roads, in many ways.",
        "And as such, there needs to be a collaboration, if you will, between governments and between the drug companies, to try to solve this problem.",
        "And I think there's a growing sense that the only way we're going to really develop the number of new drugs that we need, is for government and industry - all of us - to work together.",

        "An immigration court says the men are al-Qaida operatives.",
        "Last week, though, a different court said the men could not be deported to Pakistan because they might be tortured there.",
        "NPR's Rob Gifford reports from London.",
        "In April of last year, 10 young Pakistani men were arrested on suspicion of plotting a bombing in Britain.",
        "In the end, because of lack of evidence, the men were never charged.",
        "Eight of them returned to Pakistan voluntarily.",
        "Two of them remained, and the British government tried to deport them.",
        "But last week the deportation ruling was overturned.",
        "The legal basis for allowing them to stay is the British Human Rights Act, a law brought in in 1998 which incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights into British law.",
        "It says no one can be returned to a country where they might be tortured.",
        "The case has caused uproar in Britain, not least within the Conservative Party.",
        "The Conservatives are committed to replacing the Human Rights Act with a British Bill of Rights that senior Conservative MP Bill Cash says would take British control back from the European Court in Strasbourg.",
        "We've just seen a very important case relating to extradition of people who one would have thought would not be able to be protected by the Human Rights Act.",
        "And the problem is that the laws there are determined in Strasbourg."

        "I raised a drug dog.",
        "Her name is Angel, and she is responsible for one of the highest money confiscations in the state of Maine.",
        "Ironic because Bowerman attributes so much of what put her in this prison camp to her drug addiction.",
        "It started at 12 with marijuana, then onto ecstasy.",
        "And then when she was 15, the daughter of her father's girlfriend gave her some meth.",
        "That led to years of partying on a lake in the resort town where they lived.",
        "Now I look back, and I have absolutely nothing to show for 45 of my years.",
