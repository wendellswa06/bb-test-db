        "Before we talk about the effects of the dispersants, briefly, can you tell us why BP chose to use the chemicals as a primary clean up method, given other options that are available?",
        "Well, partly, they use the chemicals because there weren't a lot of other options available.",
        "They did not have enough oil skimmers anywhere near the Gulf to clean this up by skimming it.",
        "Burning it was not really an option for a large-scale clean up.",
        "And so they were really desperate to do something, and chemical dispersants were fairly easy to use.",
        "They can drop them in with airplanes.",
        "And it also fit into their larger agenda of trying to downplay the severity of the spill.",
        "How do dispersants downplay that?",
        "Well, one of the virtues of dispersants is that they make the oil on the surface disappear.",
        "What they do is sort of break up the oil slicks into smaller particles of oil.",
        "But it also has big sort of political benefits in that you see less oil coming up onto the shore where it can be seen by television cameras and others.",
        "So, the dispersed oil sinks down from the surface.",
        "How do the chemicals affect the sea life under the water?",
        "And it's going to be much harder to quantify this damage.",
        "Now, the Food and Drug Administration has said that the chemical dispersants used to break up oil in the Gulf have a low potential for accumulating in seafood and do not pose a public health concern.",
        "What's your take on that?",
        "Is the food chain at risk?",
        "But it's going to play out in the coming months and years, not in, you know, the next week or two."

        "What suggestions would you give to the Environmental Protection Agency to better monitor and regulate the use of dispersants in the Gulf?",

        "This is the thing, even great coaches, you know, afterwards it turns out sometimes they have to give back some of their wins if they are involved in a recruiting scandal or Woody Hayes at Ohio State-Texas students, but never with Joe Paterno; the model of rectitude, a man who funded a library and was into the classics.",
        "And even though he directly did not do anything wrong, it just strikes people as an exemplar of morality like Joe Paterno, to do nothing about this is just stunning to some people.",
