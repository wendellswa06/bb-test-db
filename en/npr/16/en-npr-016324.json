        "And as I mentioned earlier, Ron Paul's latest book, a New York Times bestseller, has a simple and catchy title.",
        "It's called \"\"End the Fed.\"\" So when he becomes the sheriff who oversees the Federal Reserve, will it be his chance to do just that, to end it?",
        "Well, in a partial sense but not directly.",
        "In the Fed book, it concludes by saying that what I'm really asking for is competition, to get rid of the monopoly power of the Fed because they don't have legitimate power to do what they do, and the Constitution didn't justify it, and the Constitution mandates gold and silver as legal tender.",
        "Sure.",
        "That's actually an agglomeration of information that's been collected by a number of researchers over the last 20 years, and it's generally true for a very broad class of air pollutants and certainly true for those air pollutants we classify as toxic air pollutants or toxic air contaminants.",
        "The number two to five is sort of a generalization.",
        "Sometimes, the amount of indoor air pollution is even more than five times what it is outdoors, if we're engaged and certain activities indoors, or if we purchase a new home that's off casting a lot of these chemicals.",
        "And that number is not true for a smaller mist of pollutants like ozone, which generally exists in much lower levels indoors because when it comes indoors from outdoors, it's reduced by a chemical reacting with surfaces indoors.",
        "What are these leading toxins that we're talking about?",
        "Well, you know, things that are heavily regulated outdoors that we see it in higher levels indoors, things like benzene and toluene and styrene, formaldehyde, which you mentioned in your setup to this interview.",
        "It's just some examples, but there are literally hundreds of different chemicals that I could list here, and you probably don't want to go through the whole list."

        "Well, I…",
        "But those are some of the biggest.",
        "Well I guess the big - the take-home message that we talked before about is that if this was a public place or a place regulated - a workplace, there would be rules against you working in such conditions, but there are none in your home.",
        "Is that correct?",
        "That's true in some situations and for certain pollutants, that's correct, yeah.",
        "And of course, that would seem that somebody would actually enforce the workplace rules.",
        "Dr. Blanc?",
        "And, you know, the number of inspectors we have, it would take another hundred years for them to get to every person's workplace.",
        "So sometimes, these things are put into those terms, but it shouldn't be taken to belittle the true and real hazards that exists and still exists in the workplace.",
        "And in fact, many of the problems that we see in the home, we only know about them because the canaries in the cave where the people are exposed on the job.",
        "Tell us what you see in the home that are particularly troubling to you.",
        "Well, you know, one of the most common household chemical toxic problems reported to poison centers around the country, for example, are misadventures with regular household bleach.",
        "Right now, we have lots of products on the market that people use to clean their tiles and other cleaners that are acid-based.",
        "And when those are mixed with regular old hypochlorite bleach, it releases a chlorine gas cloud in the house.",
        "You mean, it's a - it's putting together chemicals from different sources that normally stay apart, but when you mix them together, something else happens."

        "That's right.",
        "And people may not know they're mixing because you can use them sequentially.",
        "First, you use one thing; it doesn't get you the effect you want so you use something else.",
        "So you put the chlorine bleach on top of which you add before and, poof, something else comes out of it.",
        "Right, and a lot of people think that the only problem is when you mix ammonia with chlorine, and that's a problem too.",
        "But this other problem is just as big - bigger.",
        "We've actually seen quite a bit of chloroform formed when you use sodium hypochlorite-, chlorine-containing dishwasher detergents and laundry detergents in washing machines and dishwashers.",
        "It's a major source of chloroform in residential buildings.",
        "You mean, there's chloroform coming out of your dishwasher.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And…",
        "How does that happen?",
        "Basically, there is sodium hypochlorite chlorine in about half of all dishwasher detergents that are sold and it reacts with the food stuffs, particularly proteins and meat products as well as some of the chemicals that are in tomato paste and tomato sauce.",
        "And it - it's very effective at forming chloroform and we've seen enormous amounts of chloroform formed in dishwashers and released from dishwashers during the dishwashing and when the dishwasher door is open.",
        "So you open that door and beside the steam coming out, you have a face full of chlorine.",
        "Thank you."
