        "Yeah.",
        "There are a lot of different products on the market that you can use in your HPAC systems.",
        "Some are very effective, some are not.",
        "Most people buy HPAC filters that are fairly worthless with respect to protecting public health.",
        "They are believed removing cat hair in that type of thing.",
        "The more outdoor air you can bring in in general, the higher the ventilation rate, the better the quality of indoor air is going to be in general.",
        "And if you can control where the outdoor air comes in, and some higher-end homes are now doing that in the United States, it allows you to actually remove outdoor air pollution on its way into the house.",
        "And that's not the way most houses are designed.",
        "So for those types of systems, if you can control the outdoor air, where it comes in and treat it immediately for any outdoor air pollution in the air, that's generally a good thing to do.",
        "What about these air purifiers that people are buying that use ions to purify the air.",
        "I noticed consumer reports in the last issue, they said they had recommended these in the past, but they're no longer recommending them because of the ozone that they put out.",
        "Right.",
        "There's actually two problems with ion generators and we've been doing a lot of research on that topic here at University of Texas.",
        "And one of my colleagues is, Dr. Jeffrey Siegel, he's really led those projects.",
        "One is that when you compare them with comparably priced other devices, portable air purifiers, they are largely ineffective.",
        "I mean, they don't remove a lot of particular matter from the air.",
        "The second problem is that they do emit ozone, they don't emit as much ozone as an explicit ozone generator, but they do - most of these devices do emit enough ozone that it can raise levels of ozone in indoor air to levels that are of some concern, but also the ozone engages in chemistry indoors, which leads to a lot of other byproducts like formaldehyde and other what we call secondary products from these chemical reactions.",
        "So they are largely ineffective and also emit ozone, which is never a good thing.",
        "Well there's also, I think, a larger societal issue, which is, do we want a system where each person is on their own where they have to somehow purify their indoor air and purify the water that comes with the faucet or would we rather have public health protective standards that make sure you're not bringing in products into the home, which can muddy the air that you breath.",
        "Or, that you have, for some reason, not the ability to open the window and get the air that's around you because of hazards.",
        "And I think that's the principal that shouldn't be forgotten.",
        "How much should you rely on your nose for things that might be hazardous?",
        "I mean, you bring in new carpeting, there's glue, there's you know, plastics that come in.",
        "We know that these things are out-gassing some sorts of chemicals.",
        "Should we be wary of these things?",
        "Well, you know, one of the problems with odors as a warning is that with time - with certain chemicals, there's a mechanism by which you lose the ability to smell them at those levels.",
        "That's the one issue.",
        "Another issue is that just a simple matter of fact that smells aren't always the best warning.",
        "There are things, which are quite toxic, which you're just not capable of smelling or don't have a strong odor."

        "There's another way in which though the nose could be a warning and that is in terms of a runny nose.",
        "Because a lot of times, allergies that are manifested by runny nose in response to various exposures are the harbinger of what will go on potentially to become an asthma-type response if exposure keeps going.",
        "One good example of type of household product in which that can occur - all the modern two-part glues that people love to use - super glues and related things.",
        "Most of those types of chemicals have the capability of inducing sensitization on people who use them.",
        "The more you use them, the more the problem is so that's why in the workplace, it's more of a problem, but it can be a problem at home too.",
        "Rich Corsi?",
        "Yeah, I agree with Professor Blanc on that issue.",
        "I would point out that there are certain products where if you can smell them, then it's telling you something important.",
        "And I'll give you one example.",
        "Moth crystals, moth cakes, moth balls are made out of paradichlorobenzene.",
        "They are pure paradichlorobenzene, and there's a lot of concern about the toxicity of that compound.",
        "And the odor threshold for that compound is quite high.",
        "And so when you walk into a room and somebody's home where there's moth crystals and you smell that kind of moth crystal smell, moth ball smell, you're being exposed to really high levels of that particular chemical.",
        "And if you actually do a conventional risk assessment as the EPA does with many chemicals for that particular chemical, the risk associated with breathing the air when you can smell that chemical dwarf just about any other pollutant you can think of other than radon into our environment.",

        "And I wonder if what - if problems with that has been identified.",
        "And if so, how that would compare with other new homes that are being built that are not trailers?",
        "Because I had a brother-in-law that had a brand new $300,000 home.",
        "And when we would go visit overnight, I would get -develop nausea and get sick to my stomach in, you know, a real bad way just overnight, you know, in a $300,000.",
        "So…",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's a good question.",
        "If, you know you're testing trailers, why don't we have a standard to test new homes when they're built, whether they're livable, safely that way?",
        "Well, again, that may come down to jurisdictional squabbles; who's actually going to make the standard and enforce it.",
        "Most building codes, in fact, as opposed to some of the things we're talking about are completely local affairs.",
        "So…",
        "We have people who test for radon now.",
        "Could we not expand that test for other toxic substances?"

        "We can.",
        "But the public has to become educated on knowing what things to ask, to be tested for and its contingencies in home sales and that type of thing.",
        "I think one of the issues is educating the public.",
        "And we haven't done a very good job at that in the United States.",
        "I'd like to also respond to the caller, I guess.",
        "The levels in the FEMA trailers that I've seen far exceed sort of typical levels, even in new homes in the United States.",
        "The levels in the trailers are just off the scale.",
        "And one of the problems we have with new homes in the United States is if we've move towards, you know, energy-efficient green homes and we've really ratcheted down on the air exchange rates on those homes, the amount of outdoor air we bring in, it allows things like formaldehyde to accumulate.",
        "So even if we reduce the amount of formaldehyde in pressed wood products, for example.",
        "As we tighten down on the air exchange rates in buildings, the level still accumulate to the levels that can actually be quite irritating to people, if not toxic.",
        "So is ventilation - is that the single best way to combat whatever is in the air?",
        "Well, Guy, he basically reiterated his long-held position on the settlements.",
        "Let's listen.",
        "I would say the best way to combat indoor air quality problems is to remove sources, if you can; to basically, don't engage in activities that involves sources that emit these kinds of chemicals we're talking about.",
        "I think ventilation is probably the - is the second thing to do upon.",
        "Well, how do you know when you bring something in your house how bad it is?",
        "Again, I think that's an issue of public education.",
        "And this field that we're talking about right now is not nearly as mature a field as other environmental fields in our country.",
        "We know a lot less because there aren't the regulatory drivers that that Professor Blanc talked about, and there hasn't been nearly as much research, if there has been, say, in the drinking water field or outdoor air pollution field.",
        "And so the public is less educated because we simply know less.",
        "And what we do know, we haven't been very effective at getting out to the public.",
        "And if I wanted to bring home certain substances into my home - you know, if I was an idiot, I couldn't do it because I wouldn't be allowed to buy it and it wouldn't be on the marketplace.",
        "So requiring people to have so much knowledge is not the safest way of going.",
        "You shouldn't have to have a degree in chemistry before you go down the aisles of your supermarket, buying a cleaner for your bathtub.",

        "Lots of by-products are formed, including formaldehyde; ultrafine particles that can make their way into the bloodstream, and other by-products.",
        "So We've been doing some research on that topic here at U.T.",
        "And it's amazing what you can actually form in the breathing zone if somebody that's wearing these things, that they're exposed to relatively low levels of ozone, which should be much, much lower than what the U.S.",

        "If you are outdoors, where levels are higher, that would be - you'd be standing in a cloud of this stuff.",
