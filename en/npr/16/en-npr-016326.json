        "Well, I think it's - like everything else, it's relative.",
        "It depends on where the person is living now.",
        "I think it would take a lot of - a lot more data to emerge to show a clear pattern of problems.",
        "But, you know, clearly people do renovations around their home sometimes while they're still living in them or, you know, poorly, poorly advised.",
        "And even though we've gotten rid of some products, we still have other ones that people can inadvertently use.",
        "But I don't think that there's a clear enough pattern of data yet to comment on time periods before moving into houses and so forth.",
        "And I could certainly imagine scenarios where it's better to move into that house now than to stay where you are.",
        "So…",
        "In the few minutes I have left, what do we do and how do we clean our house out of some of these toxic products?",
        "What steps should we take?",
        "I'll ask you Dr. Blanc, first.",
        "What do we do?",
        "Well, I think the first thing is common sense.",
        "You know, you use products that are reasonable to the job.",
        "Don't — certainly there are certain things that are absolute.",
        "You should never bring home an industrial-strength product that's not marketed to the general public.",
        "You should be careful about combining products and using more materials than need to be used for the job in question.",
        "It's always good to have as much ventilation as you can.",
        "The areas in which people use products where they tend to get in the most trouble, in fact, are in small and closed spaces.",
        "A bathroom is the best example of that.",
        "But you can imagine scenarios where people are doing - tinkering in their household basement…",
        "Yeah.",
        "…that's poorly ventilates…",
        "And the spraying paint and things like that."

        "Richard, you want to add?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Let's say, first, as Dr. Blanc mentioned, avoid products that, we know cause problems.",

        "Well, let me go back for a second because I have a minute.",
        "We're in the holiday season, I can't let you go buy with that without candle and incense talking about that.",
        "Sure.",
        "Scented candles actually emit very large amounts of ultrafine particles.",
        "And these are particles that are just the right size that penetrate deep into our respiratory system.",
        "And depending upon what the candle is made of - if they're paraffin-based candles that are doped with scenting agents, you can also form some fairly toxic compounds that actually are associated with the particles that are conveyed into the blood.",
        "And my students have done some work in this area and looked at scented versus unscented candles to see major differences in the two.",
        "Scented candles seemed to be particularly bad in terms of emissions of organic compounds, some of which are toxic like benzene, as well as particulate matter.",
        "Any other kind of scented flaming things we should be worried about?",
        "As I mentioned, incense.",
        "Incense.",
        "Same problem?",
        "Same problems there, yeah."

        "And I believe the Fed will eventually end itself because they're working on a monetary system that is not viable.",
        "The main thing I will do will be to continue the effort to at least get transparency of the Fed, to audit the Fed, to know what they've been doing.",
        "Ron Paul, I mean, if you do audit the Fed, if the Fed can be audited, doesn't that effectively turn, you know, what is supposed to be an independent branch of the government into a politicized one, you know, beholden to whichever party is in power at the time?",
        "Well, I think that's a misconception because I think you describe what has been accepted over the decades.",
        "But there's nothing that says that a secret body should have the right to create money at will and pass it out.",
