        "But, you know, you're a man who's always stood against the ideas of welfare and subsidies and so on, and many Americans, they don't realize this.",
        "But after serving just five years, each member of Congress is given a full pension for life, subsidized by the taxpayers.",
        "Why shouldn't members of Congress participate in the same 401(k) programs that the vast majority of us, American citizens, have to take part in?",
        "Well, I think they should, and that's why I don't take my pension fund.",
        "I've never contributed or participated in it, and I don't expect to get one penny from my pension fund.",
        "You would be eligible to get $85,000 a year, at least.",

        "But he then went on to say that, quote, \"\"Islam knows no borders and no frontiers; the jihad in Afghanistan will continue.\"\" And he vowed to send more fighters to kick the Americans out of Afghanistan the way the mujahedin forced the Soviet withdrawal from here in 1989.",
        "So how bad is the situation today in Afghanistan?",

        "Without this, sooner or later, these territories will become another Hamastan, and that is something we cannot accept.",
        "He also said that Palestinian refugees would not be allowed to return to their historic homes inside Israel and that Jerusalem would remain the united capital of Israel, two things that the Palestinians, of course, will not be happy to hear.",
        "And Lourdes, he made several demands as well.",
        "He said the Palestinians must accept Israel as the homeland of the Jewish people and that the Palestinian authority had to fight the militant group Hamas, which is in control of the Gaza Strip.",
        "He mentioned the absolute necessity of the Palestinian's acknowledgement of the Jewish nature of the state of Israel several times in his speech.",
        "Here's one of them.",

        "As you said in the intro, this is a very murky world indeed, and connecting the dots is sort of like if you were to create a Wikipedia page on Litvinenko murder.",

        "And he said something very simple which I've always tried to bear in mind.",
        "It's useful as a reporter, but I think it's also useful as a reader, as a consumer of news, especially when we look at the Litvinenko case.",
        "He said any conspiracy theory takes at least three steps, and in Russia we usually screw it up on the second step.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And I think that is instructive.",
        "That said - and maybe we can get into this in a little bit - we are in a period of extreme crisis and tension in Russia, and it has not - in many ways, it's been obscured by the murder of Litvinenko in London.",
        "This is what I call September 1999, when there was a series of apartment bombings in Russia which led to the rise of Vladimir Putin.",
        "He was then the prime minister, and as we all know, he became president on New Year's Eve of that year...",

        "That's one of those many links, you know, that people are sort of playing with now, and it gets you into a million - it's sort of a recursive cat's cradle, if you will.",
        "But Litvinenko, that was one of his main points, and that was the book that he co-authored.",
        "The first book that he co-authored was about those apartments bombings and who was behind them, and we still don't know.",
        "And again, getting back to Chechnya, the journalist Anna Politkovskaya, she was a leading critic of human rights abuses in Chechnya.",
        "She certainly was, and she - I actually was in Chechnya with her.",
        "We were not traveling together, but we were there together at one point.",
        "I was shocked, and having been in Russia for most of the last 10 years - well, a decade before that - you are not easily shocked if you've lived in Russia that long.",
        "And when I got the phone call from Moscow that she had been murdered, it - certainly the murder of Klebnikov, an American, was shocking and seemingly nonsensical.",
        "Politkovskaya as well.",
        "And that's sort of controversial to say because she was the single strongest voice speaking truth to power concerning the Chechen war.",
        "That said, she wrote for a very, very small newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, in Moscow, which is on the Internet, but the actual printed paper only goes to a very small circle every month.",
        "Well, and to be fair, I think it was The Economist which once - this week described Mr. Litvinenko as a man who was completely unimportant until he was murdered.",
        "Right.",
        "This is one of the central questions when you link up all those - all these murders.",
        "They don't all fit the pattern, but Klebnikov -again to get back to that murder - why was he killed?",
        "We still don't know.",
        "He really wasn't raising - he was known as an investigative journalist when he was working for Forbes.",
        "But having been in Moscow at that time when the first issue of the Russian Forbes came out, he - it was - he was all pro - he wasn't 100 percent pro-Putin, but he was pro the new generation of businessmen.",
        "He was very upbeat on Russia.",
        "He was actually on the record as backing Putin in Chechnya."
