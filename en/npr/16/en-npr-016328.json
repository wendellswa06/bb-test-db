        "For a lot of people, you can plug yourself into those types, even if it's...",
        "Sergei Yushenkov, who was one of the liberal-minded deputies with a military background, he was shot dead outside his house.",
        "At that point, he was a completely marginal character on the fringe of politics.",
        "As you said about Litvinenko, he was somebody who was sort of a gnat, by no means even a wasp in the Kremlin's mind.",
        "So although the remarks coming out of the Kremlin from Mr. Putin on down have been, let us say, blunt and brusque - to give him the credit that he probably doesn't deserve on those remarks, certainly with regarding to the journalist Anna Politkovskaya - these were not significant opponents.",
        "There is no significant opposition in Russia today, and that's again a point to bear in mind.",
        "Yes, the media has been suppressed.",
        "Their political process - well, there's I guess a presidential election coming up next year, but it seems to be - the jockeying seems to be whomever Mr. Putin will choose.",
        "Well, that's when I say that's this - we're in September 1999 all over again.",
        "The last years of Boris Yeltsin, while they made for great copy in the Western newspapers, were a period of stagnation that we haven't seen - that the Russians hadn't seen since Brezhnev.",
        "But it was also this sort (unintelligible) which has become famous now in a number of books, and Russians remember that very well.",
        "When Putin came in, suddenly you had law and order.",
        "You had the war in Chechnya and you had a semblance that there would be a rule of law.",
        "Now there is again a jockeying for power, and there are two lead candidates, both of whom are close protégés of Mr. Putin.",
        "One who, like him, is what we call one of the siloviki -the men of power, men from sort of the former KGB, now FSB, and the Interior Ministry and the power ministries in Russia, those men have come from there, the alumni.",
        "And it's a very large, old-boy network called siloviki.",
        "And those are the two, Dmitry Medvedev, who's only 41, and Sergei Ivanov, who are seen as sort of the leading contenders.",
        "It's a moot point because, as you said, at the end of the day Vladimir Putin will, should this election continue, should the election go off in '08, he will be the one appointing his successor.",
        "Let's get some listeners involved in this conversation.",
        "Our guest is Andrew Meier, former Moscow correspondent for Time and working on a book about the history of the KGB.",

        "Let's start with Yana(ph), who's calling us from Wyoming.",
        "Yes, I was going to say that the Russian society seems to always have thrived on a conspiracy-type intelligence.",
        "I don't know if it's a cycle that can ever be broken.",
        "I think when the Soviet Union, former Soviet Union, collapsed, there was a - oh, part of our government that just really felt that, well, now we're finally rid of the KGB.",
        "But I just don't think the mindset will ever go away.",
        "(unintelligible)",
        "Yana's clearly being distracted by some other more pressing issues there.",
        "But Andrew Meyer, you were talking about the conspiracy culture in not only the Soviet Union but still in Russia."

        "This is a nation that was, when the Soviet Union existed, they believed they were (speaking foreign language), a great power.",
        "And one of the great tenets of Mr. Putin's rise is that he promised to make Russia again proud.",
        "This was a nation that was insulted and injured.",
        "They had lost the 15 republics of the Soviet Union, and then they fell into an economic freefall.",
        "Mr. Putin has more than enough of his share of problems on hand.",

        "So the KGB mentality exists, but you have to be careful.",
        "One thing I do when I talk about this, I like to point out is that it's not the era that I'm working on now researching my book.",
        "It's not the 1920s and ‘30s where you have agents overseas conducting operations.",

        "He served in the Russian parliament, and he's since been -found refuge here in the United States.",

        "Well, let me tell you, when Yuri Andropov took over as chairman of the KGB, and that happened in 1967, and I was pretty close to that man and I would listen to some of his deliberations on the issues.",
        "In fact, when I ran the directorate of foreign counterintelligence, one of my functions was to locate defectors.",
        "They were all sentenced to death automatically.",
        "And my job was to locate them, and someone else will kill them.",

        "Well, one is an infamous case of Georgi Markov, who was poisoned by the Bulgarians, but the poison was provided by the Soviet KGB.",

        "And during the process of kidnapping, when he was dragged across the border from Austria into Czechoslovakia, he died of a heart attack.",
        "And finally there was an order by Andropov, but again it was sanctioned and apparently by the Soviet politburo members when Hafizullah Amin, the president of Afghanistan.",
        "Before he was shot, gunned down by the Soviet crack units which stormed the palace, he was given poison, he was dying.",
        "And the Soviet doctors who served him, they tried to, well, revive him.",
        "And when the troops moved in, he was just shot.",
        "And his four-year-old kid was also shot, by the way.",
        "So these are the three cases I'm aware of, and I don't believe there were any in Andropov's time.",
        "In fact, every since Gorbachev took over and the reforms started.",
        "Until 1998, I do not recall a single case of politically motivated assassination.",
        "They all started since 1998.",
        "Well, I would say that's when Putin took over as chief of the Russian security services and later as president of Russia.",
        "And I wonder, Andrew Meier, does that history jive with what your research shows?",
        "Excuse me, we're going to try to get back to Andrew Meier in New York, yes.",
        "It does absolutely, but I think Oleg Kalugin is being too modest.",
        "He has a far greater role to talk about in each of those cases and knows the history from the inside.",
        "The point, though, to get back to Litvinenko, in 1998, when he first sort of came into the public eye, in Moscow he held a press conference with five other members then of the FSB.",
        "And I was there at the press conference.",
        "And it would be a little bit of a difference with Oleg's chronology in that he said he - Litvinenko, that is, said - he made the accusation that he had been ordered to execute the then ruling, reigning oligarch in Moscow, Boris Berezovsky, who then of course became his patron and is now living in exile in London.",
        "That predates '98.",
