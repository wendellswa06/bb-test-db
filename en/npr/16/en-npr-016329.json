        "Well, I think there's, you know, as in all things in Russia, especially today, there are many, many more shades of gray, as I'm sure Oleg Kalugin knows well.",
        "As I said at the outset, you can connect the dots that way.",
        "Those dots are very strong.",
        "But you can also connect them almost an infinite number of ways.",

        "It looks like they will be muscled out by Gazprom, the national giant gas corporation.",
        "Anyone who's paid even a cursory interest in Chechnya knows that Grozny, the Chechen capital, has suffered the worst bombing of any city in Europe since World War II.",
        "If you look at the Russian health crisis, there are catastrophes across the country.",
        "You don't need to take out someone like Alexander Litvinenko or even Anna Politkovskaya, because there is enough out there already on the record to blacken Mr. Putin's name.",
        "That said, you can easily connect the dots that way as well.",
        "But as I said at the outset, it doesn't get us very far.",
        "One thing I would point out, though, is that although Mr. Putin came in with this strong backing, it's the question of seeing where we're going to go now.",
        "With the complete elimination of independent media, there really isn't a very strong avenue.",
        "We had a recent - over the weekend - protest led by the former chess master Garry Kasparov, who was trying to raise an opposition party.",
        "There is no freedom right now to raise any kind of democratic opposition within Russia.",
        "Hmm.",

        "My name is Gintuss.",
        "I'm a second-generation Lithuanian living in the States.",
        "And I wanted to ask Mr. Meier, is there any validity to the fear amongst the Baltic countries that Putin will try to repossess the Baltics in the next five to 10 years, even though that we've recently become part of the NATO alliance?",
        "No.",
        "I think this is part of, you know, when - and to a certain extent, it's the fault of reporters, both in Moscow and in Europe and in the States.",
        "As I said, you don't need to do too much to blacken Vladimir Putin's name, but this is a man who's extremely bright.",
        "And he has amazed those of us who saw him rise in 1998, how well he's performed on the world stage."

        "Anytime - I'm told anytime George Bush mentions Georgia, Vladimir Putin flies off the handle in their one-on-one meetings.",
