        "In my view, U.S.-Russian relations are at a real crisis point now, but I think it's a positive crisis point because it's making people in Washington examine the relationship and think about the kind of work we can do with Russia and the kind of work we can't do with Russia.",

        "We not only bring NATO forces up to Russian borders, but we also then talk about putting in place a missile defense system on the borders of the Russian Federation.",

        "You saying that to engineer, design and build these more wind resistant?",
        "Absolutely.",

        "A couple things that I noted with the shelters, these - you know, near absolute protection is something that is desired, but in terms of budget it may not always be there.",
        "I think we can do a lot more in terms of the schools, providing roll-up doors or somewhere bracing those corridors in schools so that they're not facing directly to the exterior, and we can protect people's lives there.",
        "One of the things I would mention, Ira, is in the Moore medical complex, they sheltered 300 people in that shelter during the 20th May tornado with no injuries.",
        "This was interesting to us for two reasons: One, they only had 30 patients and staff at the time so that the majority of these people came from around the area, from homes, from the malls, et cetera, et cetera, because they wanted to seek shelter for themselves.",
