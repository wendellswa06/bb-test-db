        "I haven't looked into the technology of it in great detail, but I understand that the way the system is designed, it is designed in fact to go after missiles that would be on a trajectory launched from Iran, and that is precisely what the Pentagon has been saying.",
        "They are not designed to go after missiles launched from Russia, which would be, you know, very capable missiles and moving at a lot faster speed than could be chased by the NATO systems deployed in Poland and the Czech Republic.",
        "At the core of this is the very basic question of whether or not missile defense actually works.",
        "How close do you think the U.S.",
        "is to really being able to have an effective defense against incoming ballistic missiles?",
        "Well, we've made the decision that we're going to start small and build up, that we're going to start with systems that aren't very capable and build up over time.",
        "The argument that is made about these systems to go into Poland and the Czech Republic is that in fact they are not capable against a very well-developed high-technology system such as those that the Russians deploy but that they would be capable against kind of starter systems such as those that the Iranians would be deploying in some years to come.",
        "I've got to stress the Iranians aren't there yet with a long-range missile that would reach Europe, but the feeling is that they can be within a very limited number of years, and therefore a missile defense system that isn't very capable is good enough.",

        "That's Randy Butler.",
        "He's the manager of the company that was in charge of cleaning up those hotels, International Catastrophe Solutions, or ICS, from Atlanta.",
        "Butler says if those Brazilian workers were illegal and if they were denied overtime, it's not his company's fault.",

        "Agriculture and garment were the historical sectors where this was really prevalent, but now almost every low wage sector that you see, in janitorial, in retail, in restaurants, in hospitality, you see it everywhere where there is low wage workers and often immigrant workers.",
        "Ruckelshaus says federal law actually makes it pretty easy to go after companies for misclassifying employees as independent contractors, especially in situations such as the New Orleans cleanup, in which workers were bused in, housed and fed by the companies, and sometimes even paid by the hour.",
