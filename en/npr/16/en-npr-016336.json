        "And the Hutus are refugees from Rwanda who left after the genocide which were carried out by Hutus against the Tutsis, and they've been living there in exile.",
        "So Nkunda basically took the position that he was a champion of the Tutsis.",
        "Problem is that his activities, particularly his most recent military activities, created complete chaos in the eastern part of the DRC, and there were many allegations against him regarding human rights abuses.",
        "Then, in the middle of this, as you said, Rwanda announced that they had arrested him.",
        "And my guess is that what's happening is that Rwanda and the DRC have cut a deal that basically includes the cessation of Rwandan support for the Tutsi militias and the agreement for joint military operations against the Hutus.",
        "And that under those circumstances, the Rwandans will hold on to Nkunda at least as long as the deal lasts.",
        "That's my guess.",

        "That's precisely right.",
        "It's very unclear what happened.",
        "What the press is indicating is that Rwanda and the DRC are engaged, or have agreed to engage in joint military operations against the Hutus.",
        "That may mean that Nkunda's troops get brought into the picture to fight alongside, or maybe they simply are demobilized.",
