        "Shock, grief, forgiveness - a wrenching and remarkable week in South Carolina.",
        "The state is still trying to come to terms with the murder of nine African-Americans allegedly at the hands of a self-confessed white supremacist.",
        "But in their sadness, many South Carolinians have also found reason to hope, as NPR's Joel Rose reports.",
        "It absolutely raises the stakes as far as how far Governor Blagojevich is willing to go to make his point.",
        "I think, you know, he really stunned people right away.",
        "There was an expectation once these charges came out that he was going to resign, and I think there aren't a lot of people that expected him to go this far with it.",
        "So, I think absolutely it's a game-changer, and we'll see where he goes from here.",
        "But he's been defiant, so far, in admitting guilt and in wanting to step down.",
        "When you take a look at this, Marc, you have the situation where the former Illinois attorney general, Roland Burris, has been appointment by this governor to the Senate seat that Barack Obama once held.",
        "But he's been having to restate again and again his case for actually being seated, and he, yesterday, said he didn't strike any backroom deals with the governor.",
        "Is that really the primary issue?",
        "Do people think that Burris himself is tainted, or is it more an issue of the process?",
        "You know, that's a good question.",
        "I must admit.",
        "I don't really know what's in people's minds.",
        "I'm stuck in our own state legislature right now.",
        "We're just doing the boring stuff, they are, of cutting the budget, but as far as Burris' case is concerned, there certainly doesn't seem to be any evidence currently that he did anything wrong.",
        "And he's certainly and interesting, kind of jovial character.",
        "As - my perception is, is when I see him on television, he seems like a nice guy, but then again, that's what a lot of politicians seem to be.",
        "But as far as his role, he appears to have been legally appointed.",
        "It's going to be difficult for him to - or difficult for the Senate to deny him a seat.",
        "And as for Blagojevich, aside from being recorded or captured on wiretaps saying he was going to sell the seat, if he didn't actually sell the seat and they can't prove that, it's going to certainly be difficult to convict him in a court of law.",
        "Of course, in a court of a legislature, it's easier to impeach a seating governor or president.",
        "The question is, will they be able to kick him out of the office?",
        "I would imagine they probably will, because the wiretaps in and of themselves are damning in a kind of a civil setting.",
        "In a criminal setting, though, I think the bar is higher, the stakes are higher, there, and I think Blagojevich is holding on in order for him to have something to negotiate with.",
        "If he loses that governor's mansion, he loses one of his only big negotiating tools.",
        "I want to ask you about the session that you mentioned, the session in Florida about the budget cutbacks, and this is a two-week special session.",
        "What exactly is on the table?",
        "Well, what's on the table is about $1 billion in spending cuts.",
        "That's a total of $2.3 billion budget hole.",
        "Our budget has lost about $7.4 billion in three years.",
        "The state's economy is just tanking.",
        "I just heard in the previous newscast about the jobs report.",
        "We're the number-one job-loss state in the nation.",
        "We're also now the number-one food-stamp-request state in the nation.",
        "People just started moving here; the homes that are being built can't be sold; there's a big inventory of empty homes, and that means less tax revenue.",
        "We do have a - certainly not on the Blagojevich level ,but we do have a House speaker here who, behind the scene, steered tens of millions of dollars to a small community college in his district - he did this behind the scenes -and also steered and shapes some favorable legislation for them.",
        "On the day he was sworn in as House speaker, he was given a $110, 000-a-year job.",
        "People have bashed this as a quit pro quo.",
        "My colleague at the St. Pete Times, Alex Leary, has been writing quite a bit about this and what's happened since, is under pressure.",
        "Our House speaker, Ray Sansom, had just resigned his post as the community college - from the community college.",
        "And he's still presiding over the budget-cut sessions, but that's how this session kicked off with him finally declining to accept the job that a lot of people question.",
        "So, there is probably a widespread belief, certainly from Illinois to Florida, that there is a pay-to-play culture in politics.",
        "So, they really wonder sometimes when people get down to - or get into elected office, if they're doing the people's work or the work for themselves.",
        "But right now, they're kind of doing the people's work, they're cutting a whole lot of spending, and it's going to be quite a time in Florida.",
        "We're probably going to see massive government -job layoffs in the regular spring lawmaking session.",
        "So, it's kind of a tense atmosphere here in Florida, little less circus-like than it is in Illinois or perhaps even in Washington.",
        "Jerome, from your standpoint, you know, being in Detroit, you have, of course, the well-publicized issue of the former mayor, but you also have this incredible economic barrage of your own in the region, not just in Detroit itself, but in and around Detroit.",
        "How is that affecting politics and how it's played?"

        "Wow.",
        "It is just about everything right now.",
        "I was just going to say, really, in a lot of ways, the only differences between Florida and Michigan right now are the weather.",
        "It's warm there; it's cold here.",
        "Other than that, we've got huge financial problems in the state of Michigan, as well as in Detroit as well.",
        "You know, the governor is trying to figure out where the cut in the budget right now.",
        "If you look at Detroit, Detroit is trying to figure out what to do.",
        "The deficit is estimated may be as high as $300 million.",
        "The mayor of Detroit is trying to figure out what to cut without impacting police and fire services, but the services for citizens are so minimal already there isn't necessarily a lot to cut.",
        "So, it's a real dramatic thing for the mayor to do right now.",
        "The city just had its bond rating downgraded to junk status.",
        "That means it's going to be harder to borrow money, and in some cases, this downgrade means bond holders can even ask for more money back.",
        "That's causing problems.",
        "And then, the school system, as well, here in Detroit is a - the deficit could be as high as $400 million there.",
        "There's a public school here in town that things are so bad they're asking the public to bring paper and toilet papers and pencils for the students.",
        "So, we are at that same place that many states are, like Florida, like California, where there needs to be some real work done, but I think the politicians don't necessarily have the answers to do that right now.",
        "Do you expect - are there any conversations that are going on about any help of a large scale coming from the federal government for your region?",
        "Jerome?",
        "South Carolina rose to its greatest height during the last week.",
        "Those are the words of Bishop Richard Norris, of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, speaking yesterday at a funeral service for the Reverend Clementa Pinckney in Charleston.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Governor Jennifer Granholm, the Michigan governor, she was almost giddy when President-elect Obama started talking about a stimulus package and a way to get the economy going again.",
        "She feels like she's fairly close to him - Michigan, one of the poster children for the terrible economy - that Michigan is going to get some aid from the federal government.",
        "How much that's going to be we don't know, but the governor is hopeful that it will be enough to make a difference.",
        "What about you, Marc, in Florida?",
        "I mean, are people expecting the federal government to really step in?",
        "It's not only expecting; it's hoping.",
        "There's a kind of delicious irony.",
        "We have a very Republican-controlled power structure here: a Republican governor, moderate, though, Charlie Crist, in a rather conservative legislature, both in the House and the Senate.",
        "These very conservative lawmakers who belong to the Republican Party, which bash the tax-and-spend ways of Barack Obama, as well as the Democratic Congress, are virtually begging those Democrats to now pour money into the state.",
        "So, in the back of the budget bills here, they're actually writing proviso language into the budget saying, kind of, if and when the federal stimulus money comes in, here is how it will be spent.",
        "So, they're not only hoping for it; they're almost banking on it.",
        "I want to take a quick look at an international issue that, of course, all of us have been following, Israel and the 14-day war in Gaza.",
        "Both sides refusing to cease fire, and an aid worker for the U.N.",
        "was killed this week.",
        "The organization decided to suspend its aid operations, but is, you know, moving back in, planning to move back in.",
        "What do we see ahead in terms of this conflict and how it might affect the priorities of the administration?",
        "I mean, obviously, I'm asking you to do a little crystal ball, but is this something that the incoming president is going to have to deal with right away?",
        "And will that veer off course from some of the economic priorities?",
        "Just quickly, Jerome?",
        "I think it is something that President-elect Obama, when he is president, will have to look at fairly soon, but I don't think anything is going to derail him from the economic situation.",
        "It's just too deep, it's too grave and it affects everything else.",
