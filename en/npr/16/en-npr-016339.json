        "So what's the great leap upward here, if I can put it that way?",
        "Well, the great leap upward is basically reflecting China's sustained effort at space exploration.",
        "The Chinese space program is over 50 years old.",
        "It's always enjoyed support from the top Chinese leadership and we've watched it progress from first hesitant efforts to put satellites up to China now having the world's third navigation satellite system, weather satellites, and of course a manned space program.",
        "And a three person crew, as we mentioned, and certainly the first Chinese woman to go into space, 33-year-old Liu Yang.",
        "Help us understand the significance of her being up there.",
        "Well, as with the Soviets, the early inclusion of a woman in the manned effort is the reflection of political importance associated with space.",
        "Mao, of course, is said to - have said that women hold up half of the sky and now there's a Chinese woman up in the sky.",
        "But really, the larger point here is it's a reflection of the political support that China's space program has from the highest levels.",
        "Then help us understand how this mission fits in to the plans of Chinese leadership.",
        "Well, this particular mission is very important because it really shows - it is going to the opportunity for the Chinese to engage in manned docking maneuvers.",
        "And manned docking maneuvers are an essential part if you're going to build a space station.",
        "The Chinese have said that they want to do that by 2020.",
        "If they are going to put a man on the moon, which the latest space white paper shows that they're starting the studies to do that.",
        "Any kind of sustained presence in space requires the ability to do docking.",
        "And so that's a key part of this mission.",
        "The other of course is that this is 13 days so you're going to have a lot of exposure to microgravity.",
        "And, again, this is China's first really extended mission beyond a one or two day affair.",
        "And what does this mean to the people of China?",
        "Are people following it?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "China's space program is something that is a source of national pride.",
        "It's the sort of thing that we probably haven't seen since the 1960s.",
        "One of the spring water brands has on its later the official water of the Shenzhou space program."

        "It's a little bit like Tang.",

        "But, yeah.",
        "So.",
        "No, but it's not just that.",
        "There are advertisements at bus stands in Beijing for companies making sprockets and gears, that their products are a part of the Shenzhou program.",
        "The manned program in particular is essentially a statement of quality control.",
        "We are reliable enough that our astronauts depend on our products.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's obviously good enough for your factory, your cars, your plants.",
        "And, briefly, any dissident voices?",

        "Why should we (unintelligible)?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "There is, given particularly the disparities of wealth and other things, there are Chinese, particularly from poorer provinces and representing the billion or so who are much less advantaged in China, who are asking the real question.",
        "This is costing a lot of money.",
        "It is diverting a lot of human talents, engineers and the like.",
        "What are the Chinese people getting out of this?",

        "Here on Day to Day, we've been staying in touch with one young soldier, Captain Nate Rawlings.",
        "He is serving his second tour in Iraq.",
        "Tomorrow we'll hear an interview with him.",
        "Here's a preview, but our apologies for the sound quality.",
        "He called us from the south of Baghdad on his cell phone.",
        "He explained how his work there is different this time around.",
        "Last year was a little different, because stories were coming out of central Baghdad, and they would tend to freak my mother out and she'd be afraid.",
        "And then I'd say, mother, Baghdad is the size of Detroit.",
        "I was in a totally different area.",
        "But generally, once when you get down to this level where the soldiers bowl daily and go outside the wire and try to avoid bombs and rocket-propelled grenades, we really just take each other and try to do our job as best we can.",
        "And we get great supportive emails and great supportive letters from all of our friends and family.",
        "So that means the most to us.",
        "And then we know that as soon as there's a new president, he or she - I guess now he - will make a determination on what we do in Iraq.",
        "And then it will maybe come back to the forefront of the news.",
        "But I don't think that affects anyone too much.",
        "We profiled Captain Nate Rawlings back in April.",
        "He's been stop-lossed.",
        "Captain Rawlings is an aspiring writer, and we've been asking listeners to write to him.",
        "Topher, that's a very perceptive decision on your part.",
        "And...",
        "He also has to have an environment around him of friends and family who he knows is going to support him.",
        "And I think lastly he's probably going to have to have a couple teammates that he comes out to first that are guaranteed to be his allies within the locker room."

        "You did an interview with the Daily Beast where you talked about some of the traits that this trailblazer is going to have to have, that it can't just be anybody who happens to be gay, who happens to be on a team who decides OK, I'm going to tell people and come out, that this person is going to have so much scrutiny, so much pressure, so much focus, so much attention.",
        "Yes, I think one of the things that we forget is that - at least for myself - is that I didn't have much cultural competency around what it meant to be a gay person.",
        "You know, so if I had come out back in 2000, 2004, I probably would have said a lot of things that may not have helped the actual movement.",
        "You know, I didn't even really know what the acronym LGBTQ meant back then.",
        "So I think that there has to be a lot of education and understanding about what it means to be a gay person and then also what it means to be a gay athlete because I think that when you're in front of the media, oftentimes you just say the first thing that pops into your head, and that could either hurt or help the actual movement.",
        "So I think that the person has to first of all just do some research about what it means to be a gay person and then also know - and make sure that the language that he uses, the things that he says aren't going to be destructive but help the actual movement.",
        "Yeah, you used the acronym LBGTQ.",
        "We should say that's lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer.",
        "I want to bring in another voice here.",

        "So we've been talking a little bit about the NFL.",
        "Is the lay of the land there pretty similar to what you see in other major league sports around the country?",
        "Give us a sense of the big picture.",
        "Well, I think the NFL is pretty much representative of all pro sports.",
        "I mean, it's getting so much more attention simply because it's the biggest sport.",
        "I mean, the combine is - you know, where they've asked a lot of those players do you like girls and stuff - it's pretty much a glorified job interview, and the media covers that like they don't cover any other sport.",
        "So we're hearing a lot about the NFL simply because it's kind of the big dog, but I think the atmosphere is similar.",
        "I think the groundwork's being laid to where I think sports is more ready to accept an openly gay player.",
        "But as Wade said, the question would be whether a particular player himself is ready because of all the issues he has to deal with.",
        "Yeah, let's take a call.",

        "Hi Tom, go ahead."

        "Hi, yeah, I used to work with a Division I football team, and it was actually after a player had graduated and left that he came out.",
        "And it was just kind of interesting, I think it's very difficult for a lot of players to emphasize, especially when they're not in that situation, a lot of them claim that they would have been much more understanding if he would have been honest and upfront with them about it, and a lot of them felt somehow betrayed or that, you know, they felt uncomfortable that they had spent all those years, you know, and a lot of male bonding and the camaraderie of playing on, you know, an athletic team with someone that, you know, he wasn't up front with them about that.",
        "And a lot of them are uncomfortable with, you know, what he could have been, you know, thinking about the entire time or anything like that.",
        "But, you know, given the fact that there's not that many people in, you know, college and professional athletics, you know, it's just very difficult for a lot of people to, you know, kind of think from that point of view as to, you know, what they would do or how they would handle the situation because you really don't know how people would handle it once you get, you know, everybody sitting in the locker room, people that you spend years with, you know, a lot of time with and, you know, occasionally live with and stuff like that that, you know, they really have no idea, you know, what it - coming from that angle is.",
        "So...",
        "Sure, well, thanks for the call, Tom.",
        "And Wade, did you get a similar reaction when you came out after having left the team?",
        "Did any of your former teammates come back to you and say I feel betrayed, I feel like you misled me?",
        "I don't - a lot of them were actually mad in the best types of ways.",
        "What they wanted to do was to have had the opportunity to accept me, to show me that they would have been fine with me.",
        "But as your caller said, I think it's much easier for people to say that now than when they're not in it.",
        "You know, and my teammates, like, they all ask me some very interesting questions, but I'm just happy that they're OK having the actual conversation around what it means to be an athlete and to also be gay because even though they're not playing anymore, just the conversation alone is very positive.",
        "I want to read to you from an op-ed that was written by a former Major League Baseball player, Mark Knudson, who brings a different perspective to the issue.",
        "He writes: Individualism and personal agendas might be OK in a normal workplace, but it's not OK in team sports.",
        "Any individual with an agenda that's even slightly different from that of the team hurts that cause.",
        "We should salute gay athletes who are able to keep their sexual orientation private during their playing days.",
        "It's got to be very difficult to do, and yet it's what's best for the team.",
        "Jim Buzinski, how do you respond?",
        "Well, I never thought that being gay was having an agenda, and I think Mark Knudson, anytime he ever mentioned a wife was having a straight agenda by announcing his heterosexuality to the world.",
        "I mean, it really is thinking that is not that it's uncommon, but it's becoming more and more passe.",
        "It's one of the things illogical.",
        "So just by simply declaring who you are, you're having an agenda.",
        "And I think people like Knudson, you know, are the reason that it's still hard for people to come out.",
        "But I think he's becoming more and more a voice in the wilderness, at least among a younger generation of athletes.",
        "Well Wade Davis, a football team is not a typical workplace.",
        "You're spending your life with each other.",
        "You're traveling across the country with each other.",
        "You're showering with each other.",
        "Should there be a different kind of sensitivity in a workplace like that?"
