        "Boy, you know, I wish I could, but it has never happened in American professional sports.",
        "It happened in Australia in professional rugby, which is a huge sport there, in the 1990s.",
        "Someone named Ian Roberts came out, and he was a star.",
        "And he was totally accepted.",
        "But he's pretty much the only example we have of sort of a big-time athlete.",
        "We've had a lot of college athletes come out in other sports who have had great coming-out stories.",

        "I mean, that was a long time ago.",
        "Right.",
        "A long time ago, and you would think at that time it might have been a little bit more problematic, but it wasn't for us.",

        "I think just the misconception and the stereotype about jocks being - I'm not saying we're 100 percent enlightened - but being primitive, dumb Neanderthals who can't wrap their brain around working in an environment with someone different to them is just wrong.",
        "It's upsetting to me, and it's annoying.",

        "Yeah, it's definitely a teachable moment.",

        "So he got that right.",
        "You're saying people might just throw around words because they're used to hearing them thrown around, not thinking about the fact that those words apply to people in a way that is offensive to them.",
        "Absolutely, and I'm not trying to justify what they're doing.",
        "That's wrong, too, and it's important for us to have the conversation, to continue to talk about this and keep this at the forefront, to move it along, to let people know that that's just as wrong as being aggressively homophobic.",

        "So it's something that's not new.",
        "And as the caller said, and as Wade has said, players have - I've had experience, and I've talked to a number of players who know guys on their teams or play with guys - I know in college there was a guy who was homosexual, and I played in the NFL with guys who I thought could have been, but - and many people on the team thought they could have been, and they did nothing to kind of dissuade those views.",
        "And people played with them just fine, and everything was OK.",
        "I don't know, it just frustrates me when people believe - they perpetuate this myth that our players, by and large, are not tolerant.",
        "Well, why do you think pro sports has lagged behind other areas of American life in this issue?",
        "I think that it's - I think a lot of people like to make the Jackie Robinson comparison, which is dangerous.",
        "I think there are obviously some parallels, and these two issues are intertwined, they're both civil rights issues.",
        "But it's different because obviously there were no black players before Jackie Robinson in baseball.",
        "But there have been gay players probably in all the leagues probably longer than there have been black players in all the leagues.",
        "And it's not something that you can hide and you can put away.",
        "So I assume that it would have been easier to get into - or not assume.",

        "So I think the same thing is true now.",
        "It's easier to get into the NFL and thrive in the NFL if you fit into a mold that people believe you should fit in.",
        "So if you stand a chance to make millions of dollars, and the thing that's standing between you doing that and you not is telling someone something that's untrue about your sexuality, I think most people would go ahead and lie and go on and have their career and come out to everyone after they've already had a successful career.",
        "And that's why it's going to take someone who's really strong and really brave, and that's what's really different about this issue, as opposed to the civil rights issue is whoever steps out is going to have made that choice to openly take on this burden and force this country to move forward in that area.",
        "All right, that's Domonique Foxworth, who retired from the Baltimore Ravens in 2012.",

        "So what?",
        "OK so Wade Davis, former NFL player, when you hear a story like that from Sara, why do you think there's such a divide, I mean between the men's world and the women's world in this respect?",

        "And I think that that's unfortunate.",
        "I think that that's why there aren't as many vocal straight women supporters of lesbian athletes, because they don't want to be assumed gay.",

        "And unfortunately, I think that comes back to the idea of masculinity and patriarchy, where men don't want to think that a female can identify straight and do something better than an actual man can.",
        "So it's just unfortunate that we automatically oftentimes assume that if a woman is a good athlete that she is gay.",
