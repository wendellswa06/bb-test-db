        "Oh hi.",
        "Yeah, when I was in college, I was on the swim team.",
        "And there were three of us on there that were gay.",
        "And yet we really didn't have a big problem, you know...",
        "And you were out to your teammates?",
        "It was known.",
        "It was known that we were gay.",
        "And there was a few guys on the team that might have had a problem with it.",
        "We'd get comments in the locker room, this, that and the other thing, but on the whole we didn't really have a problem.",
        "You know, and this was the early '80s.",
        "So Jim Buzinski, we're hearing a theme here of people who may be comfortable with their own sexuality, out to their teammates, and yet there is this sort of, you know, pink wall that people seem unable to break through while they're still in major league sports.",
        "What's it going to take to finally cross that?",
        "I think it's going to take changing attitudes, and I think that's happening with younger people, who are more and more exposed to gay issues.",
        "And I wanted to bring up something you talked to Domonique about, Chris Culliver of the 49ers.",
        "You asked if it could be a teaching moment.",
        "Well, he yesterday was in Los Angeles, and he was at The Trevor Project, which is a gay resource...",
        "But I think, to me, it shows he's smiling, and this was a learning moment for him.",
        "He's only 22 years old.",
        "And what he said was dumb and offensive, but I think it was a good thing actually that it happened at the Super Bowl because it focused attention on this issue.",
        "So I guarantee you right now, Chris Culliver would not have a problem with a gay teammate, and it took that education.",
        "So I think it's going to take more and more exposure, and the fact that really life is not going to change.",
        "As Wade would know, your teammates are your teammates.",
        "All they care about is that you going to perform, and your sexual orientation doesn't matter to them ultimately because the same way their religion doesn't matter to anybody.",
        "You know, Wade, Jim raises this point that the guy is 22.",
        "We put people on pedestals, give them multimillion-dollar contracts, scrutinize them with the camera, and yet, you know, if any of us are scrutinized at that age, I'm sure all kinds of words would have shown up.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that that's one of the biggest reasons why you don't have as many straight athletes that are speaking out for - I mean, against homophobia is because they're afraid to say the wrong thing.",
        "You know, as Domonique said, that the locker room is a P.C.-free area.",
        "You know, when I was in college and, you know, like there's a lot of conversations that if they were had in public, you know, like both parties would have been, you know, like everyone would have been upset with them, but it's the way that players talk, and that they actually learn.",
        "And I actually don't use the word casual homophobia when talking to someone who may use the word sissy because I think anytime you use the word homophobia in talking to someone, they all like to get defensive.",
        "So I don't like to ever say someone is a casual homophobe.",
        "Like it's just language that's inappropriate..."

        "Yeah.",
        "...that we just have to teach people not to actually use.",
        "And one of the callers mentioned the fact that players knew that they had a gay teammate, and I think that that's the difference, is that teammates, you know, they don't care if you're gay, but I think the media and we all want this big announcement.",
        "And I think the announcement aspect of it is - can be in some ways problematic where an athlete just wants to play the game.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, they don't want to be responsible for doing X, Y and Z, but we all want that because we understand the impact that they can have in the world, and that's great.",
        "But we have to also understand that these are individuals who have the right to choose whether or not they want to be open about their sexuality.",
        "Right.",
        "All these years later, we're casually dropping the name Jackie Robinson.",
        "Perhaps the person who is gay and wants to be out to their friends and family and team doesn't want to be a Jackie Robinson, you know?",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, you know, also, Jackie Robinson kind of had his hand held.",
        "You know, he was brought in by someone, you know, everyone on the team was told by Leo that if they didn't want to play with Jackie Robinson that they can actually leave.",
        "You know, so there was some handholding that went on there.",
        "And unless there's an owner that's going to hold this player's hand and make this big grand statement saying, you know what, if anyone doesn't want to play with this gay player, then they can't be here.",
        "So that hasn't happened as well.",
        "We're talking about gays in professional sports, and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "We have a couple of emails here.",
        "This one from Joyce who writes: As a woman involved in sports all through childhood, high school and college, there were no gay women until the late 1970s.",
        "One year, there were no gay women on my teams, and the next year, there was a majority.",
        "She writes: It made no difference to us individually or as a team.",
        "It did, however, caused our male counterparts to distance themselves significantly.",
        "To me as a straight woman, she says, that was the most unfortunate part.",
        "And then we have this from Kara in Columbus, Ohio, who writes: I have friends, a trans-woman who played on a men's basketball team and a trans-man who left his women's row team.",
        "They had to walk away from teams, scholarships and schools in order to transition.",
        "I wonder whether either of your guests could talk about the future of transgender involvement in sports.",
        "Jim Buzinski of Outsports, any response?",
        "Well, we've had an example of transgender in basketball - Kye Allums - who wound up leaving the team.",
        "It was problematic.",
        "And apparently, there was a mixed martial artist that there's going to be a story on it I think in Sports Illustrated this week I haven't seen yet about a transgender fighter.",
        "I think that that's an issue that kind of causes a lot of people just confusion.",
        "You know, you have all the issue of gender and, you know, advantages and stuff.",
        "So I think it's somewhat different from the gays in sports thing, but I think in some ways, once we get over the gays in sport thing, the next frontier will probably be the transgender issue.",
        "Let's go to Grace in Denver, Colorado.",
        "Hi, Grace.",

        "Hi.",
        "I just want to speak from a perspective that I think speaks to the transgender piece.",
        "I was a shot-putter at a Division I Big Ten school, and so these two athletes are very well-known.",
        "We, you know, sort of the difference between the shot-putters and the sprinters, both of these ladies were - ended up coming out later so they didn't come out while they were on the team but definitely had a feeling that they were different.",
        "And now, they live their lives as one - as a lesbian and one is transgender.",

        "It was conscientious, how?",
        "Tell me about it.",
        "I think, you know, for the throwers, we just, you know, because we're all - we were athletic, and many of us were - had already identified as being lesbian wasn't an issue.",
        "But with the sprinters, this sort of idea of beauty and sexiness, I mean, that was - that seemed to be the thing that they gravitated towards.",
        "And so to sort of come out and said that they were lesbian would just be - or transgender would just be devastating to the team at that time.",
        "And at that time, our transgender teammate who came out later, it was really interesting, 'cause I think we all kind of knew that there was some gender issues going on but - and some sort of - some real biological issues later but...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...just really had a hard time.",
