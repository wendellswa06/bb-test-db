        "I was one - to one called Kilis on the border, and it is five-star.",
        "It is paid for by the Turkish government, and this one was built for 12,000 people.",
        "They live in containers.",
        "They're kind of like trailers.",
        "And it's six to a trailer, but they are big trailers.",
        "And here, there are banks.",
        "There are schools.",
        "There are outdoor markets.",
        "There are training classes for carpenters.",
        "There are Turkish languages classes for the kids.",
        "What's so interesting about these rebel - about these refugee camps is they really are the rear base for the rebels who are challenging the regime.",
        "They go back and forth across the border.",
        "Their wives and their children are safe in these camps, and they go in to fight.",
        "They come in maybe once a week, once every 10 days.",
        "Turkish border guards look the other way when they come across.",
        "And so they come here and have a rest.",
        "This is also the place where defected soldiers come and stay.",
        "So if you defect on the other side of the border, somebody in one of these refugee camps gets a call.",
        "And they'll come over and make sure that you get a rest and that you change sides easily.",
        "It is remarkable to watch here.",
        "I think when people first arrived, it was chaos on the border.",
        "People were afraid.",
        "But we're now into 16 months of an uprising, and you see real organization on this side of the border.",
        "Those are people, obviously, who made their choices.",
        "There are many inside Syria who are facing the conundrum.",
        "You need to choose sides at this point.",
        "I don't think there's very many people inside Syria who have not chosen a side by this point.",
        "For a long time and for many months, we talked about the grey people, those who said, I don't like the opposition.",
        "I don't like the revolution, and I don't like the regime.",
        "And so I'm going to sit on the fence and be part of the silent majority.",
        "As the revolution and the regime's brutal response has moved to the capital where people can see it, this is no longer the case.",
        "People now have taken sides, and that is what was so interesting for me to be in the capital.",
        "We are moving more and more into this sectarian divide in Syria.",
        "Everybody here talks about it.",
        "Everybody is worried about it.",
        "They all say: This is not us.",
        "This is not how we were.",
        "But you have a government that is run by a minority sect, the Alawites.",
        "And you have other minorities who have always supported this government, because they felt that they wanted the protection of the majority Sunni Muslims.",
        "[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: They felt they wanted protection FROM the majority Sunni Muslims.]",
        "Now, younger revolutionaries here will tell you that younger Christians, Alawites have joined the revolution, but the older generation has split down sectarian lines.",
        "And when we're talking about a civil war, Neal, in Syria, we're talking about a sectarian war.",
        "We're talking about people who are fighting each other because they belong to different sects.",
        "And we saw in Iraq just how ugly that can get, as neighborhoods that were - get torn apart in ethnic cleansing.",
        "People are forced to move.",
        "Yes.",
        "And you have seen some of that in Syria already.",
        "Now, people tell me that in the 1980s, especially 1982, when there was an uprising of the Muslim Brotherhood in the town of Hama and the Syrian army came and killed maybe 10 to 30 thousand people, that in the years following that uprising, there was also an unmixing, that people actually moved into neighborhoods where they were the majority.",
        "I talked to one young Syrian woman who grew up in the town of Homs, and she said, I thought that Syria was a majority Christian country, because everybody I saw in my neighborhood was a Christian.",
        "And so people tell me now, it's happening again, that you don't see an Alawite neighborhood with Sunnis in it anymore, and vice versa, that people are moving in a sectarian way.",
        "And it's very disturbing to Syrians, especially those in the capital who - it's - this is a capital where you see a church next to a mosque, you know?",
        "And so, for years, there wasn't this kind of problem.",
        "And so I think that Syrians are very worried that this kind of violence and this response from the regime is tearing this country apart."

        "And if it's become a sectarian war, if - that leaves everybody on all sides with everything to lose.",
        "Right.",
        "It does.",
        "It also forces some politics, certainly, to enter what is happening here in southern Turkey.",
        "What you hear from the rebels is that the most religiously conservative, the Islamist forces among the rebels, are actually getting the most funding, especially from the Gulf.",
        "They have the most weapons.",
        "They have the most money.",
        "It's the Salafis, the most conservative group here, and the Muslim Brotherhood, also a conservative Islamist group, they are the most powerful - not so much inside, but you find that the rebels need the weapons.",
        "They need the money.",
        "And so they will say, yes, I'm for you.",
        "Yes, I am an Islamist.",
        "Yes, I will grow my beard.",
        "I, you know, I will do whatever it takes to get your weapons.",
        "And so the concern here is that those groups may turn on each other as this conflict goes on.",
        "If there's no organization of the rebel forces, if anybody can fund anybody else who moves in with weapons who makes a great video - and that is how it works here, Neal.",
        "You have an operation, and you have a cameraman with you, because you have to put it up on YouTube so your funders can see that you are successful.",
        "And they all kind of sheepishly laugh about that, but they all do it.",
        "And so that's why there are so many videos of - well, now, more and more these days - of IEDs in Syria, the improvised explosive devices.",
        "You bet.",
        "And so many attacks on checkpoints where you don't tell the rebel commanders two miles away that you're going to do it.",
        "And they're the ones that are going to pay the price when the army just starts shooting indiscriminately.",
        "But what you're doing is you're shooting a video, because you have to show that you are a successful commander on the ground.",
        "It's really a little crazy.",
        "And...",
        "But you do get funding.",
        "And the other situation that we have, you mentioned the shoot-down of a Turkish reconnaissance jet.",
        "Is there tension on the border?",
        "Is there a feeling, one more, and this could turn into something really ugly with Turkey and Syria?",
        "The - it's - we are on a hair-trigger here at the border.",
        "There's no doubt about it.",
        "The Turks have made it very clear that if those helicopters come to the border, they will shoot them down.",
        "On the other hand, the Syrian president said in an interview in a Turkish newspaper: I am sorry that we shot down - I regret that we shot down a Turkish jet.",
        "And I'm sure that he is, because those helicopters have not come near the border since the Turks made their threat.",
        "So I think that both sides are prickly, but neither side wants to bring this to that level of conflict on the border."
