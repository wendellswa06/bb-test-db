        "I guess, what - well, how tall she was.",
        "I mean, she's so tall.",
        "It was just - I mean - and I know models are tall, but she is like - because she's very skinny and tall so I was just sort of stunned by that.",
        "But also, like I said, just her spirit, just her, you know, sort of feeling of, I'm grateful to be here, none of these, you know, had to happen to me, I'm still - she seems still very surprised even years later that this actually occurred, that she became the supermodel and now has a sort of amazing life.",
        "So I think, I guess, I assume by now she'll be jaded with the business and jaded with, you know, the celebrity of it.",
        "But she's the - she still seems to be enjoying it.",
        "And did she talk a little bit about what it's like for African-American models?",
        "It was a thing for a while.",
        "Well, I know she made the point that, unfortunately, because now it's all about celebrities, you know, you don't see models of color on the covers because they're using celebrities.",
        "And that definitely makes it hard to get a cover because other than Beyonce or maybe Halle Barry, no one else is going to get a cover.",
        "So she said that's been really disappointing, to sort of see that turn in the industry.",
        "But overall, she thinks, you know, the runway shows and designers have been actually very supportive of African-American models.",
        "And, finally, I don't know how much you got into the book, but are there any tidbits or surprises you could share with us from the book?",
        "Well, I think - basically, when she talks about - the more moving part is when we're talking about her dad, who died when she was 12.",
        "And basically, her just, you know, sort of saying that, you know, he died from poverty.",
        "Basically, just not having enough to eat, not having the medical care he deserved.",
        "And, you know, we hear this all the time, but she says it and she explains it in such, you know, sort of painful, you know, sort of flashbacks because she had such a close relationship with her father."

        "Well, Madeleine, analysts think that Federal Reserve is getting creative here, taking a new step to ease the credit crunch and at the same time allow banks to save face.",
        "This program auctions $20 billion for banks to bid on.",
        "The interest rate for the loans that they're bidding on is 4.65 percent, and that's lower than the standard 4.75 percent banks would have to pay at the Fed discount window.",
        "Quick refresher here.",
        "The discount window or that discount rate is just the interest rate charged to commercial banks and other institutions on loans they got from their local Federal Reserve Bank lending facility.",
        "So - anyway, before this program, many banks that actually needed cash wouldn't go to this discount window.",
        "Economist Mark Zandi with Moody's Economy.com says it's stigmatized, you know, it's seen by investors that, you know, if a bank is going to the discount window, it must be in serious trouble.",
        "And Zandi says this new option from the Fed gives banks a better excuse to seek a fat loan."

        "We can get cheap money, so we're here because we want to, not because we need the cash.",
        "So Janet, the banks are just snapping up these loans?",

        "Some investors actually say, you know, it should be even lower, the rate should be lower.",
        "But banks ended up making 93 bids on more than $60 billion worth of these loans.",
        "And believe it or not, Zandi says that's a small amount of cash, but he thinks it's going to grow, and another auction like this is going to be held tomorrow.",
        "So the banks will be able to get more money.",
        "Does that mean they will then loan out more money?",
        "Well, that is the hope, that this is going to ease the credit crunch, but it might not be the reality, because banks are hoarding cash right now.",
        "Zandi says, you know, no one is sure which institution is going to go under next.",
        "You know, today we heard Morgan Stanley announced a $9.4 billion write down from bad loans, and Merrill Lynch and Citicorp made similar announcements about write downs.",
        "And Zandi says it's not done.",
        "He expects the write downs will reach $300 billion.",
        "My guess is we're a third, maybe if we're lucky halfway through the write downs, so we've got another 150 billion plus to go.",
        "That's a lot.",
        "And there are probably some institutions that are on the very edge of solvency and no one really knows who's next.",
        "So Madeleine, while the markets and the banks and all of us wait for those other shoe to drop, Zandi thinks it's very possible that the Federal Reserve is going to lower its discount rate again in January, if not before then.",
