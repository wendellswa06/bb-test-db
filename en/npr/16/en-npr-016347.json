        "The state of Rwandan democracy is where we begin our recent conversation with Rwanda's current foreign minister, Louise Mushikiwabo.",
        "It's been noted by everyone that Rwanda has had a remarkable economic recovery and has remained relatively secure in recent years.",
        "But also that there has not been an opening of political space, that Rwanda is not nearly as politically open as many people might like it to be.",
        "When will it be time for a political opening in Rwanda?",
        "I don't think there is anything happening in Rwanda politically that's not happening in many other parts of the world.",
        "And I think also perhaps because the recovery of Rwanda and the advancement we've seen in the last 20 years is perhaps unprecedented for a country that was basically nonexistent 20 years ago.",
        "Maybe that puts Rwanda on a level of expectations that is not realistic.",
        "We do have elections.",
        "We decide how elections should be conducted.",
        "You have to remember, when our constitution was basically written from scratch after the genocide, what was on the minds of Rwandan people and leaders was stability.",
        "And again, this is according to deliberate choices that were made by people of this country.",
        "You know, I believe you mentioned that just before we began this conversation, you were meeting a delegation from the U.S.",

        "Did I hear that correctly?",
        "Correct.",
        "Now, that's very interesting because, of course, there is the question of remembering the Holocaust.",
        "And you had this genocide in Rwanda...",
        "Yes.",
        "...which I'm sure people want to remember.",
        "But at the same time, they want to move past it.",
        "How do you deal with that?",
        "I tell you its very difficult.",
        "And, you know, as we mark 20 years after the genocide, we realize that on one hand, we have done so well as a nation.",
        "But we are still a long way.",
        "We live with an inbuilt fragility, having to do with the dark history of the genocide.",
        "So I'll say it's a very difficult balance.",
        "If you consider the whole justice versus reconciliation, for us it cannot be versus.",
        "It has to be justice and reconciliation.",
        "Because had we gone the classic route of justice, we would have a broken country because of the numbers involved, because of the level of brainwashing and propaganda by the state that committed genocide.",

        "As she learns how to make pierogies from her grandmother, I'm just going to sit there and kind of see the process and see this tradition passed down from grandmother to grandchild, which should be interesting.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And to save me a mispronunciation, what is the name of your team?",
        "Yeah.",

        "What makes this sun different from what most people think of an eclipse is that the orbit of the moon is an ellipse.",

        "You just take some object, punch a real tiny hole in it and then project an image onto an object behind.",
        "And you'll see a projection of the sun.",
