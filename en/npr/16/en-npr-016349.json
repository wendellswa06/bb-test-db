        "And do overnight workers ever really adjust to their sleep schedule?",
        "It's really - most of them never adjust and for some of the reasons that have already been laid out, that on the commute home, typically in the morning, they're exposed to very bright outdoor levels of light, which kind of reinforced their biological clock that it's daytime and time to be awake.",
        "And then also for the reason that on days off, they want to adopt a schedule that allows them to interact with the rest of the world, and so they don't maintain the same night schedule on their days off as they do on workdays.",

        "So is it unfair to expect locomotive engineers or air traffic controllers or doctors on overnight shifts in emergency rooms to work through the night?",

        "So we know that there are many countermeasures that can be used, like brief naps, using caffeine, getting up and walking around.",
        "And if those things are scheduled, and if the time off is scheduled and the shift rotation is scheduled, we know that some of those things can minimize the problems that happen on the night shift.",
        "They can't always eliminate them entirely, but there are many things that can be done to minimize problems on the night shift.",
        "But many employers don't take those into account, and, you know, many employees themselves also, you know, work the night shift so that they can do other things during the day.",
        "So they don't set aside the time that they should to try to get the amount of sleep that they should.",
        "Here's an email we have from David(ph): How does rate power naps, where you go semi-conscious for 15 or 20 minutes but never fall deeply asleep?",
        "This is much more refreshing than a nap where you fall relatively deeply asleep for a short period.",
        "So power naps, so these sort of brief, 20-, 25-minute naps, have been shown to be the most effective things in sort of giving you a pickup and then allowing you to be much more alert for several hours afterwards.",
        "And so for a nap to really work to help someone stay awake for the rest of the night shift, it should be fairly short because if it's too long, you can go into the really deep stages of sleep that, when you come out of them, those are when you feel really groggy.",
        "And so you can something which is called sleep inertia if you fall too deeply asleep, and so that's why very brief naps of, 15, 20, 25 minutes are actually the best and the most refreshing, if you can do that on your break during the night shift.",
