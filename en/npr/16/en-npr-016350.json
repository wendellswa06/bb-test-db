        "regularly work evening, night or rotating schedules.",
        "That's based on 2004 figures from the Labor Department.",
        "Men are more likely than women to work an alternate shift, and blacks more likely than whites, Latinos or Asians.",

        "And we stay awake on post for - you know, after going on patrol for eight hours a day, sweating all day long, having not a lot of food, not a lot of sleep, not a lot of rest at all, six, seven, eight, nine hours with no moonlight, no kind of sunlight, sitting there staring through our NVGs."

        "Your night-vision goggles, yeah.",
        "Right, right, sorry about that.",
        "The thing that makes us stay awake - and I've seen Marines do incredible things, because it's just our sense of purpose of what we're doing for our country and the fear of if we do fall asleep, the consequences of our actions of falling asleep, whether it's us getting killed or everybody inside our friendly lines getting killed.",
        "And what I don't understand is that these air traffic controllers and stuff like that, why they don't have this sense of purpose as well, is that - it's the fear of the consequences of our actions if we fall asleep.",
        "And fear, obviously it's your buddies who would be at risk.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I wonder if you - Jeanne Duffy, if you've thought about that.",
        "So I haven't thought about that specific situation, but I think to imagine that it's just a matter of will, to be able to will yourself to stay awake, is - you know, it's not just a matter of will.",
        "This is a sort of overwhelming biological need that we have.",
        "And it may be in certain situations where, you know, you have sort of a lot of adrenaline because the situation you're in, that that may help you to kind of focus your attention and stay awake.",
        "But it's not true that you can - you know, if you just try hard enough, you don't need to sleep.",
        "Dutch, is that your experience?",
        "Is it adrenaline, do you think?"

        "It's kind of like, I guess, doing a drug.",
        "You know, you build up a tolerance.",
        "Like I said, it's this sense of purpose.",
        "It's - you know, even though after being over there for, you know, seven months in Iraq and then seven months in Afghanistan, you know, you get to a certain point where you're not scared to death, but you just know inside your heart, inside your sense of being, that I cannot fall asleep.",
        "Otherwise it'll be detrimental to me, I'll let down my family, I'll let down my friends, and people might get killed.",
        "All right, Dutch, thanks very much for the call, appreciate it.",
        "Can I add one thing, please?",

        "This is for the neuroscientist.",
        "I've been involved in transcendental meditation and things like this, and I know that we've had brain scans and stuff, and I've gone through, when I haven't had sleep for a long time, and I've gone into states of transcendental meditation for 15 minutes, half hour, and I feel well-rested, like more than if I actually get regular sleep.",
        "Yeah, so that may be sort of putting your brain into one of these states.",
        "It's akin to a power nap, rather than, you know, falling into a deep stage of sleep.",
        "So this does exist?",
        "You can actually rejuvenate and revitalize your body through, like you said, a power nap?",
        "Exactly.",
        "It's a short-lasting effect.",
        "It won't last you 24 hours.",
        "But it will last for several - it can last for several hours after a power nap.",

        "Joe?",
        "Well, I was just going to say, I mean, I don't - I'm not in any way prepared to contradict Dutch's experience of staying awake in this position.",
        "But I will say that one thing I learned when I was doing sleep research, before I became a journalist, is that self-reporting is a difficult tool to rely on.",
        "And it is hard to know sometimes, when you have fallen asleep and aren't actually aware of it, and you wake up and maybe you don't even notice that you have fallen asleep.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Now, presumably if you're standing up and, you know, you wake up and you're falling on the ground, then you know something changed.",
        "But I'm just saying that a lot of times people say: Oh, I didn't sleep at all last night.",
        "And if I go to a sleep lab, you know, I won't sleep at all.",
        "And you put them in bed, and they wake up in the morning, and you say: How did you sleep?",
        "Oh, 15 minutes.",
        "But if you look at the record, the polygraph record of what their brain is doing, they're asleep two, three, four hours.",
        "So self-reporting, very difficult.",
        "And do not think that I am in any way disparaging or disagreeing or not believing what Dutch is saying.",

        "I think that's a really good point because we - in the laboratory studies, when we are recording people's brainwaves, we'll often have them close their eyes, and we can see that they're sleeping and, you know, a few seconds later we'll wake them up because we see that they're asleep and they're not supposed to be.",
        "Oh, no, I wasn't sleeping.",
        "Even though we sort of have the evidence right there in our hands, they have no perception that they were sleeping.",
        "So we can often have these what are called micro-sleep episodes that we are not consciously aware of, and so we think we've managed to stay awake.",
        "Dutch, thanks very much for the call.",
        "All right, God bless you.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Bye-bye.",
        "Here's an email from Kevin: I'd like to know if there are people who are naturally inclined to be awake at night, the so-called natural sentinels.",
        "Joe, is that anything you've ever heard of?",
        "Well, I think Jeanne's probably in a better position to talk about them, but there are certainly people - circadian rhythms are not also fixed in terms of where they occur and how the light actually affects where they start and stop or how they run.",
        "And so there are people who - they call them owls and larks, people who are much better to stay up late and then sleep late, and people who are much better at getting up early in the morning.",
        "And there are even sleep disorders, which Jeanne will know much more about than I, that talk about, you know, how - circadian rhythm disorders, where you really have a hard time keeping your circadian rhythm in the right spot and sleeping in the right time in that spot.",
        "Right, so there definitely are individual differences in when people's preferred time of sleep is.",
        "And we can classify people into sort of early birds and night owls, and night owls are individuals who find it much easier to stay up late night after night and then sleep later in the day, whereas early birds really struggle with that."
