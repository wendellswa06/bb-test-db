        "An early bird, the sort of early bird type of people are ones who have the most difficulty working the night shift because they not only prefer to go to bed and get up early, but they also have more difficulty sleeping during the daytime than night owl types do.",
        "So there are definitely individual differences in when people are able to sleep and when they prefer to sleep.",
        "This email from Christina(ph) in Albany, Oregon: I used to work the night shift at a residential treatment center.",
        "It was my job to do general office work, check on inpatients every half hour, and then clean the facility.",
        "It took a while for me not to nearly fall asleep during my eight-hour shift.",
        "The harder part was being able to go to sleep once I got off work.",

        "And I actually avoid caffeine for long-lasting (unintelligible) my mom's a nurse and she taught me the trick of drinking a lot of water.",

        "And so night shift workers tend to have higher rates of obesity and are more likely to develop things like diabetes, because their eating at a time when their body sort of isn't prepared to deal with that food.",
        "Night workers also tend to eat a little - few more calories than day shift workers do, maybe in an attempt to try to keep themselves awake.",

        "Thank you.",

        "So there are still, you know, 24-hour shifts that happen to doctors-in-training.",
        "And we, you know - sleep researchers don't believe that you can learn how to make good decisions when you're sleep-deprived.",

        "Then I got a new supervisor who had had the same job and would sleep on the job and - but I got fired for sleeping on the job.",
        "And I think your expert there makes a good point that people don't make good decisions when they're sleep-deprived.",

        "It's - I mean, well, the message seems to be - and we've heard it a couple of times, is you can only go so far in cheating your body.",
