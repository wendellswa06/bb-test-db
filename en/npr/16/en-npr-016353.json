        "But no, she never did reveal to me that she was hopping trains from time to time.",
        "And how much about her life did she tell you?",
        "Well, she told me quite a lot.",
        "A lot of her talk was mostly in philosophies, you know, and things that I have learned from her journal that she - that I got after she passed.",
        "One of the things I gather confused you a bit is she told you that she'd learned how to cook over an open fire down there in New Orleans.",
        "Exactly, yeah, and I would ask her: Well, Katie, why would you have to cook over an open fire?",
        "And why would you have to learn how to make coffee over an open fire?",
        "I wasn't clear on that, and anytime I would question her, she would, you know, become sharp and say, Mother, I don't have time for these questions, I only have a short time on the phone.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "And the other thing was you kept hearing trains in the background.",
        "Yes, exactly.",
        "I was like, why, why do the trains - I mean, you sound like you're on a train.",
        "No, we're just really close to the tracks.",
        "And of course after seeing all the videos and the fire and whatnot, I noticed that they were definitely right next to the track.",
        "For greater access, I guess, and the warehouse was a convenient place to live, and a bunch of kids, not just your daughter, were living there, and she was really, I guess, part of a - I'm not sure community, but transient group of people who connected and reconnected and knew each other sort of.",
        "But what did you learn about this kind of life from her writings?",
        "Well, if you would allow me to, I could read a short excerpt from her journal."

        "Maybe they were happy that way.",

        "Sure, she mentioned her own - the depravity and filth that she lived in, and I think to some degree ironic, but I think there's some truth to that too.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Do you think she was happy?",
        "Oh, I know she was, and I can remember one of the last conversations I had with her.",
