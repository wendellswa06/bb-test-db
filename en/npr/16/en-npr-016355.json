        "At the end of the day, though, I think it is a great lesson for me in loving the daughter that you have rather than the daughter that you thought you wanted to create when you first had that baby.",
        "You don't get that much control.",
        "So you have to learn to love what you have.",

        "She's with us from her office in Chicago, and it's nice to have you with us today.",
        "Hello, Maureen Blaha, are you there?",
        "Hello, can you hear us?",
        "All right, we'll try to get back with her in just a moment.",
        "In the meantime, let's see if we can get another call on the line.",
        "We'll go to Forest(ph), and Forest is another caller from Charlotte.",
        "Yes, hello.",
        "My name is Forest, and I live here in Charlotte.",
        "My daughter is living this lifestyle, and it's totally her decision.",
        "She didn't need to go.",
        "She - we worry about her immensely.",
        "We didn't have any idea that these kids were doing this around the country.",
        "And when I initially heard she was hopping trains and learning to cook birds over a tin can, I was just - was completely devastated.",
        "And now after hearing some people on your show and realizing that these are choices that these kids are making, and this doctor from Charlotte, it's really opening my eyes.",
        "My comment is my family is always - she'll call me from time to time, and very seldom will she ask for any money.",
        "And the first thing as a parent I want to do is of course send her money.",
        "She'll ask for $15, and I'll send her 50.",
        "But of course with no checking account, it has to be done through the Wal-Marts and Western Unions of the world.",
        "Well, my entire family is telling me to stop this practice, that I'm only helping her live this lifestyle.",
        "So not too long ago, shortly after Christmas, we decided to kind of put the stop to the funding, and I was always concerned about her not calling, but the calls still come, and she's as happy as she's ever been and completely understands that I don't want to send her money.",
        "And it's very puzzling as a parent but - and very concerning, but it's tough to deal with, but it's something that you do have to live with.",
        "Forest, I don't envy you trying to get to sleep at night.",

        "They will make this decision on their own.",
        "I think every parent who I spoke with recognized that the only power they had was the power of expressing their love to their child and that that love would bring them back.",
        "Some parents were like I'm going to be strict, and I'm going to do this, and I'm going to set higher rules and higher standards.",
        "Other parents were like I am going to open my heart to you and approve of whatever you do.",
        "And neither approach has any effect.",

        "It's tough to understand as a parent, but it's nice to know that it's not something that I did wrong or that her mother did wrong.",

        "Nevertheless, a lot of people who run away from home and become transients are very vulnerable people.",
        "Absolutely, yeah.",

        "You know, they'll do anything for a warm bed, a hot meal, from panhandling to selling drugs to selling their bodies.",
        "So it's a very scary situation for kids to be alone and on the street.",
        "Not everyone finds the kinds of friends and support groups that the kids we're talking about did.",
        "And it is important to remember that parents too have resources, and I know you try to help."

        "And when we handle calls - last year we handled over 100,000 calls - about half of them are from adults, and that would be parents whose child has gone missing or parents who might say she was adorable at 12, and now she's 15 and we can't communicate.",
        "And we are there to listen to anyone who calls, either a child or a parent or someone else concerned about a child, to help focus on really what is the main issue and to help come up with a plan of action so that the caller at the end of the call has somewhere to turn.",
        "Now, most of the kids in this fire, I think all of them, in fact, were over 18.",
        "That changes things, doesn't it?",
        "It does a bit, except at the National Runaway Switchboard we are here to support kids, and we define them even into adolescence and up to age 24, because a lot of youth are not really able to be on their own, even though most states have 18 as the age of majority.",
        "A lot of them are still struggling, you know, depending on perhaps what their family background was, depending on their education and job situation.",
        "And so we are here to support those that are even over 18, and for parents of children that are in risky and vulnerable situations.",

        "Well, they're not the - I agree with you, but it's not the population that I was involved with.",
        "They were mostly 18, and had tried a number of ways to connect with the world, and it hadn't worked, you know.",
        "My daughter was in her second semester of her freshman year of college when she said, I'm out of here.",
        "And there are a lot of young people who have that same experience.",
        "They're in college, or they're in a job like at Pizza Hut, and it just seems like they can't make it in the world.",
        "And every time they come home, people are scowling at them.",
        "And so the urge to shake off the scowls with this kind of blind act of daring is something that appeals to them.",
