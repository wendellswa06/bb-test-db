        "What do you say to Americans who are so weary of this 10-year war, and also the hundreds of billions of dollars that has been sunk into it, tax dollars - what do you say to those people who just want out?",
        "What I say in the case of Afghanistan is, you know, this is where 9/11 came from.",
        "We're engaged with the same adversary that gave shelter and space to al-Qaida to plan those attacks - the Taliban.",
        "And the Taliban, in the intervening 10 years, has not become any kinder or gentler.",
        "So if we decide we're tired, we want to go home, without having established the conditions for a stable, secure Afghanistan, the Taliban will be back.",
        "And they will bring al-Qaida back with them.",
        "The reason al-Qaida isn't here now is because we are.",
        "I know people are tired of this war.",
        "I am tired of this war.",
        "I've been deployed for five years since 9/11, going on two more.",
        "But if we think the war is expensive - and it is it's a lot cheaper than another 9/11."
