        "Pakistan is generally understood to be a key to any sort of reconciliation with the Afghan Taliban.",
        "From your time there, what would it take for Pakistan to give up what is generally thought to be their position, and that is an unstable Afghanistan is good for Pakistan until the point at which they can control what's happening here, that they will have some power over who's running Afghanistan, as they did the Taliban back in the '90s?",
        "I think what they want to see is a stable, secure Afghanistan that does not in any way threaten them.",
        "But I don't think they want to see a weak Afghanistan that can be exploited by who knows which groups, that could be dangerous to them.",
        "So what's it take to get, I mean what is friendly to Pakistan?",
        "Why aren't they just right now urging everyone to the negotiating table, especially the Afghan Taliban that they've been protecting for the last 10 years?",
        "And don't I wish they would.",

        "We need Pakistan's cooperation to make that happen.",
        "Although also in the works, I think, what is the state of the negotiations for American military staying here?",
        "How would you describe what is being worked on?",
        "Well, there are talks under way in Washington between an Afghan team and ourselves on a strategic partnership document.",
        "We have also agreed that, as you know, by the end of 2014, Afghanistan will have full responsibility for security throughout the country.",
        "What is not yet determined is whether Afghanistan will desire a military presence after 2014.",
        "Would that be desirable?",
        "It's too soon to tell.",
        "One thing, though, that I can tell you is that we do not seek, nor do the Afghans desire, any permanent U.S.",
        "or other foreign military bases in this country.",
        "If there were to be a follow-on presence of some sort, it would not be permanent, and it would pose no threat to any of Afghanistan's neighbors.",
        "That's Ambassador Ryan Crocker.",
        "He sat down with us in his office at the American embassy in Kabul.",
        "NPR's Juan Forero has the story from Sao Paolo."

        "Well, I suppose what is particular is that the reaction has been rather overheated, precisely because the political elite was always rather tolerant, and still is, but tolerant in a rather paternalistic way.",
        "Meaning that if people complained, say, about too many immigrants moving into their old working class areas, they were very quickly dismissed as being racist and not politically correct and so on.",
        "And so the once the floodgates were opened and populist leaders came up who articulated such feelings, often in a rather crude fashion, people began to voice these kinds of complaints, perhaps more violently than they would do in countries where there was less of the paternalistic tradition.",
