        "At one time, many parents in such adoptions rejected racial categorization and tried to raise their children as if racial differences did not matter, raise them colorblind.",
        "As those kids have grown up, research shows they've emerged more confused about identity and that colorblindness created discordance rather than unity.",
        "And with more and more kids being adopted by parents who don't look like them, the question of how best to raise these children will not go away."
