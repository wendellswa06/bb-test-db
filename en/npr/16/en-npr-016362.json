        "Well, let's talk about this back and forth that we had tonight, Mitt Romney demanding an apology, saying that President Obama has demeaned the leadership he should be bringing to the country.",
        "E.J., what do you make of this?",
        "Well, you know, after watching a bunch of those interviews, I started wondering whether Romney was engaged in damage control or damage enhancement.",
        "I mean, yes, he did get his shots in at Obama, he was clearly counter-punching against Obama.",
        "But there were two things that really struck me about this.",
        "One was the absolute nature of his denial of any involvement in Bain after February of 1999.",
        "No role whatsoever in the management of Bain, he said, after February '99, on CNN.",
        "He said a similar thing again, no involvement - denied any involvement whatsoever on ABC.",
        "And I think this could come back to haunt him because there are press releases out there listing him as a kind of part-time CEO.",
        "He was clearly involved in some ways.",
        "And so, I was curious about why that blanket denial.",
        "The other thing that struck me was the firmness with which he said, no more tax returns, he's going to put out two and that's it.",
        "And that very firmness, I think, is actually going to increase pressure on him to release more.",
        "I would suspect the Obama campaign is going to go straight at the tax return issue, partly on the grounds of the foreign investments he has and also asking, you know, what kind of taxes did he pay.",
        "So, I'm not sure how much good these five interviews did him tonight.",
        "Mona Charen, what do you think?",
        "And would Mitt Romney be better off releasing more tax records, which he says he will not do?",
        "Well, won't shock you to learn that I disagree with my friend, E.J.",
        "You know, I actually think this represents the desperation of the Obama campaign.",
        "They have been grabbing at every little shred that they can - a story in the Washington Post that suggests that Bain was responsible for off-shoring or outsourcing, they weren't making a distinction.",
        "And now, you know, this story that Romney was involved with Bain after he said he wasn't.",
        "Yeah, I think a lot of the adoptees talked about ways in which it was useful in the workplace or to connect with white people, to have a sense of closeness and familiarity: White people weren't the other.",
        "And so that certainly played out in place where they were, in adulthood, having to negotiate predominately white contexts.",
        "This is another quote from some of the people, one of the people you interviewed: I remember there was a girl named Ebony(ph), and she could not believe I had been adopted by white people.",
        "She was like: Wow, you were adopted by white people.",
        "Are they nice to you?",
        "Do they treat you well?",
        "And that was a shock to me because it was the first time I realized that black people might not get treated well by white people.",
        "I was teased by white people, but at the same time, I had white people sticking up for me.",
        "You know, I didn't feel like all of them were against me.",
        "Right, so when you live up close to any group, right, you're able to see the pros and the cons and the advantages and disadvantages.",
        "And here, she's talking about really becoming aware of I think a couple things: first, another group's perception of people who she's very familiar, a group that she's very familiar with; but also making the point that being a trans-racially adopted person is a very political existence that people have very powerful opinions about, even though they themselves have not lived that experience."

        "And so you oftentimes, when you're not with your family, and automatically outed as a trans-racial adoptee, you have these opportunities to really hear how strongly people feel about that.",
        "On the other side, there are often times when you go out with your family, and people will come up to you and voice their opinions, as well.",
        "So many adoptees talked about those experiences, also.",
        "Sure, and feeling that even though they felt loved by their white parents and felt very comfortable in what amounted to a bubble of suburbia, those who were raised there, I think there was this one, Steven(ph), again who said he would have felt adrift, dead somehow, had he not connected with the outside world.",
        "Right, and so there's a part of many of these adoptees where, especially as they grow older, and their worlds broaden and expand, where they start to realize that there is a part of them that they may not have had the opportunity to experience.",
        "And that oftentimes is, in part, a collective experience of their racial self and their racial heritage.",
        "And so that's certainly not true of all adoptees, but many of the ones that I talked to talked about how very important it was for them to access more than just books or dolls or a festival but a community that they felt they were a part of and that that was an experience that oftentimes was taken for granted that wasn't a part of their childhoods growing up.",

        "And the one thing that I try to do differently that my parents were not able to do is talk to my biological children about what other kids might say to them and what negative experiences they may have because we weren't prepared for that.",
        "My parents tried to race us in a colorblind sort of utopia, and we weren't prepared for the negativity that we were going to get about our brother.",
        "We didn't understand it, and we didn't know how to handle it."

        "Go ahead.",

        "But one of them that you cite is a feeling that this is endorsing the aims of the civil rights movement.",
        "Right, and so it's oftentimes with the best of intentions that parents do this and reflects maybe how they hope the world will be someday.",
        "But as your caller just indicates that oftentimes what this ends up doing is having children be meeting the world, the real world, unprepared.",
        "And then there's not a family norm of having the ability to come home and talk about it because it's real.",
        "And so kids are met with some hurtful situations that they're unprepared for and therefore unprepared to deal with in a healthy and strength-based way."

        "And this research as in part due to your upbringing, no?",
        "Right.",
        "So it was largely due to my upbringing and also having been a child welfare worker and feeling very dissatisfied with some of the ways in which these issues were grappled with, as either it's a terrible thing, and we should never do it, or it's really, really great, and everybody should do it."
