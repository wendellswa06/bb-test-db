        "That makes them the largest group of internationally adopted persons in the United States.",

        "They cited racism and teasing as reasons for confusion about their identities in childhood and said contact with other Asian people helped them learn to identify as Korean-American when they were adults.",
        "So if you joined your family in a trans-racial adoption, how did your adoptive parents address your background as they raised you?",

        "Well, you know, trans-racial families aren't just adoptive families.",
        "I think it's interesting to think about some of the lessons that Gina's talking about, some of the lessons than in eRA research which is very extensive across all the races and all the types of adoptions.",
        "And to realize that this applies to lots of families in America that were formed through marriage.",

        "You know, you become a multiracial or multiethnic family.",
        "And I think in adoption in particular, that's a useful model in which to think about it.",
        "We become a multiethnic or multiracial family when we bring in a child who is of a different race or ethnicity, and that really helps define, as Gina was saying earlier, the family as a unit, because we understand each other as being a whole and not just those separate parts.",
        "And when we talk about this, the idea of trying to raise kids who are colorblind, was this something that was more predominate a decade or two decades ago than it might be now?",
        "Right.",
        "So we have really simple ideas about what race means.",
        "And yet there are very...",
        "Oh, you bet.",
        "Social workers used to tell parents: You just raise your child - adoptive parents - you just raise your child as though you gave birth to her.",
        "Well, you're white, and she's Korean.",
        "That's an interesting trick you've got there.",
        "So the result was things like what you said, what showed up in our research, than an extraordinary majority of trans-racially adopted kids, as kids, grew up wishing they were white or thinking they were white, not wanting to look in a mirror."

        "Somebody when they're six, seven, eight, nine years old might identify very strongly with their parents and their adoptive family.",
        "That might change, though, when they're in high school or college.",
        "Well, I think you would assume that, although you have to remember a lot of these kids' contexts, in terms of race, don't change until after they're done with high school, and then they leave to either go to college or move out of the town.",
        "And so many adoptees grow up in predominately white contexts, where people know them since they were in first and second and third grade.",
        "And so they develop an identity and a way of surviving and living that incorporate being known by the people who are around them and oftentimes wait until they're 18, 19, 20 to have some of their first-time cultural immersion experiences.",
        "And that can be quite a shock.",
        "It can be quite a shock if you're not prepared for what that -for all of the questions that come and all of the assumptions about who you are and what your life experience has been like.",

        "And you have to - you have to acknowledge whatever difference that child has, and you nurture it, or you fix it.",

        "Ms. Millbratt(ph)?",
        "Right, right.",
        "So what you're seeing is sort of this next generation that, as a trans-racial adoptee, makes me very happy that some of the message has gotten through about a couple things in that email: one, just, you know, taking seriously a friend's experience and thinking through as a parent now what can she do so that she doesn't repeat that experience.",
        "And two, also that idea of open adoption, which is becoming increasingly more important.",
        "I think it's really going to produce, not just for trans-racial adoptees but for all adoptees, hopefully, a very different sort of experience as an adopted person who is able to retain some level of connection with their own biological ties, be they racial, cultural, but just understanding biologically where you come from.",
        "And three, reaching out to communities that can provide those supports and missing pieces that may not be within the family is a great shift and change in trans-racial adoptive parenting."
