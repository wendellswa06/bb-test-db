        "I wanted to read another of the stories you tell in your study, Gina.",
        "This is a man named Steven(ph), who recalled attending his family's church when a visiting black minister preached about the importance of racial socialization for black children, and his parents not including him as having those same needs.",
        "I remember him talking about how it's really important to immerse black children in their culture, and my parents were smiling and agreeing, and I was just sitting there, bobbling with anger, bubbling with anger because I was, like: that's not what we had.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "So, I mean, some of this, I take, is a quote of -this is sort of the disconnection that oftentimes happens between parents and kids, where parents are thinking they're doing something and totally lost on the kid, and then, on another level, questioning whether or not his parents were not thinking of him as black because he was biracial.",
        "And so sometimes that happens also where people think of people who are mixed race as not having the same sort of needs for a connection to culture or to a racial ethnic group that isn't white, as do children who don't come from racially mixed or obviously racially mixed background.",
        "And so, in that case, he's having to really think through, how did I get here that we're in this position where my parents are ascribing to a belief that is not practiced in our home?",
        "Let's go next to David, David calling from San Francisco.",
        "David, you're there?",
        "And David, I guess, has left us.",
        "Let's go instead to Nick, and Nick on the line from Sacramento.",
        "How are you guys doing today?",
        "Good.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Actually, I grew up in a really small country town, and I grew up -I'm white.",
        "And my dad was actually a drug dealer, and as a result, I got taken away.",
        "But what ended up happening is I got put in black foster home, and I grew up with black people.",
        "And when I went back to my home, my birth parents' home, I got chastised a lot because I talk black and I act black.",
        "In fact, I had to teach myself how to act more white as I got older and got into the business world so that we're actually accepted more.",
        "And the one thing that I just really would like to drive home here is regardless of the color of the parent or the child, each child will always recognize love coming from somebody.",
        "If you give that child the love that it really knows that is from your heart, they'll grow up knowing that, and that has nothing to do with race.",
        "Thank you very much."

        "Nick, before you go...",
        "Sure.",
        "...was there something that was particularly challenging to do to learn to be a white person?",
        "Well, it's funny because like I'm more comfortable today even around black people than I am around white people.",
        "And my wife, who's also white, she constantly tells me like when I get around black people, all of a sudden my dialect changes and everything else.",
        "And she doesn't understand that that's more comfortable for me.",
        "So it is hard because you feel like you're becoming another person when you're around, like, elements, like when I deal with my customers or anything.",
        "It's difficult because you feel like I have to be this person in order to, you know, to maintain in the business environment.",

        "It's interesting.",

        "And boy, this must add a whole another layer to that.",
        "Well, you know, there is a small - there's a minority of adoptions from foster care - mainly from foster care these take place - that are African-Americans or blacks, maybe sometimes Latinos, who adopt white kids.",
        "So this is not - this is an unusual phenomenon, but not really rare.",
        "It is a very good example.",
        "Again, forgive the pun, but the subtitle of my book is \"\"How the Adoption Revolution is Transforming Our Families.\"\" This is a really good example of how families are changing.",
        "They're becoming multiracial, multiethnic.",
        "It's black parents with white kids.",
        "It's a lot of white parents with kids of every color.",
        "And that has a really genuine transformative effect, not just as with this caller, not just on him and his family, but, you know, he's part of a larger community.",
        "When you have white parents with African-American kids and their last name is Irish and they're at St. Patrick's Day parade, you know, this forces us to think about who we look like, what we - who we are as a nation and where we're going with it.",
        "We're talking with Adam Pertman of the Evan B.",

        "And, Gina Samuels, I just wanted to follow up on what we were just talking about.",
        "It also reinforces, as some of your research suggests, that we be careful about making judgments about people who don't act as if in - or speak in the ways that we anticipate that they will or expect that they will.",
        "Scott Finn of West Virginia Public Broadcasting has more.",
        "Right.",
        "And so we sort of assume that when somebody checks a box African-American, they're going to have this matching way that we've stereotyped what an African-American is; where maybe they live, what their family structure is and definitely how they talk, how they wear their hair, et cetera.",
        "And so this caller earlier, who has that - is articulating that experience of what it's like to grow up with a cultural context and a racial context that does not match his racial appearance, and how you navigate that if you decide that you need to make other people feel comfortable with who you are or if you just go ahead and be that and watch other people's discomfort.",
        "But it's not an unusual way of coping as somebody who's lived in a mixed race or multiracial or multicultural context.",

        "He was pulled over walking down the street in our neighborhood, pulled over by the police exclusively on the basis of his skin color.",
        "And it's a white neighborhood, and somebody called in and said there's a kid who don't belong here.",
        "And that brings up the whole negative side of racism.",

        "Well, this is a really great example why we can't be colorblind.",
        "If a white parent is raising a kid of color, the responsibility is not just to make this person feel comfortable in their own skin, which is obviously essential, but also to empower that child, and then growing up as a youth and an adult, empower them to deal with the society around them.",
        "And that does mean letting them know you can't wear that red bandana.",
