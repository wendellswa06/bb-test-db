        "Yeah.",
        "And I think, you know, you're caller is making an important point that I think underneath that is, if you address race and you talk about it, then it doesn't have to be the big issue.",
        "But if you don't talk about it at all, then it becomes the big issue.",
        "And so...",

        "The big elephant in the room that nobody can talk about and all of a sudden it grows to be far bigger than it needed to be.",
        "And so it's great when the family can talk about it.",
        "And I also think that, you know, when children are five, there are certain issues that happen.",
        "And then when children are 15, there's other issues that happen.",
        "And, as she said, you know, the family grows and will grow through this issue.",
        "And I think the point of my paper is just that - it's hopeful that we have parents that are a little bit further along than their kids in that growth process, so that they can be the adults and be a little bit forward-thinking in anticipating some of these things rather than playing catch-up with their children, as their children go out in the world and experience a version of it that they have yet to experience.",
        "Let's...",
        "It's worth adding - I'm sorry.",
        "No, go ahead.",
        "It's worth adding that when we think about the family that's dealing with these kids as they grow up, it's not just the parents and the siblings.",
        "A lot of the discrimination in our research that we found, or that the adult adoptees reported in our research, was from other relatives, extended family, schoolmates.",
        "So we - that education process, that conversation really has to be pretty broad if we're going to get it right."

        "His high school in Shaker Heights is one of the first in the country to actually accept black students.",
        "And so he wants to distance himself from that.",
        "And I'm always sort of thinking that maybe that was one of the reason he adopted my sister and I.",
        "For example, like we'll get in an amusement park or something growing up and he'll say hi to black families, but he'll sort of just ignore white families.",
        "And it's sort of, from my sister and I, it's a little awkward, because it's sort of like an overcompensation kind of a thing.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Gina Samuels, did any of the people you spoke with have that experience?",
        "Sure.",
        "I think what he's illustrating is that, you know, as much as this is about adoptees' identity process, that there is a racial identity process that is also going on for the parents.",
        "And parents will talk a lot about what this means to have a mixed race child or what it means to have a black child or a Guatemalan child or whatever.",
        "And much of the meaning-making that they attribute to what it is to be a white person who has adopted Child X is really important, as your caller indicates, because children are listening and that has implications for them, the role that they feel they're playing in their parent's life.",
        "So this isn't - I think this is true of all parents.",
        "All parents referenced their children as an extension of who they are.",
        "And when you add race to that, there's ways in which that extension can be a less than helpful framing for kids to understand why they were adopted, the purpose of their adoption in their parents' life.",
        "Thank you, Jason, very much for the call.",
