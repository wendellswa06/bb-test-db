        "Hurricane Katrina wrecked and damaged dozens of Gulf Coast oil and gas platforms and knocked out refineries, but for all its destruction, Katrina will likely mean even bigger profits for most of the major oil companies.",
        "With gas around $3 a gallon, some people are fuming and calling for investigations into whether the oil companies are engaging in price gouging, but many economists insist the prices are not improper.",
        "NPR's Chris Arnold reports.",
        "For many people, it just doesn't seem right that the oil industry should be profiting from a natural disaster that has destroyed much of New Orleans and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless.",

        "The fact of the matter is that oil companies are taking advantage of the situation.",
        "In many parts of the country, there's no real competition at the gasoline pump.",
        "So when there is a disruption in supply, the companies that serve that area can raise the prices almost as much as they really want.",
        "An underlying question here is: Are oil companies profiteering by colluding to jack up prices, or is the run-up in prices just a natural reaction of the market?",
        "It's just market forces.",
        "Stephen Brown is director of energy economics for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.",
        "A number of refineries were knocked out of production.",
        "In fact, four of them are still out of production, amounting to about a little more than 4 percent of US daily oil consumption.",
        "Four percent might not sound like a lot, but the supply of oil was already so tight that it sent a price shock across the country.",
        "Phil Flynn is a vice president of Alaron Trading in Chicago, which trades oil and gas futures.",
        "You know, people when they hear these record profits, it's so easy to get angry and say, `Oh, my gosh, those oil companies are making so much money.",
        "What's going on with them?",
        "We have to remember the oil companies were making record profits before the storm hit.",
        "It's because the demand for oil has been through the roof.",
        "Steven Brown with the Fed says a jump in prices helps rebalance supply and demand--for example, as people start driving less and buying less gas--and already demand is down a bit.",
        "The price of crude oil has fallen back to prestorm levels, even if the price at the pump will likely stay up there for some weeks.",
        "But some experts say supply wouldn't be so tight if oil companies had invested in building more refineries."

        "There really hasn't been any credible evidence of it whatsoever.",
        "And I have to say something else, and that is that, you know, Romney may have faults but nobody has ever said that this is a person who is dishonest, who's a dissembler, who hides things.",
        "And so, you know, I think this allegation that he somehow lied to the SEC, which is what the Obama spokesperson said, it's really over the top and I don't think it actually sticks because Romney does give off that aura of integrity.",
        "Why not just release his tax returns, then, and put that out on the table?",
        "Well, you know, that's the other thing is that these calls for more, you know, more and more tax returns - look, maybe it would be fine to release them, but you know, on the other hand, it would just again distract from the issues that Romney is attempting to get the country to focus on, the issues involved in the campaign.",
        "This would be an opportunity for 10,000 Democratic activists to pore over his tax returns and say, oh, what about this - look, he bought a horse for his wife in 2012, you know, and so on, as if that were important to the country, and it really isn't.",
        "E.J.?",
        "Could I just say, I actually disagree with my friend Mona on the integrity issue itself - which is Romney has said a lot of things in the course of the campaign, you know, Obama has to keep - stop apologizing for America when Obama didn't apologize.",
        "There's a long list of things Romney has said that raise questions about whether he sort of either consistently told the truth or trimmed the truth.",
        "But I think the very fact that Romney chose to go out there tonight is telling us that this Bain Capital story, including the ads, have really hurt Romney - there's polling that suggests that."

        "Of course, in a campaign, an opponent is trying to undercut the other guy, and clearly the Obama people are doing that.",
        "But it's precisely because Romney made his stewardship at Bain Capital so central to why we should make him president - because he says he'd be a job creator - that there were going to be a lot of questions about this.",
        "And as I said earlier, I don't see how he gets away from the tax return issue.",

        "It doesn't seem to me that it's legitimate to hold him responsible for things that Bain may or may not have done after he left.",
        "Do you think that the American voter listening to this conversation, listening to the charges from both campaigns, is going to be so turned off that people will tune out of this campaign all together, if they can?",

        "Your question suggests something that's true, which is - ultimately, this is not the decisive question of the campaign.",
        "The decisive questions have to do with the economy, and what government's role is, and what tax levels different people should pay.",
        "The thing I think about the Bain issue is it does, underlying it, it does raise some questions about how the American economy has been run, what form of capitalism we want.",
