        "Now E.J., you began by taking about the central role of Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, but there is another key player whom you've written about, there has been a lot written about him and that's Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the independent, formerly Democratic senator.",
        "I want to quote back what you wrote in the blog: I think the evidence is overwhelming that Lieberman double-crossed the Democratic leadership and the rest of his colleagues.",
        "That's a strong, strong, strong word.",
        "And Democrats felt burned by him on this in a way they had not felt burned on other things that they were mad about Joe Lieberman for, because they felt that they had finally found a solution to the thorniest problem here and then he blew it up.",
        "And so there is a kind of resentment.",
        "I heard this week from a lot of Democrats, again, including people who are not necessarily sort of longtime foes of Lieberman where I think he created a break now that's going to be very hard for him to heal with many of his colleagues.",
        "David, Senator Lieberman's role?",
        "And the idea that you could win over the senators with the Medicare buy in, which is a solution further to left than the existing proposal, to me was the political nonstarter.",
        "So, I don't understand the anger directed to Lieberman as opposed to all the other 10 senators or so, who've always been opposed to these two things.",
        "Just to answer that, there was a view that there were sort of provisions in the buy in that would have won them over.",
        "The leadership was very strongly of the view that they actually had everybody else and that Lieberman's public announcement really broke the deal."
