        "Nice to see you guys again.",
        "Let's talk first about the Geithner plan -the public-private partnership - looks like Wall Street liked what it heard.",
        "Do you guys really think it's going to work, David Brooks?",
        "Wall Street's incredibly stupid.",
        "The, you know, a couple of weeks ago you had the same plan, they hated it.",
        "Now the guy's the second coming of Adam Smith.",
        "What strikes me about the plan is that it's prudent.",
        "The other alternative was to essentially nationalize the banks as he indicated.",
        "And when you do that, that's sort of irrevocable.",
        "Now we don't really know if that's necessary.",
        "So, he took a more modest step which is this public-private partnerships and if we have to nationalize, do something more drastic, maybe we'll be able to do it now.",
        "But it strikes me as a very prudent way to approach things.",
        "E.",
        "J., it was criticized by some as too good a deal for the private end of the partnership.",
        "Right, indeed it was.",
        "I - I think that President Obama and Secretary Geithner are playing things down the middle, or at least a very particular middle.",
        "On the one hand they are offering a bailout plan for the banks that could well enrich those terrible folks at the hedge funds.",
        "And the critics on the left are saying that they're really not challenging the basic structure of the finance industry.",
        "On the other hand Secretary Geithner also spoke in a very tough way this week about new regulations that he and the administration want to impose on the finance industry.",
        "This will get them criticism from Wall Street, from some folks on the right.",
        "Either this will be not too much of this, not too much of that, just right, or they will find themselves under constant attack from both sides.",
        "At the moment, because the stock market looks pretty good, people are feeling a little better.",
        "So, they're having a fairly good week out of it.",
        "Do you think that between the public-private partnerships and the move for greater regulation and the stress tests, that all of this is pulling together some kind of coherent policy or is it a lot of various improvisations that are addressing one problem after another, David.",
        "I think it's a coherent temperament at least, which is a temperament of activism but yet not completely trusting government A) to set prices to know how much assets are worth, so to try to preserve some sort of market mechanism.",
        "So, I think you do a very moderate temperament there and a desire not to go too far, not to nationalize when it may not be necessary.",
        "E.",
        "J.",
        "let's move on the budget.",
        "Are congressional Democrats likely to cobble together a budget that looks anything like the budget that Barack Obama sent them.",
        "You know, I think when you were looking at accounts this week, on the same day you had stories saying that the Democrats are really changing Obama's budget a lot.",
        "And then you have Peter Orszag, the budget director, saying well actually we're happy with this.",
        "We're winning a big victory.",
        "What's going on here?",
        "I think what's going on here is that the Democrats in Congress are going to make some superficial changes and some of them are kind of sleight of hand changes.",
        "You know, they may cut foreign aid here but then throw in later in a supplemental budget.",
        "They've cut the window on Obama's budget.",
        "They've gone back to certain gimmicks, you know, instead of looking at a 10 year budget we are going to look at a five year budget."

        "I think the one area where you are seeing the administration give ground and accepting it is on cap and trade.",
        "Cap and trade is the system where the government sets a limit on carbon dioxide emissions and then sells permits that give companies the right to pollute.",
        "Right.",
        "It does not look like you're going to have robust action on cap and trade this year.",
        "But on balance I think, the administration is not unhappy with what it's getting.",

        "And what role will Republicans play in that budget process?",
        "Well, I more or less agree.",

        "It's also an incredible source of about $650 billion in revenue.",

        "And whether this is going to be end up being even more expensive then we thought, I think is the core issue.",
        "We're going to have deficits probably in the trillion dollars a year.",

        "But they have not been particularly effective since their budget is not - it's semi-joke, let's be frank about it.",
        "But the rise of deficits as far as the eye can see should be cause for a great concern.",

        "Yeah, and I really went there very skeptical, because it's incredibly poor country.",
        "It's incredibly ill-educated, you've got high school teachers who are illiterate.",
        "And so, can we really turn this into a functioning society.",
        "And I must say the people who are there were unified in their optimism and commitment.",
        "And they're incredibly impressive sort of people.",
        "The Afghan people...",

        "Most of the safe heavens are over in Pakistan.",
