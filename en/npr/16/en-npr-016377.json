        "And then just, I sort of took on the role of a parent.",
        "And an Afghan colleague and I, we began, you know, we tutored them and I made sure they did their homework.",
        "And we really gave them expectations.",
        "They got excited.",
        "They began to have dreams, they started talking about the things that they wanted to do.",
        "And then four months later, I left.",
        "And I told them I'd come back, but I really didn't believe it at that time.",
        "I didn't know what was in store for me in terms of other assignments and I always felt that I had given them expectations, but had left them no place to go.",
        "And the more I thought about it, the more I felt that my relationship with the boys was, in a sense, a metaphor for the world's relationship with Afghanistan - we go in, we promise a lot and then we leave.",
        "And last summer, last spring when the Taliban was making inroads very close to Kabul, I decided I needed to go back and find the boys.",
        "There's a point during your search for them, you're carrying pictures that are obviously four years old at that point, of the boys and trying to locate one and you talked to a man who says why these boys?",
        "There are thousands like them here on the streets of Kabul.",
        "Why don't you help them?",
        "Right, yeah.",
        "And actually I even had adults who would stop me and say why children?",
        "I need help.",
        "And I just explained that I had made a commitment to these boys, and that I had to find these boys.",
        "That it was something I had to do for myself, as much as I had to do for them.",
        "And that's why I was focused on that particular group of children.",
        "You also described in the process of your search, a Kabul greatly changed from four years ago.",
        "It was.",
        "Kabul is somewhat of an illusion.",
        "On the surface, there's all sorts of construction going on.",
        "They have malls now.",
        "You can buy widescreen TVs.",
        "But beneath the surface there's a real anger because again, to use the metaphor, you know, as the boys had expectations of me, so the country had expectations of the United States and the international coalition and five years later or six years later, many people feel their life hasn't improved.",
        "And they see, you know, people drive around in SUVs.",
        "They see the large houses that aid agencies rent and that private security firms rent, and they just see a great disparity between the westerners who were there who they feel should be helping them and what they feel is the result of their presence, which many people just feel isn't that much.",
        "There's a wonderful scene you paint, you and your translator go into a restaurant in one of this sort of gated communities.",
        "And there are a bunch of other people who were brought in by their Afghan drivers.",
        "The drivers, regarded as security risks, are asked to remain outside.",
        "They can't come inside.",
        "Right.",
        "And that, you see that a lot and, you know, it's just, it's the awkward situation of working with people who in many instances, you don't know who is friend or foe.",

        "And that's what my colleague said to me, that when you tell Afghan people they can't walk down particular streets where there are western embassies or western businesses, or you can't go into a particular restaurant because it's for westerners and security, it gives the impression that the coalition is occupying the country, which then takes away the veneer that they're there really to help rebuild and then turn the country over.",
        "You also take a trip outside of Kabul against the advice of your translator and driver to go down to, you know, another place to look for the boys.",
        "On a newly paved highway, so there is some reconstruction going on.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "You can see improvements, but as one international aid worker told me, said the successes are not proportional to the amount of money pouring into the country.",
        "So the roads from Kabul to Jalalabad is paved and it's wonderful.",
        "It takes about two hours now, whereas before, it took five to six hours.",
        "But those kinds of improvements aren't, you don't see them consistently and even when there's an improvement, as we show in the story, you might be able to get from one place or another, but it's very dangerous because of the insurgency.",
        "And indeed, a lot of the people - there's another one conversation that you write about - a man you approached, I think down in Jalalabad, in fact, who said, I just hope that when you find these boys that they're going to be - they will have picked up a Kalashnikov and be on the other side now.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, the people are very upset.",
        "In that situation, I was talking to farmers who'd had their poppy crop destroyed.",
        "But poppy is the thing, is a crop where they can really make money.",
        "And so you destroy the crop.",
        "You don't - there aren't alternatives for them to pursue, you get very angry.",
        "And that anger is widespread and so yes, people were pretty candid with me about either suggesting the boys get guns or that they probably have already joined the insurgency and I shouldn't bother looking for them.",

        "Yes, my question is - I mean, morally objectionable as we might find it, aren't we reaching a point where we're causing more trouble than good by trying to save and we don't save these countries?",
        "Don't we just have to realize and maybe just walk away and say, hey, look, you know, the Afghans are going to have to solve their own problems?",
        "I realize we set up some of the problems, but by our staying there, don't we just exacerbate and irritate what ultimately need to be fought out and figured out by Afghans themselves?",
        "What do you think, Malcolm Garcia?",
        "Well, I think that we should really follow the suggestion of the International Committee for the Red Cross, which last June called for massive amounts of emergency humanitarian aid, to get - to help Afghanistan get back on its feet.",
        "I think if we follow that procedure, you would give hope to the country.",
        "People would see a reason not to join the insurgency but to pursue goals that would actually have outcomes.",

        "This year, we're having 200,000 hectares, with a farm gate of about $1 billion.",
        "And yet, all you reporters come in there and say that if we eliminate the poppy crop, we're going to hurt the country.",

        "I just would like to get your opinion on that.",
        "Well, I think you make good points.",

        "There needs to be an alternative.",
        "And I doubt they'd ever find the alternative that would pay as well as poppies.",
