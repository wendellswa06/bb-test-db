        "Or else, according to the report - now, these are recommendations from an independent group, but the group recommends that Canada indicate that it will withdraw its forces, its combat forces, from Kandahar in - if NATO is unable to reinforce the Canadians by February 2009.",
        "Kandahar, of course, was the home of the Taliban, their base of support; is one of the most dangerous areas in Afghanistan, and the Canadians, I know, feel that they've not gotten enough notice for what they've done or credit for what they've accomplished.",
        "I think that that's right.",
        "There's a great deal of frustration in this country with the sense that here we are, doing our share as a member of an alliance, yet there are very few members of NATO who seem willing to consider deploying their forces to southern Afghanistan.",
        "And I think the fear in this country is that Canadian troops could end up being locked into this primary role in the most strategically important and unstable part of Afghanistan, that is Kandahar, without adequate support from our allies.",
        "And that is, I think, the rationale for this, in effect, what is the recommendation that Canada give, deliver a kind of public-spirited ultimatum to NATO to get its act together or we won't stick around.",
        "And yet the other side of that ultimatum is, yes, the situation's deteriorating and we're going to pull out.",
        "That's right, except that - I think that the - this task force, which reported, also made a point of saying that the situation isn't hopeless and also that the success of the overall international effort in Afghanistan is important for international security, regional security, and perhaps more to the point for - ultimately, for Canadian national security interests too.",
        "So, they're not suggesting abandoning the mission.",
        "But they are, in a sense, calling on NATO as a whole to get its act together and saying that we are - that Canada shouldn't be willing to continue putting its forces in a potentially losing situation, if NATO can't at least get its act together to send an additional thousand troops to Kandahar by next February.",
        "So, you see this as a shot across NATO's bow?",
        "And, you know, Canada is not the only people appealing to NATO for more troops for Afghanistan.",
        "The United States has made it pretty clear that it would like NATO to send more forces to Afghanistan too.",
        "It is intended, I think, to be a shot across NATO's bow.",
        "It's worth emphasizing that the government of Canada is still considering the recommendations - excuse me - in the task force report.",
        "And one of the reasons that this debate is so vexing within Canada right now is that the current government is a minority government in the parliament and there's a great deal of disagreement among the various parties on what Canada should do after February 2009.",
        "So there needs to be - and there is a debate and there needs to be, in a sense, a negotiation between the government and especially the leading opposition party in order to determine what the Canadian position on Afghanistan post-February 2009, will ultimately be.",
        "That's still in motion.",
        "As of yesterday, I think 78 Canadian soldiers and one diplomat have died in Afghanistan, which is of course deplorable.",
        "But looking at it from the vantage point of the United States, which has of course had many more troops and many more casualties, is it - why is this so unpopular in Canada?",
        "Well, I mean, it's a very difficult question for me to answer, and I should say that I lived myself in the United States for 10 years until 2000 and -the end of 2003.",
        "So I'm acutely aware of the circumstance of the debate within the United States surrounding both Afghanistan and at least, the beginning of the Iraq War.",
        "Very different here - this combat operation for Canada in Afghanistan is the first real combat operation that Canadian troops have been involved in since the Korean War.",
        "This country has not, for decades, been in a situation where its troops have been involved in real combat.",
        "The - of course, for Canadians, the primary role over the last few decades of the armed forces, internationally, has been in the mind of Canadians at least, peacekeeping, where there have been casualties but under very different circumstances.",
        "So there is a strong strand of public opinion in this country that's quite uncomfortable with the combat role to begin with.",
        "But even among those who are comfortable with the role that Canada's been playing, there's concerns about drift in this mission and about whether Canada is out there out front while the United States has effectively treated this as an economy of force mission and been distracted by what's been going on in Iraq."

        "If you had a guess, what would you hazard?",
        "It's very difficult to say.",
        "What will happen now over the next days and weeks is that the government and the opposition, main opposition party, will negotiate and see if they can come out with a common position.",
        "The opposition party's current position is that it wants Canada to stop all combat operations in February 2009.",
        "They might be willing to consider an extension, but I think they would ultimately want to have a date where they knew that Canada would be replaced and would rotate, maybe to some other part of Afghanistan, to be replaced by an alliance - by another alliance member.",
        "If there is an agreement, then it'll probably be on that kind of basis, an extension but with an end date where Canada will do something else in Afghanistan.",
        "If there isn't an agreement that - given that this is a minority parliament, it's possible that this could trigger an election in this country.",
        "Hi.",
        "Yes, thank you for taking my call.",
        "I have a question for Mr. Garcia.",
        "A friend of ours traveled quite extensively throughout Afghanistan in the 1970s as an American citizen with his wife.",
        "And he was welcome pretty much everywhere he went.",
        "There were pictures or photographs of John F.",
        "Kennedy in every little shack or shanty that he'd stopped in.",
        "I'm curious as to Mr. Garcia's opinion as to how did we get from that to this within such a brief period of time.",
        "Well, I think in part, after the Soviet Union left Afghanistan in '89, we, in effect, left Afghanistan also.",
        "We were helping the Afghans fighting the Soviet Union.",
        "But we didn't stay to participate in the rebuilding.",
        "When we went in in 2001, the Afghans, you know, were joyous.",
        "I mean, that's a gross understatement.",
        "They were, you know, they - beside themselves and very pleased to see us.",
        "But I think, again, we dropped the ball in terms of pursuing reconstruction in such a way that they would see tangible and consistent progress in a timely manner.",
        "Perceptions aren't fact but they're real, and the perception now in Afghanistan is that we've been there for a very long time and haven't done a whole lot.",
        "You write, in fact, that in some sort of historical rearrangement, Afghans now blame the West and, particularly, the United States for all of their problems going back to the Soviet invasion.",
        "Now, that was a very surprising moment in Jalalabad when people were talking to me.",
        "And, you know, when I first arrived in Afghanistan in 2001, nobody had anything good to say about the Taliban or the Soviet Union's occupation.",
        "And now, suddenly, you know, history is being rewritten because of the disillusionment - the Soviets are being praised for what they did.",
        "The Taliban is being praised for having brought security to the country.",
        "And the international coalition is just being maligned.",
        "Along with Karzai, he's being roped into that as well.",
        "And he's losing legitimacy in the eyes of the country.",

        "What I've seen and what gives rise to much of the problem that we're seeing right now; that is, the rise of the Taliban, is the fact that we're attacking a security problem that is our definition of the security problem in Afghanistan.",
        "In reality, the Afghans, as Malcolm so clearly described, identify their own security needs.",
        "Those security needs are things that make it possible for people to live and survive in their communities, in their villages, in the towns and cities.",
        "Basically, security needs that they have are things related to address the corruption issues, address the problems with the warlords, address the problems of no local opportunities at the community level, that kind of things.",
        "Those are the problems that we have not addressed adequately in Afghanistan...",
        "Would you agree, Malcolm?",

        "I think that's an excellent point.",
