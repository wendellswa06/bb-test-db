        "The police showed up, and there was an altercation.",

        "What was that like?",

        "And I wonder if you could explain what that is and how the military has used that in the past.",
        "Well, it's understood, sort of, from the history of warfare that militaries have attempted to shape adversary behavior and their will to fight.",
        "And the focus has generally been on influencing adversaries in attempting to defeat them.",
        "And there are a number of examples of attempting to shape an adversary.",

        "How so?",
        "What can they learn?",
        "Well, there's a basic premise here.",
        "In a counterinsurgency operation, local population ultimately has a choice to make in terms of who they're going to support.",

        "No, we did not.",

        "What we argue is that military should first seek to understand the needs and preferences of the local population to understand what their needs are and ideally incorporate those into their decision-making process, so that the actions that they take have the best opportunities of gaining support.",
        "It seems like that should have been understood earlier and that it doesn't need to be understood entirely in advertising terms.",
        "I have to say, for me, it's just a little almost odd to hear advertising terms like you just used - the needs and wants of the customers, or the word branding - when you're talking about a war in an occupation.",
        "Well, as I mentioned, the key is to gain support of the civilian population.",
        "When we do things in individual neighborhoods and in local cities, we want to make sure that our activities are as less disruptive as possible.",

        "Everything has a brand identity, and the U.S.",
        "military would be no exception to that.",
        "So with that in mind, it makes sense that the military would be interested in creating positive perceptions, or you call it positive brand identity among the civilian population.",
        "Now, the way businesses go about creating brand identities is they first determine what their core message is.",
        "Once they have a core message and they attempted to integrate that message into all actions - not only their communications, but also their product features in the interactions that customers have with their service personnel.",
        "So Volvo is branded on safety and it's a very clear message.",
        "And commercials certainly relay that message, but the product ultimately has to deliver.",
        "With that in mind, we see a couple of implementations in terms of how branding can be understood for the military.",
        "Like I said, the military has a brand in Iraq and Afghanistan, and they need to understand that everything influences that.",
        "Second of all, when we entered Iraq, we did so with - for lack of a better word - a reputation of force of might.",
        "It was a very effective brand developed during the Cold War and it helped to stop the Soviet advance and to protect the nation.",
        "But now that operations require winning hearts and minds, the military and the U.S.",
        "government needs to develop a core message that can reach these populations.",

        "And, you know, in American culture, we've developed this evangelical belief in the spin-doctor, this notion that anything can be spun.",
        "And my problem with the marketing model of communications is it tends to assume a relatively neutral audience.",
        "If you're sitting at home and you're watching TV and Cindy Crawford comes on with a Pepsi, you know, you're not necessarily coming into that with intense political baggage.",

        "You are communicating with an audience that not only doesn't want to be educated by you, that you're communicating with an audience that often wants to kill you.",
        "You know, the issue is not whether or not there aren't lessons to be learned in the branding world - I think that there are.",
        "My problem is I think that, you know, I get these calls from people - a chemical company spills a chemical and, oh, let's bring in the PR people.",

        "I was in Iraq for a year as a civil affairs soldier and spent a lot of time going out talking to people and being out in the community.",
        "But I think that the idea that we need to use marketing techniques is a good one because there's only so much that soldiers can do to get the message out and to put out our partyline.",
        "But when you hear it from a guy with a gun and body armor, it doesn't come off quite the same as if you see something on television or through the media because, you know, even in the poorest households, everybody had a satellite television, because that was the easiest way to communicate.",
        "And I don't feel like we're really using that resource to the best of our abilities.",
        "So I think there's potential here.",
        "It's not panacea.",
        "It's not going to fix everything, but it definitely should be a tool in our tool chest.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks for your comment, Dan.",
        "Todd Helmus, though, I'd like you to respond to that because I'm not sure that's exactly what you are talking about.",
        "It seems to me, part of what you're talking about is that even members of the military need to be inculcated with this idea of a brand that is a kinder, gentler kind of brand than the one we've been using thus far."
