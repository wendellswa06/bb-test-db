        "We ideally would want these soldier-civilian interactions to be such that they help to earn local support.",
        "And it's partly what soldiers say when they're on patrol to local civilians, but more importantly how they act toward those civilians and the types of operations that they conduct to ensure that they're at least disruptive as possible.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I'm just wondering, Eric Dezenhall, do you think that some of what we're discussing here could have been used early on?",

        "If you're losing, you're going to get bad PR.",
        "And the problem with this war is we are losing - or put differently, we are not winning, and I just don't think that we have an audience that is receptive to communications when what they're trying to figure out is whether they're going to survive the day.",

        "Every employee has to understand what their brand stands for and what their on-and-off brand behaviors are.",
        "What we suggest is at the military, ultimately, if we're going to be conducting stability operations - and we're doing them now, and if we do them in the future - then we need to build an internal culture that values its role in earning civilian support.",
        "It's true that for the past number of years, the military has been trained to put steel on a target.",
        "But ultimately, in addition to being effective with their firearms, they also have to be effective in communicating with the local civilians in interacting with them.",
        "But they have to appreciate that if it's going to be successful.",
        "Do you think he's leaving mano-a-mano sensitive diplomacy to the past, and he's willing to let lower levels and - or even the secretary of state - ensure that there is some deal?",
        "But why do you call that a brand?",
        "I mean, isn't that that you're training soldiers to hold on to certain values even when they're in the midst of a war and you're may be training soldiers to have a cultural sensitivity and understanding?",
        "I just don't understand why that's put in an advertising term like branding.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And ultimately, we may have been able to come up with some of -many of our same observations by studying psychology or sociology or what have you.",
        "Okay.",
        "It just so happened that we looked at marketing in part because some of the examples that we use in our report and understanding the marketing industry is very salient.",
        "But - ultimately, culture is key to building a brand identity.",
        "As I mentioned before, the way we understand businesses build brands is they first identify a core message.",
        "Now, the military could've identified at a positive core message to begin with - and we did attempted to do that.",
        "But ultimately, if the culture of your organization is not attuned to manifesting that message on a very real level, you're going to have a hard time with success.",
        "So the idea that we could all of a sudden change our military force that was otherwise prepared for conventional military operations on a whim's notice to interact with civilian population is a tall order."
