        "You can spin yesterday's results in the British election in two ways: a big victory for Labor, as Tony Blair and the Labor Party won a historic third term in office, or a dramatic setback for Tony Blair, since Labor's majority in the House of Commons has been reduced to less than half of what it was.",
        "Here's how Prime Minister Blair interpreted the results.",
        "We've got a mandate to govern this country again, and we've got to listen to the people and respond wisely and sensibly.",
        "But they have made it very clear they wanted to carry on with Labor and not go back to the Tory years.",
        "(Soundbite of cheering and applause)",
        "The Tories, or Conservatives, gained at least 33 seats in Parliament, but it wasn't enough to bring them out of the minority.",
        "And the party's leader, Michael Howard, has already announced his resignation.",
        "As I can't fight the next election as leader of our party, I believe it's better for me to stand aside sooner rather than later so that the party can choose someone who can.",
        "Joining us from London to sort out the winners and losers is Michael White, political editor of the Guardian newspaper.",
        "And, Mr. White, how do you see this--vindication for Tony Blair or a slap in the face for Labor?",
        "Well, a little of both.",
        "I think the first thing you have to say on these occasions, that any party in your country or in mine which wins three major elections in a row in our sort of system is doing pretty well.",
        "And I think all your listeners would understand that.",
        "So that's pretty good.",

        "The downside is that his Commons majority, his majority in the British House of Commons, is down from 160 to 66, and his share of the vote is down to 36 1/2 percent.",
        "And in terms of a winning party in Britain, that's exceptionally low.",
        "When Tony Blair said, as he did today, `I have listened and I have learned,' does that sound to you like there would be a different Labor that we'd be seeing in a third term?",
        "When Mr. Blair says he's going to listen, he means that he's acknowledging that the British electorate gave him a bloody nose, as the tabloids put it, on Thursday night.",
        "The British people decided, in effect, that they wanted a Labor government with a smaller parliamentary majority so it would be more responsive to pressures from both the voters and from back-bench members of Parliament.",
        "Mr. Blair is trying to acknowledge that.",
        "He's promising to be more collegiate, less presidential in his style of leadership, and to listen to what people say.",
        "And of course behind all this is the other question which has upset the voters here.",
        "It's Iraq, of course, which was hugely divisive and controversial.",
        "And it has had quite a big effect on how people have voted.",
        "Many of them have voted for the Liberal Democrats, the third party in Britain, as a protest vote against Mr. Blair.",
        "They haven't delivered their votes to the Conservatives under Michael Howard because they don't like the look of what they've got to offer.",
        "But Iraq has caused the damage in this week's election.",
        "If you cast forward to the next election--I realize that these results are not fully counted yet--but do you see that this is essentially a Labor Party in its last gasp of power, and some other party will be on the rise, and four years from now, there will be a change in government?",
        "Well, four years is a long time in politics.",
        "Labor in four years' time will have a new leader; it's almost certain to be Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and he may be the last gasp, the leader of a party which is on a down slide, or he may be a man with the energy to reinvent themselves.",
        "But equally, the Conservatives, perhaps with a new, younger leader, will finally find their way back to power after three terms in exile.",
        "And I think I should mention the third party, the Liberal Democrats under a young and quite popular leader, Charles Kennedy, seeking to make a breakthrough.",
        "The odds are always against third parties doing it, but Labor was once the third party in the state, and 80 years ago, it made the breakthrough and pushed the Liberal Democrats into third place.",
        "So who knows what might happen?",
        "Michael White, thanks very much.",
        "Thank you.",

        "A North Korea summit that President Trump left with no deal, a failed bid to get aid into Venezuela, a Middle East peace plan that has been called dead on arrival - we're going to talk about this administration's foreign policy with a man who has had a hand in shaping it for two years.",
        "Joining us in the studio today is Ambassador Thomas Shannon, who's had a long and distinguished career.",

        "And that's a good thing.",

        "And I think he's shown clearly that he's prepared to return the diplomacy to his negotiating team, to Secretary of State Pompeo and to special envoy Steve Biegun.",
        "Isn't it a low bar, though, that he is willing to walk away from a bad deal, that being the main concern, not that he can actually close one?",
        "These processes are difficult, and the negotiations are hard.",
        "But the president, to his credit, has decided that this is something he's going to do.",
        "He's taken on probably the toughest foreign policy challenge he could find in the world and has decided to make it his own.",
        "Now he has to find a way to ensure that the North Koreans and our negotiators return to the table and can pick up the pieces here and try to find a way forward.",

        "OK.",
        "So they actually adjusted the order, according to the reporting, at the last moment to include green card holders.",
        "And now they've decided, after some of the blowback, to exclude, more or less, green card holders.",
        "Is that right?",
