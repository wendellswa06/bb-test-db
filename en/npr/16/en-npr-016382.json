        "Sometimes it can.",

        "And the extent to which that can be taken advantage of and used in an important way, it needs to be taken advantage of and used.",

        "Well, I mean, I think clearly this has raised tensions, but what I think from my work is one of the things that I find in studying kind of the geographic and demographic patterns of the gay community in Los Angeles is that the distinctions that you see in the broader population are true in the gay population.",
