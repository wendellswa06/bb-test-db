        "They do tend to be a little more racially and ethnically mixed, in part because they are less expensive neighborhoods than the gay male neighborhoods.",
        "So - and there's much higher rates of child rearing, obviously, among lesbians and lesbian couples.",
        "And so, again, those neighborhoods are seen as more affordable.",
        "Ron, when you think about what we're talking about and we on News & Notes have tried many times to have conversations about the intersection of race and other forms of identity.",
        "Is this a case, as some people argue, where one identity was prioritized over another?",
        "For example, not just race but identity as a churchgoer.",
        "You know, if your identity as a churchgoer was prioritized over, you know, other identities that you have of being someone who, you know, sees gay and lesbian members of your family and who wants certain things for them.",
        "I mean, how do people in your experience, that you've met, prioritize what they believe in when it comes to a situation like this that is a social values issue?",
        "Well, that's what I mean by more education needs to happen.",
        "It's true.",
        "I simply can't understand it myself how - and I've spoken with people who are, you know, college professors and are religious, and they know that we're talking about civil marriage.",
        "We're - it has nothing to do with going to a church, but yet they say, you know, my pastor says I have to vote yes on Proposition 8, and that's what they do.",
        "So clearly, they are prioritizing one particular identity over another.",
        "But another part of the question which sort of raises my hackles(ph) is the question about, well, which are you first?",
        "Are you black, are you gay, are you gay, are you black?",
        "And it sort of - it denies the idea that one can be both simultaneously.",
        "It's like asking Barack Obama, which is he?",
        "Black or white?",
        "White or black?",
        "He is both.",
        "Patrick, what's - when you think about the response to this, there have been protests all over the country, some of them tense, some of them very specific.",
        "Like this person gave this money to this part of the Yes on 8 coalition.",
        "We're going to protest in front of this business.",
        "Some of them much more general.",
        "One of things that came up over the course of the past eight years was with antiwar protest.",
        "Is protest still an effective form of civil interaction?",
        "From your perspective, as someone who watches politics, do you think these protests are accomplishing what they set out to do?",
        "Well, as a Republican, I'm more conservative, so protests are never high on my list, but I have to say, for myself, even, my reaction to this passage of Prop 8 has been anger.",
        "And so I can understand why people want to do something to show their anger.",
        "I think our challenge going forward as a movement working toward equality for all is how we, within the next few weeks, transfer that anger into positive momentum to move forward.",
        "Because at the end of the day, anger won't get us any closer to achieving where we want to go, so what we need to do is, again, figure out why we lost and get more people involved.",
        "A lot of mink and beaver, a bunch of bear fat.",
        "We've got beaver carcasses that we chunk up and feed whole.",
        "And how much does that freezer itself cost?",
        "I don't really want to know what my costs are (laughter).",

        "It's a bit frustrating, in my mind, that there wasn't this activism before the vote.",
        "So what we have to do is make use of the energy and the anger, and move forward in a positive way, rather than just throwing rocks.",
        "I will add, just briefly, that as a sort of stats person, from 2000 to 2008 the percentage who voted against same-sex marriage has gone from 62 percent to 52 percent.",

        "So I think there is a little bit of perspective here to say that there is enormous change going on already.",
        "I'm going to give you the last word, Ron.",
        "We're going to have to make it short, but if you had to say to someone who just absolutely says, look, my pastor - and this is something many people have said - my pastor told me to vote yes, and I did, what's your shorthand answer on that one?",
        "Well, if it's a black person, I would say, there are, you know, there are black LGBT people, like me.",

        "It was effective, but then you began to realize the things she didn't say.",
        "She didn't say that Obama won fair and square.",
        "She didn't say things got a little rough in the course of the campaign, and I said some things in the heat of battle, but I came to respect Barack Obama for his sterling judgment or his, you know, epic legislative skills.",
