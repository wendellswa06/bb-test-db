        "And he is pretty confident that he'll be able to hold on to them.",
        "But again, from the White House's perspective, it is a principle.",

        "He's doing that with the Democratic Congress in place, certainly more than he did when Republicans were there, passing spending bills.",
        "And he says this is an important issue on which to do that.",
        "And that's why he's dug in.",
        "So as you say, there are votes to override in the Senate, but not in the House.",
        "So what happens to the program if Congress cannot override this veto?",
        "Well, for now it continues to live, even though it has technically expired because of kind of continuing temporary funding that has passed.",
        "But that only holds us till the middle of November.",
        "That gives some time to work out some kind of a compromise.",
        "Beyond that, it's hard to say what happens, though both sides do say they want this program, that it's a good program to continue, but the big question is, how big will it be?",
        "And again, both sides are dug in now and it's a pretty good political issue for Democrats as well as the battle plays out.",
        "NPR's Don Gonyea from the White House, thank you.",
        "Pleasure.",
        "In 1993, forensic pathologist Robert Huntington testified that 7-month-old Natalie Beard showed the characteristic symptoms of a shaken-baby, and given the timing, her caregiver, Audrey Edmunds, had to be responsible for her death.",
        "Ten years later, Huntington said in a retrial, he was no longer comfortable with that verdict, that other things could explain the subdural bleeding, retinal hemorrhaging and brain swelling, and that new research also throws doubt on the timing of the injury."

        "In last week's edition of The New York Times Magazine, senior Slate editor Emily Bazelon reported that shaken-baby cases may no longer be as clear cut as previously believed, and that a fierce debate is underway.",
        "I'm sorry, what?",
        "Emily Bazelon is senior editor at Slate, also a Truman Capote law and media fellow at Yale Law School, and joins us now from a studio in North Haven, Connecticut.",
        "Nice to have you with us today.",
        "Thanks so much for having me.",
        "And the cases you talk about in your piece, these women who've been exonerated after serving time, what's changed in the way that we now understand shaken-baby syndrome?",
        "One of the things that's changed, it relates to Robert Huntington's testimony as you were just talking about, and that is how definitive doctors can be about timing and injury.",
        "It used to be that the assumption was that every time you had evidence of the shaking - medical evidence - that you knew, you assumed that the baby would immediately stop breathing and go into a coma.",
        "And that meant that the last person taking care of the baby was necessarily the guilty party.",
        "Now doctors acknowledged that there are some cases - and there's a debate about how rare this is - but that in at least a few cases it's possible for a child to remain conscious for some amount of time.",
        "Not to be totally normal, necessarily, but to be sleepy or fussy or not eating regularly, as opposed to immediately unconscious.",
        "And there's also - your article talks about that those three symptoms, subdural bleeding, retinal hemorrhaging, brain swelling - if those three were present even without bruises or broken bones or other injuries evident, doctors still said that used to be solid evidence of shaken baby.",
        "Doctors used to say that that had to be shaking, that it was -there was only one explanation.",
        "And now we know - and again, there is a big debate about how rare this is.",
        "But now we know there are possible alternate causes of those symptoms.",
        "There are certain bleeding disorders that cause those symptoms.",
        "Some doctors, though not all - many dispute this - but some doctors think that it's possible for certain accidental falls to cause those symptoms."

        "And so this is really the debate.",
        "It is a debate about, in criminal court, where, if we're going to convict someone, then the standard is beyond a reasonable doubt, whether there's always that level of certainty in these criminal cases.",
        "Well, how many of these cases come up every year?",
        "So there are between 12 and 14 hundred cases of children attributed to abusive head injury every year.",
        "And we're talking about a small subset of those cases in which they go to court - they are criminal charges -and the only medical evidence of abuse are these internal injuries that you described.",
        "And so no one - the numbers are a little fuzzy.",
        "But the best estimates I was getting were that there are between 100 and 150 cases a year in this category.",
        "And this case goes back to, I guess, the most famous shaken baby case, and that was - involved the English au pair Louise Woodward, who was put on trial - and I guess a celebrated trial - about 20 years ago.",
        "That's right.",
        "This is 1998.",
        "Louise Woodward was a 19-year-old British au pair.",
        "She was taking care of a baby who collapsed in her care.",
        "This child wasn't - did not simply have internal bleeding and swelling.",
        "He also had a skull fracture.",
        "And one of the big debates at the trial was whether that skull fracture was old or whether it has been inflicted, you know, in the few hours before he died, when he was in Louise Woodward's care.",
        "And the verdict in that case was guilty.",
        "Yet Louise Woodward was, well, dismissed with time served.",
        "That's right.",
        "The jury believed the prosecution's experts, who said essentially that the medical evidence meant that Woodward must have abused this child, given that she was his caregiver before his death.",
        "But the judge, without explaining why - trial judges don't have to necessarily give reasons -he reduced the charges to involuntary manslaughter and then let her go for time served.",
        "And the testimony in that case by Barry Scheck, who's since become better known as one of the principals in the Innocence Project, but his testimony seemed, you say, to lay the groundwork for doubts that have since sprung up.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, Scheck was the lawyer in that case, and then there were a bunch of experts who were testifying on both sides, and Scheck's strategy in that case, to really bring in doctors who had an alternate explanation, at least for the timing of the baby's injuries - this was the first big courtroom battle over shaken baby syndrome.",
        "And given the doubts that had been thrown up, are the convictions that have occurred in other cases being reconsidered?"

        "When she went on trial in 1996, no one really questioned the evidence about the timing.",
        "And so since Audrey Edmunds had been the baby's caregiver and she had these - the baby had these injuries, Edmunds was convicted.",
        "Then, a decade later, she was having a hearing about whether she would deserve a new trial or not.",
        "And Robert Huntington, the pathologist who had testified at the first trial, came back and said that he had personally observed a child with subdural and retinal bleeding who had been lucid for a period before collapsing, and that made him go back and look at the literature.",
        "And he no longer felt confident about timing that child's injuries.",
        "And based on that, the Wisconsin Appeals Court said, you know, there's really fierce disagreement now among doctors about this aspect of this case, and as a result we are going to grant Audrey Edmunds a new trial.",
        "The prosecutors then decided to drop the charges against her, and she was released after serving nearly 12 years in prison.",
        "And does this suggest that someone else may have been responsible, at least in some cases, or that there are these other - well, in some cases, difficult births may have been responsible?",
        "Well, the first possibility is certainly there.",
        "It is certainly possible that most of these children were, in fact, abused and what we just don't know with enough certainty is who did it.",
        "Then there are other cases in which it's possible that there are alternate explanations for these injuries that we don't fully understand now and that more research really needs to be done to figure out how probable that is or isn't.",

        "We resented that the article indicated that there were all kinds of people sitting in prisons that had been wrongfully convicted, although we feel like everyone else, that we would not want anyone wrongfully convicted.",
        "But it's important to know that mainstream scientists, medical organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics, Centers for Disease Control, National Association of Medical Examiners, the Academy of Ophthalmology, have all published statements and recognized shaken baby syndrome.",

        "The doctors agonize over these decisions, to say it might be abuse.",
        "And they look at other possible explanations, including mimics.",
        "In many of these cases there's other signs of physical abuse, and medical examiners will tell you that when they're doing autopsies they find numerous broken bones and bruises over the body of a dead baby.",
