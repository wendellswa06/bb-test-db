        "There are about 200 a year.",
        "And of those cases, between half and three quarters, according to the prosecutors I talked to, there is only medical evidence from the internal bleeding and the brain swelling as opposed to things like fractures and bruises, which obviously that's a whole different scenario for both doctors and for the legal system.",
        "But not to argue that there is no such as shaken baby syndrome, clearly...",

        "Well, it was the point, Emily, that you gave of - the title of it was a flawed diagnosis, and so that certainly lends to the situation that there's this whole bulk of physicians and people who were incorrectly diagnosing this.",
        "And I just think that that impression is not only completely wrong but very, very dangerous.",
        "And as you know, you talk to many of the top people in world, actually, and they spend hours and hours being interviewed by you.",
        "But the representation in the article was more representative of the few, I'd say 10 or so, of the people - the witnesses that are testifying in these cases over and over again in every city...",
        "And Marilyn...",
        "...who are paid a high price to do so.",
        "And Marilyn, I don't want to break you off again, but we just have a very few seconds left.",
        "And I want to give Emily a chance to respond."
