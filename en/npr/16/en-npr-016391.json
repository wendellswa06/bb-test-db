        "Well, several Safe Street employees are now behind bars after a police raid turns up guns and drugs stashed in the East Baltimore facility.",
        "News reports about the raid featured Dr. Wen at police headquarters speaking to the press.",
        "She's flanked by officers and federal agents.",
        "And instead of doing what she'd hoped to do this summer - announce the opening of a new Safe Streets site, perhaps in Freddie Gray's neighborhood - Dr. Wen announces she's shutting down the raided site temporarily while they figure out what went wrong.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "We stand united with the police department and our partners in reducing violence in the city and making Baltimore safe and healthy.",
        "Now, her words had been carefully chosen.",
        "She had strongly defended the program, but there's a hitch.",
        "She soon learns from her deputy Olivia Farrow that the Safe Streets staff were not happy.",
        "Here's what she told us when we saw her later that week.",
        "I actually felt really badly about it because what she said was that we - for lack of better words - messed up on the messaging.",
        "Part of the problem was the image.",
        "People were upset to see me standing with the police in the first place.",
        "And then to use the terminology of we're partnering with the police because the entire point of Safe Streets is that they are separate from the police and that in the mediation for conflicts, there has to be total trust.",
        "And we have potentially interfered with that relationship by standing with the police.",
        "So Leana Wen sets about trying to fix things.",
        "She calls a meeting with the Safe Streets site directors.",
        "And she brings in a guy from the Chicago program that was the model for Safe Streets.",
        "Brent Decker trained the Baltimore staff and swaps hugs with them as they walk in.",
        "Well, I might as well just get my apartment back here in Baltimore."

        "And it's interesting, because even though Alice Clifton is an enslaved black woman at this point, in the past she would've been subject to the separate Negro courts.",
        "But in 1780, Pennsylvania had passed a gradual abolition act.",
        "So they actually freed any enslaved blacks born after 1780.",
        "But this act of gradual abolition didn't do anything for folks like Alice Clifton except allow them to be tried in the regular courts.",
        "They would still remain enslaved, but they would be tried as if they were free because the 1780 Act had also gotten rid of the separate Negro courts.",
        "So it was kind of the worst of both worlds.",
        "It is the worst of both worlds in many respects.",
        "And also, I really chose that case to open up the book with, because I felt like it did this great job of highlighting the sort of confinement and the parameters of black womanhood during the time period.",
        "You know, it's almost like, you know, too high to get over, too low to get under.",
        "You're not free, but we will try you as a free person.",
        "So what does this story say to you about the nature of black female criminality at this point, during America's evolution?",
        "And how does it have relevance now?",
        "Well, one of the things that I argue in the book and what I think that the case starts to highlight is that black female crime is constructed jointly by both the perpetrators and the state.",
        "So that black women are - because of the bias and the bigotry of the period - they're socially, economically, politically disenfranchised in almost every way.",
        "So that in order for them to attain even a minimal quality of life, law-breaking or doing and acting in ways that are outside of the law are often some of the only avenues that they have to exert any sort of autonomy.",
        "But at the same time, it's also in some respects constructed by the state in the terms of the way that the laws and the early legislation sort of legally wrought the parameters that left an Alice Clifton no choice for freedom, except, you know, over the corpse of her, you know, illegitimate child, essentially.",
        "I guess where I would end with this - because your book has some many facets - is you have a whole chapter called Deviant By Design: Race, Degeneracy and the Science of Penology.",
        "And you have a quote from a book - the Science of Penology, written in 1893 - that says, the possible criminal must be caught and rendered harmless before he can act.",
        "The constant reinforcement and recruiting of the criminal class must be checked at its source.",
        "Now that's kind of an equivalent of preemptive war against crime.",
        "What did that do to black women who were arrested, tried, convicted, back in the turn of the last century, and what is it doing now?"

        "That there are a certain class of criminals who fall into crime for a variety of reasons in that they can be saved and redeemed through, you know, rehabilitation and reintegrate into society.",
        "Then there was this idea that they were habitual criminals.",
        "These are people who were biologically deficient and prone to criminal activity.",
        "And the ways that they define habitual criminality were along the very sort of biased biological ideas about criminal heredity.",
        "So basically, habitual criminal identified those characteristics that were the antithesis of white middle class hegemony for the time period.",
        "So this has huge implications for black women because it essentially renders almost criminals on sight.",
        "It's almost like an early form of racial profiling.",
        "But I think for black women today, there still is a type of profile or a hopelessness about what can be done with folks once they have committed crimes.",
