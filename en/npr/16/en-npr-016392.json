        "It is not a place all that known for its cuisine, unless you live there and spend summer days on the shore of the Chesapeake Bay with a spread of crabs smothered in Old Bay seasoning, maybe some corn and a pitcher of beer.",

        "B.",
        "VOLTAGGIO: You know what's really great about this is actually - if you think about this, this is a crab feast, but it's for breakfast.",
        "And breakfast is Bryan's favorite meal because it's the only time he gets to eat with his family.",
        "Most other times he's at one of his restaurants.",
        "And this is why the recipes in his new book are centered around family and family gatherings, from Thanksgiving to Super Bowl Sunday to the morning we visited.",
        "He was making his pancakes with granola.",
