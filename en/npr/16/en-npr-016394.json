        "Murphy checks with them, then comes back with the story.",
        "They know him.",
        "They know that he's on parole, and he's a Hangout Boy gang member on parole for armed robbery.",
        "And here, you see the LAPD's strategy for holding down crime.",
        "These Metro Division officers have time to seek out potential troublemakers.",
        "Often, that means looking for people who are on parole or probation.",
        "They chat them up.",
        "They search them, and they search their homes for guns.",
        "That's what they're doing in this man's apartment right now.",

        "With the recent uptick in crime, the mayor now wants to double the size of the Metro Division.",
        "So at what point does this kind of policing become too much?",
        "LAPD has gone through 20 years of difficult reforms.",
        "Even the feds were involved for a while, pushing the department to become less arrogant, to act less like an occupying army.",

        "Which is kicking in doors, proning out people, arresting everybody and suppressing.",

        "To be clear, Noblet doesn't think the LAPD is there yet, but he's troubled by what he sees as the department's fading interest in community policing programs.",
        "There's also the case of Ezell Ford, a mentally ill black man killed by police last summer in South LA.",
        "The police chief found the shooting justified, but the police commission recently ruled that there wasn't a good reason to confront Ford.",
        "In short, it was a case of police being a little too proactive.",
        "But back at the 77th Street police station, Lieutenant Murphy sees things the other way around.",
        "He says the whole point of Metro Division's tactics is to suppress crime without making a neighborhood feel like it's under siege.",
        "We're looking, then, to focus on those specific crime problems of specific crime locations, specific chronic offenders.",
        "Rather than just come in and blanket a community, we're going to come in and focus on those specific spots, specific areas where crime is spiking and make that area a little bit safer and better for the people that live there.",

        "But we have to really start looking at the community also.",

        "Despite the doubts raised by Ferguson and Ezell Ford, she thinks people are still willing to work with the cops because those people still have fresh memories of the bad, old days.",
        "They were afraid to sleep at night.",
        "They would hear a gunshot, and everybody would jump into the bathtub.",
        "People do not want to live in that fear, and that's what's going to keep this community from going back to that stage 'cause no one wants to live in fear."
