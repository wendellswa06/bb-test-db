        "I mean, one of the problems with this debate is that those who are against too much austerity are also demanding that Germany should do more to expand the economy to push growth across Europe.",

        "So there are some examples but when you look at countries like France, Spain, Italy, there's an awful long way to go.",
        "One other thing, Mr. Peet.",
        "I just want to ask if the worst-case scenario here is more and more countries getting into the cycle that Greece has been in for several years, where you have budget cuts and massive firing of public workers which only hurts the economy more and puts the country in an even worse situation to pay its debts."
