        "Well, President Obama says he's looking for Iran to take steps to clear up questions about its nuclear program, so what was Rouhani's message to the General Assembly today?",
        "He talked a lot about hope and moderation - those were words he used often.",
        "He said Iran will act responsibly.",
        "It's prepared to remove any and all reasonable concerns about what he called Iran's peaceful nuclear program.",
        "He said nuclear weapons have no place in Iran's defense doctrine.",
        "This is why Italy has hardly any foreign investments, and future prospects are grim.",

        "Yeah.",

        "The Toronto Film Festival's always a place where documentaries really get their day.",

        "I saw a documentary called \"\"The Armstrong Lie,\"\" which is from an Oscar-winning director named Alex Gibney.",
        "And as it happens, Gibney was already making a documentary about Lance Armstrong's return to the Tour de France in 2009 and had been working on it with a close relationship with Armstrong for quite a while when Armstrong eventually admitted that he had been doping.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"\"THE ARMSTRONG LIE\"\")",
        "Life for me at the time was moving fast.",
        "Look at 2005, I was - I had won seven tours in a row.",
        "I was engaged to a beautiful rock star.",
        "I was - but that all just felt normal to me.",
        "I certainly was very confident that I would never be caught.",
        "This documentary then, of course, takes a turn and contains this very complex interview between these two men where Gibney is essentially confronting him about the fact that he was lying to Gibney for quite a long time while Gibney was making the documentary originally.",
        "I found that fascinating."

        "Bob and Linda, did you notice any trends in this year's films that somehow established this festival as different than the ones before?",

        "Like by choosing the movies you do, you automatically sort of start to notice a trend.",
        "So last year, for whatever reason, I was seeing nothing but films about revolution and about the Middle East.",
        "And this year, I kept seeing biopics.",
        "And it's a matter of what I selected.",
        "I kept seeing films from directors who had made small, really respected films before who now were making bigger, more Hollywood films.",

        "This is really the kickoff one.",
        "It's become a place where you can kind of tell what the front-runners for the Oscars are.",
        "One aspect of that is the timing and another is that it has selected, one way or the other, the winning film at the Oscars for several years.",
        "And so people are now entering their pictures if they think they have a shot at Oscars because it gives buzz at a crucial moment.",
        "The King's Speech\"\" started there.",

        "So the Muslim Brotherhood basically went home, several hundred people set up tents and tried to stay in the square, and that's when riot police moved in and violently pushed them out.",
        "They've since burned those tents down.",
        "Of course, when this violence resumed, and the photographs were very similar to what we saw in January when Hosni Mubarak was being driven from power, this drew more protesters into the square and into the neighboring streets, and it's been a very violent encounter for the last three days.",

        "And he complained that the U.S.",

        "So he was definitely striking a balance between being more open to talking with the West, but also standing firm on some of the themes that Iran always brings up here, America's dominance at the U.N.",
