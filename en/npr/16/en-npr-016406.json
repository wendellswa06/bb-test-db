        "The CDC is saying that just about a quarter of those people who are infected in this country have their virus under control.",
        "So what can be done?",
        "I mean, how do you address the 75 percent of those who are not seeking treatment - getting the treatment that they need?",
        "Well, of the remaining 75 percent, about a third don't know they're infected.",
        "So we need to make testing as easy as getting your blood pressure tested at a drug store, for instance, so that there's no barriers to testing.",
        "The other third don't want to go into care.",
        "They're afraid that if they go to the doctor that they'll then become ill.",
        "And the remaining third are in care, but they're not reliably taking their medication.",

        "Do you think when your career is over, you will see a cure?",
        "I don't think in my career that we're going to see it.",
        "There has been one person cured, so we know it's possible, and people are working on it with new scientific tools.",
        "So there may be a breakthrough sooner than expected.",
        "People are optimistic because we have the tools, but we don't have a blueprint or any construction equipment.",

        "That's AIDS researcher Jeffrey Lennox.",

        "Now, back in the 1980s and early '90s, an HIV diagnosis was a soon-to-be a death sentence.",

        "He revealed it years later in an autobiography.",
        "But in 1988, he decided that he tell almost no one.",
        "It was a really scary time because my thought was if I was diagnosed HIV positive, then I was going to do the honorable thing and pack my bags, because I was training in Florida, and I was going to go back to California and lock myself in my house and wait to die, because that's what we thought of HIV at the time.",
        "And so my cousin, who is my doctor, was treating me, and he wanted to treat me very aggressively.",
        "So they put me on (unintelligible) right away.",
        "He talked me to continue training.",
        "And so I did.",

        "It was really a blessing for me at that time because diving was much more positive to focus on than my HIV.",
        "When your book came out - and this is just 17 years ago - even at that time, there was a little bit of a backlash.",
        "I mean, you lost some sponsorships, and some people condemned you for not having revealed this earlier during the Seoul Olympics.",
        "Were you surprised by the reaction at the time?",
        "No, no. I wasn't really surprised.",
        "When you come clean of secrets, I mean, there's going to be some backlash.",
        "But you know what, there was a lot of education that was happening at the time.",
        "People needed to learn how you get HIV, but also important to know how you don't get HIV, and you're not going to get HIV from a chlorinated pool.",
        "You know, really, the only person that I put in harm's way was the doctor.",
        "This, of course, is a doctor who treated you when you hit your head on the diving board..."

        "And once the conditions permit, we will hand over responsibility to the Afghans, and I would expect that we could start in some provinces this year.",

        "Now there's one thing, though, that people who've observed Afghans in action - Afghan soldiers are often quite brave, but in terms of a fighting force, there's a lot holding them back.",
        "They're illiterate, for the most part.",

        "But all of this, it boils down to the need for a strengthened NATO training mission, and this is a reason why I have urged all allies and partners to contribute trainers and training teams, so that we can improve the quality of the Afghan security forces and also increase the number of Afghan soldiers and Afghan police.",
        "NATO has been in Afghanistan, of course, fighting, but you have made it clear that nations like Russia and China could and should be involved going forward in Afghanistan, if it is to become stable over the long term.",
        "Could you give us some examples of how - let's start with a traditional historic rival to the West, Russia - how they would be involved?",

        "Russia also suffers from drug trafficking rooted in Afghanistan.",

        "On the contrary, we have 28 allies.",

        "And what form does that support take?",
        "Are you actively, say, training Somalia's current government's military?",
