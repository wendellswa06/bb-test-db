        "On the other hand, they have to be nervous that maybe we'll have too much of a good thing because if the dollar goes too far, then our foreign creditors could start to lose confidence, interest rates we pay could go up and then we'd be in trouble again.",

        "And there has to be a kind of agreement in patrolling of the frontiers between these different areas in Iraq.",

        "During the first Bush administration, during the genocide and ethnic cleansing in Yugoslavia, he suggested that the Bush administration not really do anything because we don't have a dog in that fight.",
