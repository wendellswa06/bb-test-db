        "News or any type of news element or any blog and you decide that it's something that should be featured on Digg.com, what you do is you go on the site.",
        "You input all the information and what happens is on Digg.com, they show those headlines.",
        "And as more people view those headlines, they can either dig it, which means they promote it more, or they can opt to bury it.",
        "And so what it is is the community pretty much chooses what headlines they want to know more about and decides on what news they really are interested in.",
        "You also mentioned something I think called Pandora.com, which sounds intriguing.",
        "What's that?",
        "Pandora.com is one of my favorite sites for the past three weeks.",
        "For the past three weeks?",
        "Yes.",
        "And it's just because I actually just learned about it.",
        "I've always gotten in those funks of not being able to handle listening to any type of music because I've just been listening to the same thing over and over.",
        "And what Pandora.com is, is it's a music discovery service.",
        "It's an Internet radio service where you go online, you can create up to 100 radio stations and you pick what music you like.",
        "Say you like the Goo-Goo Dolls or any other type of music, and you type that band in.",
        "What they do on Pandora.com is they go through the Music Genome Project.",
        "And they find other bands that pertain to that group of names that you've already chosen throughout the list, and they create those stations for you.",
        "And you can listen to all of this for free.",
        "You can check everything out because there's advertising.",
        "And you don't have to go to the store and buy a CD that you might not like, and you might discover it's something you really like.",
        "So that's why I really enjoy Pandora.",

        "What's big in 2007?",
        "Honestly, I don't think that we know.",
        "I mean, many of these technologies that you saw on MySpace, YouTube, Flickr, some of these, the things that really came to fruition in 2006 were built for a year or two before that.",

        "It's more general trends, and the fact that, you know, you're the myriad of different social technologies that are trying to get in, and frankly, trying to make some money.",
        "And that what you're seeing is they've trained a lot of these big technology sites like YouTube have trained users that they can actually do this, and so you're seeing users actually splinter across hundreds of different sites rather than locating on one particular site.",
        "And so they're going based on where their friends are.",
        "So rather than, all, you know, say, 14 through 24-year-old Americans going to MySpace, you're seeing them going to 20 to 30 different social network sites, and I don't think that that trend is going to stop in the next year.",
        "Now Danah, you consult with companies on trends in social media.",
        "What are some of the trends that you're seeing and how might they be shifting?",
        "So some of the obvious trends arewhat is often talked about as user-generated content, which is the collection of or the presentation of all of this, you know, media - so video, music, everything that people can go and create their own thing and put it up.",
        "You know, you see the new technologies out there, the fact that your phones have cameras on them, the phones have videos on them, a lot of them allow pretty much anybody to go and put things together and express themselves.",
        "The others, in that you're trying to see, is just people have this desire not to talk to just anyone, or even to talk to people that thereof a particular interest what they do, but talk to talk to their friends.",
        "So they're actually going in or taking their offline friends and they're bringing them online trough the different social network technologies so that they can go on and share it just with their friends.",
        "So while there's some people who'd desperately want, you know, the attention of, you know, 50 million people, most people are going and seeking the attention of about six.",
        "So a lot of the tensions of, you know, this round of user generated content is who is that audience.",
        "Is the audience just your peer group or your close family?",
        "Or is the audience meant to be all public across all space and all time?"
