        "And the other major sticking point is who's going to be Prime Minister.",
        "The Shiite Alliance won the most votes in the elections in December and they have the right to nominate the Prime Minister from their own ranks, and Ibrahim al-Jaafari was interim Prime Minister for about the last ten months and he managed to win a nomination of the alliance but he only did it by one vote and he only did it with the support of Muqtada al-Sadr, the radical Shiite cleric who is very anti-American and wants the U.S.",
