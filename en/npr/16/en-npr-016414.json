        "We did model it off of some other legislation around the country, where there is an automatic bar, or automatic line in the sand that kids have to pass.",

        "We know that 90 percent of high school dropouts did not read on the third-grade level, and it's one of the strongest predictors of high school graduation success.",
        "So this was something that we looked at, and we said: If the pipeline is broken, and we're not getting kids to and through and prepared for college, how do we back this up, and where are the pitfalls and the areas that we can take a look at?",
        "As I understand, the legislation in Colorado, again, it does not provide for automatically holding a kid back who fails this test, and also provides additional funds for the schools to work with those kids who are struggling with their reading.",
        "That's correct.",
        "There was $21 million that was put into this piece of legislation that is for support, to give the kids every chance they can.",
        "What the legislation does require is that there's a conversation between the parent, the teacher and the principal to let folks know, let these parents know that their kid is behind, and they're at risk of falling further behind because of the child's reading skills.",
