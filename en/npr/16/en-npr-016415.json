        "Well, I think it's critical, but I think the response of Colorado - while remarkably responsible because they've read the literature - is also a little misguided.",
        "Leaving kids back, we know from research, is - it sometimes improves achievement temporarily, for a small number of the repeaters, but over time, grade repeaters fall further and further behind other low achievers who have been promoted.",
        "And the repeaters also drop out more frequently.",
        "That's really not controversial, and I think Colorado knows this and has passed sensible legislation, in a way.",
        "But they don't know which kids will profit from being left behind - none of us do - and it's hard to make public policy based on exceptions.",

        "The vast majority of smokers do not get lung cancer.",
        "Does that mean we should rescind the policy that makes it mandatory to warn people that smoking's a bad choice?",
        "Of course not.",
        "Just because some kids are helped by retention in grades doesn't mean it's good policy.",
        "That's the reasoning of illogic here.",
        "You make policy based on good odds, and the odds are that retention in grade is bad for the kids who are retained.",
        "It's bad socially, emotionally, and they don't seem to catch up.",
        "And they drop out at higher rates.",
        "I understand the - what you're saying socially and emotionally, everybody has experience of - we've all been to school and understand the trauma involved in being held back.",
        "Nevertheless, if they can't read at a third-grade level, they've gone into fourth grade, where they no longer teach reading, how are they ever going to catch up?",
        "Well, we all agree that neither retention nor promotion is beneficial to struggling students or their school if it's not accompanied by effective, programmatic interventions.",
        "And those usually mean extending learning time.",
        "You need opportunities for children to get after-school tutoring on weekends and in the summer.",
        "They need to be in safe and supervised environments.",
        "Programs must offer homework assistance, intensive tutoring in basic skills, counseling and enrichment.",
        "Waiting till you make a decision to leave them back is a little late.",
        "Does Colorado have preschool and kindergarten mandatory for poor kids?",
        "Does it have tutoring for first and second-graders whose teachers say they need it?",
        "Does it have summer programs for these struggling kids, or have those funds been cut?",
        "Has Colorado cut or added librarians to school to help children with reading?",
        "Because librarians play a big role in this.",
        "Does Colorado have smaller classes in first and second grade so as to give struggling students more chances to be served individually by teachers?",

        "Well, I mean, many of those things are very important, and we believe that the policy in Colorado takes a look at the entire spectrum of what's going on in literacy in Colorado.",

        "And we know, in Colorado, we're getting that right most of the time.",

        "And as an option of last resort, if the kids are not literate by the end of the third grade, we have got to stop lying to them and putting them into fourth grade, where they don't have the skills to succeed.",

        "It makes it one of the most important things that can happen in a child's life by the time they get to the end of third grade.",
        "And that is really at the core of what our bill wanted to and what we succeeded in doing, and that is because we've had flat literacy rates in the United States for the past decade.",
