        "And Tim Taylor, this is - I know you believe sincerely that retention is, in some cases, clearly the best thing to do, but the effects - as Kathleen and some of our other callers have illustrated - they're very real.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "And in that case, it sounded like the retention was done based on an age piece.",
        "And what we're trying to identify is whether the kids have the skills.",
        "And we need to change the culture in our schools so that isn't done in some schools, but not in others, or a teacher has the final decision.",
        "This is something where we have to look at the test scores, find out whether the student has the capacity.",
        "And if we change the culture across the board, this is not going to be a stigma for these kids.",

        "And some kids just need a little bit more time, and there is nothing wrong with that.",

        "By leaving the kid back, you're ensuring that the child will be with more immature children.",
        "By promoting the child, if it's an immaturity issue, you're at least putting the child in a classroom where the children are gaining maturity.",
        "For the immaturity excuse for leaving the kid back, I think that's just a terrible reason to do so.",
        "You want the kid - if the kid is so immature, promote him a grade or two so that the kid is hanging out with mature people and he learns the skills of maturity.",
