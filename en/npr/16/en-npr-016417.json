        "Part of the problem was - this is back in the '90s - we were not able to hire as many people as we wanted to hire, therefore the backlogs are growing.",
        "Now, what we're doing is playing catch-up, trying to hire as many new examiners as we can possibly hire and train, bring them up to speed to address the backlog.",

        "How do you train them?",

        "We also have software, hardware, computer encryption that require some of the computer scientists, computer engineers.",
        "We also do business methods where we actually do examine methods of doing a particular business, and in those, we have people that have scientific degrees, but they also have a minor or extensive background in marketing, finance, insurance or one of the other areas that apply.",
