        "He is a slave owner.",
        "That's hardly equality.",
        "That's a raisin farm you grew up on and indeed still live on in Fresno.",
        "And it was, of course, sort of interesting to see that.",
        "There is also the conflict between a society.",
        "At one point one of the characters describes the gods of Olympus as childlike and that this is moving into a more serious, more intellectually serious kind of theology.",
        "At the same time we are moving into a more intellectually serious form of warfare - enough with this sort of mob of the phalanx.",
        "One of your characters, Aeneas, says this is warfare as a science.",
        "Come on, kids.",
        "Yes.",
        "And he's going to be told that by the Spartans because I'm trying to - I'm a little bit ambiguous about this, you see, because Sparta saved Greece at Thermopylae.",
        "Sparta was the traditional bulwark of Hellas.",
        "It had a constitutional government, oligarchic, but it was constitutional.",
        "And when it was destroyed - and it would be by Epaminondas and people like Melon, the central character - they could make an argument, well, you, too, have slaves, and they do throughout the novel.",
        "So what's so wrong with having serfs when you have slaves?",
        "And what's so good about democracy when democracy itself at Athens, for example, has over perhaps 20 to 40,000 slaves?",
        "And so - and this is personified in this weird character Lichas, who is pretty foul and vile, but he seems to say things that, in terms of being hypocritical, that sting the Thebans.",
        "I've seen Spartans speak lately in the film \"\"300\"\" and some of its parodies and that sort of thing.",
        "Lichas, though, I've never heard anybody speak like that.",
        "What - a little unbearable.",
        "Yeah, he is.",
        "And we don't really know too much about how Spartans speak because they didn't speak.",
        "That's where we get much.",
        "That's where we get the idea of laconic.",
        "And - but I try to go through ancient speeches and see how they would be recorded in the assembly, and I've done that most of my life.",
        "And we do know something about Spartan values, and they were laconic.",
        "They put a premium on valor in battle.",
        "And they had this sense that to make everybody equal would be to make people who were by nature not equal the same as people who were better by nature.",
        "It's a very foul concept to the modern mind, but to the Spartans they wanted to institutionalize hierarchy.",
        "And what Epaminondas represented, at least to them, was the destruction of hierarchy, and they didn't like that at all.",
        "And they said it would be bad for Greece as a whole.",
        "Unleashing chaos upon the world.",
        "There is an order now.",
        "We enforce it.",
        "And if you destroy it, this ridiculous nonsense that all men and even women are equal, well, what comes after that?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's especially a contemporary - we see things in the Middle East, Iraq, Afghanistan - and the idea that we're going to want to do good and we can do good, it requires a thought process that goes to the nth degree about what follows.",
        "And this is what the Thebans are discovering, that even though that Messenia is a wonderful free city and the Helots are amazingly energetic, today if you go to Greece and look at the Helot city of Messenia and the scant remains of Sparta, you can see that pent-up energy.",
        "But there's some chaos.",
        "And Philip of Macedon, who's a character in the book, will take advantages of that.",
        "Well, Sparta just simply won't show up at Kyrenia.",
        "It's not able to, and that'll be..."

        "Yes, it was, although I think the vision of Epaminondas was sort of lead from behind.",
        "It was the idea that he was going to allow all of these city-states to become autonomous.",
        "And once they got the taste of democracy or constitutional government free of Sparta, they would have these enormous citadels at places like Mantinia and Megalopolis, still there, and then they would be a community of rivals, so to speak.",

        "Yes, he did, even more so than the father ever imagined.",

        "He was.",
        "And people have argued in bits and pieces throughout classical literature that much of the Macedonian phalanx, some of its tactics, came from his stewardship as a young boy under the wings, so to speak, of Epaminondas.",
        "So in the book, he's sort of a weird little character that carries their shields, carries their baggage, but he's always gabbing and talking and noticing terrain.",
        "And at the end, when his tenure is up, he's a hostage.",
        "He can be sent back.",
        "Then he sort of announces, you don't really know who I was, but I was - I'm heir to the king, and I learned a lot here, and you're not quite going to like what I learned."

        "We still don't understand quite why it was that that Epaminondas wanted not merely to defeat the Spartans and drive them back into the Peloponnesus, but to destroy their culture once and for all, a culture that allowed them to prepare for warfare 24/7 because they did not have to grow their own food.",
        "They had that grown for them by their slaves, the Helots.",
        "You're absolutely right.",
        "And even classicists, the esteemed historian Buckler, who wrote a very good book \"\"The Theban Hegemony,\"\" even our experts in the field are not quite sure what happened, because either A) he was a realpolitik Bismarckian character who said, you know what, free the Helots, these people, then they have no economic basis to support perennial training and then pretty soon they'll die in a vine.",
        "Or he was a - he really was an idealist, and he did get tired of the Peloponnesian War and he saw that he could do in two years what Athens could not do in 27.",
        "Athens had tried to free Helots, but they didn't pursue it very well at Pylos and he had studied that.",
        "So the modern scholarly community, because of the dearth of sources, isn't quite convinced one way or the other.",
        "And I try to bring both those elements, but I erred on the side that he was an idealist, I think.",
        "And you had to even invent what he looked like because there was an iron statue of him erected at one of the cities he created for the Helots, the Messenians, but it doesn't exist anymore.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's one of the great tragedies of the ancient world that although Cicero said he was princeps Graecia, the foremost man of Greece, and I think up until the end of the Roman Empire most people thought that; today he's an obscure nobody.",
        "Although I noticed in one of the private letters of George Patton he said I want to aspire to be like Epaminondas.",
        "So he least knew who he was.",
        "But exactly, we don't know how he looked except throughout Plutarch's \"\"Moralia\"\" there's all sorts of little tidbits that suggest that as Pythagorean he did not eat much.",
        "He had only one cloak.",
        "He dress sparingly, and he embraced voluntarily - voluntarily he embraced poverty, so I tried to really bring that out in his appearance.",

        "Absolutely.",

        "Because with the \"\"300,\"\" the novel, and \"\"The Gates of Fire,\"\" a very good novel by Steven Pressfield, the emphasis has been on heroism and the martial order of Sparta and then we have a whole corpus of being Americans, of idealism, especially lately of Athens.",
        "But nobody quite has ever said, well, wait a minute, Thebes seems to be some transition between the discipline of Sparta and the freewheeling chaos of Athens because it was a democracy, but it was a democracy of conservative small landowners, and it was very powerful.",
        "And how could it do, as I said earlier, in two years what Athens couldn't do in 27?",
        "There had to be something about Thebans and Thebes and their form of government and their values, and that's sort of what I tried to bring out in the novel.",
