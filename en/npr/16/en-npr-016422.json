        "They needed a bass player to round out the band.",

        "Hi.",
        "I've taught French horn since 1986, and I have a large studio of private students, and I teach at the college level, as well.",
        "And I totally agree, once you get kids to figure out that it's this cool, different language that they can speak, and especially something kind of quirky like horn, it makes them feel special, and they feel it's sort of like a little kid that figures out hey, I can say a couple words in Spanish, and nobody else can or something like that.",
        "It just turns them on.",
        "They love exploring everything they can about it.",
        "So for me, with my students, it's just making them feel special, making them feel like this is something they can do that nobody else can do.",
        "There's a certain number of notes that they have to know how to play, though.",
        "Do you have drills?",
        "Do you do scales?",
        "But at the same time, once they realize there's that, the camaraderie with other musicians, and I'm sure these guys have experienced the same thing, that when you're in the midst of a big orchestra or a band or any group, there's that feeling of brotherhood and that you're just part of a group like you really aren't in any other setting, I don't think.",
        "Victor, is that right?",
        "Well, I totally agree.",
        "And it's just another form of expressing yourselves.",
        "And sometimes, music can express yourself better than words, because I can we can play a song, like J.D.",
        "and I just played a song, and we may have a certain meaning that we are attaching to the song, but you don't have to know what that is.",
        "You can totally misinterpret it, but as long as you're feeling something cool, it's all right.",
        "Where with verbal language, you may misinterpret one word, and all of a sudden, there's an argument.",
        "So music can be freer than a verbal language, and I agree with this woman that it makes you feel special when you can express yourself with this alternate language.",
        "But do you agree with her you need those certain number of practical skills, those notes, that ability to play certain kinds of chords on your guitar, that sort of thing, before you can start talking?",
        "Yes and no. I agree to play certain types of chords, you need that knowledge, but to play music, you don't need it.",
        "I definitely agree with that.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, you kind of give them the building blocks.",
        "It's just like a little, bitty child.",
        "When they start to learn words, they know how to form the words, but then they manage to get across their meaning even though maybe they don't fully understand sentence structures, things like that yet."

        "So instead of forcing our children who are learning to speak into our boundaries, we learn their way.",
