        "As I was growing up and studying music and learning all wonderful things about it, what I discovered was that my students really didn't have a background in the classical setting.",
        "And what I tried to do as I was teaching was to teach them great music and show it to them and then bring them out of it and say, okay, this is what was done.",
        "Where are you going from this point on?",
        "And I had some success with that.",
        "So you would say, this is what has been done in terms of musicians like or composers like Mozart or Beethoven, like that?",
        "Oh yes, and also performers who did things like Paganini and so forth.",
        "Look at this guy, who was a little kid, who became one of the greatest violinists in the history of (unintelligible).",
        "Can't you do that yourself?",
        "You can.",
        "And did you also perform with them?",
        "Oh, yeah, I'm a jazz trombone player from age eight on, and I'm 75 now, so, you know...",
        "So you were playing them Jack Teagarden and that sort of thing, too.",
        "Oh gosh yes, that and Tommy Dorsey, imitated them all.",
        "That's nice.",
        "So Victor, does that accord with your experience?",
        "Absolutely, because that's how I learned.",
        "I had, you know, great elders, you could say, even though they were my brothers who were just a little older than me.",
        "So they were my elders who were playing along with me, and they were turning me on to their elders.",
        "So they were turning me on to people like, you know, Coltrane and Bird and then the great bass players, you know."

        "Is there a moment, and I wanted to ask you, too, Doug, is there a moment when you're playing with somebody in a group and then you can look them in the eye and engage them in one of those little exchanges of riffs back and forth, a magical moment where you can start saying: You can play, too.",

        "Exactly.",
        "It's a yin-yang symbol on the front, and it is two pieces of wood.",
        "It's a piece of ebony, and this is yellow wood from South America somewhere.",
