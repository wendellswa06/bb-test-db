        "I played in an orchestra because I still don't play a wind instrument, even though I recently bought a trombone.",
        "So I'm hoping to get in there.",
        "But I got into the orchestra when I was in the sixth grade because, you know, before that, I of course, I'd been playing electric guitar electric bass.",
        "And I'd only seen the full upright acoustic basses, the standup.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Mr.",
        "V.",
        "WOOTEN: So I thought I'd be too young or too small to play one, so I chose cello.",
        "I didn't know they made standup basses real small.",
        "But it was a blessing in disguise because, especially at that age, there were no in my opinion, no good parts written for the bass players.",
        "But the cello got all kinds of beautiful melodies and things.",
        "And so I really learned how to read well, and I learned a lot about bowing from playing in the orchestra.",
        "And I've been able to translate that back to the electric bass guitar.",
        "And this is from Neal(ph).",
        "I just spoke with Stanley Clarke a few days ago, asked if he'd ever considered playing a five or a six-string bass.",
        "He said he always felt four strings were enough.",
        "He didn't want to use more.",
        "He also mentioned a photo with himself, Victor and maybe a dozen other bass players.",
        "He called them the last of the four stringers.",
        "Mr. V.",
        "WOOTEN: Yes.",
        "Do you ever experiment with more than four strings on the bass?",
        "Also with art education declining, what can parents do for - exposure for their children?",
        "Mr.",
        "V.",
        "WOOTEN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "I get that totally.",
        "Well, Stanley is my hero, you know.",
        "I met him when I was nine.",
        "And he's just always been one of my main musical influences.",
        "And I, like him, am most comfortable on a four-string bass.",
        "But I also understand that the bass doesn't make the music.",
        "In other words, if I were to put the microphone up to the bass right now, you wouldn't hear anything.",
        "So that let's you know that I make the music.",
        "Stanley Clarke makes the music.",
        "And Stanley Clarke would make great music on whatever he play, you know.",
        "So the thing is is that we play what makes us comfortable.",
        "So if a five-string bass, a six-string bass or a two-string bass makes you comfortable, that's what you should play.",
        "And this from Jay(ph).",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And if they don't have that performance - if they don't have those performances, it makes it very difficult to really get interested in music more than just the lessons.",

        "It builds confidence, helps them focus, builds discipline and just gives them a wonderful outlet in their lives.",

        "I totally agree.",
        "I totally agree.",

        "In other words, we'll practice something over and over and get into our performance and can't do it.",
        "And so I always say, we need to find ways of making our practice like a performance and making our performance like practice so that both of them are the same thing.",
        "So one of the things that I like to do is I will find an audience before my student or before I'm ready.",

        "I urge all of us teachers to start including all of music into what we call music theory, not just notes.",
