        "What's number one on your list for reading this summer?",
        "Well, I think the book that a lot of people are gonna be talking about, although it's definitely a very intense book with some gruesome moments in it, is The Ruins by Scott Smith.",
        "This is a book that if you - I would not recommend you pick it up if you have anything else you need to do in the next eight hours or so because you're not gonna want to put it back down again.",
        "It's about five backpackers who are stranded in a Mexican jungle, and it's a kind of a combination of a very sort of grueling survival story - they have to deal with some basic issues like food and water, and then there's an extra menace that takes them a long time to understand.",
        "And the thing that's so gripping about it is that it's very realistic.",
        "The people behave in very realistic ways, and the problems they face are very realistic, and yet there is this extra added element of horror to it that kind of takes it over the edge.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "It's a book that a lot of people are gonna wanna talk to other people about when they finish it.",
        "This extra menace.",
        "You're not gonna tell us what this extra menace is.",
        "No, I don't wanna ruin it.",

        "Charlotte Abbott, is this gonna be the The Da Vinci Code of this summer?",
        "Well, I would definitely say I've been hearing a lot of buzz about it, especially come out of the Book Expo, which was last weekend.",
        "That's when all the booksellers get together.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "And so there is definitely a buzz about it, and is there something that you're looking forward to reading when you go to the beach?",
        "Well, I'll tell you one thing that everybody was talking about at Book Expo, was a novel called Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen, which is just out in hardcover from Algonquin, and one of the causes of excitement was that it's one of the first works of fiction that's really taken off.",
        "It's been a quiet spring, I think, in the wake of James Frey and Katya Basnowathen(ph), and the sort of plagiarism and memoir scandals have kind of dampened enthusiasm for books for a while.",
        "Hmm.",
        "This one is, it's set, it's about a veterinarian who joins a second-rate circus during the Depression, and there's a love story.",
        "He falls in love with one of the performers.",
        "Unfortunately, she's married to a psychotic animal trainer, so it has a sentimental tinge, but a lot of people are enjoying it for its historical detail and, of course, for the love story.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Let's get Oscar into the mix out in San Francisco.",
        "Oscar Villalon, what's your number one pick for the summer?",
        "Well, my number one pick is actually a book that came out in 1956, originally, but was reissued not too long ago by the New York Review of Books.",
        "It's Oakley Hall's Western Warlock, which some people may remember from, I guess, the movie with Anthony Quinn and Richard Widmark.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "But it is astounding, frankly.",
        "It's a big, fat tome, in the best sense.",
        "It's beautifully written, and it's absolutely, it's absolutely gripping.",
        "Technically, yeah, it's a Western in that it involves the town of Warlock.",
        "It's set somewhere, probably, it could be around, it looks like Arizona, around the Arizona-Mexico border, and it's a struggle for the civility of the town."

        "That is to say, are they going to let the outsiders, who literally live outside the town take control of it or will civilization triumph in the form of the businessmen and their plans for, you know, for basically, well, growing the town and making it respectable and maybe one day even making it a county seat?",
        "Now that's the, if you will, that's the front story.",
        "But the backdrop, real story, is that this struggle becomes, well, you know, a metaphor for the whole American experience, basically, not only of trying to settle a, you know, so-called wild land but also dealing with the fact of how vicious people can be, you know, doing, you know, evil in the name of good, these sort of things.",
        "And it's also just, it's just flat-out suspenseful, and the action is beautiful, and the characterizations are lovely.",
        "It's literature.",
        "Don't mistake it for, you know, for anything else.",
        "It is actually literature, but it's a beautiful genre work.",
        "When was it first published?",
        "With that cast in the movie, some time ago.",
        "Right.",
        "I think 1956 is when the book originally came out, and the New York Review of Books reissued it with an introduction by Robert Stone and with a blurb from, of all people, Thomas Pynchon, who apparently could not get enough of the book when he was in Cornell and just read and re-read it and re-read it.",

        "One, there is a diary that's written by one of the local businessmen, and it's written in this arch Victorian sort of speak, and it's very florid and funny.",
        "And then the rest of it is in this third-person omniscient.",
        "That's this plain, stripped-down prose but very, very muscular, and it's a prose that if you've read Cormac McCarthy or Robert Stone, you'll recognize it right away, and basically Oakley Hall was the first guy to do this."
