        "It's an incredible read.",
        "And what's it about?",
        "It's about a true story of a backcountry ranger in Square Kings National Park.",
        "He went missing, I think, in 1996.",
        "And so it's the whole epic of finding him and, you know, what a search is involved - what's involved in a search in a national park.",
        "But it's also a really interesting perspective on what is like being a backcountry ranger.",
        "And I just - it was an incredible read.",
        "I'm giving it to a lot of friends for summer.",
        "If you backpack, if you go into the mountains - it's in hardcover.",
        "But well written.",
        "It's just a great, great read.",
        "Is this a true story or one that purports to be true?",
        "True story.",
        "The ranger's name is Randy Morgenson...",

        "...so the story's his life and, like I said, about what rangers do and how rangering has changed since the Wilderness Act came into - since that was legislated.",

        "Actually, I do.",
        "The one that I'm recommending is Adam Hochschild's book Bury the Chains: Prophets and Rebels and the Fight to Free an Empire's Slaves.",
        "It came out, I think, in last far, but it's still in hardcover.",
        "It may be coming - actually, I think it's actually now on paperback.",
        "But anyway, Hochschild, your listeners may know him from his last book, King Leopold's Ghost, which was his nonfiction account...",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "...of the Belgian king and his atrocities.",
        "Yeah, right.",
        "That he oversaw in the Congo.",
        "And this is sort of an offshoot from that, because what Hochschild did was he went back to sort of that story and looked at the - basically, what was the first human rights movement in the West, where you had a group of people, and a small group of people, who banded together and basically said that slavery was unacceptable.",
        "Now, they did this at a time when slavery was more the common condition than freedom.",
        "I mean, we tend to focus on, you know, just the South and stuff.",
        "But anyway, that's the one.",
        "It's a beautiful piece of narrative history, if I may use the word beautiful again.",

        "And she is this kind of insecure, awkward but ambitious young woman who's trying to make her way in the world and then also sort of trying to figure out what's going on in some of these stories that she covers.",
        "And it's a - the first book was called The Field of Blood.",

        "No, it's not.",
        "And it's very gritty and very realistic and - you know, she's just a very sympathetic character.",
        "And why don't we go to Oscar Villalon, and any ideas for science fiction this summer?",
        "Well, yes, but technically it's not a sci-fi story when it came out.",
        "It's Kazuo Ishiguro novel Never Let Me Go.",
        "Ostensibly - this gets into a whole, something else, completely different, which is the idea that sometimes we don't find it compatible to say that something that's a genre work is also literature.",
        "But anyway, this book is, Ishiguro's novel, about - it's a coming of age story essentially of children who live in this sort of specialized school.",
        "And they live there from when they're very little to - all the way through high school and graduate.",
        "And essentially they're clones, human clones.",
