        "What's Absurdistan about?",
        "Absurdistan is about a young man, he's around 30, and very, very, very big man who is a Russian citizen but he's been going to college in the U.S.",
        "and he gets stranded in Russia and he's trying to get back to the U.S.",
        "and he has all these kind of grotesque and hilarious and horrifying adventures in post-Soviet Russia and this satellite state called Absurdistan.",
        "Okay.",
        "I'm really quite busy, so I usually don't have a lot of time to sit down and do a lot of reading.",
        "But I've been doing a lot of reading of poetry, and I'm wondering if anybody has any suggestions on summer poetry reading.",
        "I've been reading a lot of Jarrel(ph) now that we're involved in this fabulous crisis.",
        "And just - and I'm wondering if anybody has any contemporary...",
        "I can actually think of somebody who is great if you don't have a lot of time.",
        "Her name is Kay Ryan and she writes very short poems that have the advantage that you almost never find in contemporary poetry, which is that they're very witty.",
        "And I have often been reading her books.",
        "The one that I think of, off the top of my head, is Elephant Rocks.",
        "But she has a more recent one that's called Niagara.",
        "And I've been reading them on the subway sometimes and laughed out loud.",
        "And I think that that's probably the most extraordinary thing about them, is that they're literally so clever and so funny that...",
        "Yeah...",
        "...you might laugh out loud.",
        "I actually heard Kay Ryan, recently, speaking about her work, and it sounds really great.",
        "I haven't actually - I've yet to read her, but I'm...",
        "Oh, she's good, yeah.",
        "They're also very short."

        "Terrific.",

        "So, very, very short.",
        "You might also want to try, in honor of Stanley Kunitz, who just passed away, the former - to look up some of his, maybe his collected poems or go back to some of his work.",

        "Because, I don't know, I'm in the middle of reading all this serious stuff about the ward and everything, the world of mongrels and wizards just seems that much, you know, more enthralling.",

        "Yeah.",
        "And I have one more question to the people, you know, in your panel, that is there anything good in the historical genre which is going to come out this summer which doesn't have the word Da Vinci, Templar, Priory of Scion and, gosh, one more, Mary Magdalene.",

        "I can't remember what his exact status was.",
        "And there is mystery.",
        "Some of the cadets turn up dead and a detective comes in to figure out what's going on and Edgar Allan Poe becomes his friend and assistant in solving this mystery.",
        "It's very moody.",
        "You know, it very much has the feeling of the Hudson River Valley in the early 1900s.",
        "And it's fairly accurate about Edgar Allen Poe's personality.",
        "So you might want to check that one out.",
        "Also, I recommend, along those lines in terms of a historical novel - would be Luis Alberto Urrea's novel, The Hummingbird's Daughter.",
        "It won the Kuriyama Prize, I think, this year.",
        "And it's set in northern Mexico in the state of Sinaloa, which is sort of like central north.",
        "Anyway, it's his story basically, about a relative of his, I guess, who at some point became sort of like this unofficial saint.",
        "And it's 19th century Mexico going into the early 20th century.",
        "It's beautiful.",
        "There's that word.",
        "And he was a poet, and so every single line in that book is written with a sort of care that you normally don't find in a lot of novels.",

        "It's got war, love, tragedy.",

        "And it's probably, you know, one of the best novels frankly to come out in the last five years.",
        "Ronnie, were you looking for historical fiction or history?",
        "History mainly, actually.",
        "But, you know, I think the first one that she said, the Edgar Allen Poe one, really seems interesting.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Thank you, Julie.",
        "And one more thing, just a quick anecdote.",
        "I had a big discussion with one of my nieces in India and they're all convinced that Harry is the final hocrux.",
        "So, if J.K.",
        "Rowling turns up with that, you heard it from me first.",
        "Alright, well, speaking of history books, Nathaniel Philbrick, who had, of course, great success with his previous books, has a doorstop coming out about the pilgrims.",
        "Anybody read that?"
