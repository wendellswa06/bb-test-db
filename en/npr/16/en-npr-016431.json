        "Now, I have to tell you I haven't read it, but it's the book that they chose and - so that might be something that younger people might want to read.",
        "Actually, older people too, because a lot of those books are really books that are worthy of any age.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "And somebody earlier asked about poetry.",
        "A poet that we really like here is Frank X.",
        "Walker, and he has a new book called Black Box.",
        "I'm not sure who the publisher is and how - you can find it on Amazon, I know.",
        "What kind of poet is he?",
        "He's black.",
        "And he writes about African Americans, but they, of course, have greater themes than just that.",
        "And he wrote about - another one of his poetry books is about York, the slave that went with Lewis and Clark.",
        "And, of course, they're heading back, you know, this is the return year.",
        "And it's called Buffalo Dreams.",
        "And he's just wonderful.",
        "He reads a lot at our library, things here in Kentucky, and I really, really liked his poetry.",
        "And so if anybody is looking for poetry, they're not real long.",
        "But his - in this black box, they're about kind of unsung, unknown black folk of Kentucky.",
        "But again, he's - I'm not black, and I think anybody, you know, could find messages in his poetry.",
        "All right, Nancy.",

        "It's about - it follows the lives of two characters.",
        "One is a changeling, an Irish spirit, and the other is the child that he steals and replaces.",
        "So it follows the two characters throughout next 40, 50 years of their lives, and it's a lot about identify and finding your place in the world.",

        "Particularly just trying to fit in, her family, she feels sort of a misfit.",

        "She's kind of like Holly Golightly at 70, and keeps dragging her out of her normal existence and putting her in very awkward situations.",
        "I think people may really, really dig that one for the summer.",
        "Again, it's one of very few things I've read that made me laugh out loud.",
        "You know, there's a lot of things you read that are somewhat funny, you kind of, you know, snicker a little bit, but start cracking up like a madman on the bus and people look at you.",

        "It's a memoir by a woman who was seven days into a bike journey across the country in 1977, when she was a Yale student, and she and her roommate were run over in their tent and attacked by a man with an axe.",
        "It seems almost a cliché, and yet she had to survive it.",
        "Her arm was gashed and her friend was nearly blinded from head injuries.",
        "And the culprit was never found, and she felt she lost a part of herself, an innocence, but more than that, in the experience.",
        "And she was haunted by it, as you can imagine.",
        "Fifteen years later, she went back to the town in Oregon to try to recover the part of herself she lost, and found that the town hadn't really been able to move on, either.",
        "The man who many people suspected of this crime was still among them, and she - come - follows the story to a point of some emotional resolution, and it's not quite In Cold Blood, but I think readers who like that kind of story will find some real chills and catharsis there.",
        "Laura Miller, you will be our alpha and our omega."
