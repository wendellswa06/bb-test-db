        "So how much of an asset is the family name?",
        "Well, it's a tremendous advantage because these candidates always begin with much more name recognition than their opponents.",
        "You also, if you're a daughter of a candidate, you begin with the fundraising rolodex of your parent.",
        "And we see them thriving also because so many of the daughters, and this is true of any of the children of politicians, so many of them have spent countless hours with their parents in the political arena.",
        "They have been mentored by the best in the business and they understand how the game works.",
        "But does the family name ever backfire?",
        "It does occasionally.",

        "Because the Cheney family ended up going through this painful public split over Liz's position on gay marriage, since another Cheney daughter, Mary Cheney, was married to a woman.",
        "But what does this say about who we are as a democratic society, Charlie?",
        "Is this the way it's supposed to be, that you get to run, and perhaps win, just because your dad did?",
        "Well, you'd think for a nation that was born in revolution that the idea of this heirloom congressional seat or state office would be something that we recoil at, but we really don't.",
        "In fact, we've got a couple hundred years of history of children of politicians ascending to power.",
        "And it's a real problem now, I think, and really a reflection of the role that big money plays in national politics because it tells you one thing, which is name recognition is really important and name recognition is really expensive.",
        "And so if your parents don't have a name that's recognized in politics, you begin at a huge disadvantage.",

        "And when he was there, received certain assurances about what the North was willing to negotiate about when Kim Jong Un meets later with President Trump.",
        "And importantly, it's at that point when U.S.",
        "officials became convinced that North Korea was willing to put the issue of denuclearization on the table, which is just a really significant concession that they would be willing to make.",
        "So this was apparently quite a fateful meeting that the two had.",
        "So this is, in theory, the Trump ministration not wanting to put the president out there in this meeting if they're not at least convinced that North Korea is willing to at least come some distance and negotiate.",
        "And this is kind of setting the table and making sure that they feel confident with the president going into this."
