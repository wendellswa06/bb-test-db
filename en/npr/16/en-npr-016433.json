        "They didn't say how they got them, but it was becoming clearer to us that the Trump administration would not come out and say we think the North is willing to negotiate on this unless they were pretty darn sure that that was the case, and it appears that they got that assurance from this meeting.",
        "Well, isn't this also extraordinary because it was not clear at the time who was actually representing the United States as the top diplomat?",
        "I mean, President Trump nominated Pompeo to be secretary of state.",
        "In theory, though, Rex Tillerson was supposed to still be in charge of diplomacy, right?",

        "It's quite unusual and probably would come as a surprise to Rex Tillerson, too.",
        "I mean, what you've seen is that Mike Pompeo, although he was the director of the Central Intelligence Agency - usually a very kind of secretive, clandestine role - has been taking on more of the responsibilities of America's chief diplomat.",
        "And it's our understanding that part of this outreach to North Korea was done with the idea in mind that eventually, if everything went according to the White House's plan, Pompeo would be transitioning over into the role of secretary of state and would sort of be there to pick it up.",
        "But these channels of communication that have been going on so far have all been conducted through intelligence channels, different in the way we've traditionally done things in the past.",
        "Mike Pompeo has really been the leader in that.",

        "There are several big studies that came out during that time from exercise physiologist that had devised really simple tools for measuring fitness, and they found that American kids were much less fit than European kids, and Eisenhower saw that and said, we've got to do something.",
        "He actually created the President's Council on Physical Fitness, and that's where it became sort of a political issue.",
        "From there, it, the idea of exercise and fitness being a personal choice developed slowly through the 60s and 70s.",

        "You've got, at both ends, you've got about 25 percent of the population that says, the people who say they exercise routinely and then you, at the other end of the spectrum, you've got 25 percent of people who say they do no exercise at all.",
        "The other half falls in between.",

        "We actually have a pretty good answer for that now.",
        "We know that in a study, the Nurse's Health Study, that was 70,000 nurses looked at over a period of eight years, they found that nurses who walked three hours a week or more cut their risk of cardiovascular disease by about a third, somewhere between 30 and 40 percent.",
        "Pretty big number.",
        "Pretty big number, and the interesting thing is that people who actually exercise more did not get any kind of increased protection, meaning they, exercising more didn't seem to, uh, protect you from stroke, heart attack risk, that sort of thing.",
        "So the idea took shape that what we need is a consistent amount, perhaps a half hour a day of moderate exercise that can be something as simple as walking.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "If you go to a gym, what a fitness manager will call them, they'll call them toys, and the idea is that, you know, fitness competes with social time, and when people get, go to a gym, they want, they don't want to be bored.",
        "I mean, the reason why people don't go into stationary bikes anymore is because there's something much more interesting, spinning, where you actually have a teacher, and the teacher's got music going, the teacher's having you, you know, do dynamics within a class to get you motivated.",

        "First of all, I've tried for the past almost 40 years now, since we started this work, to bridge the gap between faddism and scientific legitimacy, using exercise for projects of medicine, because in my early days, if people were physically fit when they were free from disease, fitness wasn't cardiovascular fitness, it was absence of disease.",

        "So when I developed the aerobics concept, and actually invented the word back in 1966, I was preparing for that manuscript on that first book, got to that chapter with endurance exercise, just walking, running, cycling and swimming, in those days, I recall the word isometrics.",
        "It was a popular word.",
