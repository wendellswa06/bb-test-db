        "So what you do is you start with 220, the number 220, and you subtract 60 from it, and then from there, so what number does that give us?",
        "160",
        "Okay, yeah, 160, and then you want to exercise about, at 65 percent capacity of that, so that would put you in the what?",
        "One?",
        "One-sixty, half of that would be 80, say around 90.",
        "Around 90, that would be considered 65 percent.",
        "I mean, this is like the standard measurement of trying to figure out what your maximum potential heart rate should be.",
        "Now there's a lot of controversy because the guy who came up with this has pretty much admitted that it's, you know, it was this rough calculation and he had no idea that over time it would end up as being this calculation everyone uses.",
        "So obviously, if you don't feel like you're getting enough of a workout from that, the idea would be your, I've heard exercise physiologists say that your body can tell you to, you know, move it up a little higher, to 75 or 85 percent.",
        "So that's sort of the ballpark of how to calculate it.",
        "And is it worth doing?",
        "That's an interesting question, and I think the science on that, it comes out both ways.",
        "I think the idea is, there's been a lot of focus in trying to figure out what is the significance of getting the heart rate up?",
        "Clearly, you do have to get it up in order to get, you know, cardiovascular results.",
