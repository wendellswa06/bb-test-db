        "Yeah, that's correct.",
        "And a met is, essentially, one met is the number of calories that you burn per kilogram of body weight when you're sleeping, when you're completely at rest.",
        "And I don't know if this is, Dr. Cooper could probably weigh in much more intelligently on this.",
        "But I don't know if this is the same for everybody, but I believe it's 70 calories per kilogram of body weight when you're at rest, so it's called a Kcal.",
        "So, when you're cranking up your mets, if it says 6 mets, that, you are generating six times, you're expending six times the number of calories than you would when you were completely at rest.",
        "And if you're at, you know, 18 mets, then you're really cranking and you're expending 18 times the number of calories you would completely at rest.",
        "And I believe Neal is exactly correct on watts, how much energy you are outputting through that exercise.",
        "Okay.",
        "Are there targets that I should be aiming for, for both of these or either of them?",
        "Dr.",
        "Cooper, what do you think?",
        "DR.",
        "COOPER: Well, first of all, a met is just a metabolic unit and at rest, it's 3.5 mg of oxygen consumption per (unintelligible) body weight.",
        "Now, mets and points that we talked about earlier are not the same because points integrate mets and duration.",
        "Mets is just intensity.",
        "Watts is the power, how much you're expending.",
        "But, Janice, what you need to do on bicep, we do our spinning classes, if you have a heart rate monitor that you're exercising on, you don't have to worry about the watts or the mets, but you try to keep your heart rate for that 20 minute exercise an average of 140 or at 30 minutes, 130.",
        "So, you eliminate that and look at the scientific output, the scientific results, and I can guarantee you results if you'll do that.",
        "So, again, the most important thing that I always recommend to my patients is listen to your body and don't exercise to the point of severe chronic fatigue.",
        "Exercise within your limits, and listen to your body.",

        "So, yoga is a good place to start, because it will help you with stretching.",
        "It also helps with building muscle, and when you get to the point where you can actually add almost a cardiovascular level to yoga, you'll be doing something called yoga flow, for instance, where you're actually moving freely and actually getting your heart rate up a bit.",
        "So, I would say that it very much depends on what kind of yoga you choose, and you should do a little bit of research there about your options locally and watch some classes.",
        "You'll get a sense of those that can actually get your heart rate up versus those that are just very simple stretching classes.",
        "The trend in yoga right now, in terms of taking yoga into fitness centers, is that there's a lot of fusion classes, meaning they're combining yoga with other higher impact type exercises.",
        "I know in Santa Monica, for instance, there are gyms that offer an hour class where you do a half hour of yoga and then a half hour of spinning, which is a very, you know, cardiovascular type exercise that's going to really get that heart rate up."
