        "Jenny.",
        "Jenny.",

        "I found myself enacting a pose called The Dragon that involves sticking one's tongue out.",
        "And my neighbor was reaching for the air sickness bag to hand to me.",
        "But in seriousness, there was a study I wrote about in October from the American Council on Exercise and you will get, as Allison intoned, you're going to get a lot of debate on this if you ask somebody in the yoga community, they're going to be a big fan of telling you all you need is yoga for lifelong health and fitness.",
        "That is not untrue, but the American Council on Exercise found that exercise, that yoga was not aerobic for the vast majority of the public.",
        "Most classes offered do not help you burn enough calories to drop weight.",
        "What a previous guest on the show was mentioning, Dr. Cooper, essentially it's a simple equation.",
        "You have to expend more calories every day, on average, than you are consuming.",
        "And a safe level is 200-300 calories per day of a deficit that you want to run.",
        "You want to burn 200-300 more than you're eating, and that means the boring tasks of keeping track of your diet and keeping track of how much you're exercising and how many calories that exercise burns.",
        "You don't have to do the research.",
        "So, to get a general idea, I'll wrap this up quickly, is caloriesperhour.com is a great website to see how many calories each activity, and it's a huge list, down to housework, gardening, dancing, yoga, tennis, will tell you, of all those activities, how many calories they burn and then just match that up against what you're eating and try to run a safe and healthy deficit.",
        "And it will take a little bit of time, but you should get there.",
        "And a general rule about burning fat is that in a pound of fat there are about 3500 calories.",
        "So to shed a pound, you need to burn 3500 calories.",
        "That's a general equation that exercise physiologists will put out there."

        "This is one of those questions, it sounds like you're in pretty good shape, Shannon.",

        "Well everybody would like to lose that last ten or fifteen pounds, but some of us, maybe aren't meant to lose that last --",
        "Right.",
        "I was going to say, are you sure you need to?",
        "I mean, have you looked at BMI or are you focused on weight?",
        "Or have you looked at the other measurements of fitness?",
        "I've tried to look at everything, but I really just go by how I feel and how I feel when I look in the mirror.",
        "And, you know, I just know, like, I could still lose just ten to fifteen pounds to be a little bit more healthier and little bit more flexible and agile."

        "You know one, this is John, Shannon, one thing to ask is, how long have you been doing your current exercise regimen?",
        "About two years.",
        "Okay.",
        "One thing that experts recommend is, it's called periodization, and what that means is mixing it up every four to six weeks, because what the human body does, it grows accustomed to what you are subjecting it to.",
        "So if you go, for example, and I doubt this is your program, but if you went to the gym every single day and did 45 minutes on a spin bike, and then 45 minutes of weight lifting, upper body one day, lower body the next, and you just did that, over time your body will become used to that workout, and it will become more efficient in handling that stress.",
        "Because exercise is stress on the body.",
        "So it'll become more efficient at handling that, and therefore use less energy to accomplish the tasks.",
        "So try to mix it up.",
        "If you normally run, maybe try swimming.",
        "If you normally swim, try biking.",
        "Obviously you enjoy rock climbing, so don't ever stop doing that, but mixing it up not only keeps it interesting and introduces you to new exercises, but it's also good for your body and can help you burn a few extra calories.",

        "That's right.",
