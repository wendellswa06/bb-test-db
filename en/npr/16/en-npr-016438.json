        "The parade considerably precedes the football game in history.",
        "There were camel races before there was a football game, but there was a parade.",
        "And how did they get started?",
        "It got started in 1890 because the city fathers in Pasadena wanted to show New York, the rest of the world insofar as it could then that this was a place where roses were still blooming in the middle of winter, to show off the beauties of Southern California.",
        "And it's a grand spectacle.",
        "Of course, I gather, it must have started out rather smaller.",
        "It did, people in their carriages and little boys with their wagons all dolled up with flowers.",
        "But once they started televising in the 1950s, in particular, it became an international event.",
        "And the focus wasn't just on the escapism, on the family friendly theme, but who was in the parade and who wasn't.",
        "Well, it's interesting, you go back to 1950 and that, of course, was a year - well, 1952, year of political transition as Democrats finally were leaving the White House after a good long time.",
        "This was before the election, January before the election of '52.",
        "And one of the floats showed the Republican donkey - or Republican elephant entering the White House and a Democratic donkey leaving it.",
        "So there'd been a lot of political themes.",
        "A lot of the grand marshals had been Republican politicians.",
        "California used to be a Republican state, but it has been traditional and conservative for many years."

        "The NRA used to sponsor a float.",

        "Many of the other women who had been grand marshals in the past had been Shirley Temple.",

        "It's putting on California's face to the world, and that face really needs to resemble Southern California.",
