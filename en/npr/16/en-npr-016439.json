        "Just to note, whether you take this as political or not is, I guess, up to your point of view.",
        "The Defense Department, for the first time, put a float in the Tournament of Roses Parade, one of the most watched parades in the country, to commemorate veterans from a conflict that still casts a shadow over the world.",
        "A $247,000 flower-covered float is a replica of the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C.",
        "Consistently, over the years, Neal, they've had military heroes, generals, Korean War veterans as grand marshals of the parade.",
        "And there's always been an effort to honor the military.",
        "And the Iraq veteran and the \"\"Dancing with the Stars\"\" star, I think his name was J.R.",

        "Hey.",
        "Hi.",
        "I actually live in Los Angeles.",
        "I'm driving back today, but I remember growing up, my dad and my mom were separated, but every year my dad would come and pick me up really early in the morning and we'd go to the parade route, and he'd actually bring a ladder so that I could go all the way to the top so I could see over everyone's head.",
        "And it was great because, you know, there was a time when I didn't really like going to the parade, where I was just kind of over it, but I kind of seem to circle back around to it and be, like, really all about it because it's something that represents Pasadena and, like, the city of Los Angeles because everyone goes there.",
        "Everyone, you know, they're throwing silly string, they're doing this and that to the cars on the parade route.",
        "But for the most part, it's just like a great time had by all.",
        "How long did the parade seem to take as you were there as, what, an 8-year-old or 10-year-old boy?",
        "Honestly, it felt like six or seven hours, like - I remember this one time, I think Will Smith was on the parade route, and my dad gave me a camera.",
        "But I just remember seeing that float go by but it felt like it took like, like, you know, it took maybe about a minute to go by, but it felt so long because I was just like kind of excited and there was something like I've seen him on television before, and now I'm seeing him in real life.",
        "So it's something pretty exciting, and I think that's what made it feel like it took forever.",
        "Marcello, thanks very much.",
