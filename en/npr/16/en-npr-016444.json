        "We need a person in charge.",
        "When it comes to the long-term process, though, and the long-term rebuilding, we here in the United States do things very differently than they do, for example, in Europe.",
        "We depend upon the market to do it.",
        "And the market means, just as Chuck was alluding to, finding the contractors, getting money from the insurance company, getting money, perhaps, from the SBA, whatever source is possible to rebuild our homes, rebuild our apartment complexes, rebuild ultimately our community.",
        "And those--we all take individual decisions about our homes and that sort of thing, but the elected officials have to take the decisions about the community.",
        "Well, absolutely.",
        "I mean, the elected officials, both at the local level, but really, you know, at this point when we're looking at a community like Hurricane Andrew--excuse me, Miami after Hurricane Andrew, New Orleans, Northridge and dealing with those situations after the earthquake there, it really depends upon a lot of governmental action to bring back infrastructure.",
        "People--you won't see the reinvestments in New Orleans unless we get the levees rebuilt, unless we get the levees probably strengthened, we get the infrastructure up, the bridges back up, the roads back up.",
        "And then, of course, the utility and the utility companies have to be involved as well.",
        "So it takes coordinated effort.",
        "It takes effort by public officials and more broadly by our government.",
        "After that, though, and when it comes to rebuilding your homes and issues along those lines, then we're really into the multitude of decisions that have to be made by oftentimes homeowners.",
        "But we need to remember that, for example, in the New Orleans case, you know, over 53 percent of the population were renters.",
        "They don't have the same kind of decisions and responsibility, but they do have, of course, the responsibility of trying to find homes for their families and the like.",
        "But they cannot take those actions.",
        "Now we're talking about businesses and developers taking actions and making decisions.",
        "See if we can get a caller on the line and this is Ed.",
        "Ed's calling us from Portland, Oregon.",
        "Hi.",
        "I was just--all the talk about New Orleans and how it's been, you know, below sea level, which attributed a major problem remind me of--in the '50s, my hometown of Portland had a suburb called New Forge that was built below the level of the surrounding rivers and after a major storm it got flooded and thousands of people made homeless and everything, and I know at least here in Portland, they just decided to abandon the city rather than rebuild its location.",
        "And I know New Orleans has a lot of history, but it does make me wonder why there is even any serious consideration of rebuilding when it's--I mean, one levee leaking and there it goes again.",
        "Well, at least parts of the city.",
        "That's an interesting point, Ed.",
        "We'll get to that after the break.",

        "Is there the political will to ask hard questions about what's worth rebuilding and what isn't?",

        "Very well, thank you.",

        "I went to school there back in the '80s and lived there for six years.",
        "And part of what made the city so great was the closeness of the different socioeconomic groups.",
        "And your guest (technical difficulties) was mentioning that there were so many renters, and I'm concerned about the rebuilding process sort of meaning that people who own the lots will sell them to other people who have more money and that some of what made New Orleans so great will be lost in the course of that.",
        "So I'm choosing Habitat For Humanity as my charity of choice because I think...",
        "Well, there's a real possibility to have major changes that could occur and especially in this case.",
        "I think Heather brings up an excellent point.",
        "I mean, the fact is that we have very large component of the population in New Orleans that's rental housing, renters themselves.",
        "We have--What?--27, almost 28 percent of the population that were living below poverty.",
        "Markets, for all their wonder--and they do marvelous jobs in terms of rebuilding.",
        "So much of the housing that was rebuilt after Hurricane Andrew was made possible because of that, but markets have also failed.",
        "They've failed systematically to bring housing for low-income households.",
        "Affordable housing becomes a real issue, and that's why we have to have programs like HUD and other types of programs, community block grants, to try to facilitate that.",
        "And we've really got to see that type of action take place in this context; otherwise there is a very, very real threat that we won't see that richness, we won't see the diversity that was once New Orleans come back.",
        "In addition there, the simple problems with--we have got essentially the entire population gone.",
        "And large components of that population simply will not be able to come back.",
        "And, again, those at most risk, the low-income households, minority households, that are being distributed throughout the entire nation indeed now are struggling.",
        "They're going to have to get jobs, get kids back in school.",
        "And it is very difficult to come back in those situations.",
        "So we're dealing with a very unique situation here.",
        "There has to be then in this situation government action to ensure that we get the broad spectrum of housing back, that we get a broad-based community redeveloping in those areas."

        "So a huge difference in scale, I'm sure.",
        "But how much of your city had to be rebuilt?",
        "Well, we lost about--well, 8,000 homes were affected by the actual flood, and we knocked down about 1,000 homes near the river.",
        "Seventy-five percent of our community was covered with water, and East Grand Forks, Minnesota, had about 95 percent.",
        "So we had some extensive home rebuilding, and just about all of our downtown had to be rebuilt.",
