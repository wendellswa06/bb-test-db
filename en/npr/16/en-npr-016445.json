        "Businesses got first priority in the rebuilding, but a lot of people had found that they were either uninsured or underinsured to rebuild.",

        "It could be a real danger as well, too, as Alana was mentioning about, you know, other people buying up homes or, you know, not being able to rebuild, because there could be that attempt to make it almost like a Disney World place, where it's recaptured artificially.",
        "And I think one of the things we need to be concerned about is recapturing it actually through the people that were there.",
