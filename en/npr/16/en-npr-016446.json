        "And, of course, the Dutch learned their lesson in 1953 after disastrous floods.",
        "You're right.",
        "There often is a window of opportunity where we can reassess the situation and perhaps learn from it.",
        "I think California is a wonderful example of how they have dealt with the issue of earthquake, earthquake risk, and continually, after event after event, building codes are looked at, issues about, you know, making our homes more seismically safe; same thing with respect to wind in Florida.",
        "The problem often is, is that we forget those lessons.",
        "And I'll have to be honest that in the post-9/11 world that we live in now, I think there's been a moving away from mitigation related to natural hazards.",
        "And I hope, indeed, that this is a new window of opportunity, and we will re-look at FEMA, we will re-look at local and federal government emphasis on building back better and learning the lessons and not forgetting those lessons.",
        "Mitch, thanks very much.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You bet.",
        "And let's see if we can get one more caller in on this.",

        "Hey, how are y'all today?",
        "Very well.",
        "I'm a native New Orleanian, and while this is a tremendous tragedy from a historical perspective, New Orleans was a city that was very sick as far as--the school system was abysmal, and many about to be taken over by the state.",
        "The political system has been inherently corrupt.",
        "And this, from a therapeutic standpoint, might be a golden opportunity to really rethink and rework not only the physical city, but also the psychological part of the city, and get rid of some of that corruption.",
        "It, to me, is sort of a cleansing.",
        "And this tragedy, I mean, from a personal perspective, has cost my family dearly.",
        "Three of my family members are now no longer living in New Orleans right now.",
        "So we need to look at the other side of this.",
        "This is a city with major problems, and now we're going to be able to, hopefully, do it again and do it much better.",
        "The point you've been making, Walter.",
        "Abso--again, a window of opportunity.",
        "And we see that also happen after disaster throughout the United States, that oftentimes corrupt local governments are re-examined.",
        "You know, there's kind of a breaking open of that social fabric and political fabric, and we can see a little bit behind the scenes and re-evaluate those things.",
        "And I would have to agree.",
        "I mean, there were and there are some fundamental problems there at the local level, as well, too, and perhaps this will be a rebirth, a reopening.",
        "But it has to be a comprehensive redevelopment strategy here so it is all-inclusive and not just focusing on one component of the population..."

        "On September 8th, 1900--the anniversary's tomorrow--a hurricane hit Galveston, Texas, that until last week was considered the deadliest natural disaster in US history.",
        "Galveston obviously still exists; the storm eternally altered the city's destiny.",

        "Well, thanks for having me.",
        "Tell us a little bit about Galveston before the storm.",
        "Well, first of all my sympathy is with everyone who's been affected by this horrible disaster.",
        "Galveston was Texas' principal city and seaport in the 19th century.",
        "The city itself was thriving economically.",
        "We were a boom town.",
        "But the local government was bankrupt, and at that time we had war politics.",
        "The hurricane came September 8th, 1900, and literally the whole city and island of Galveston were inundated by floodwaters.",
        "How many people died?",
        "We don't know.",
        "We estimate upwards of 8,000 on Galveston Island alone, and several thousand more on the mainland, making this, to date, the nation's deadliest natural disaster.",
        "But Galveston did rebuild in a dramatic, total way.",
        "And I agree with what most of your callers have said, that this offers the opportunity to do it right and to make substantial and transformational changes to the city of New Orleans and the middle Gulf Coast.",
        "But after the storm, we all read that the city of Houston, Texas, about 50 miles away up the ship canal--Houston became the principal commercial city of Texas, and Galveston never recovered.",
        "Well, there's a reason for that, because Galveston was recovering at a time in 1901 that the state's economy shifted from agriculture to oil.",
        "We had the Spindletop oil boom.",
        "Now Houston became the oil--started becoming the oil capital of the United States in the 1920s, so the change was gradual.",
        "It didn't happen overnight.",
        "Galveston in 1901 pioneered the commission form of local government, and Houston and a couple hundred other American cities eventually adopted it.",
        "And this simply meant that professional businessmen were in charge of various city departments, and they operated their departments in a businesslike manner, accountable to the people of Galveston."

        "Now we also had some physical changes that dramatically transformed the local landscape.",
        "First, a seawall, 17 feet high, was built to protect the city from the Gulf of Mexico between 1902 and 1904, and it was extended in later years.",
        "And then after that, we had the elevation of the city's--it was called the grade raising.",
        "Literally, the city was raised from an elevation about eight feet along our principal east-west thoroughfare to a height of just about 16 feet behind our seawall.",
        "And this was called the grade raising, and it took place between 1904 and 1910, and it was extended westward in subsequent years.",
        "And then, third, we also had the construction of a causeway that handled vehicular, foot and railroad traffic that connected Galveston and Galveston Island to the mainland of Texas.",
        "So between 1900 and 1912, Galveston transformed itself radically in terms of its local politics and technologically as well.",
        "And all I'd like to say is that Galveston offers an opportunity to study how one city 105 years ago changed itself in light of a terrible disaster.",
        "And could now, ironically, be among those cities that could reap some economic benefits from the distress elsewhere.",
        "Well, we have our share of evacuees here from New Orleans.",
        "Of course, Texas has taken a huge share of this--of people, victims, as have other states.",
        "I don't know about Galveston benefiting directly from this terrible disaster, but we do provide a model for studying how one city over a century ago changed itself in response to a hurricane.",
        "Oil from the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion has been spewing into the Gulf of Mexico for nearly two months now.",
        "This week, the White House secured the commitment of BP to help offset the financial losses of those who live and work along the gulf.",

        "And how do you feel about this - BP's commitment to a $20 billion escrow account?",
        "Is that enough?",
        "Well, we're hoping that's enough but, you know, frankly, I'm not sure.",
        "I haven't seen any data from either BP or the White House, nor from any of the Gulf Coast states, to indicate that that number is going to be sufficient.",
        "But at least we can begin with it and then go forward.",
        "But more than setting aside the escrow, whatever the amount, the most important thing is to make sure that claims process is working efficiently so that people receive the money in a timely fashion because, you know, that did not happen in Alaska after the Exxon Valdez."
