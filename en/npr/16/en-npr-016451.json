        "Absolutely, and in fact he's not the first person, former senior official from this administration, to talk about the failure of the top policymakers to focus the way they needed them to on al-Qaida.",
        "We have former National Security Council senior director Richard Clarke, the former counterterrorism chief at the White House, who has said the very same thing, that he was pulling his hair out to get the attention of senior Bush administration officials to focus on the question of al-Qaida before 9/11.",
        "So you have that aspect as well.",
        "And plus, there were some warnings that they got.",
        "I believe, and I've written about this, there was some intelligence they got, I believe from Britain.",
        "There was talking about the intelligence that the al-Qaida was - that they had intelligence that al-Qaida might hijack a jetliner, etc., etc. And then there was some National Security Agency intercepts prior to 9/11.",
        "But - all of which adds up to the fact that there was no, as - I think even George Tenet will concede, and as I think he's said on Capitol Hill - there was no specific warning that there are going to be airplanes that are going to be used as flying bombs and flown into the Pentagon and the World Trade Center.",
        "There is also - and this has to be on the credit side of the ledger -the CIA-led war in Afghanistan, which toppled the Taliban in surprisingly short time.",
        "Well, you know, I think Donald Rumsfeld will probably dispute talking about it as a CIA-led war.",
        "There were special forces involved in that as well.",
        "But yes, it was for the first several years quite a success in toppling the Taliban, bringing President Karzai and his administration in.",
        "And then, even before - and I've been told this by senior officers who are involved - even before they had finished disposing of the remnants of the Taliban and had allowed Bin Laden and the hardcore al-Qaida to get to escape, the administration began diverting very important resources - intelligence resources…",
        "Special forces.",
        "Special forces, you know, as the eyes in the skies, away from Afghanistan, money away from Afghanistan, energy away from Afghanistan, time away from Afghanistan, to the invasion of Iraq.",
        "And today what we have - and I've spent 20 years covering Afghanistan, in and out for the last 20 years -what we have today is what I would like to refer as Iraq on a slow burn.",
        "Another question that people are asking is why it took George Tenet three years after he left the CIA to say these things.",
        "Well, I think, it takes a while to write a book, for of all.",
        "Second of all, I believe, you know, I'm not the authority on this, I believe there was an effort to sell a first draft, or there was some kind of first draft.",
        "It didn't go over very well, so they had to go back and rewrite it.",
        "And then it had to go through the CIA vetting process, which is extensive.",
        "And so I think that's why it took long.",
        "Yeah, but if these are questions of national security, the interest, the importance of them - you have to wait to write a book?"

        "Good - I mean I can't, you know, I can't speak for George Tenet.",
        "You'll have to ask him that.",
        "…that helps.",
        "Well, much of the criticism leveled Tenet has come from inside the intelligence community, and joining us now by phone from his home in Virginia is Michael Scheuer, the founding head of he CIA's Bin Laden unit and author of \"\"Imperial Hubris\"\" and \"\"Through Our Enemies' Eyes,\"\" and it's nice to have you in the program today.",
        "Thank you, sir.",
        "And you say we should not buy George Tenet's attempt to let himself off the hook.",
        "I mean he does say that he got some things badly wrong.",
        "Well, he got things deliberately wrong.",
        "If the agency told him that this disaster was going to happen in Iraq and he didn't resign over that after he was ignored, I think he definitely got that wrong.",
        "And with all respect for Mr. Landay, nothing was more wrong in American foreign policy than Tenet's prescription for going to Afghanistan.",
        "He guaranteed the president that a few special forces and a few intelligence people and lots of money would carry the day there, and of course it didn't.",
        "We won the cities, which always fall, and now we're losing the war.",
        "So I don't think there's much credit here for Mr. Tenet.",
        "And of course he himself admits the forces were too light at Tora Bora to capture the top leaders of al-Qaida.",
        "Well, absolutely right.",
        "And too light - and that's the general's fault.",
        "You know, they subcontracted to people who fought along side Bin Laden against the Soviets.",
        "This is not rocket science, sir.",
        "We could have stayed out of Iraq and won in Afghanistan with a minimum amount of intelligence.",
        "We happen to - intelligence in the sense of brainpower.",
        "And people didn't even apply minimum brainpower to these issues.",
        "Michael, I'm in complete agreement with you on all of that.",
        "But let me ask, I mean, to be fair, the switch of resources from Afghanistan to Iraq - that wasn't George Tenet's decision, that was the president's decision."

        "Give us an example of what you mean by that.",
        "Well, I think it's very clear that in his book, Mr. Tenet tacks back and forth.",
        "He played down the intelligence that would have allowed Mr. Clinton to kill Osama bin Laden, and he played up the intelligence that allowed President Bush to go to war.",
        "And so you're kind of betwixt and between.",
        "What kind of a fellow have we got here?",
        "So he told people what he thought they wanted to hear.",

        "Well, in terms of keeping quiet for four years now, and that's saying to the American people that the agency had it right.",
        "No matter whether Saddam had weapons or not, the point was the agency said that the war wasn't worth it because of the disaster that would ensue.",
        "And additionally, the question about links to al-Qaida and of course the question about the yellow cake in Niger."

        "And I don't buy that at all, sir.",
        "We have just a few seconds before we have to take a break, but he says that famous slam-dunk line was really taken out of context.",

        "Okay, Justin.",
        "Michael Scheuer, is that an accurate statement?",
        "Oh, I think that's absolutely right, and the Clinton administration was very concerned that if Bush didn't take care of bin Laden, it would come back to their detriment.",
        "I think one of the startling things about Mr. Tenet's book is how pro-Democratic it is and how anti-Republican it is.",
        "I carry no brief, as you know, for the Bush administration, but honestly, only Mr. Clinton had the chance to kill Osama bin Laden and had good information and solid intelligence that would have allowed him to try to do that.",

        "You said in an op-ed piece that you thought, in a way, he was returning to his first political home, the Democratic Party.",
        "Well, certainly, you know, for an intelligence officer to know the quality of the information we had regarding bin Laden and for Mr. Tenet to say that it was never enough to have made an attempt to go after bin Laden, that can only be seen as an apology for Mr. Clinton's fecklessness when it came to protecting Americans.",
