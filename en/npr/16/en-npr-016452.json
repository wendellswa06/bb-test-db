        "Exactly right.",
        "They knew he was there, they had 1,800 Marines in the desert of Helmand province, hundreds of miles away; and instead of using them to shut off the - escape through - the border to Pakistan, they hired three local Afghan warlords, one of whom took an enormous amount of money and allowed Mr. bin Laden to flee.",
        "And let me add, Jonathan is exactly right on that.",
        "And the agency, when they did the traces on the three warlords, pointed out to the administration and to the military that at least one of those warlords had fought in conjunction with Osama bin Laden against the Soviets in the 1980s.",

        "And stovepipe referring to the system through which intelligence is vetted so that…",
        "It wasn't shared between agencies and different people didn't know - the right hand didn't know what the left was doing, or the feeder or anything else.",
        "Right, and the intent is, of the stovepipe, is so that administration officials don't get that information.",
        "And Hersh made claims in that article that the Bush administration purposely dismantled that stovepipe, as it's called, in order to get raw information, in order to - that would fit their goals."

        "Oh, this was the Feith group at the Defense Department?",
        "Right.",

        "And I wanted to know from your guest if they know more that would support or deny some of the claims he made of that actually happening.",
        "Michael Scheuer, I guess you would know more about that?",
        "Well, I can only give you what I saw from the inside, and in my mind, the intelligence was largely irrelevant in terms of what Mr. Wolfowitz and Mr. Rumsfeld, the president, Mr. Cheney wanted to do.",
        "They were going to war one way or another, and Mr. Feith produced a lot of intelligence that was helpful to that really silly notion.",
        "But again, Mr. Tenet could have been the one that stepped up and put a brake on it.",
        "Mr. Powell, Secretary Powell, could not have delivered his briefing at the U.N.",
        "had Mr. Tenet spoken up, and I really think that this is one occasion when a man could have made a difference.",
        "Jonathan?",
        "I think instead - I would put it differently, because I did a lot of writing about this and looked at this question even before Seymour Hersh did.",
        "And what they did was, instead of a - breaking down stovepipes, what they did is create their own.",
        "They created their own intelligence system, where not only did they use existing stovepipes to obtain raw intelligence collected by the Defense Intelligence Agency and the CIA but also their own from people like Ahmad Chalabi and the Iraqi National Congress, and this stuff was going directly into the office of the vice president and Doug Feith's office.",
        "But Michael is absolutely right.",
        "They were going - they had made the decision, they were going to war.",
        "But what they still needed was material to make a public case.",
        "This is what they needed to do, so irrespective of what the real intelligence was saying, they needed information that they could then trot out to the public and make the case regarding the war against Saddam.",
        "And they were literally obsessed with doing this, which is what led them into doing the kinds of things and creating the kinds of phony intelligence reports that they did.",

        "That's George Tenet, director of the CIA, the 16 words referring to the yellow cake in Niger and the so-called British report of Iraq's efforts to buy uranium in Africa - this, of course, the whole origin of the Valerie Plame incident.",
        "Correct.",

        "And between 9/11 and Iraq, there were a lot of things that were going on.",
        "George did, I think, a tremendous job in terms of rebuilding the morale of CIA, building up intelligence capabilities, doing a tremendous a job in responding to al-Qaida after 9/11.",
        "So I think when the historians review the record, I think George is going to come out looking quite good.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "He did say in the interview with \"\"60 Minutes\"\" last night that - and I'm sure he says in the book that he was head of the CIA at a time when they have stopped active plans to attack the United States.",
        "Yes.",
        "You know, when George took over the CIA, the operational capabilities had been, in fact, degraded.",
        "The amount of training that was underway was reduced significantly.",

        "And prior to 9/11, I think he was trying to put in place that intelligence warning in indicators system that could identify those threats that were coming.",
        "So sitting on top of the intelligence community is a very demanding and challenging job.",
        "George acknowledges that he made mistakes.",
        "Looking back on his history, I think he would like to have done things a little bit differently, but at the end of the day, I think he contributed significantly to American security.",
        "We're talking about George Tenet's new book, his argument about intelligence before 9/11, before the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "John Brennan, in the run up to the meeting - run up to 9/11, Condoleezza Rice has responded to some of George Tenet's criticism by saying that meeting where he says he told me to - we needed to act down preemptively in Afghanistan that attacks were coming - how come he did not make that same statement to the 9/11 Commission?"
