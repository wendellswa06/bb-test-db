        "Well, I think there was a lot of information that was conveyed to the 9/11 Commission, and much of it was written up in their report.",
        "I think George did, in fact, point out that he had this session with Condoleezza Rice along with Cofer Black, the chief of the Counterterrorism Center.",
        "And he was trying to basically provide her a sense that the warning lights were blinking red, and that action needed to be taken because the intelligence was rather strong that al-Qaida was going to hit us.",
        "You know, quite frankly - and looking back on that time - the system itself was very - not very well, sort of, positioned in order to respond to such a threat warning.",
        "We have a much a better system in place today.",
        "If we had the same system in place, I think there would have been quite a few more actions that were taken - not just preemptively against al-Qaida and Afghanistan, but putting in place those security measures and safeguards here in the States that might, in fact, have prevented some of those hijackers from coming in to the States, as well as being detected once they were here.",
        "If, in fact - well, the CIA did have it right that there were no links between al-Qaida and Iraq, that, in fact, great concerns that the - there would be would drastic consequences from an invasion of Iraq.",
        "George Tenet certainly had been criticized for not coming out and saying that in a more vocal manner before these decisions were actually acted upon.",
        "Well, I think what George tried to do is to present the president and the senior officials a sense of what the intelligence was related to WMD in Iraq.",
        "And I think everybody realized that the intelligence community and worldwide intelligence services had it wrong.",
        "Also, whether or not there were links between al-Qaida and Iraq, George and the CIA adamantly opposed efforts to try to enhance the nature of that relationship on the part of some officials within the administration.",
        "But George had to walk a very fine policy line between being an advocate of a certain policy course and presenting objective intelligence.",
        "A lot is raised about why didn't George go in and tell the president, Mr. President, invading Iraq is a mistake?",
        "You shouldn't do it because of all the implications.",
        "But if he did that, he would have been perceived immediately as being an advocate for not going forward.",
        "And I think, from that point forward, all of his input to the president and others and all the intelligence he brought forward would have been suspect, because they would have perceived him as trying to push a certain policy course that he had favored, which was to continue with the sanctions.",
        "So, you know, I think as George said in his book and on \"\"60 Minutes,\"\" the president never asked him directly.",
        "He tried to present the pros and cons.",
        "He tried to present the intelligence fairly.",
        "George recognizes that the intelligence he provided, it was flawed, which is unfortunate.",
        "But to go in there and to bang his fists on the table and say you shouldn't do this - that was a policy decision.",
        "The policy makers made that decision.",
        "The intelligence did not drive that decision.",
        "And…",
        "It enabled it, but it didn't drive it.",
        "And one final question - a lot of people criticize him sitting behind at Colin Powell's shoulder at the United Nations when Colin Powell presented as fact the estimates that turned out to be so disastrously wrong.",
        "Well, an estimate is exactly that - it's an estimate.",
        "It's an assessment based on all the information from reliable and…"

        "And I don't mean to interrupt, but that's what George Tenet said last night on TV.",

        "He says the CIA director is sitting right behind me.",
        "His credibility is on the line.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And it was on the line.",
        "And George, I think, feels badly that the intelligence that was presented, in fact, turned out not to be accurate.",
        "So, you know, George was standing behind or sitting behind the intelligence on that day, and the intelligence community believed that there were weapons of mass destruction.",
        "The intelligence community didn't say we must invade or we're going to be attacked by Iraq - no. It was, what is the basis for that decision by the policy makers to go forward with it?",
