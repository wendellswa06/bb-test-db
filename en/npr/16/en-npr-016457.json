        "His name is Brian Smith, in fact, he was one of the people who was in the Newsweek, one about e-mails from the fallen.",
        "And he was very conscientious, in fact, the reason he's dead is because even though he wore all the body armor and everything and he was deployed without the side armor, Mr. Rumsfeld statement, you know, you go with the Army, you have, and I won't go further on that.",
        "What happened was a lot of the tank commanders would either send their crew out to check running gear or they just wouldn't do it because the lack of security.",
        "And he went out conscientiously, checked at each time and a sniper got him where there wasn't any of the side armor.",
        "And he was a good commander.",
        "The unit he was deployed with at the time, even though it was - from what I understand against the rules of engagement, went and that got the two snipers any way, for which I'm happy.",
        "But it's just that, of course, my sister's condolence letter was during the times Senator Rumsfeld was too busy in using an auto patent, so I've got my own issues with that even though there's disagreement within the family over those.",
        "But he was just a good husband and they've been married two years.",
        "It's interesting because they have been undergoing in vitro fertilization and they've been trying before everything happened and it was very sad and ironic that they had to send back the (unintelligible) to get some of the permission stuff because he was born and they wanted extra things and the papers arrived two weeks after his remains, but she now has a very healthy little boy and so she and his family have something to remember him by.",

        "And that we tried to do is keep it - to keep fresh is you got to take it for the effort and find the information about these guys that really come - produce them back to life at least in the newspapers so that the (unintelligible) families read about their love ones and the people we write about would understand a little why these guys do it.",
        "Can you give us an example.",
        "Sure.",
        "We did - April Johnson and I, one of my colleagues there, we did a really in-depth story about seven guys that were killed (unintelligible) Samarra.",
        "And just two of them quickly - one of them a staff sergeant named Justin Estes.",
        "His nickname was Dutch and he had that - he had it tattooed on his arm and when I talked to his mother about why he had that tattoo, she talked about - that was, you know, he was of Dutch descent but he became Dutch when he joined the Army.",
        "He was sort of - not lost but he was looking for something to do, kind of coming from Arkansas; got into the Army and really found himself - that she talks about how confident he was and everything.",
        "So that's what where the Army kind of changed him and made him into a man, really.",

        "This guy, suburban kid, I mean, almost a classic American kid, played videogames, was really smart, really computer savvy, and he joined the military because he felt like he had a pretty life that he got a lot given to him and he was joining to give it back and he was really conscious of the fact that he came from an affluent family and really worked hard to be one of the guys.",

        "It is.",
        "And you got to be conscious of that but sometime, I tried to talk to the families about - one, I don't force when they wanted to talk to me but what I tried to get across them is that the more they talk to me, the more other people will understand their love one and the more that they'll have a keepsake.",
        "They can clip out the story.",
        "They not only read about some of their own memories but read about memories of some of his friends and family, and that if you read - if you put the two kinds of stories together, the folks that talk about their loved ones, they really kind of special stories.",

        "And if you look at the anti-war, they're going to say, 4,000 is too much.",
        "It's a waste if you look at the folks that support the war in the Iraq, they're going to say, you know, that's - if we leave, if you sacrificed 4,000 guys, you know, so I think it's a politically charged number but I think it is going to have an impact."
