        "my pleasure, Neal.",
        "And tell us a little bit about Augie.",
        "A little bit - Augie was a person full of joy, wry humor, his best friend said that he couldn't imagine him as a Marine because the hardest thing he ever hit was the remote on the television.",
        "Augie was a fellow who enjoyed being a member of the team.",
        "He was on every sport that you could imagine.",
        "Although he was no great athlete, he enjoyed the camaraderie of the team.",
        "While still in high school, he took an emergency medical technician course and passed the New Jersey state, licensed, and so was a volunteer in West Orange and South Orange, New Jersey.",
        "More to be a team player than be with the group of people who were doing something good - he did that through his church.",
        "He did that in a fraternity in college and he joined the ultimate team which is the Marines.",
        "How did he get that nickname, Augie?",
        "Well, his name is Edward August and that was my father's name.",
        "And so we had an Ed and I have a nephew Ted and before he was born, we knew that he was a boy so we just started calling him Augie, and it stuck and anybody who talks about him, if they call him Augie, we knew that he them well.",
        "That part of New Jersey were he was working - that was particularly hard hit by 9/11.",
        "Well, yes, 9/11 was - there's a park - we live in South Orange at the time and there's a park there where you could see that Manhattan skyline.",
        "And after 9/11, we - I had moved back here by then and my wife and I, and he was going to Ohio state more originally from Cleveland.",
        "And so after 9/11, we said, look, before you guys all run down to sign up, call us first.",
        "He signed up for the Marines in the March of 2002 and he neglected to call us first.",

        "The black graduates, they're more confident about competing with whites, and they're also not as likely to see whites as being categorically racist.",
        "Well, we've responded in a couple of ways - three ways to be precise.",
        "First, my wife and I began speaking out today after Augie's funeral.",
        "And about what we thought about this war which was not much and what we thought was the cost.",
        "My son's number was 1824, so we've come a bit further since then.",
        "We kept feeling that at that time people were not fully aware of the cost, and so within a few months after feeling that we were just - they're just grieving parents, time will heal all wounds, my wife and I decided to start an organization to lobby for an end of this, and this is called Families of the Fallen for Change.",

        "We've talked to members of the House and the Senate.",
        "We've been lobbying ever since our Web site keeps track of fairly much what's going on in Iraq in terms of Congress, the administration on the ground, the human cost, et cetera.",
        "We also - I wrote a piece that appeared in the New York or not in the New York, in The Washington Post in January of '06, called \"\"A Life Wasted,\"\" which explains my feelings about this.",
        "I thought my son's life was just thrown away.",
        "So…",
        "On the other thing is my wife ran for Congress and did not win the primary, so we've become politically active.",
