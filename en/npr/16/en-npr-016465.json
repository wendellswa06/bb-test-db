        "Much lower.",
        "I mean if you're an ordinary working person, you pay the Social Security and Medicare taxes for starters, which is 15 percent.",
        "And then you're either in the 15 percent or 25 percent tax bracket, so these guys are paying anywhere from half as much to a third as much as ordinary working people.",
        "Representative Eric Cantor, Deputy Republican Whip in the House, has come out solidly against the proposal to further tax private equity.",
        "This is not just an issue for folks working on Wall Street.",
        "This really is an issue that will, in the end, impact blue jean-wearing Americans.",
        "Cantor, who like many of his colleagues in Congress has received campaign contributions from private equity firms, says changing the tax rate would have unintended consequences.",
        "Under the current rules, capital gains are taxed at a lower rate to encourage investment, and Cantor claims rewriting the tax code for just one type of business, private equity, will likely be just the first step for gracing the rate for everyone.",
        "This really is not just about private equity.",
        "This is really about taxing innovation and job creation in America, and I think it really is the first salvo of those who wish to get rid of the rate reduction on the cap gains tax that we have in this country.",
        "But some tax experts believe those concerns are overblown.",
        "Victor Fleischer is a law professor at the University of Illinois who studies private equity.",
        "He says private equity managers invest other people's money, not their own.",
        "And he says they perform real work and therefore should be taxed more like a company.",
        "I think it's a tricky issue.",
        "I don't want to oversimplify it, but it's an anomaly, I think, when you see people getting taxed at lower rates on what at least has strong elements of compensation income, as opposed to investment capital."

        "Josh Lerner, a professor at Harvard's Business School, says if they lose, private equity firms won't just pull out their checkbooks.",
        "They'll get creative.",
        "Instead of relying on the traditional set of compensation, could simply figure out a way where they simply assign themselves a small amount of the stock in the companies that they're financing and in all likelihood get around some of the provisions as they're laid out.",

        "That's right.",
        "Yes.",
        "This is a bill that would allow workers to choose a union to represent them by signing what are known as authorization cards or a petition basically supporting the union.",
        "And if a majority of the workers indicated their support for a particular union as their representative to negotiate terms and conditions of employment, then the National Labor Relations Board would be charged with certifying that that information is accurate and then the employer would be required to negotiate with them.",
        "Why do unions say that this is needed?",
        "Under the current law, unions file a petition for a representation election with the National Labor Relations Board once they have at least 30 percent of the workers signed.",
        "And that's the requirement of the law.",
        "Most unions in practice actually get something like two-thirds who have signed up to support them before they ask for an election, because during the course of the election campaign, the employer uses very aggressive tactics to persuade workers not to support the union.",
        "What are business groups saying about the bill?",
        "Well, business groups say that using this process where you just simply have to sign on a card is not democratic.",
        "It does not give workers the opportunity to cast a secret ballot.",
        "And so they argue that it would give unions the opportunity to intimidate workers during the organizing campaign by pressuring them to sign these authorization cards.",
        "So that's at least the rationale for their opposition.",
        "The unions are calling the bill one way to stop this membership decline by making it easier, but are the unions doing anything else?"

        "Yes.",
        "Unions are definitely engaged not only in political action of this sort and in other forms of political action that actually give them more leverage with employers; they're also actively organizing workers in the context of the current law and trying to develop ways to pressure employers to reach agreements with them.",
        "Most unions today when they try to organize workers do it outside of the context of the current law, not violating the law, but not attempting to go through the National Labor Relations Board election process because they feel that the playing field there is not level.",
        "What type of workers and businesses does labor want to organize now?",
        "I think it's clear that unions are trying to figure out how to organize those parts of the workforce where employment numbers are growing.",
        "So they need to organize in the service sector.",
        "They need to organize more white-collar workers, more professional and technical workers.",
        "But they're not prepared to ignore blue-collar workers, manufacturing workers, sort of their bread and butter in the past.",
        "Okay, so say the bill does pass the Senate, and if it does there probably won't be enough votes to override a presidential veto.",
        "Even with Democrats in control of both houses of Congress, is labor much better off?",
        "Certainly labor can get a better hearing.",
        "And will labor be able to achieve its legislative objectives in every way?",
        "No, that's not going to happen.",
        "That's not been the history of labor's relationship with Congress.",
        "Labor does not have its own political party.",
        "They have to appeal to the political parties that we have.",
        "So they have to influence those people who hold office.",
        "But it could easily be paving the way for 2009 if labor and their allies in the Democratic Party and what allies they have in the Republican Party - and they do have some - are able to win enough elections to gain true control of the Senate and have someone in the White House that would be sympathetic on legislation like this.",
        "So I think this is part of a long-term strategy to change the law in a way that - well, at least from a union standpoint - level the playing field.",
        "Richard Hurd is professor of labor studies at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations.",
