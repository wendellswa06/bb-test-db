        "He - I think that Dave Kindred, who was the sports editor of The New York Times for so many years - or sportswriter at The New York Times for so many years - wrote that before Ali, sports was mostly slow dancing and Ali turned it into rock 'n' roll.",
        "He brought it - he brought boxing into the mainstream and he also became very quickly one of the most recognizable faces on the Earth because of, again, the courageous stands that he took and the controversy that surrounded him.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And what do we make of that, the world figure that he became?",

        "Well, you have to think back to 1967 when here he was the champion - the world champion and he was refusing induction into - for the Selective Service.",
        "He refused induction.",

        "He was criticized in the halls of Congress and across the country.",
        "He left millions of dollars on the table.",

        "This was a powerful moment, and it resonated around the world because remember that the Vietnam War around the world was seen as a puzzlement for most people.",
        "And they couldn't understand why Americans supported this so vigorously.",
        "And here was this great champion turning against it at enormous personal cost.",

        "He was very controversial and not beloved and today we're remembering him as - well, as just a great citizen of the world.",
