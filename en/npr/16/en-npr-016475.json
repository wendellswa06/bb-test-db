        "Reid shined these red-dot faces at the bellies of 39 women in their third trimester and watched how the fetuses reacted using the newest, most sophisticated ultrasound.",
        "So we moved the stimuli, and then we tracked how the fetus would look at this - so whether they would look at it for a longer time, whether they would move their head more.",
        "So we just measured their head turn, how long the head was moving, how much it was moving to see if they were tracking the stimuli.",
        "In the journal Current Biology, the researchers report what they saw.",
        "The fetuses clearly seemed to track those red dots more when they looked like a face than when the dots were flipped upside down and looked nothing like a face.",
        "And they would look longer and move their head far more to try and track the stimuli if they were looking at something that was face-like than if we showed the same object but upside down.",
        "Now, the differences weren't huge, but other researchers say the findings are still significant.",
        "I think it's fantastic.",
        "It's really a breakthrough.",

        "Like when that sensitivity to faces, which is probably crucial for bonding with parents, begins.",
        "So it kind of pushes down the age at which we know now that the developing human shows a socially relevant visual preference.",
        "The visual system in effect kind of knows something about faces even before any exposure to faces at all.",
        "It's just astonishing to think about it."
