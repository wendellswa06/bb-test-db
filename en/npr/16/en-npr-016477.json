        "No, it didn't.",
        "It weakens them, but it leaves the laws on the books, and the laws still have real practical significance, because if you live in California, for example, and you're a medical marijuana user or someone in your family is, the law still stands that the state and local police should not arrest you, and those state courts should not prosecute you.",

        "One is the interstate commerce power does go this far, and number two, there's a Supremacy Clause in the Constitution that says the laws of the United States will be the supreme law of the land, and if Congress says something, then the federal law trumps the state law.",
        "But they didn't really need to go as far as to say the state can't--in the end, a state can sort of do what it wants to do with its own people.",
