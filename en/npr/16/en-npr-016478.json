        "If you were to just look at this and just look at the subject, medical marijuana--and the Bush administration is going after these people--you might guess the liberals would be on the side of the marijuana users, and the conservatives would back the Bush administration.",

        "There should be some points where the federal government can't invade local matters.",
        "And so you had people like Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice O'Connor and Justice Thomas voting against the Bush administration in this case and saying, `The federal power doesn't go that far,' but yet the court's liberal block--Justice Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer--saying, `Yes, we're going to maintain this broad view we have that if--we're not saying it's right, but that Congress can extend the federal power even to home-grown marijuana in a state where the voters think that should be legal.'"
