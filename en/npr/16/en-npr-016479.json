        "So really, nothing has changed that way.",

        "That was always a right the DEA claimed it had all along.",
        "Of course, it is a question.",
        "Does the federal government want to squander its resources on patients who are trying to do nothing better than keep themselves healthy or alive, or should it be fighting terrorists and using its resources other ways?",
        "That's something for the federal government, but I think it's clear the people of this country overwhelmingly support the obvious notion that patients deserve the right to have the medicine that keeps them healthy.",
        "Every single poll has shown that between 70 and 80 percent of the American people support medical cannabis.",
        "Where do you go from here?",
        "Well, the next step is Congress.",
        "The Supreme Court yesterday, in the final paragraph of its majority opinion, essentially called on Congress to change these laws, and as you mentioned, there is an opportunity as early as next week in the House of Representatives for Congress to do just that.",
        "Representatives Hinchey and Rohrabacher, a Democrat and a Republican, have co-sponsored an amendment to the Department of Justice Appropriations Bill that would prohibit the spending of any money to prosecute patients in states in which medical cannabis is legal."
