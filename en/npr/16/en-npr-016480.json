        "And I think when you start talking about whether marijuana is effective, if it's as effective or more effective as any other pill or powder, then treat it as such, and don't give it the freedom that we're giving medical marijuana right now.",
        "Well, I would agree that it is effective and a safe medicine, and it should be treated as any other kind of medication.",
        "Unfortunately, after seven decades of propaganda, Congress has not chosen to do that.",
        "I would take issue with your characterization of patients having a ridiculous amount.",
        "Under California law, a patient is allowed to possess or cultivate only the amount necessary for that patient's personal medical needs.",
        "How do you know what that is?",
        "Well, under state law, there is a floor of six flowering plants that patients may have, but the answer to your question directly, the best advice I give to patients is to keep some records of the amount of cannabis they use, so they can demonstrate to their doctors and to law enforcement, if necessary, what they do need to satisfy their personal medical needs.",

        "She instead is going to stay here and fight to try to change these unjust laws.",
        "The fact of the matter is, the federal government is playing politics with patients' lives.",
        "And it is choosing to ignore the scientific and medical facts that cannabis is a good medicine for many patients.",
        "We've just got to bring the laws of this country up into the 21st century.",

        "It needs to be just like the previous caller said.",
