        "It is the least important question you could ask, with all due respect to your list of questions there.",
        "More than 50 Democratic candidates have said they would not vote for her.",

        "FBI director James Comey told reporters the background check failed, that the paperwork was inaccurate and also incomplete.",
        "And last month, Republican South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham actually said the background check system was broken and that he was open to modifying it.",
        "But this isn't really an idea that's caught on politically, not in Congress and not in South Carolina.",
        "And David, you know, why do you think the political energy was focused on the flag rather than on guns or background checks?",
        "Well, first, I think it was focused on the flag because you take what the field will allow.",
        "You know, they've tried to do gun reform for a long time, and it hasn't gotten anywhere.",
        "And the flag was something that so many people were agreed upon, so progress was made on that front.",
        "As for the gun issue, you know, government bureaucracies are not known for their efficiency and effectiveness.",
        "But I sort of think the rule is dumb - the three-day rule is kind of a dumb rule.",
        "If they can't - if you're going to have a government check, a background check, on a gun purchase, have a check and reach a conclusion, don't suspend it in the middle.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Right.",
        "I think what it showed is that even when you pass a sensible law - in this case, background checks - to keep people with records from getting guns, the gun lobby manages to put unworkable loopholes in here.",
        "As The New York Times reported, the FBI had three days to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to deny the purchase of this gun.",
        "And if the Bureau can't come up with an answer, the purchaser can come back and buy the gun.",
        "The bias in the law should be the other way.",

        "At the heart of this argument is what did that flag stand for?",
