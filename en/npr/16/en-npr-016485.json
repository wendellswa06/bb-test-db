        "Right.",
        "So did you think that you would be making less than your dad at the same age?",
        "You know, I guess you don't really think about it.",
        "I mean, when my dad was 30, he was married, he had three kids, you know, and he was working hard as the sole earner, but earning, you know, a very good living.",
        "And I'm 30 and I guess things have changed a lot.",

        "Well, and what about buying power?",
        "Did your dad have his own house?",
        "Yeah, definitely, he had his own house.",
        "Do you?",
        "My wife and I do have our own place, but it's a very different house.",
        "It's a small townhouse and the only way that I was able to buy it is that I did get some help.",
        "And I know most 30-somethings aren't getting that kind of support.",

        "And so things are very different than they were, you know, 20 and 30 years ago.",
        "You know, one thing that - the guy I just spoke with, John Morton, talked about was why they studied men in their 30s, is because it's a pretty good indicator of what their future earnings would be in their lifetime.",

        "And the answer is no.",
        "So it's either, okay, we become, you know, dual income, no kids, you know, dinks, as they say, or we decide to move, which is probably what we're going to do.",
