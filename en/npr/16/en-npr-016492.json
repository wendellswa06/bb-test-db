        "Well, I was really struck seeing \"\"The Dark Knight,\"\" you know, which I saw before it opened with all of the other film critics in America and then again on opening weekend with everybody else, that, you know, this is very artful, very ambitious, very serious, very high-level film making, and it seemed to me that a lot of the director, Christopher Nolan's, ambitions really came up against some of the rules and conventions of the genre.",
        "So in the end, after seeing a lot of, you know, dazzling visual set pieces and action sequences and some very fine performances from Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart, in particular, I felt like I had kind of also seen it all before, that, in a way, you know, much as you can push in some directions to renew and make more interesting and more original and more ambitious this formula, the formula is still there.",
        "And I just felt like it's starting to get old, and I'm just wondering how much longer this level of interest on the part of film makers and audiences can be sustained in it.",

        "Iron Man,\"\" \"\"Hancock\"\" - actually four - \"\"Hellboy Two,\"\" and \"\"The Dark Knight,\"\" all of them seemed to me to be, for all their originality and all of their spectacle, seemed to me to be really pushing up against and in a way blocked from being better by what we expect of these movies.",
        "And by those limitations of the genre you were talking about, things like, well, the end always has to be a climactic battle between the arch villain and the superhero, who then mention to each other along the way that they are, of course, mirror images.",
        "Right.",
        "And also now, you seem, you know - they all have to take a very serious allegorical turn.",
        "Whether or not you can figure out what the allegory is supposed to be saying, you know, you're supposed to feel like one way that you justify buying your ticket or the studios justify spending 200 million dollars to make these movies is, in addition to those fights and all the special effects and the exploding cars and the big suits and the CGI and all that great stuff, you're going to have some serious ponderous themes about good and evil, vengeance and justice...",
        "Anarchy and order.",
        "But the thing is that these themes are very rarely kind of made integral or woven into the story.",
        "Instead, you just have the characters state them again and again and again and again.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Nevertheless, this iteration of the superhero movie seems to have come up with a way of attracting, well, huge budgets and huge audiences, too.",
        "One of the which is, as you pointed out in your piece today, was to get really good actors and let them do some work.",
        "That's one of the things that distinguishes them from the, you know, 20 years ago, Batman and Superman.",
        "Yeah, I think that's right.",
        "You know, there have always been good actors, but you often had the impression, if it was Marlon Brando in \"\"Superman,\"\" who I think, you know, got paid more money per minute for a brief appearance in that movie than any other actor in history, or even Jack Nicholson doing a Joker the first time in the first Batman series, you know, that they were sort of hamming it up for the paycheck.",
        "Now, I think the movies take themselves seriously enough that, in addition to the paycheck, which I imagine is handsome, you know, you can watch some of these actors do some really nifty stuff."

        "At the same time - and these things are not in opposition with each other - they have recognized fundamental freedoms and rights for women to participate in all elements of society.",

        "The Taliban have said that they want a new constitution.",
