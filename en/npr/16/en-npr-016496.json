        "That changed a month ago.",

        "They may not have the name that you might be looking for, but they have all the essentials.",
        "That's not exactly what North Carolina-based Family Dollar likes to hear because it's made a big push to expand its name-brand selection.",
        "But it doesnt surprise marketing chief Don Hamblen.",
        "If you look at the consumer research, people will have a perception that our brands are not the same as what they are at the grocery store or at the drug store.",
        "So Family Dollar has hired a full-time ad agency for the first time in its 50-year history.",
        "And it's delving into social media.",

        "I think as more of the older demographic is getting a lot more involved in social media, those are the people more likely to shop at a dollar store.",
        "Berthiaume says the economy has erased much of the stigma of shopping at these kinds of stores.",
        "He says it's important to engage more affluent customers before they return to old habits when the economy recovers.",
        "For NPR News, I'm Greg Collard, in Charlotte.",
        "Euro 2012, the European soccer championship, is playing out now in Poland and Ukraine.",
        "Ukrainian officials had hoped the games would show the world their country really is part of Europe.",
        "But as David Stern reports, that idea is proving to be a hard sell.",

        "She's definitely guilty of something but it's got nothing to do with the fact that she is in prison today.",
        "She is not in prison today for proven facts.",
        "This is Oleg Ryabachuk, who served in the previous government and is now an independent analyst.",
        "He says that Tymoshenko is in jail simply because she's a rival to President Viktor Yanukovych.",

        "But companies are putting non-GMO on things like strawberries or mangoes that aren't ever genetically modified.",
        "Apparently because people think non-GMO means good for the environment, maybe less pesticide spray.",
        "But it does not.",
        "Non-GMO crops are still conventionally grown with synthetic pesticides and fertilizers.",
        "There's no significant environmental benefit.",
        "On the other hand, organic really does mean no synthetic pesticides and fertilizers.",
