        "They were involved in that country's genocide in the '90s.",
        "Bill explained why the men were being tried in a Spanish court.",
        "The technical reason that Spain is prosecuting them has to do with the murder of some Spaniards in Rwanda, and they may have been murdered, executed or so-called collateral damage in the war that was going on between the Rwandan Patriotic Front and the Hutu perpetrators of the genocide.",
        "Listener Janice Yuwn(ph) says Bill missed a point in his explanation.",
        "Janice writes, I couldn't help but cringe yesterday when I heard Tony Cox' guest speaking on the indictment of 40 Rwandans.",
        "Spain indicted those men under its broad universal jurisdiction, which allows Spain to prosecute international crimes committed beyond its borders.",

        "He tried to see the word from all sides, as a controversial slur and as a show of brotherly love.",

        "Thank you for this insightful and amusing commentary.",
        "I believe it goes to the heart of the issue of distinguishing between words and the meaning of those words.",
        "It's comical repetition of the N-word satirizes the futility of using substitute words as a mean of social change.",
        "On our sports bloggers' roundtable last week, we talked about black folks showing more and more love for the Boston Celtics.",
        "Listener Andrew McFarlen(ph) in Miami is crying foul on that one.",

        "So it's an example of what's called: the herd effect.",
        "If you, in fact, immunize a large enough percentage of the population and you eradicate the reservoir of the offending agent, in this case, the parasite in the mosquito, then, in fact, the parasite will disappear from the environment because of the fact that it no longer can replicate itself and, therefore, die out.",
        "And how long would it take to begin to see this affect if it started to work?",
        "Well, if this work then you could do and I would anticipate that you, probably, could see in affect, possibly, within months to years."

        "Well, that's pretty quickly, isn't it?",

        "And has this been tested in enough laboratory rats and mice and animals that we are ready to try it out in people?",
        "Well, I think the issue is that, in the mouse, it induces potent levels of the antibody more than enough to stop the development of the parasite in the mosquito.",
        "Secondarily that our investigators have documented that that affect is persistent at protective levels or at levels that block transmission up to seven months after an immunization and, potentially, longer.",
        "And that what one would attempt to do in humans at this point would be, first of all, to see whether the vaccine induces antibody production in humans and secondarily, whether the vaccine is safe.",

        "Yes.",
        "So there are two approaches.",
        "One, first of all, actually is a consequence of someone I talked to the other day who had malaria, and who was for several years in an endemic area for malaria.",
        "And they said this disease is so bad and so prevalent everyone, if they understood what you were doing, would volunteer to be immunized to get rid of this disease that kills so many children.",
        "And the second, obviously, is that what our investigators are thinking about are things that you might do as well that could protect the individual who is bitten, who is, if you will, the first bite that leads to the development of this antibodies to block transmission.",
        "So, one good explore, for example, the possibilities of other vaccines being used as well so that you protect the individuals that receives such an immunization.",
        "If you can create such a strong antibody reaction in people -",
        "Yes.",
        "Why can't you do that to people who are infected and let them fight off the disease?",
        "Ah.",
        "The point is that the two lifecycles of the malaria parasite are different.",
        "And the proteins and the forms of the malaria parasite that occur in the mosquito are never seen by the human host and the cycle that occurs in the human.",
        "So, in fact, the reason that you, or at least one potential reason that you get such a potent response in the human, is because of the fact that the human has never seen the protein or antigen that this vaccine was made from, which is an extract of a form that only exists in the mosquito.",
        "Why could you not create being a little bit more creative something that humans have never seen in creating a stronger reaction in a form that would help cure people with it?",
        "Well, so that's, without question, another thought but, to date, that has been very difficult to do."
