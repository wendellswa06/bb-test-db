        "You know, I really don't know this works for malaria but why could the animals that are around these villages in Sub-Saharan Africa not be vaccinated, you know, cattle and pigs and dogs, and whatever else gets bitten by mosquitoes, and would that not carry the same antibodies?",
        "If you immunize the other animals that might be bitten by the mosquito that's quite true.",
        "You could have other animals serve as a vector for the development of the antibody.",
        "I think, part of the thing is that there's only the major mosquito class that the malaria parasite propagates in is anopheles.",
        "And the anopheles seems to have a preferential taste for humans.",
        "Oh.",
        "Well, would pigs or things that are similar tasting, I guess, to mosquitoes be possible surrogates?",
        "I think, they would be additions but not surrogates.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "Thanks, Mike.",
        "This sounds a little ghoulish but is it possible to create banks of just human blood that's infected and find some way to have mosquitoes attack it without the people themselves?",
        "Well, that's, in essence, the model system that our investigators use to assess the biological consequences of this antibody.",
        "That is to say what they expose mosquitoes to was a container of blood that contained red blood cells that had the malaria parasite in them, and that had the antibody in it and, basically, put a little membrane between the tube of blood in the mosquito and induce the mosquito to bite and drink of the little tube.",
        "And then they could show that they blocked the maturation of the malaria parasite in the mosquito.",
        "I would think you could but I think you'd have to find good meal substitutes, if you will, that mosquitoes and the right type of mosquito would go after.",

        "And, I think, clearly, independent of the present push and recognition of that, it is an old problem and a problem that has merited approaches over time and it's unfortunate that we haven't made more progress.",
        "The other part I'd, sort of, stress is, you know, that relates a little bit even to the return of certain insecticides and the fact is that developing a blocking antibody or another approach is, in essence, an extension of the notion of eradicating the vector, the host, for the mosquito and its cycle outside of the human.",
        "And one cheap way that people have suggested to reduce the incidents of malaria is to reintroduce things like DDT and spray and kill the mosquitoes.",
