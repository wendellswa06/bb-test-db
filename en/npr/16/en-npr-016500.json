        "The city of Baltimore, of course, and on the Democratic side, the city is the most important part.",
        "Then here in the suburbs in Washington, D.C., we have Prince George's County, which is a majority African-American county, and we also have Montgomery County, which is of mixed race but does have a very large proportion of higher income of people whose living is usually in some sense of another associated with the federal government and it tends to also vote very Democrat.",

        "It is a state where the old Dixiecrat Democratic Party kind of fell apart in the years after integration began and the years after the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act in the middle 60s, and where a new Democratic Party has been built in its place.",
        "Based on African-American voters, also on white suburban voters in northern Virginia, in the Washington, D.C.",
