        "But he did not actually totally 100 percent leave the campaign.",
        "He suspended his campaign, which means he's no longer really contesting John McCain's nomination.",
        "But if something should happen, some untoward event were to really alter the course of things, in the next couple of weeks or months or as we get closer to the convention, if something happened to John McCain and Mitt Romney wanted to get back into the fray, he's still holding on to that cash of delegates, which is at this point still the second largest.",
        "He's still a little bit ahead Mike Huckabee, even though Huckabee had a pretty good weekend out there.",
        "So Mitt Romney's hanging onto those delegates for now.",
        "In the end we expect there will not be a big fight for the nomination at the convention and all the delegates will make it unanimous for John McCain, except those few who might choose to cast a kind of protest vote.",

        "No, I would not dare to do that.",
        "He would come up with something very, very clever and funny and memorable.",

        "Well, you know, it really stems from the - all the bad publicity, and rightfully so, that plastics was getting in the recycling stream and more importantly in the waste stream.",
        "And we started taking recycled materials, working with Rutgers University here in New Jersey and looking for things where we could take a negative, which was waste into the environment, and turn it around into a positive, which was developing long-lasting products that reduce maintenance, reduce plant obsolescence and, you know, was really a useful thing.",
        "And so, again, in working with Rutgers and some other people, we started to advance this into railroad ties, bridges, military projects, marine projects, all that type of thing.",
        "So do you actually start with the bottles and melt them down, or how did it begin?",
        "Yeah.",
        "There's a, you know, I mean, there's now a whole collection process.",
        "Most people have some type of what we call curbside pickup, you know, where the bottles are put out and where the juice containers, detergent containers, all of that is put out curbside.",
        "It gets collected.",
        "We buy certain types of material and put it together.",
        "And, yeah, then you feed it through machinery and equipment, melt it down, and we can get it to take whatever shape we need it to, whether it's a round marine piling, an I-beam type of design, you know, interlocking tongue and groove boards, all different types of things.",
        "So what do you mix it with?",
        "To make it stronger, there must be other additives, correct?",
        "It's actually 100 percent recycled plastics.",
        "The key of the technology that Rutgers developed was to put together certain materials that are strong and rugged and tough but that might not be stiff enough on their own, and mix them with other materials that are - other plastics that are very stiff but might be too brittle on their own.",
        "And in the right proportions and through the right processing techniques, they yield all types of - all types of combinations.",
        "We have 13 patents or patents pending that we work with here.",
        "And as you mentioned at the beginning of this segment, we built bridges that hold 130-ton railroads and railroad cars, M1 Abrams tanks for the military, that type of thing.",
        "It's really pretty exciting stuff.",
        "Hmm.",
        "So there is a bridge in Maine, which I think - given the weather, you know, and - because it's made out of plastic, I imagine it holds up to road salt and corrosion and things - and rust much better than a steel bridge."

        "At about that same time, lawmakers also began using the shortcut process to make changes in health policy, says Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health policy at George Washington University.",
        "In fact, the way in which virtually all of health reform - with very, very limited exceptions - has happened over the past 30 years has been the reconciliation process.",

        "In 1980, children who were living at less than half the poverty level in the United States could not get a Medicaid card in half the states if they had two parents at home.",

        "In 1997, also in a budget reconciliation bill, it created the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP.",
        "Today, says Rosenbaum - who helped write many of the children's health provisions in those bills - Medicaid and CHIP together cover one in every three children in the United States.",
        "So literally, we've changed everything about insurance coverage for children and families, and we've changed access to health care all across the United States, all as a result of reconciliation.",

        "Reconciliation bills have touched other parts of the health care system beyond Medicare and Medicaid, too.",
        "For example, the law that lets people keep their employers' health insurance after they leave their jobs is called COBRA, because it was included as one fairly minor provision in a huge reconciliation bill, says Rosenbaum.",
