        "Ramis was prolific behind the camera, writing and directing movies like \"\"National Lampoon's Vacation,\"\" \"\"Groundhog Day\"\" and \"\"Analyze This.\"\" Later on, he even directed a few episodes of NBC's \"\"The Office.\"\" The current generation of comedic filmmakers took a lot of their cues from Harold Ramis.",

        "And I do, I remember him as a two-year-old and being impressed.",
        "And you know, one of the few complaints I have with the movie is that the horses that they got to play Secretariat weren't big enough or pretty enough.",
        "And I think that's because there aren't a lot of horses out there that are big enough or pretty enough to be Secretariat.",
        "He really was a remarkable looking horse.",

        "And that's the moment well, I think everybody remembers the moment when the announcer says: There is Secretariat, racing like a great machine.",

        "And it's not so much a defect as it is just a genetic mutation.",
