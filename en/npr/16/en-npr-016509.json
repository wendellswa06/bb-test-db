        "BOYDEN GRAY (Former White House Counsel): The idea was to get away from what we call, technically, command-and-control regulation, where you try to regulate every tailpipe, every smokestack.",
        "So Gray and Krupp came up with a cap-and-trade plan to reduce sulfur dioxide pollution, a plan to let market forces make it smart business to cut down on emissions.",
        "Here's how Fred Krupp remembers it.",
        "There was some skepticism among other environmental groups, to be sure.",
        "There was some criticism that we were talking to Republicans, which sounds humorous in retrospect but was very real at the time.",
        "And Boyden Gray also got pushed back from the White House chief of staff.",
        "I remember John Sununu blew up, and he said: My god, you're going to strangle America.",
        "And I said: No, John, calm down.",
        "And he calmed down, and the rest is history.",
        "The result was the Clean Air Act of 1990, and today it's regarded as one of the most successful pieces of environmental legislation in modern American history, and it's the model for the current climate bill, known as Waxman-Markey passed by the House.",
        "But on this bill, Boyden Gray and Fred Krupp part company.",
        "Gray wants pollution permits to be distributed by the government for free.",
        "That is what will happen under the current House bill, at least initially, but over time, industry will have to bid on those permits at government-run auctions."

        "If it's done simply and done the way it was done in 1990, the answer, in my opinion, is no.",
        "In the way the current bill stands now in the House…",
        "I think the current bill now is too complex, too unworkable and will not be the simple reduction that could be achieved, and it is the auction which allows the opponents of this legislation to call it a tax, and that's not really a stretch in my opinion.",
        "The auction is a tax.",
        "As it will eventually phase in, it'll be $2 trillion a year.",
        "That is one heck of a lot of money.",
        "And that is what to me spoils the bill politically.",
        "On this point, Guy, it won't surprise you that I disagree with Boyd, and I think it's very important that we protect consumers as we go forward.",
        "And one of the things that bill does is use some of the auction revenues to protect consumers from an abrupt spike in prices.",
        "Now Boyden Gray, do you think that Senate Republicans would back a bill if it was still a cap and trade bill but without, as you say, an auction system?",
        "I think so.",
        "I think if we took the tax out of it, you will take the air out of the opposition.",
        "I do believe that."
