        "The band's cheekiness extended to the title of its first album, called \"\"#1 Record.\"\" Critics loved it.",
        "But problems with the band's label meant that fans couldn't find the album in stores.",
        "That didn't stop Chilton and the rest of Big Star from partying like the rock stars they thought they were going to be, says biographer Holly George-Warren.",
        "Memphis was a crazy party town at that period in the '70s.",
        "A lot of other things came into play and would, you know, make people have short tempers.",

        "By other things, you mean drugs.",
        "(Laughter) Quaaludes - quaaludes were very popular in Memphis, in those days.",
        "After their first album flopped, Chris Bell quit.",
        "Chilton led the rest of the band back into the studio.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"\"SEPTEMBER GIRLS\"\")",
        "The album \"\"Radio City\"\" was another success with critics.",
        "But once again, the band failed to find an audience, much to Chilton's dismay.",
        "It was frustrating not to make any money there and, you know, thinking: Well, Jesus, here in the last two or three years, what I've been doing hasn't made a penny.",
        "Chilton recorded a third album with Big Star.",
        "It's revered as a classic now but at the time, it was considered so dark and strange that it wasn't even released for years.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"\"BANGKOK\"\")",
        "From there, Chilton went on to record R&B, country, rockabilly, lounge music - pretty much anything but the power pop anthems he wrote for Big Star.",
        "That frustrated his fans, says Holly George-Warren.",
        "He was constantly reinventing himself.",
        "But it wasn't done consciously, like, oh well, I'm going to be a new - you know.",
        "It was wherever his voracious appetite for new music would lead him.",
        "That appetite led Alex Chilton to New Orleans in 1982.",
        "He quit drinking and got a job as a dishwasher.",
        "But he kept on playing when it suited him, as he told FRESH AIR.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED FRESH AIR BROADCAST)",
        "And I've sort of got my scene going and have carved out a little niche - however little it is - in the music business, you know.",
        "And I manage to play as many gigs as I want every year, and make money doing that; and make a little money here and there, making records.",
        "And it's OK with me.",
        "Meanwhile, Chilton's reputation started to grow, thanks to younger musicians who had hunted down Big Star's records, including members of REM, Wilco and the Replacements.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"\"IN THE STREET\"\")",
        "And Chilton did make some money when the producers of \"\"That '70s Show\"\" chose one of the band's songs for the opening."
