        "When is he expected to join that crowd?",
        "Right now, he's not officially announced.",
        "He's testing the waters and this actually a legal term with the Federal Election Commission.",

        "I will say when you watch the film, at least for me, I came away feeling moved, but I also felt like if it's just a story holding us together and we are telling ourselves different stories for a lot of different reasons - if you're locked in separate tribes, as you describe it, in these factions - then it feels really fragile.",
