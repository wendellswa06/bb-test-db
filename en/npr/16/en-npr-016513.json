        "We'll get to those issues in just a minute.",
        "But you said they were seeking clarifications on his on his eligibility.",
        "That's not what the letter said.",
        "In terms of relief sought - this is according to your story - the appeal requested the IPC, quote, \"\"nullify Bailey's physical disability status and render him ineligible.",
        "Well, I'm here to report, you know, what I was told.",
        "And when I called the people who filed the appeal, they insisted over and over that they were merely seeking clarification.",
        "When I explained that that's not what \"\"clarification\"\" means, that clarification derives from the word \"\"clarity,\"\" which derives from the word \"\"clear,\"\" which means you're seeking some sort of clearness, not a specific outcome in requesting ineligibility for your own athlete, they repeated 18 or 20 times in different ways that they were merely seeking clarification.",
        "So that is all I can tell you here, is that's what they say.",
        "The suspicion was that, in fact, they were uncomfortable with an athlete, a para-athlete, who is difficult when he is out of the water.",
        "Well, Kendall Bailey has the emotional temperament of a toddler.",
        "He is very difficult to be with when he is uncomfortable.",
        "He will not eat.",
        "He will - he can fly into rages.",
        "Now, not ones that are dangerous for other people, he is not violent, but he can throw tantrums and throw fits like a three year old, even though he's 19 and six-foot-six and quite an imposing presence.",
        "And so, it was certainly plausible to think that perhaps the United States officials didn't want that distraction in, you know, Beijing, when they're trying to win medals with athletes who are merely amputees or paralyzed or they, certainly, in general, do not have any mental or emotional disabilities.",
        "Now, let me say that the officials at U.S.",
        "Paralympics said very clearly this had nothing to do with Kendall Bailey's emotional state or mental state.",
        "They said that it was merely that they wanted clarification on his status.",
        "And so I - it's not for me to speculate, I know that the mother having, you know, spent 19 years looking after her son and having met people who didn't want to deal with him, she is concerned that perhaps that was at play here.",
        "But something is very important to note.",
        "It's that U.S.",
        "Paralympics and the people who did this thing and asked for his ineligibility, which appears to be misguided and ill-conceived - at least that's what the International Paralympics Committee said - these are people who have devoted their working lives to developing opportunities and competition for disabled athletes.",
        "It's very difficult to think that they acted out of malice or disrespect.",
        "I don't know why they did what they did, but it would be wrong to assume that it was done out of malice.",
        "I think - I don't know what it was beyond that, but it is not logical to think that that was the reason.",
        "We've got a caller on the line, and by the way, if you'd like to join Alan Schwarz in this conversation about the Paralympic Games, and an autistic athlete, also physically disabled, who qualified and then ran into questions about his qualifications, 800-989-8255.",

        "OK, for - basically, the Paralympics exists for people with certain physical disabilities to compete against each other.",

        "They have nothing to do with it.",
        "However, they were very distracting in this case, and they caused great confusion among people who got very distracted by them.",
        "However, according to the International Paralympic Committee, because they have people who examine the athletes - They watch them perform.",
        "They examine their bodies not unlike horse.",
        "I mean, they check to see muscle spasticity and various things.",
        "Obviously, if someone is an amputee, it's pretty obvious.",
        "However, in a case like Kendall Bailey, he went through several rounds of inspection, and it was determined by the experts at the International Paralympic Committee that he qualified for the physical disability classification of S-10.",
        "I won't get into all that.",
        "And so, that's how it's done.",
        "It's they inspect the athletes and make sure that he has a certain level of disability.",

        "Thank you, Irfan.",
        "OK.",

        "Oscar Pistorius was challenging for the right to compete in the regular Olympic Games, running on prosthetic legs that some thought gave him an advantage over regular, able-bodied runners.",
        "It has since been found he can compete on those if he is fast enough to qualify, and we've had him on the show, and he said maybe not this time, but four years from now, he thinks he's going to be able to do that.",
        "The other question is I think there's some confusion, Alan, between the Paralympic Games and the Special Olympics."

        "And you're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "And Alan, the other part of the story was Kendall Bailey's mom, who is terrified by the idea that her son, to whom this meant everything, would get to Beijing and then find out that he would be disqualified when he got there.",
        "Well, she was told by the United States Paralympic Committee that that was not only possible, it was downright likely, and that he could very well, upon arrival in Beijing, be disqualified, because he didn't - he wasn't physically disabled enough.",
        "And it terrified her.",
        "I mean, that's what they based their request to the IPC on, is the likelihood that he's just going to be disqualified anyway.",
        "Well, - and she was - she felt that this asteroid was speeding toward her head and her family's house for the past two months.",
        "And only on Monday did I finally get to the bottom of it and learned from the International Paralympic Committee that there is virtually no chance that that would ever happen in Beijing.",
        "Only under exceptional circumstances, I won't get into the details, but those circumstances would not exist in this case, and that the United States had it wrong for two months.",
        "Regardless of how they handled it, they had it wrong and scared the dickens out of this poor woman.",
        "And did Kendall himself know about this, that this might be a possibility?",
        "Kendall Bailey has no idea that any of this has been going on.",
        "His mother never told him, because he wouldn't understand, and what he could understand he would not be able to comprehend, in the sense that his own team tried to keep him from swimming?",
        "He would have not understood.",
        "He would have been desperately upset, and of course, had he gone to Beijing and then been told he can't swim, which is what the United States said would happen, he could have been ruined for life.",
        "And I'm not exaggerating.",
        "He could have just crawled up in a ball, crying or - you know, flown into an uncontrollable rage because this thing that has given him self-esteem and purpose over the last six years, the ability to represent the United States in the Paralympics - he wears he's jersey everywhere.",
        "He sleeps under an American flag blanket every night.",
        "If he had been - if he knew and understood that his own country tried to get him ineligible, he would have been more confused than even you or I or the reader - or the listeners, and we're confused enough.",
        "There's a wonderful scene you describe in your story of Kendall after winning the race, breaking the American record to qualify and learning that he would qualify to go to Beijing.",
        "This boy who, when taken to school for the first time, in terror at strangers, ran up to the roof of the school and threw pebbles at people below, this boy greeted people on the airplane and signed autographs.",
        "But the thing about these periodic scandals is that when there are cable trucks all over the place, it does sort of shine a light on what's going on.",
        "And that's when, sometimes, you do seem to see some of the consistently screwed-up political actors getting bounced and having to face some consequences."

        "But he saw the things about him winning the race that put him on the team, and he saw some things about his life, and he is now finding out - not through me and the New York Times - but through his success at swimming - I remember a line from a movie I liked very much, said if you have it - you know, when you finally get a taste of success, you find that it suits you.",

        "And now he's starting to think, OK, I want to be focused and swim as fast as I can and compete against other people.",
        "And when he started to embrace what that meant, he shocked everybody by breaking the American record in the 100-meter breaststroke for his classification.",
