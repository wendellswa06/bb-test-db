        "Archaeologist Richard Buckley led the team that dug it up.",

        "And you'd go around the back where gardens and old houses used to be, which was then paved over and used as this parking lot.",
        "If you go back about 500 years, this was the site of a friary.",
        "Richard III was buried there after he was killed in the Battle of Bosworth in 1485.",
        "And so Richard's naked body was brought back to Leicester, swung over a horse and, there, buried in the church of the Franciscan friars in the middle of Leicester.",
        "The friary was eventually demolished, and for centuries, no one knew exactly where Richard III was buried until the archaeological dig in 2012.",
        "The king's remains were reinterred three years later at Leicester Cathedral.",
        "Since all of this happened, archaeologist Richard Buckley says new hotels and restaurants have been built in his hometown."

        "But we answered our government's appeals in order to make China's 100-year old dream of the Olympics come true.",
        "Glasses clink because the former villagers drink a toast to the Olympics.",

        "Hi, Ari.",
        "So what's the difference between President Trump's Affordable Clean Energy, or ACE, as they are calling it, and Obama's Clean Power Plan?",
        "Well, the Obama rule, the Clean Power Plan, it was more sweeping and more specific.",
        "It directed states to reduce emissions from power plants by nearly a third by year 2030.",
        "It let states figure out how to do that, but for many of them, that would've meant shutting down coal-fired power plants because they emit more greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, which, of course, contribute to climate change.",
        "The ACE rule is more narrowly focused and gives states more discretion.",
        "This rule looks at individual power plants and what can be done to make them more efficient.",
        "That means under the Trump administration rule, it's more likely that a coal plant currently operating could stay open longer.",
        "The Obama administration's Clean Power Plan actually never took effect because two dozen states, many of them coal-producing states, sued to block it.",
        "How are people in those states and the coal industry responding today?",
        "Well, they're very happy about this rule change.",
        "They thought the Obama administration overstepped its authority under the Clean Air Act with its plan.",
        "At the EPA headquarters today, there were some coal workers in their gear and hard hats for the announcement.",

        "Avoiding additional retirements is so important given that 40% of the coal fleet has either retired or announced retirement.",
        "And we expect under the Clean Power Plan, there certainly would've been a lot more.",
        "Of course, President Trump campaigned saying that he would help the coal industry, but dozens of plants have shut down since he was elected, mostly because natural gas and renewable energy are cheaper.",
        "And what are environmental groups saying about the new rule today?",
        "They're very critical of this rule.",
        "Climate change is on a lot of people's minds now, and they think the country should be doing more to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, not less.",

        "Environmental groups and others have already said they plan to sue to challenge this plan.",
        "A key question will be how far can the EPA go in setting national policy on carbon emissions, because there's a sense that this rule change from the Trump administration could make it more difficult for future administrations to take an aggressive approach.",

        "It's more a function of markets favoring natural gas and renewable energy.",
        "I've talked with plant owners who say they can shut down a coal plant, build a couple gas plants, produce a lot more electricity and still have room left over to put some solar panels and industrial park because they don't have to have all that room to store coal and coal ash after it's burned.",
        "So the economics just don't favor coal power plants right now.",
        "Still, scientists say that to avoid the worst effects of climate change, we need to reduce emissions a lot more, basically down to nothing, within about three decades.",
