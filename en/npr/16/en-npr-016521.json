        "How difficult has it been to arrive at this report?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "They might - something might arrive in the mail for them, a letter from an old friend or something like that, and they would believe that they'd already received that letter before.",
        "Their wife might bring them the newspaper, and they'd think that they'd already read the newspaper before.",
        "They'd refuse to watch the television because they'd think that they'd watched, you know, whatever was showing on the television at that time before.",
        "Probably if they receive some news or had a conversation, they might complain, as well, that they'd had that conversation before.",
        "But it's not really the case that they - they wouldn't refuse to eat or they wouldn't, you know, get dressed or have a shave, or things like that.",
        "The routine things in life they don't think they've already done before.",
        "But, yes, they kind of walk down the street, and they think it's same bird singing the same song in the same tree and so on.",
        "So if they went into a restaurant to eat dinner, they'd see the same people they thought - Oh, I saw them last time I was here.",
        "Yes, probably.",
        "But we think that, obviously, it'd be an overwhelming sensation if it was everything like that.",
        "It just seems to be the things that most kind of capture that sensation, that most lead to this sort of problem."

        "Hmm.",
        "But what if they're with someone who's been with them, you know, all day, and they say, why, I've seen this person earlier in the day.",

        "You couldn't have seen that person.",

        "How do they react to something like that?",
        "Yeah, well, that's the interesting part.",
        "I mean, this is one of the exciting things, I guess, about psychology, that you - most of the time, we're kind of - we can be manipulated by reason and by the experience of other people around us, and maybe we can reconstruct events to our kind of - our rationale and our way of thinking about things.",
        "But these people have such a strong sensation that they're immune to that kind of reasoning.",
        "So, for instance, if their wife says, well, you know, you, you know, you've already seen this person - or you can't have seen this person before, then they won't respond to that.",
        "They just have such a strong sensation that they've encountered things before that they can't escape that.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Would they make...",
        "So they don't really have the same kind of insight that we have.",
        "That's the exciting thing, I think, that when we have deja vu, it's like a little window into how the mind works.",
        "And it's an intriguing, exciting feeling because it lasts for a few seconds, maybe, and you have an insight into how your mind can kind of play tricks on you.",
        "It feels like you remember something, it feels like you've encountered it before, but you know that you haven't.",
        "But these people don't have that kind of awareness.",
        "They don't have that insight.",
        "So they don't know that their mind is kind of playing tricks on them.",
        "So would you classify this as an illness then?",
        "We don't go so far as to classify it as an illness.",
        "We're not quite sure of the kind of - the significance that it has as an illness, but it's quite clear that it's a symptom.",
        "And we're kind of describing it as a new sort of symptom that people can get.",

        "Mm hmm.",
        "And how many people do you think have this?",
        "Well, I think it's safe to say it's a really rare condition.",
        "But we do think that the more we talk about it and, in fact, the way our papers have been received, our scientific papers, we know that it's probably more common than we first envisaged.",
        "But I would still think that there would probably be no more than 100 cases worldwide at any one time.",
        "It's not very, very common.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Now with the brain scanning techniques that people use today for experimentation, diagnosis, you know, watching the brain light up, can you do that, also, and try to figure out what's going on in there?",
        "We could do that in theory.",
        "In fact, we're kind of at the step and the stage just before doing that.",
        "So we have a good idea about where these problems occur in the brain.",
        "We would have had a good hunch for a long time because we know the people with temporal lobe epilepsy, which is a form of epilepsy that affects the temporal lobes, and that's the portion of the brain behind the ears - they often experience sensations like this deja vecu or like day-to-day deja vu.",
        "And we know that these areas of the brain in the temporal lobe are very important for memory and for recollection.",
        "So we would have thought it was those kinds of areas.",
        "And kind of happily for us that's - those are the areas where you see kind of damage in the brains of the people that we've managed to look at.",
        "So we haven't got them in a scanner doing some kind of memory task and watching the brain whilst they have a sensation of deja vu, but we can look at the structure of the brain and how many cells are in any one area.",
        "And from that we can kind of extrapolate and work out that's the area involved.",
        "Do people with deja vecu know that they have something unusual going on with them?",
        "Well, they really appear not to know.",
        "I mean, that's the main thing.",
        "So we describe this as anosognosia, so that means they've got an unawareness of that deficit.",
        "And that's really the difference between the deja vu that you and I have and the deja vecu that they have.",
        "So it's persistent, it's ongoing, and they're really aware of it.",
        "They do show some kind of insights into it every now and then.",
        "So, for instance, the first case we worked with, his wife was very good at challenging him and trying to reason with him and find out the rationale for his sensations and believing that things had repeated.",
        "And as happened very often, he complained that he had watched the television program before, and she said, well, it's not possible.",
        "This is the first time it's ever been on television.",
        "And he said, well, I've definitely seen it before.",
        "So she said, well, OK, if you're seen it before, go on, what happens next.",
        "And he said, well, how should I know.",
        "I've got a memory problem.",
        "So he had some kind of awareness that he had memory difficulties, but he couldn't kind of come to terms with this ongoing sensation that he was remembering things."

        "Well, will patients sometimes make up stories to cover their own illness?",
        "Yes.",

        "So that's actually a more widespread and fairly common memory problem, that people will kind of - invent is a bit of a hard, nasty word because that sounds like these people are lying.",
        "But what they do is they kind of fabricate stories that justify the memories that they're having, and we call that confabulation.",
        "So that's quite a common thing.",
        "People have gaps in their memory, and they kind of make up stories to fill in those gaps, and that's exactly what these people do.",
        "So if you challenge them and say, well, how can you have known this piece of news already happened?",
        "They'll say, well, I got up really early, and I left the house very quietly without my wife knowing.",
        "And I got to the news agent's, and I read the newspaper as it was being unloaded from the lorry.",
        "And then I came back, you know, to the house and came back to bed and so on and so forth.",

        "Or they're kind of vague memories, and it reminds you of a dream, and there's that kind of dreamlike quality.",
        "And, in fact, that was Freud's idea about what deja vu was.",
        "But in - it goes a bit - it's a bit more technical than that, as well, because we do know that the temporal lobes are very much involved in those kind of dreamy states.",
        "And when we're asleep, we know that firing in that part of the brain does lead to kind of vivid dreams, the types that you discussed.",
        "There is some kind of link there, and I think it's fair to say that that part of the brain is very involved in those kinds of actions.",
        "But it's probably early days in our understanding of both recollection and these kinds of sensations of remembering and our understanding of dreams to go the, you know, the whole hog and say, well, they are definitely related.",
        "But it's a very good point.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Could there be some place, some sort of buffer in our memory, where, you know, the event happens and before you actually analyze it in your brain, it, you know, it seems to be a memory already?"
