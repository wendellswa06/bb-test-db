        "Now, for you or I, we don't make memory mistakes on those kinds of words because they grab our attention, and we think, well, if I'd heard that word or if you'd shown me that word, I'd really remember that, doctor.",
        "So we don't make any problems.",
        "But they make their problems on those kinds of words.",
        "Now, for us it's hard to imagine why that would be due to some kind of, like, pathway in the brain or some little buffer that goes wrong, because you'd have to explain why the buffer was more active for some sorts of words than for other sorts of words.",
        "And so we - so at Leeds that's not really the model that we're working with.",
        "The other evidence that works against that is - and for a long time, a similar idea was that there might be an optical pathway.",
        "And that so some information arrived at one part of the brain quicker than the other parts of the brain.",
        "But we found deja vu in people who were congenitally blind, so that's...",

        "If the stimulus is working along with all the other things that policymakers have done, we should see a more stable economy by the fall and, hopefully, we start to see a bit of growth in 2010.",
        "You know, I don't think even under the best of circumstances we're going to come roaring back.",
