        "And the tipping point is that with all this new technology, emerging technologies, and globalization, migrations of people from Eastern Europe, from other parts of the world coming over into the country, all competing for jobs and positions, that African-Americans who for so long have been the mainstay of people of color in this country, pretty much, are facing some pretty stiff competition.",

        "That's absolutely right.",
        "And I think as African-Americans, we need to make sure that we're equipped to do business internationally, to do business globally, and that means equipped with an understanding of culture, of language, of religion, of a variety of competencies that transcend the United States and how we do business here--and that's what's going to allow us to move across the continents and have better employment as a basic issue.",

        "Therefore, jobs are pretty much well set for us--opportunities, they need us.",

        "Virginia Clarke, Dwight Ellis brings up an interesting point, and that is diversity becomes one of those buzz words that we hear quite a bit now.",
