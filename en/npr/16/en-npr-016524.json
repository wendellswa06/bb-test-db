        "I think it is realistic.",
        "I think we have to do our part in being prepared and begin to really insist on getting some of these opportunities and work with these organizations so that they can really create an environment where we're going to do well.",
        "I always use the analogy that there can be organ rejection.",
        "People say, well, I want one of those African-Americans or one of those Hispanics in this organization, and yet they haven't done anything to really evaluate and assess and prepare that culture, that company, that has heretofore been homogenous for someone who is not like them.",
        "And so for as much as they might want this representation in their organization for all the right reasons, very often these very savvy professionals and executives of color are saying, you know what, I've got other choices.",
        "I can go to an environment where I know I can succeed, and I can put my head down and do what I'm good at as a person of color, as a professional.",
        "Let me say this very quickly, that I don't want to put all of the weight of nonparticipation or nonpreparation on African-Americans.",
        "I think what we're talking about is pretty much an American syndrome.",
        "The most white Americans are not internationalists.",
        "Most white Americans, professional and otherwise--",
        "So we all become the ugly American.",
        "We all become the ugly American.",
        "However, I think African-Americans, if we realize the value that we really carry with us by our pigmentation, by all that we have and our connections beyond even Africa, accepting Africa but understanding opportunities and understanding how to take advantage of opportunities I think is beneficial to our group as African-Americans and especially to this country.",
        "Virginia Clarke, I know one of the things that you want to make sure that people understand is, fair or unfair, in relative terms, African-Americans are still new and learning the upper rungs of corporate America.",
        "And while we have made steady gains, there is still a lot for us to learn.",
        "When I think about my parents who were--my mother was a physical therapist, my father a state employee.",
        "And while they had great experience and were well-educated, the corporate world was something that we didn't talk about at the dinner table.",
        "So our counterparts have generations of experience at this game, so to speak.",
        "And so, yes, we're prepared technically.",
        "We're getting our advanced degrees and we're getting good experiences in our corporations.",
        "But I think there is probably only 40 or 50 years of experience as compared to hundreds.",
        "We need to learn the game.",
        "We need to know when to step out and to leverage maybe some other competencies that we've developed.",
        "But we've got a long way to go.",
        "I'd love to see us change the rules of the game as we go.",
        "And I think we are really positioning ourselves to do more of that as you see more minority, particularly African-American board of directors and you see more CEO's.",
        "They're small numbers, but this is where it's beginning to start.",
        "And it's going to take a while.",
        "We have to stay with it.",
        "Let me ask you both this as a closing question.",
        "Virginia, I'll start with you.",
        "And that's the question of whether or not this is perhaps even too Pollyanna of a thought.",
        "But often we hear the idea of networking, and we see it with other groups in terms of tackling new frontier, i.e., diversity on a global scale for African-Americans.",
        "Is this something that we should look to more a conglomeration of groups of successful blacks to tackle new territory?",
        "These cameras are expensive, there's no evidence that they'll do anything to make Tiburon safer and, once these cameras are up, they can very easily be used for spying and discriminatory targeting."

        "So I'd really like to see us broaden our relationship building a lot more thoughtfully and strategically, but cutting across global lines.",
        "And Dwight Ellis, I would think that the important point to that would not be the obvious connection, i.e., as we said before, the African diaspora, the Caribbean, etc., but the idea of Finland and Sweden and Europe, etc.",

        "What are the big global issues that black Americans have shown the most interest in and what do you think, secondarily, are the most important international concerns we should be paying attention to in the coming year?",
        "Historically, African-Americans have always had a feel for people around the world who were in similar kinds of situations of being marginalized and socially isolated, and that has carried all the way up until today.",
        "In 2005, the race riots in France were just one element in which the black community here paid a great deal of attention.",
        "I would say as we look towards 2006, we have to have a broader sense of that particular urgency.",
        "I think both in Europe and in Latin America, we're starting to see movements by black populations toward democracy, for inclusion.",
        "In the Southern Cone, for example, in Venezuela, in Colombia, in Brazil, in all of those areas there's been a resurgence, in some instances new movements, that have emerged by those black populations, and I think we have to pay some attention to that and to give some support to those efforts.",
        "In a similar way, what happened with France is happening across Western Europe with people of color in general and people of African descent in particular.",
        "One of the things that has emerged as a new project is racial profiling in places like France, in England and a number of different countries.",
        "People of color--not only people of African descent--people who are Muslim or from Arab countries are essentially profiled.",
        "Let me...",
        "And we know what that means.",
        "Let me jump in to ask you--certainly we do know what that means, and that segues nicely into my next question which has to do with the fact that the plate is full for African-Americans right here at home, and how are we showing our support for the struggles of people of color elsewhere in the world?",
        "The most important way, I think, is simply to recognize that we're part of the global community and the global family and that what affects any of us affects all of us.",
        "And so African-Americans just by promoting and getting information out about these incidents that are happening around the world is one means.",

        "So we have people who are very active in that sense.",
        "Let me ask you one final thing in the time that we have left.",
        "Where the civil rights movement in this country was once seen as the standard by which movements in other parts of the world were patterned after, is that no longer the case?",
        "And do other nations care about support or the lack of it from blacks in this country now?"
