        "There's - it'll be, I don't know, close to a 900-page report, something like that, and then there is this policy for summary - a policymaker summary that we've been producing over the last few days, where the policymakers - the way I think of it is that they help create the language that we use to communicate the report, while the experts determine what goes into the report.",

        "And since the last report, which was published in 2001, we've had six new years of data, and Mother Nature keeps telling us that the planet is warming.",
        "Those six years are among the seven warmest on record, for instance.",

        "But there are parts of sea-level rise that we also recognize are very uncertain.",
        "And in the last five years, for instance, there's been noticeable melting of the Greenland ice sheet and increased flows of glaciers, as several ice shelves around Greenland - and this is also true in the West Antarctic region - indicating that glacier dynamics comes into play.",
        "And so these great big ice sheets are not just like a big ice block which sort of just gradually melt.",
        "Instead, there's a lot of active features that come into play where they crack, the crevices form, water flows down in them, lubricates the base of the glaciers.",
        "They become dynamic, and so the collapse of the ice sheet can occur much faster than we thought about five years ago.",
        "The ice will just slide into the ocean."

        "Well, I think it's much more carefully discussed, and part of it was presentational in I think some of those critical comments.",
        "And I hope the critics are much more satisfied now.",
        "The problem is that a lot of this is speculation and is something that needs to be pinned down in the future, but there's very little basis to go on.",

        "Well, it says that for the next 20 years because of the long lifetime of the greenhouse gases - in particular carbon dioxide - in the atmosphere.",
        "What we already have right now guarantees, you know, what's going to happen in the next 20 years to a very large extent, along with the infrastructure that we have.",
        "We're not going to shut down a whole lot of power plants in the near term, and so that contributes as well.",
        "And then the oceans respond very slowly.",
        "The uptake of heat and when they reach equilibrium, you know, that adds about a 20-year timeframe to the response function.",
        "But what it also does say is that the different what we call emissions scenarios, the different decisions that we make about how much we put into the atmosphere does make a difference after about 30 years.",
        "And so the rates of change can be affected by policy decisions that are made and, you know, whether we have things like carbon taxes and other options that politicians consider for perhaps reducing emissions.",
        "Speaking of policy decisions, next week you're going to present these results to both the House and the Senate.",
