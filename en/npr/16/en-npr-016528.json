        "Well, certainly we hope that our results are policy relevant.",
        "The purpose of the IPCC is to inform decision makers and help them to make decisions.",
        "But the debate as to exactly what should be done is one that becomes very much part of the political arena, but it's also a part of public awareness-raising.",
        "And in order to provide the decision-makers the support, they need in order to make some of these critical decisions.",
        "You know, a key thing is that this is truly a global problem and it's important for the U.S.",
        "I think to be much more engaged than they have been on the international scene.",
        "Because from the U.S.",
        "standpoint, even though at the moment the U.S.",
        "is the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, China is catching up and we have a global atmosphere.",
        "So what China does to the atmosphere affects us just as much as what we do affects the Chinese.",
        "It's a global problem, and so we are going to have to recognize that it's happening.",
        "We're going to have to adapt to it, but we also need to work to slow it down.",
        "And you think those policy decisions need to happen very quickly.",
        "Well, you know, we don't have to solve this tomorrow or even next week, but we do have to give it attention.",
        "And one of the problems is that it's a long-term sustained problem, so it has to be given continued attention.",
        "And this is sometimes incompatible with the relatively short lifetime of people who are in office, where they're looking at two-year or six-year timeframes, or something like that.",
        "Well I want to thank you or taking time to be with us.",
        "And are you looking forward to your hearing next week?",
        "Well, I haven't given it much thought at the moment.",
        "It's been so consuming with this.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I'll be flying back to the United States tomorrow, and then to Washington later in the week.",
        "So it's been a busy time.",
        "Are you hopeful that people will finally change their minds - I mean the skeptics will change their mind now that this meeting - this report is out.",
        "You know, the whole - you know, I think many of the so-called skeptics certainly agree that the planet is warming.",
        "They may argue a little bit about what it is due to or just how much is due to human influences, but we state very clearly in this report that the solar influence - for instance, the sun - is a very small component of what has gone on, and we've got good measurements of that in the last 25 to - last 35 years.",
        "So there's not much basis for them there.",
        "But then the argument is, well, you know, maybe this is good for us.",
        "And so that relates to the second IPCC report, which will be coming out in April that deals with the vulnerability and the impacts and the (unintelligible) adapting to it."
