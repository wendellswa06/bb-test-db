        "Just a few years ago we saw, literally, dozens of schools closing in the New York area and Boston.",

        "It's really a matter of money, and that goes back to nuns.",
        "Back in the 1950s, over 90 percent of Catholic school teachers were nuns, and that meant the Catholic schools were very inexpensive because they didn't have to pay those nuns anything.",
        "Well, the nuns have disappeared.",
        "And so now, Catholic schools have to hire lay teachers and pay them a reasonable salary and that's made Catholic schools much more expensive, that means Catholic school tuition is much more expensive, and middle-income families and, certainly, low-income families can no longer afford them.",
        "Now, to what degree are the financial problems tied to the clergy sex abuse scandal, the big payouts, the bankruptcies that followed?",
        "Is there a connection there?",
        "I think there is.",
        "I think that was the final nail on the coffin that the church can no longer afford to subsidize these schools, because many dioceses were going bankrupt.",
        "But that was just the final straw.",
        "This is very interesting, because for years, Catholic schools were held up as this beacon of excellence, this model that inner city public schools...",
        "Right.",
        "...were trying to emulate.",
        "That's right, you know.",
        "Inner city Catholic schools have a long record of doing a great job educating poor and minority children, including children who are not Catholic.",
        "And the public schools, more recently, have been trying to emulate some of what Catholic schools do, making sure that every student has access to a college prep curriculum - and not something that's watered-down, having a better discipline, even school uniforms.",
        "So at the very time that we're working very hard in turning around failing public schools and creating new good schools in the inner city, we have good schools in the inner city that are closing down.",
        "Now, some will look at this - and because of Fordham's position on school vouchers, some will look at this report and the argument that you're making and they'll say, this is really all about reviving the voucher to pay...",
        "Yeah.",
        "Right."

        "Well, in fact, what we found in the study was that school vouchers are no panacea.",
        "In Milwaukee, where there is the largest school voucher program in the country, we still see declining enrollment in Catholic schools.",
        "So vouchers alone isn't - are not the solution.",
        "In part this is because the funding for those vouchers is still too small to cover the true costs of these Catholic schools.",
        "But we do think there are some solutions out there.",
        "You look to Wichita, for example, where the archdiocese has made Catholic education free for all Catholics.",
        "And they've done that by asking parishioners to tie the significant portion of their salary, and parishioners have been willing to do so.",
        "Is it possible that people are drifting away from schools or just leaving because they don't have a strong Catholic identity themselves, they don't feel that same connection to the church as Irish immigrants or Italian...",
        "Right.",
        "...immigrants or Polish immigrants have in the past.",
        "Sure.",
        "It's certainly possible.",
        "Although in the survey we did in our study, we found that Catholics love their Catholic schools.",

        "Deputy Field Director Jim Martin explains how this can happen.",

        "Officials also arrested more than 40 people in the sweep who weren't targets but are in this country illegally.",

        "The arrests have sent ripples of fear through immigrant communities.",
        "Ali Noorani, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, says targeting criminals is good, but he's concerned the government is casting the net too wide.",
        "So that they are also drawing in people who have overstayed a visa, who are really just trying to make ends meet.",
        "I would rather have it that the government is trying to find terrorists, people who are a real harm to our country, rather than people who are washing dishes and trying to make life better for themselves and their family.",
        "But Homeland Security officials point out, Americans are more likely to be a victim of violent crime in their own community than a victim of a terrorist attack.",
        "And, federal officials say the types of criminals arrested in the sweep have a 40 percent recidivism rate.",
