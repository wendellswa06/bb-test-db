        "MICHAEL SCOTT (Co-editor, The Endangered Species Act At Thirty): Absolutely, seemed very logical...",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "Well, where else?",
        "And so, well, thanks for being here, both of you, and I guess, Mike Scott, I'd like to start with you.",
        "You know, can we call the last 30 years of the Endangered Species Act, or 33 years, a success?",
        "I think that there's a lot to celebrate.",
        "Number one, I think within, more than anything else what the Endangered Species Act has done has changed the way we think about wildlife.",
        "When you think about that first group of species that was listed, there were 78 of them, and they were all vertebrates, and most of them were large, charismatic vertebrates.",
        "Today we have 1,300 species, and a majority of 'em, two-thirds, are plants and invertebrates.",
        "So it's expanded our view of what wildlife is, and in that respect I think it's been a huge success.",
        "It's also, I think, facilitated the creation of new partnerships, collaborative efforts to conserve private, to conserve endangered species on private and public lands.",
        "So I think, in terms of, it's almost created a sea change in the way we conduct our business on the landscape.",
        "I have a feeling we're gonna come back to this over and over in the course of this next hour, but what does success mean for a species that's threatened with extinction?",
        "I mean, I suppose there's a simplistic answer which is it's still around, but what does it really mean?",
        "Well, I think success can be measured in a number of ways, and when we talk about recovery, for most people, in the past success has been de-listing, but recovery...",
        "De-listing.",
        "okay, we've lapsed into jargon.",
        "What does that mean?",
        "De-listing, that means the species has reached a point that the protections afforded by the Endangered Species Act are no longer necessary to maintain the population.",
        "I got it, and you were saying, so a success is de-listing, which means it's gonna survive on its own or is there more to it than that?",
        "Well, we've operated under the assumption, I think, that when a species is de-listed, it would cease to be protected by the Endangered Species Act and fall under existing regulatory mechanisms, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, and other laws, state and federal laws, that are out there that protect wildlife, and for species like the peregrine falcon, the gray whale, that's certainly been the case."

        "I see.",
        "But for other species, it's becoming increasingly clear that those species will require species specific management actions, even after de-listing, if they are to maintain the populations, robust populations necessary to keep 'em off the list.",
        "Absent species specific management actions, those species will fall back and once again become eligible for listing.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, this probably is a good time to turn to John Nielsen and say, okay, John, the condor, there was a time, what 20 years ago, when there might not be a single condor left, and now how many?",
        "Well, there are a couple of hundred, at least, and I think that the condor is exactly the perfect example of the latter category that Mike was just describing.",
        "It's, well, it is the largest living flying thing over North America.",
        "For people who don't know, it's a giant vulture that was down to about 20, was taken completely out of the wild into zoos, and then through a number of very hands-on, you know, management moves was reintroduced and is now up to more than 100 in the wild.",
        "But I can't, I don't think anybody can begin to answer the question of whether this bird will ever be saved in the technical sense, whether it will ever fly free or even fit into the world anymore, but I can't, you know, I just can't make the leap from that to the idea that, you know, it hasn't been a successful program because you can't save the bird.",
        "Mike, well, so but would, is, are we close to the day when, to use Mike Scott's language, the condor will be de-listed or is it already de-listed?",
        "I guess I don't know.",
        "No, it's not, and I don't think we're close to that day.",
        "I mean, the condor is, I mean, it's at once, in my opinion, I mean, Mike, I should say, Mike Scott ran the condor program at one time so, Mike, you can just butt right in anytime you want here...",
        "Okay.",
        "...and speak the truth, but I think that the, you know, the condor is in a way a proxy for the effort to save all endangered species.",
        "It was actually the first one to have a critical habitat plan written for it, and it has had a lot of the sciences that are now used on endangered species developed, in a way, on the back of the effort to save it.",
        "But I'm, in another way, it's a completely unique species, and in a way, in a depressing sense, it's sort of a preview of where we're headed in terms of, you know, I think we're headed towards a world where we're going to have to actively manage a lot of the big animals or a lot of the animals that we're with.",
        "We're gonna have to put tracking devices on them.",
        "We're gonna have to watch where they go."

        "Thanks.",
        "Have a great weekend.",
        "Yeah, I think the California condor is a classic example of what myself, Mike Beam(ph), John Leeds(ph), and several other people, Dale Goble(ph), have characterized as conservation reliant species.",
        "In other words, their main, they're wholly dependent upon human intervention to maintain their populations in the wild.",
        "In the case of California condor, that human intervention comes in the form of releases from captive-reared birds, and in that respect, the condor program has been tremendously successful.",
        "There were many in 1986, when the last birds, or '87, when the last birds were taken in from the wild, who said we couldn't be successful in captively rearing California condors.",
        "Folks at the San Diego Zoo Wild Animal Park and the Paragon Fund have given, have given us great hope because they've been incredibly successful at that.",
        "We release them into the wild, but we can only maintain them there because of the releases and by providing contaminate free food in the way of stillborn dairy calf carcasses.",
        "And what we're not addressing with the California condor and if we're to get beyond the point where it is a conservation reliance species, we have to deal with the limiting factor which, and one of the major ones is lead in the environment, at a scale that's biologically, ecologically relevant.",
        "We haven't done that yet.",
        "Well, as you'll find out if you read John's book, this is a topic that engenders, the condor, in specific, but is a topic, in general, genders strong feelings, so I'm sure we'll have a lively discussion, and why don't we start the discussion off with Paul in Corvallis, Oregon.",

        "What's your question?",

        "But I'm curious to see what your guys' thinking about this.",
        "I see two things.",
        "One, U.S.",
        "citizens who care about this need to really light a fire under their butt and write their legislatures, not think about it, but really write their legislatures, find out who they are, write a letter, and do that.",
        "And secondly, I think the Endangered Species Act is very needed, but it's a short-term band-aid until the human global population growth is stopped.",
        "There's plenty of us.",
        "We're one species that is not under any population pressure to survive for a viable breeding population.",
        "We need to stop and get that global gag rule overturned on the, oh...",
        "This is on contraceptive use, yes?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay, Paul, thanks very much for that comment.",
        "I want to ask Mike Scott, I mean what about that?",
        "I mean, this is not going away; humans are still expanding on the planet.",
        "There's no sign that's going to stop.",
        "Right.",
        "But in addition to that, you have the issue of the human footprint on the environment, that in the 30 years, first 30 years of the act, the gross domestic product for the United States increased their rate eight times that of the population increase.",
        "But to the extent that people are part of the problem, they're also part of the solution, because the majority of endangered species are found on private property.",
        "And it's those private property owners that are going to help provide the solutions, and I think that one of the things that came out of the Endangered Species Act at 30 conference that we held in Santa Barbara was that we need to do a better job of providing incentives for the private property owners to get involved in protection of endangered species, because many of them are willing partners.",
        "Okay, Mike Scott, I have to pause right there while we take a short break.",
        "We're talking with Mike Scott and John Nielsen about the Endangered Species Act, and we'll be back after a short break, so stay with us.",

        "We're talking this hour about endangered species, and now we're going to talk, take a few minutes to talk, update on a story we've been following here at SCIENCE FRIDAY: the search for the ivory-billed woodpecker.",
        "Until recently, everyone thought this bird was extinct.",
        "But two years ago, a group of researchers shot video footage of a bird they believed was the woodpecker.",
        "Ever since the video was made public, skeptics have argued that the video evidence is inconclusive.",

        "You know, if I could answer that question that millions of birders would be ecstatic, or else they'd be after me, because it is still in play.",
        "And so much of this revolves around this four-second video that was taken two years ago.",
        "It's been out for all to see for about a year.",
        "And you know, it's something like the Zapruder film that was made of the Kennedy assassination because it's been analyzed, frame by frame, de-interlacing, I'm not quite sure what that is, but it's been, it's been analyzed so many times, and the conclusion that the Cornell University scientists who have the rights to the film that was shot by David Luno(ph) from the University of Arkansas, they're concluding that yes, indeed, it is an ivory bill.",
        "But the skepticism has been growing, and this week there's a paper in Science magazine, which is the venue where the original discovery was announced, and this is from David Sibley, who's a leading bird expert.",
        "He's an author and an artist and he publishes guides to birds.",
        "And he's saying, as others have said in the past, many of them experts, no, this is sort of the common, ordinary, pileated woodpecker, a nice bird, but not extinct by any means.",
        "And now that the bait is what you see often in science, it's tete a tete, people whacking away at each other's hypotheses, trying to figure out whether or not this film is truly the spotted.",
        "Well, is this tape, I mean you can shred it and take it apart and analyze each pixel, but is this going to be enough to settle the dispute, whether the ivory-billed woodpecker's around?",
        "Semrau's assurances haven't stopped Aspenites from worrying.",
        "It didn't help when he started bringing \"\"Atlas Shrugged\"\" to debates.",
