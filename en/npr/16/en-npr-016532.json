        "The sightings were in 2004 and early 2005.",
        "They're considered reliable, but they're not film.",
        "And sort of, you know, that's the gold standard in this sort of work, is you've got to have a really good photo or a really good video.",
        "There, they have audio, which is also interesting.",
        "I've heard that, that's at Cornell.",
        "Again, it's, Cornell doesn't hold that up as real proof and, you know, it gets down to slicing and dicing the word proof.",
        "What is proof?",
        "And for scientists, it, there's a high standard, and many scientists say it has not yet been met.",
        "Right.",
        "But there can't be a lot of these birds around, or presumably the massive numbers of birders who are out looking for them would have seen them.",
        "Or is it that they're far away?",
        "Well, it's a big piece of land; it's half a million acres.",
        "And of, you know, it's a lot of area to cover.",
        "There may have just been one bird.",
        "That would be extraordinary.",

        "I think the people have thought about them, but they have sort of a bigger issue at hand in trying to get better evidence at this point.",

        "It's four seconds, but it's very interesting to look at, I would suggest that if people want to do that, they might get a hold of the June 3, 2005 Science magazine, the original Cornell paper, because it has drawings of both the pileated and the ivory bill, and what their coloration is like, and this whole thing comes down to coloration, how much white on the wings, the underside and the top side of the wings.",

        "And maybe I could go to you, John, and ask, these changes that are being proposed to the Endangered Species Act by California Congressman Richard Pombo, you know, what's he actually proposing there?",
        "Well, there are a couple of major changes.",
        "I should start by mentioning that this act, while it is widely thought to be, agreed to be one of the most important environmental laws ever passed, possibly one of the most powerful zoning laws ever passed, and definitely one of the most powerful animal rights laws ever passed, it is also widely agreed that it is old and kind of creeky, and that it has been up for re-authorization for 18 years now, and that, you know, people have been trying to figure out ways to massage it and tweak it, you know, for all of that time."

        "The set of changes being proposed now are the most radical.",
        "They include a plan to eliminate what's called the Critical Habitat Rule, which basically requires biologists to map out the length of the lands a species might need in the future, at the time it's listed, which sometimes means before they've studied its needs.",
        "And, you know, a lot of people agree that the Critical Habitat Rule could be improved, but a lot of people disagree with the idea that it should be eliminated.",
        "The act also includes, or the act proposed by Congressman Pombo, includes a provision that would compensate land owners who argue that their development lands, or plans, are changed by some interaction with an endangered species, even the new head of the Fish and Wildlife Service has said that provision would basically break the bank.",
        "And there's also an exemption form pesticide use act from the act for at least five years, which shocks a lot of environmentalists who remember the DDT days.",
        "Right.",
        "Meanwhile, in the Senate, there's a big argument in committee, and there are efforts to come up with a somewhat milder version of this bill, and the fate of that argument is far from clear at this point.",
        "So, you know, we may end up going into a 19th year of attempting to re-authorize the act, but there are clearly great changes being considered, and I think, in a sense, you know, the debate has forced a lot of people to go back and sort of reconsider what it ought to be about.",
        "I mean, what should we be trying to save?",
        "What do we, you know, do we want from it, from an endangered species program?",
        "I mean I know that's what Mike talked about at his conference in Santa Barbara.",
        "Well, Mike, I was going to ask you, you've made recommendations to require, for example, recovery management agreements for conservation reliant species.",

        "It's not inconsistent...",
        "...with what Congress is proposing.",
        "The, I think the compensation of landowners issue, with respect to the funding, I think that raises a major league issue, and the director of the Fish and Wildlife Service spoke to this.",
        "But right now, we can't, we're funding recovery actions at only 19 cents on the dollar, 19 cents for every dollar that's been identified as necessary for recovery, that's the median level for recovery, for funding recovery, and if we can't fund recovery then this additional burden would, as Steve said, break the bank.",
        "Okay.",

        "I am from Little Rock and I do take great advantage of our natural state with the wildlife and the nature around, but I also want to know why, if these animals are being eliminated through the natural process, why we should make the effort to keep them up, especially if they are not profitable members of society, you know, by providing us with the things that could help themselves stay alive.",
        "Okay, Christa, interesting point.",
        "Mike Scott, what about that?",
        "Well, I think the biggest single response, the most important response to that, is that these species are not at risk because of the normal extinction process.",
        "They're at risk because of anthropogenic factors, habitat loss and degradation, invasive species, new predators.",
        "For example, in Hawaii the Hawaiian water birds are at risk because of cats, rats, and mongoose.",
        "They would not be at risk absent those human-introduced threats.",

        "Oh, yes.",
        "It's a--and there are a number of solid success stories, a number of bird success stories.",
        "A lot of them have to do less with the Endangered Species Act, however, than with the banning of DDT, particularly the raptors that have recovered, the bald eagle in particular.",
        "OK.",

        "Well, OK, it's a potential legislation at this point because it's only been passed by one House of Congress.",
        "But John Nielsen, do you know enough about the wolf to talk about how that program is faring?",
        "Well, I believe that particularly in the west the wolves--wolf conservation programs are being passed to the states at this point.",

        "And the logical next step is to hand over management of that species to the state fish and game departments, state fish and game department in Idaho and in Wyoming and Montana.",

        "This means sufficient to maintain the population.",
