        "Divorce, illness, job loss - the stress of these big events researchers thought would trickle down to everyday life, and make the smaller stuff - day-to-day chores, commuting, house repairs - more stressful, too.",

        "She focused in on older men - average age 65 - who said they suffered stress.",
        "She found it didn't matter whether it was caused by a major life event or by day-to-day problems.",
        "The harmful effect was the same.",
        "These stressed-out men had a 32 percent increased risk of dying.",
        "As a matter of fact the people who always perceived their daily life to be over-the-top stressful were three times more likely to die than people who rolled with the punches and didn't find their daily life very stressful."

        "Now, getting upset in traffic isn't an earth shattering event.",
        "But if things like that happen all the time, and the response is always getting really upset, then Aldwin says the harmful effects of stress take hold and can become toxic.",
        "Stress increases cortisol levels, which in the short term can be really good.",

        "And Waldinger says when it comes to fighting stress that's enough.",
        "When they do studies particularly of the mood benefit they find is that more than 30 minutes a day is not necessary, you don't get any extra boost, so if you think just about stress relief and antidepressant effect, 30 minutes is enough."
