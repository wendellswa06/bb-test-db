        "I mean Sheryl do you have any sense that this is anything that the Administration is really going to focus on, given that things are so desperate right now?",
        "Well I think they are trying to focus on it and I think that Condoleezza Rice, having blown it with the Iraq war is looking for some you know, better legacy you know, of her stewardship of the State Department.",
        "But you know, I hear things like this and you know, I almost don't know what to say about the Israelis and the Palestinians anymore.",

        "And the Palestinians and the Israelis are still at it.",

        "Well not much.",

        "They have ten months to broker an agreement or broker peace.",

        "And we started taking recycled materials, working with Rutgers University here in New Jersey and looking for things where we could take a negative, which was waste into the environment, and turn it around into a positive, which was developing long-lasting products that reduce maintenance, reduce plant obsolescence and, you know, was really a useful thing.",
        "And so, again, in working with Rutgers and some other people, we started to advance this into railroad ties, bridges, military projects, marine projects, all that type of thing.",
        "So do you actually start with the bottles and melt them down, or how did it begin?",
        "Yeah.",
        "There's a, you know, I mean, there's now a whole collection process.",
        "Most people have some type of what we call curbside pickup, you know, where the bottles are put out and where the juice containers, detergent containers, all of that is put out curbside.",
        "It gets collected.",
        "We buy certain types of material and put it together.",
        "And, yeah, then you feed it through machinery and equipment, melt it down, and we can get it to take whatever shape we need it to, whether it's a round marine piling, an I-beam type of design, you know, interlocking tongue and groove boards, all different types of things.",
        "So what do you mix it with?",

        "And in the right proportions and through the right processing techniques, they yield all types of - all types of combinations.",
