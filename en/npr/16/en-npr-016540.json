        "Since we last convened, Senator John Ensign of Nevada, who earlier this year confessed to an affair with a campaign staffer, the wife of one of his aides, made it clear that, well, he was not planning to resign.",
        "He's going to hold onto his seat.",
        "I said in the past I recommended him for jobs just like I've recommended a lot of people, but we absolutely did nothing except for comply exactly with what the ethics laws and the ethics rules of the Senate state.",
        "We were very careful in everything that we did, and you can see our statements on that.",
        "Senator Ensign, responding to a long article in the New York Times that seemed to, well, categorize what might have been ethical violations.",
        "Right.",
        "We're not talking about the sex, although we can if you like.",
        "Okay.",
        "And you can call me on my personal line to talk about that, if you like.",
        "But also, more importantly, it seems like Senator Ensign lobbied to have his - the husband of the woman he was sleeping with, his long-time aide, Douglas Hampton - become a lobbyist.",
        "And also that Senator Ensign apparently talked to government agencies to get Doug Hampton clients, and that is a misuse of his office.",
        "And if that's true, and if it actually did happen, that is a serious violation, and the Senate Ethics Committee is looking into it.",
        "And meanwhile, the House of Representatives is currently voting on a resolution to remove Charlie Rangel of New York as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.",
        "Well, now here's a little difference here.",
        "The Republicans are not standing up for John Ensign.",
        "They've been very quiet.",
        "Mitch McConnell was asked about John Ensign.",
        "He says well, let's just see what happens.",
        "The Democrats are standing by Charlie Rangel for several reasons.",
        "One of them is that health care is a big issue, and the Ways and Means Committee is a big player in the health-care issue.",
        "Two, if Charlie Rangel is removed as Ways and Means Committee chairman, Pete Stark of California, who's a real, far-out-there liberal - in some ways I'm looking at it…",
        "Again you're talking like a Republican."

        "I'm sorry - would be chairman.",
        "And three, I think most importantly, perhaps, is that there's a feeling that you don't want to upset the Congressional Black Caucus, and Charlie Rangel - first elected in 1970, defeating Adam Clayton Powell by the way - is a key member there.",
        "And look, until something is proven, something is proven in court or at least by the ethics committee, they don't want to move Rangel out of his seat.",
        "One more question.",
        "Then we'll get to some people who think they know the answer to our trivia question, and that involves New York's 23rd Congressional District.",
        "The former holder of that seat, now the secretary of Army, so it's an open seat.",
        "It is an open seat, and more importantly, it has never elected a Democrat in its history.",
        "But here's the problem, of course, with John McHugh -who was a congressman up there for a bunch of times, became Army secretary, and now it's an open seat - but you have a Republican candidate, Dede Scozzafava, who is in a long-time…",
        "Easy for you to say.",
        "She's a long-time state assemblywoman who is pretty moderate on some issues, including abortion, and the conservatives are not only upset about that, but they've endorsed - a lot of conservatives are backing a Conservative Party candidate named Doug Hoffman, who's been backed by Fred Thompson, Gary Bauer, the Club for Growth, the American Conservative Union.",
        "So if there is a split in Republican ranks, and there could be, it could help the Democratic candidate, Bill Owens.",
        "But again, we still have some time to go.",
        "But right now, Bill Owens is polling in, like, double digits.",
        "Well, let's get some callers in on the line, and our trivia question again: Name all of the current members of the United States Senate who also served as governors of their state and in the House of Representatives, 800-989-8255.",
