        "So Ken, as we continue on, there have been a number of meetings in the White House to try to determine Afghan policy, including a big meeting yesterday with members of the Senate and House from both parties.",
        "Well, I'd like to wish the Afghanistan War a happy birthday.",
        "Today is eight years since the United States has been involved in the war, one of the longest wars in history, and we're still searching for a policy.",
        "As President Obama has said, he is not going to reduce the number of troops that are there, but at the same time, he is not committing to sending in much more troops, as apparently General Stanley McChrystal has suggested over the - and he was rebuked by Jim Jones.",
        "But it seems like the military and the Republicans want more troops.",
        "And at his meeting yesterday with members of Congress, John McCain said to the president that it's urgency; that we can't fool around, there's a serious urgency to it.",
        "And of course, President Obama said look, I'm aware of this, and I'm just doing the best I can.",
        "But right now, there is really no understanding of what's going to be.",
        "He said there has to be alternatives to either doubling down or going out altogether.",
        "There has to be something in the middle.",
        "So we're expecting something, as he says, that may not make everybody happy.",
        "And that sounds vintage Obama because Obama with health care, with almost everything, it's always been looking for that consolidation in the middle of some kind of a thing that will satisfy everybody, but ultimately, it often satisfies no one.",

        "They've already been the source for one book, President Clinton's memoirs.",
        "But on the way home to Baltimore, Branch recorded another set of tapes, where he tried to recall everything that he and the president talked about.",
        "And now those tapes form the basis of Branch's new book, that rambles from health care to Whitewater, impeachment, Kosovo, Haiti, Rwanda, welfare reform, Boris Yeltsin's drinking habits and Sophia Loren's cleavage.",

        "He called, or his office called, out of the blue for me when he was president-elect, and in the middle of a huge crowd of people, somebody I hadn't seen for 20 years, says: I've got one question to ask you.",

        "And this is right over the heart for me, because of the plate(ph), because I think we're not recording good materials and that our history is not particularly good.",
        "And so I encouraged him, and he wasn't going to record his phone conversations, and this oral history is the next best thing we could hit on.",
        "It was interesting.",
        "One of the things you kept pressing him on was find somebody who's attending your domestic and your international meetings, and take notes.",
        "Just take notes.",
        "And everybody who attended those meetings thought that somehow this was beneath them.",
        "It was beneath them, and they were also threatened by it.",
        "They were afraid it would be used against them, what they said.",
        "So I found an extraordinary amount of resistance to keeping notes, to the point that in one conversation, I had - not from John Podesta, but he was the keeper of the records, and he said he looked - I asked him how the records were, and he said, well, I have a lot of records, but if you're talking about what really happened, that's not what the records are about.",
        "And of course, it's impossible to believe that any records kept during the Clinton administration would have been subpoenaed or anything.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, of course, that's what he was worried about, which is why he wanted to keep this oral history secret.",
        "Paradoxically, the whole purpose of it was to open it up for the future so that people could get some sort of unfiltered look, in the moment, of how a president felt that he was wrestling with all these issues.",
        "But in order to do that, we had to keep it secret, because we knew if it got out that a hue and cry would grow up that, you know, the answers to Whitewater and whether or not - and the Vince Foster suicide would all be in these tapes, and that would kill the project.",
        "So we did keep it secret for eight years, and I'm proud of that.",
        "And that's something to be proud of.",
        "For a while, the president always kept the tapes, except for one instance.",

        "I didn't know that.",
        "Not until the second term did he show me, when this thing had been going on.",
        "He trusted me enough to show me where to put them away, and that - the two boxes I had given him were behind his socks in a drawer in the little walk-in closet right next to the bedroom."

        "There's something he said about David Bonior, the Democrat from Michigan - this is in the NAFTA debate - that strikes me as just so interesting, given the situation that we face these days.",
        "He felt that David Bonior, long-time labor supporter, was going to vote against him on NAFTA, but then he went on to say something very interesting.",
        "Well, he said that David Bonior was the kind of person that would fight you tooth and nail on NAFTA, on the merits, but then turn around and say where can I work with you tomorrow?",
        "And for Clinton, that was the kind of politician that he really relished working with.",
        "He also said he never begrudged the opposition - the Republicans - he never begrudged anything they did or said against him.",
        "Any way you can get a vote, fair or foul, was fine with him.",

        "That's part of survival.",
        "He felt the same way about foreign leaders, you know, because he was very patient with Boris Yeltsin, for example, was under tremendous pressure from politicians in Russia who wanted to reconstitute the empire.",
        "And if Yeltsin didn't cuss the United States, he couldn't survive.",
        "And so Clinton would say Boris, I understand why you have to cuss me, and you are facing the most difficult challenge of any foreign leader I know, which is to build free institutions on the carcass of the Soviet Union.",
        "He was also understanding of Yeltsin deciding to go out for a pizza late at night.",
        "Well, yes, actually that story - which is of Yeltsin in his underpants trying to get a pizza at two o'clock in the morning - was actually something that Clinton said in the context of Yeltsin's doing this impossible task, and his alcoholism is much more serious than the popular image just of jolly old Boris.",
        "And he told this story, and others, at the Blair House by way of illustration, that when you're the leader of the United States with these responsibilities, you're trying to help somebody work the impossible, but then you've got these private secrets and liabilities that you can't really talk about that make it even harder."

        "He believed that a political leader's job was to have the right analysis and all the wonk stuff about what you needed to do, but that it was worthless unless you made some sort of personal connection with somebody, and Jiang Zemin frustrated him.",
        "He felt that he never made a connection with him at all, and Jiang Zemin just looked at him and said basically the United States will fade away in a few years, and we may be coming over there, telling you to make the U.S.",

        "I saw it primarily as trying to get the most candid material that would not otherwise be on the record right out of his mind while he was remembering it.",
        "But it's not that simple because to him, rapport and how you talk, and he likes exchange, he feeds off of it; and if I just sit there like a bump on a log, he's going to lose interest.",
        "And what do I do when out of the blue, he says: Do you think I should fire the CIA director?",
        "Is that going to affect the history project?",
