        "But I would like to know, sort of what his sense of President Clinton is as a person, particularly with regard to integrity deep down in the center, I mean, where is he?",
        "Because sometimes, he seems like he's a got moral compass, it may be wavering, or is that a result of being in the position he was in?",

        "And he felt - we had some searing conversations with it at the end - that it undermined any chance that he had to lift the country above what he saw as an undeserved period of cynicism about our politics that's been plaguing our political discourse for the last couple of decades.",

        "He couldn't - if he tried to escape it, he was attacked for that.",
        "If he tried to run on the record, he was dragged down by the scandal.",
        "And it went back and forth until finally, Clinton said, well, Al, Hillary had a heck of a lot more reason to resent me over Monica Lewinsky than you did, and she won in New York by running unabashedly on our record and trusting that people could separate the personal from the political.",
        "And you should've done that too.",
