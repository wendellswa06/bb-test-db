        "…he had always talked about Shelby as somebody who really didn't like him and yet Shelby was a prosecutor and felt that the case wasn't there and it wasn't going to happen, and for that reason kind of shared with Clinton a lot of a political strategy, what was going on behind the scenes, particularly the resentment of the House managers in the case that they presented.",
        "So there was a lot of behind-the-scenes that he described.",

        "Or was it just some kind of a corporate sellout, like the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act?",
        "I mean, did you get any sense of what his true thoughts on this…",

        "And it's better to have NAFTA because it will open more foreign markets.",

        "He thought it created high-paying jobs and, of course, his presidency -under his presidency, the number of jobs did rise by over 20 million.",
        "So he regretted and talked about some things that he felt that he didn't get in NAFTA and he wanted to go back and fix it.",
        "He said the same thing about the welfare bill.",
        "There were parts of the welfare bill that almost made him veto it.",
        "He vetoed it twice and only signed it the third time.",

        "When you picture the whole Bill Clinton in his entirety, what picture are you left with?",
        "Well, the only sadness I have is that the Bill Clinton that was so driven and relentlessly analyzing all of these matters for the benefit of the world, with this amazing brain, was not the Bill Clinton that most people dealt with in their daily politics, and that either a combination of our fault and his fault - we were caught up in scandals for most of that time.",
        "We're sitting here now with a trillion-dollar deficit and an economy where a lot of things are shut down and we have real problems in the world and we lack confidence that politics can do anything about it.",

        "I was there at the time - for Somalia deal, I was stationed in North Africa - that set a precedent for them to come after us and attack us because they could see that the Somalia deal, when we backed out after we lost all our troops there, showed that we didn't have the belly for a real war in that area?",
        "Wasn't the only example that's been cited by some in the Arab world and some in the Middle East as saying the United States pulled out of Lebanon after - that, of course, during the Reagan administration - after the attack on the Marine barracks and then out of Somalia and, of course, the great example, Vietnam, but Taylor Branch.",

        "There was a McCain amendment to withdraw all soldiers immediately and he was trying to get it postponed for six months.",
        "And one of the first questions I had was should I record these phone calls that he's having with these senators, and I decided to do it.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "So it's one of many examples where tactical retreat can be seen as encouraging an enemy.",
        "Well, I can honestly say from being there firsthand that we were just waiting for him to drop the hammer and we were going to go to it with all we had because, you know, to lose our soldiers like that and sort of retreat was just, at the time, it was very difficult as a troop, to ask a soldier to do that.",
        "Oh, I can certainly understand.",
        "And, of course, that's your job, too, but I can also understand that beyond that you've got personal feelings because you've lost friends.",

        "And what impact did it have on the president after the fight was lost?",
        "Good questions.",
        "Very good questions.",

        "They retreated and brought a very, very complex health care bill to the floor all at once.",
        "And President Obama has taken pretty much the opposite tack.",
        "President Clinton, when it started going down, he got discouraged pretty quickly.",
        "He said complexity gives the advantage to the attacker and this is a complex issue.",
        "There are reasons it hadn't been done in 60 years.",
        "He felt that he submitted health care too soon after the budget act of 1993, so that it got lumped together as big - another big tax, big government thing and cost him both houses of Congress, when, in fact, he thinks the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 really put us on a path not only for prosperity and jobs but to eliminate the deficit.",
        "But health care, he put them too close together.",
        "But he was forever second-guessing the strategy about health care.",
        "But the main thing is he felt that he did it too soon and that there were a lot of tactical mistakes in the way he presented it.",
        "One of the things we tend to forget was how long and protracted that fight was.",
        "You think about it as, well, not over a couple of months, it went on a lot longer than that.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "No, it didn't occur to him.",
        "At that time, he was not apologetic for it.",
        "He later became very apologetic for it.",
        "He said at the time, that - he said it took us two years to assemble a coalition to do anything in Bosnia, which was on CNN every night.",
        "He said, Rwanda was not on CNN.",
        "And it occurred in seven weeks - they killed 700,000 people, largely without guns.",
        "That even if we had been - wanted to, there's no way we would've mobilized that quickly.",
        "Later, he felt regretful that we responded so slowly.",
        "And he told stories of visiting Rwandans and people who were chopped up and that sort of thing, and even going to Kosovo and telling the people in Kosovo, you need to try to make peace, the Albanians with the Serbs in Kosovo.",
        "And I know it's hard for you, but it's not any harder than it was - I've had - I've sat in Rwanda with people that I didn't help in Rwanda who had had their whole family hacked up in front of them.",
        "And this problem of ethnic hatred is a worldwide problem, and we all owe it to make greater efforts to make peace.",
        "So it was quite difficult.",

        "Well, that's the whole thing of trying to wrestle through - and this is our best notion of a bill and presenting it as their bill.",
        "Then, if you don't defend that bill, you start losing ground from weakness, because you have to retreat it.",
