        "Right.",
        "But people say, look at the economy, or look at the mortgage scandal, or look at the unpopular war in Iraq.",
        "All of that's true, but nonetheless, the phenomenon that I have been talking about has been stable since the '70s.",
        "It's a fundamental fact of both political and social life in this country right now.",
        "To what degree is any of this, you should forgive the expression, cranky-old-guy stuff?",
        "Well, you know, I had to take a hard look at that.",
        "When I was walking around and started, you know, noticing, you know, how come clerks in stores don't want to take my money and be polite to me even though I want to pay for something?",
        "Or how come people are always cutting me off?",
        "Or isn't that stuff on TV awfully violent?",
        "Or isn't the potty humor on TV absurd to be showing our kids?",
        "And I thought, what, Meyer, are you becoming, you know, a mini Andy Rooney?",
        "So, what I decided to do is try to write about these things and think about them with a little bit of intellectual rigor, and what I found is so many people shared my complaints, that it wasn't just cranky-curmudgeon-middle-age syndrome.",
        "And is it nostalgia for Mayberry?",
        "Well, it - I would be less than forthright if I said that I probably didn't have a nostalgic personality by bent, by proclivity, but no, it's not.",
        "It's being honest about what society has lost in four or five decades of radical and rapid social change.",
        "And it is not being unrealistic about the flaws in American communities and small towns before '60s.",
        "I mean, if you were somebody who was different in a small town of Mayberry, if you were black, if you were homosexual, if you were marginal in any way, it was bad, and it's better now.",
        "But we have lost a lot in our society because of our mobility, because of our rejection of inherited wisdom, and also now because of the changes that have come about in the pace of life, thanks to technology.",
        "It's been a lot of change, and we have been slow on the uptake in coming to grips with it.",
        "And one of things, you say, is that a lot of this new reality that we live with is phony, and we see it as phony.",
        "Nevertheless, a lot of people would argue that we see wonderful things in virtual communities.",
        "We - the atomization of society that you talk about forms new communities of people who are able to find each other through places like the Internet.",
        "There were people who you talk about, politically very upset that they could not find anybody who they agreed with them in their communities, and again, the Internet and other technological marvels have enabled them to reach out and locate other people.",
        "And what we're asking for is, what kind of authenticities do you find, listeners, in these new worlds that Dick Meyer is complaining that we hate so much?",
        "Do you find some places wonderful in the strip mall?",
        "Do you love your MySpace page?",
        "Do you find a community on the Internet?",
        "Give us a call at 800-989-8255.",
        "Email us, talk@npr.org.",
        "And those kinds of things, if you are interested in Azerbaijani bikini backsliders, you can find people on the Internet who do that.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean, I think the debate about whether the new technology is either morally or socially sociologically good or bad, it's like arguing about whether the pencil is good or bad.",
        "These are merely tools.",
        "They can be used for good, and they can be used for, as they say, evil.",
        "We are in control of that as individuals and we shouldn't seed that kind of control.",
        "We shouldn't talk about - we should be careful when we talk about the media.",

        "If you're a member of the White Aryan Nation or a hate group, you have social capital, you're in a community, but nobody would argue that's positive.",
        "And that can be the same thing with virtual communities.",
        "I mean, a column that I'm publishing tomorrow is about cancer in virtual communities.",
        "Now, that's a great opportunity for people, 40 years ago, cancer patients could not connect to each other.",
        "And...",
        "That was sort of a taboo, and now they can, and that's a wonderful thing.",

        "Well, I think if you cede that to anybody else, you're making a mistake.",
        "You have to decide it for your own life, and you'll have to decide it in what you consume and how you perceive the world.",
        "I mean, there is not a national commission of phoniness detection.",
