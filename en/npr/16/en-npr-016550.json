        "Well, one of the things that you also write about in your book is the degree to which we overlook things that we ought to have in common.",

        "Absolutely, I mean, I think one of the reasons why I feel that there is something quite optimistic in this book with this negative title is that when people get together and talk about the stuff we and they hate, I think there's a lot of common ground, and nowhere do you see that more than parenting.",
        "Now, my guess is that these punky, tattooed parents, when they get together and they're talking about what kinds of stuff they let their kids watch on TV, violent video games, the kind of sexual exploitation that's in a lot of marketing, I bet that they will sound very similar to yuppie, urban parents in New York or home schooling Christians in Loudon County.",
        "It's just that we have found it hard to listen to each other at a time when we feel that we're so polarized.",

        "Your person indicated that what you wanted to hear from my part of the story is that we can't really talk about this too much without falling back on spirituality and the new spirituality, but how to turn within from what seems outer chaos - I'm a Christian Scientist and I haven't always followed it.",
        "I was raised in it, and just lately I have fallen back to that discipline, but I find my practitioner - and online they have a spirituality.com as a Christian Science online service, and I do an awful lot of research and reading online as well, and so we're kind of amalgamating a very, kind of, older religion with new technology.",

        "Well, I would suggest, if I may, that what you're talking about is using the Internet as a tool, no different than the library, or no different than the bookstore, and that it's, in that regard, not a great change from where we've been.",
        "There was one phrase that you used that I would pick up on just a little bit, which is, when you were talking about spirituality, you talked about turning in on yourself, but in fact, it sounds like you've turned to a traditional practice of religion and a practice that involves others and that involves community.",
        "In the sort of post-'60s world, the - our general approach, not just to spirituality but to finding recipe for life, is that you need to discover yourself, reinvent yourself, that somehow the roots of contentment come from the self.",

        "It's hard, for one thing.",

        "And I mean, I'm not a person who's generally a proponent of Second Amendment rights, but it was - to listen to these people talk and to hear what they had to say about gun laws, it gave me something that I wouldn't necessarily have even gone into a conversation about with anyone online.",

        "And then, of course, as the revolution began to die with a number of years and my generation began to sell out and open businesses and became CEOs and whatever, I like - what happened was, we discovered that all of that spiritual growth, self-awareness stuff could be sold to people.",

        "I don't think it was selling out, but I do think that there was a vacuum in how people organize their life with the rejection of the traditional, and it was filled by the merchants of self-help, by the mega-churches or by just commercial marketers of all sorts.",
