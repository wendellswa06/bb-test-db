        "Do you give up on this wing of your party?",
        "I think until the Republican Party decides to do that finally one way or the other, nothing is going to get done in Congress, and the party's national ambitions, as it pertains to the executive branch, will be very problemed (ph).",
        "But, David, how could a party make a decision like that if it means basically writing off the base that supports Donald Trump?",
        "Well, that's sort of the question.",

        "And I guess if I had to project that long-term, I do think it is going to be the party of the white working class.",
