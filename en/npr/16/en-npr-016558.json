        "First, we'll go to Capitol Hill, where Senate Democrats forced two votes today on extending the Bush-era tax cuts for everyone, but the wealthy.",
        "NPR's David Welna joins us with the details.",
        "It was entirely expected that these votes would fail.",
        "One of them would have capped the amount of income eligible for tax cuts at a quarter million dollars a household; the other would have raised that cap to a million dollars per household.",
        "But they both fell seven votes shy of the 60 they would have needed to advance.",
        "A few Democrats joined every single Republican who voted in voting against the measures.",
        "And Republican leader Mitch McConnell was pretty scornful of the whole exercise today.",
        "Senator MITCH McCONNELL (Republican, Kentucky; Senate Minority Leader) Meaningless showboats and anti-business rhetoric won't do anything to make the situation better.",
        "This Saturday's session is a total waste of the American people's time.",
        "Yes, but New York Democrat Charles Schumer made it clear that these votes had another purpose.",
        "They were also meant to portray Republicans as catering to the millionaires whose taxes would have gone up had these measures passed.",
        "And over the next year when they come to the floor and talk about deficit reduction, they will be reminded that they chose $300 billion in tax breaks for the very wealthy, not paid for, increasing the deficit over any other priority.",
        "Okay, David, but these tax cuts are scheduled to expire on December 31st.",
        "So, what are the chances of this being dealt with before then?",
        "Well, I don't think there's much of a chance that either Democrats or Republicans would allow them to expire at the end of the year.",
        "Neither party wants to take the blame for taxes going up on January 1st.",
        "And, in fact, today, President Obama called on lawmakers to work out a deal on taxes, as he said, in the next few days.",
        "So it's looking highly likely that there will be probably a temporary extension of all the Bush-era tax cuts, and along with that an extension of lapsed unemployment benefits and probably a green light to go ahead with ratification of the START treaty as part of the deal.",

        "And because for the very simple reason, those mammals, around that time, this is - we're talking about the end of the dinosaur age - they really foreshadow modern mammals, including ourselves, so they're very important from an evolutionary perspective.",
