        "Well, I think what one really appreciates if you're a paleontologist is how ephemeral life is.",
        "And, you know, it's not just these major mass extinction events.",
        "We think of the lump sum of those as five major events that occurred over the course of hundreds and million of years at very short intervals.",
        "But extinctions happen in all the time.",
        "In many species - we say on average, most species don't last probably more than a million years.",
        "But then, when you look around you and you see the devastation of ecosystems and habitats on Earth, the extinction of species, you would say, wow, this is happening right now.",
        "And couple that with things in the physical system, climate change and global warming, and you've got a rather dramatic event.",
        "Do you - it doesn't seem like, I mean, the U.S.",
        "is late to this party in terms of European countries.",
        "But how do we convince the big developing countries like China and India to come to dance at this party also?",
        "If I were a paleontologist living 10 million years from now and looking back at this record, I might say this is a fascinating thing, you know?",
        "This is a major extinction event we're recording now in the fossil record, you know.",
        "It's 10 million years since.",
        "And so I think it's something of concern since we're the cause.",
        "And theoretically, that means we could do something about it.",
        "Let's go - we'll come back and talk lots more about what those possibilities might be.",

        "Well, I was just going to ask - I like to offer this question to anyone, like, from different expertise he's in.",
        "I mean, the threat of global warming is so obvious, and what do you think we as American people and citizens of the world should do to change the mind-set of our politicians, our business leaders and just like the normal person to finally counteract all these threats?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Dr. Novacek, what can we do?",
        "Well, I think it's a phased process.",
        "It takes three or four major steps.",
        "And I think the first step is a change in behavior, actually, and a change in the way we consume energy.",

        "But now, nobody's laughing.",
        "As the price of gas approaches $100 a barrel, you know?",
        "And so I think that changes in behavior are an important thing.",
        "We know we can save, but that's not enough.",
        "We have to develop alternative energy options, technology.",
        "We may even have to store carbon.",
        "We don't have ways, perfect ways of doing that yet.",
        "You talk about - sequestration.",
        "Yes, that's right.",
        "That's right.",
        "And so, you know, there are many issues there.",
        "One is the technology that's practical and usable and even exists.",
        "The other is where do you store - some of the options there are not too attractive you don't want to dump it back into the sea and create another problem.",
        "So, you know, I think it is a phased-in process and it's going to take many decades.",
        "What I worry about is sometimes, there is so much focus on the climate change issue that we also - and it is important.",
        "I wouldn't at all deny that.",
        "But we sometimes lose sight that it's the double whammy or the combined effects of land loss and climate that really poses huge environmental threats to us.",
        "It's the combination of a lot of these factors."

        "Why air pollution?",
        "Well in a sense, pollution is obviously an environmental disrupter.",
        "Not only creates dangers for human life, but it also destroys ecosystems or destroys habitats.",
        "Acid rain is a good example.",
        "And, you know, and another way - the reason I talked that length about air pollution is, in a sense, one can think of climate change as a by-product of air pollution.",
        "So when you have a lot of pollution - the last thing people were probably imagining when they are creating all this pollution was, well we're going to change the climate.",

        "Well, I think one should accept the possibility of extinction in humans first, simply because that has occurred in other organisms, many organisms which have lasted much longer than we have.",
        "So that is one thing.",
        "Now, how fast would it occur?",
        "It's very difficult to say.",
        "I think the scenario that I'm more concerned about in terms at least the near-term future is that we might survive, but we might survive in an ambience, if you will, in an environment, in an ecosystem that's not very nice to survive in, you know?",
        "If we're sharing the planet totally overrun with rats and cockroaches and other species that reproduce like weeds and adapt to degraded environments, this is not particularly a quality of life.",
        "And it will put us in dangers, other dangers, including our health.",
        "And certainly, the world for our children will not be any - even worse than what we see for our self in the near term.",

        "It seems pretty dramatic changes in the past, mass extinctions, as you were talking about.",
        "And the biosphere, you know, evolution, being as powerful as it is, it's just going to move on and find a different equilibrium.",
        "I think what should we really be talking about is the very real and immediate threats to humanity because I think when we don't that - when you talk about the threat to the planet, then it's very easy for people to sort of dismiss it as this kind of an altruistic, save-the-whales sort of phenomenon.",

        "Yeah, I can understand the point of view there.",
        "It's not - we're not threatening - the planet is not at risk.",
        "But as the tile of my book says, what is that risk is this 100-million-year-old ecosystem, the ecosystem that we depend on for food.",
        "And one of the arguments I make there is that this ecosystem hasn't been around for all of the history of life or the 3.5 billion-year history.",
        "It's been around for 100 million years.",
        "It emerged during the time of the dinosaurs.",
        "It's largely defined by flowering plants and the pollination by insects.",
        "And those flowering plants, many of them produce the 15 or 100 - 15,000 or so crop species that humans depend on.",
