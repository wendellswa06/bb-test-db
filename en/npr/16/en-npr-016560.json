        "And we'll begin with Ed Gillespie.",
        "Why is partisanship important?",
        "Well, partisanship is important because parties are based on political philosophy, and there are different philosophies how should we approach the proper role of government or how those in government should approach governing.",
        "And if it weren't for that difference, we wouldn't have political parties, obviously.",
        "We'd just flip a coin on election day and Donna could call heads and I'd call tails and whoever won could claim the election.",
        "But the fact is the policies are different that are pursued by the two parties largely, and they're important.",
        "And they're very important, obviously, in a country as big and as diverse as one like the United States of America.",
        "Donna Brazile, the competition of ideas, that's what it's all about?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "It's also about allowing the American people to see the array - an array of ideas and solutions and perhaps ways that we can, you know, work together behind some common goal.",
        "But like Ed, I believe that partisanship at times is a good thing, especially when your party is guided by principles -when your party has a unique vision that they would like to offer the American people."

        "But the fact is, I think most politicians, most of the people that I know of are on both sides of the aisle do espouse what they believe in.",
        "Sometimes you trim yourselves a little bit depending on your voters, but the fact is I know a lot of folks - I know lot more than I used to - who've run and lost but feel good about it because they, you know, they've said what they believed in and stood up for principle."
