        "Except that the reality is that older Americans are spending about 30 percent out-of-pocket already for their health care costs.",
        "And to ask them now to pay even more costs, I think, is absolutely the wrong way to go.",
        "We can have a public option in our health care system, which would reduce about $10 billion in costs.",
