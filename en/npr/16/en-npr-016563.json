        "How much is patronage an element of the partisanship, Donna Brazile?",
        "Well, it is a small part of it.",
        "Look, there's no question that when you win an election you hope not only to put your person in office, but you also hope to surround him or her with people who share their values and share their convictions and share their values, I mean their ideas.",
        "And so there's no question that patronage plays a large roll.",
        "But by and large, what drives partisanship in this country is not just a desire to win but the desire to govern and govern in a way that hopefully, you know, will bring the country together and keep the country strong and prosperous.",
        "Ed Gillespie, is it the desire to foment your ideas or prevent the other sides' ideas from taking hold, do you think, that (unintelligible) partisanship?",
        "Both.",
        "That is - the fact is that, like I say, I mean, I think, you know, our party has the right ideas and their party has the wrong ideas.",
        "That's what it's about.",
        "But I think most people are driven by ideas.",
        "Some people do want to, you know, get a job at the end of a campaign.",
        "That's understandable, especially the younger folks who are involved.",
        "And it's also true that personnel is policy.",
        "You have to have people who share your views if you're going to implement the polices that you want to enact.",
        "So, you know, I guess one person's patronage is another person's, you know, policy agenda.",
        "Mike, thanks for the call.",
        "Yeah, Neal, just real quick.",
        "Not taking away from anything your guests say - the thing that's driven me from being a Democrat to a Republican and being disappointed with both of the conventional parties and the standard parties, is the consistent ad hominem attacks that have been so much part of the discussion in recent years.",
        "And I'm now registered Independent, and I look at the people and what they do, trying to ignore so much of what they say because for me, partisanship is appropriate and right on, but the ad hominem attacks - they've got to clean up their act because they're not gaining respect - of this guy, anyway.",
        "All right.",
        "Mike, thanks very much.",
        "You bet.",
        "Let's go back to the studio here in Washington, 4A - this mic to my left.",
        "Hi, my name is Gary Lavocker(ph).",
        "I'm the chairman of the College Republicans of the George Washington University, and my question for the guests - and probably best directed at Chairman Gillespie - do we think there's a double standard in the way - in the media's discussion of this excessive partisanship?",
        "More specifically, are Republicans constantly told that they need to water down their principles and be more conciliatory, where as it's okay for Democrats to be partisan?",
        "Your thoughts, sir.",

        "But I do think the media needs to be more balanced in calling the hand.",
        "They are - I always call them the referees, and they swallow their whistles sometimes when Democrats are personal in their attacks against President Bush.",

        "And I enjoy debating the issues and how we come up with solutions that work.",

        "But I tell you, when I heard him speak and the tone and what he was saying about his values and God and his beliefs, I had to listen to him.",
        "Now, I'm not going to sign up for the campaign, and God knows he will never get my vote, but I have to tell you this - I was impressed by him.",
