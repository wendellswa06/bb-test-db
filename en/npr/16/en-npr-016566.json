        "Given what you described, it sounds like the chances of there actually finding this wreckage is not great.",

        "Ooh.",
        "Well, I think the the most important thing, Ari, is that we learn to track aircraft no matter where they are on the planet, especially over water.",
        "And to do that, they need to be able to stream their location - latitude, longitude - with GPS back to a land base.",
        "I mean, the idea that we have to mount a full-scale ocean expedition to find out what happened to that aircraft - it's really the wrong side of the equation to be on.",
        "It's a very difficult thing.",
        "So streaming capability would be, to me, a real big step forward.",
        "That's David Gallo of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University.",
