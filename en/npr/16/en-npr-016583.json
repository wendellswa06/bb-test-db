        "Two terrific stories that were in tight contention with the eventual winner, Lisa Sarasohn's story, \"\"Poetry at Six,\"\" is set in a creative writing class, and someone is actually speaking that first line and then doing an analysis of why it's a good line of poetry, sort of scanning it for meter.",
        "And Will Dowd's story, \"\"The First Session,\"\" is about a nurse leaving work and going to a marriage counseling session, only to find that her husband, a quantum physicist, has been exhibiting what is called quantum behavior.",
        "It's very funny.",
        "They're both extremely funny stories.",

        "James, the story, please.",

        "How do you know, Pablo?",
        "Maybe you went cold, had a flash, you know, blacked out, and when you woke up, you thought it was five?",
        "I was pushing him now, just to see how sure he was.",
        "I like her.",
        "He lowered his head humbly for a moment, then abruptly continued in a strength I hadn't ever seen or felt from him before.",
        "She brings me coffee sometimes at five o'clock.",
        "It was five o'clock when my angel in white brought me coffee.",
        "And she smiles at me, my coffee angel.",
        "No starbucko never done that for me, but my angel does at five o'clock.",
        "She left at five, and I saw her.",
        "Pablo karate-chopped his right hand, slicing the air between us to make his point.",
        "He smelled so ripe in the afternoon's August heat.",

        "I handed him a few bucks and continued my search for her killer.",
