        "The combination of environmental regulations and cheap natural gas, have discouraged development of new, coal-fired power plants.",

        "The answer is no. The industry has come to us.",
        "There's no cost for the first six months.",
        "And if everything works out well, they can get five other departments, whether it's fire, police, and everything will be donated to the city of Palm Bay.",
        "What's the response from the community?",
        "It's been mixed.",
        "And a lot of the mix is based on the fact that on the downside, people say why are you spending taxpayers' dollars for this foolishness?",

        "Has there been any confusion, any UFO sightings, people wondering what the heck is that up in the sky?",

        "Hurricane Katrina caused so many oil spills along the southeast Louisiana coast the US Coast Guard says they can't count them all.",
        "NPR's John Burnett reports that the spills range from a couple of barrels overturned at a loading dock to 90,000 barrels gushing out of huge oil storage tanks.",
        "To give you an idea of the gargantuan force of Katrina's storm surge, it floated a two-million-gallon oil storage tank off its foundation beside the Mississippi and dropped it several hundred feet away.",
        "Up and down both sides of the river, the storm ruptured tanks and pipelines that dumped just over eight million barrels of crude according the US Coast Guard pollution response task force.",
        "Today, three weeks after the storm, more than half of that has evaporated or it's been cleaned up by more than 600 oil spill contractors.",
        "Charlie Hebert, a Louisiana native who works with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, is optimistic based on what he saw during a recent overflight of the spill zones.",
        "Hebert says he did not see huge oil slicks, but instead isolated pockets of oil sheen on the wetlands.",
        "Most of the time, we see the marsh, although it looks really bad, that will revegetate next spring with almost no sign of the oil having been there.",
        "And that's typically what we see here almost every spill.",
        "You don't see the long-term effects.",
        "It won't be years before that restores itself.",
        "On the ground, the picture is more troubling.",
        "An oily, black, bubbly mess.",
        "Not very appealing."

        "The storm rammed a piece of corrugated iron into a 20-inch pipeline owned by Shell Oil; 136,000 gallons seeped into the marsh.",
        "Though cleanup crews are sopping and skimming up the oil, about half the leak remains uncontained.",
        "Again, Steve Robertson.",
        "You know, most spills we deal with are much more contained in, you know, one or two sites.",

        "A Murray subsidiary was fined half-a-million dollars after the deadly, 2007 collapse of a Utah mine that killed nine people.CEO Bob Murray blames regulatory moves by the Obama administration, for the closure of an Ohio mine this year - a criticism that Romney picked up yesterday.",
        "You've probably heard the president say he's for all of the above.",
        "And I wondered what he meant, because I see how he's been waging war on coal.",

        "He's for all the sources of energy that come from above the ground; none of those that come from below the ground, like oil and coal and gas.",
        "The Obama campaign disputes that, noting that coal-mining employment hit a 15-year high last year.",
        "This might seem like a parochial contest involving two Midwestern swing states - windy Iowa and coal-rich Ohio - both trying to protect important local industries.",
        "Iowa windmill makers want to maintain their government tax break, while Ohio coal miners want to beat back government regulation.",
        "Romney couches this as a choice between the free market and government interference.",

        "We can listen to folks who want to take us backwards by doubling down on the same economic policies that got us into a fix several years ago, and that we're still fighting up - out of.",
        "Or we can keep moving forward, to a future with more good American jobs; more sources of home-grown, American energy; greater energy independence; and cleaner, safer environments for our kids.",
        "That's a popular position - at least, here in Iowa - where one turbine developer described Romney's team yesterday as running against the wind.",
