        "I think, surprisingly, at the advanced-degree analysis we did, Stanford was actually edged out by Harvard grads.",
        "And I think given Stanford's proximity to the whole Silicon Valley, we were surprised to see that it was kind of outdone by Harvard.",
        ": If you look at the kind of training the Internet start-up founders have educationally, what did you find?",
        "When we looked at MBAs versus master's degrees in other disciplines, primarily master's of science, a majority of the teams had only MBAs on them, or the highest degree on the team was an MBA.",

        "You know, I think that was one interesting highlight.",
        "I thought the other thing that came away from the report was the fact that all Asian teams actually raised the largest venture capital relative to other teams.",

        "What were you trying to find out?",
        "When we talked to venture firms and asked them how they make their decision, you know, the idea - I think - is obviously important, but there's a lot of people who have the same idea.",
        "The VC folks are always telling us that it's the people.",
        "And so that's what this was trying to bring to the table, was just the data-driven perspective into the people behind the companies that we read so much about.",
