        "And the billions of dollars destined for victims and rebuilding has trickled out slowly says Manuel Guadarrama, a public finance researcher at the think tank IMCO.",
        "There is a significant delay in getting access to these resources, and there are a lot of communities that are still waiting for the help of the government.",

        "Now, this track that we're hearing, it opens the record, and Miles Davis's solo comes in about a minute and a half into the piece.",

        "You have the piano and then the bass.",
        "Why do you think Davis started the record out this way?",
        "I think he did it that way to give you a kind of taste of what was coming, that this wasn't going to be your standard jazz album that, you know, began with a fanfare and continued at 100 miles an hour and, you know, blew your socks off.",
        "And the really amazing thing about \"\"Kind of Blue,\"\" I guess, and what you point out in the book, is that Miles Davis, in a pretty short period of time, went from playing conventional bop, something that sort of sounded like this:",
        "(Soundbite of song, \"\"Move\"\")",
        "And this track is \"\"Move,\"\" off \"\"Birth of the Cool,\"\" which was actually recorded in 1949 and released in the late '50s.",
        "But he went from that to the more modal-based sound on \"\"Kind of Blue.\"\" How did that happen in a relatively short period of time?",
        "Well, what you just heard - the music by the Birth of the Cool Band was a sort of halfway house, in a way.",
        "It was when he began to work with a group of other young musicians of similar instincts - people like Gil Evans, the arranger, John Lewis, the piano player - guys who weren't happy with bebop, who didn't think music should just be about athleticism and muscularity, you know, who wanted to take it somewhere else."

        "And by early 1959, when \"\"Kind of Blue\"\" was made, they were very comfortable with each other, and they were ready collectively, they were ready for this moment.",
        "Richard Williams, last year I interviewed Van Morrison to talk to him about his seminal record, \"\"Astral Weeks.\"\" And I asked him about the recording process, and it seems very clear that it was very methodical and deliberate.",
        "He knew exactly what he was doing, and he felt as if he was making something that was going to be extraordinary.",
        "We often think of this record, \"\"Kind of Blue,\"\" as, you know, sort of one of the great examples of spontaneity on a jazz album.",

        "Yes.",
        "And I think it's an example of a very carefully prepared kind of spontaneity.",
        "Bill Evans, the pianist, wrote a very interesting sleeve note for the original issue of this album, on which he described the method of working as being akin to that of Japanese calligraphers who spend the whole day preparing their brushes, sharpening their inks, and then do their work in just a series of very quick strokes.",

        "What did you want to say about \"\"Kind of Blue\"\" that you felt needed to be said, that hadn't been said by other writers?",
        "What I wanted to do was look at what I conceived to be the effect of \"\"Kind of Blue\"\" on the world - not just on jazz, either, because I do think of \"\"Kind of Blue\"\" as a kind of lens that focused a set of feelings that were around in the late 1950s and really, then, disseminated them to the world of music as a whole.",
        "So, it affected all sorts of other musicians.",
        "And in particular, I think of the California minimalists of the 1960s - Lamont Young, Terry Riley, Steve Wright, John Adams - who in their turn, went on to influence a number of interesting musicians who have nothing to do with jazz at all.",

        "I think that trip to Paris in 1949, when he was still a very, very young man, was profoundly influential on Davis's view of the world and hence, affected his musical direction, too.",
        "He spent a lot of time on the Left Bank with, you know, the bohemians of the time, the existentialists, meeting all those people."

        "But in Paris, everything seemed freer.",
        "He was able to absorb all these influences that he found very interesting.",
        "And I think also while he was there, he tuned in to that sort of European sensibility of the post-war years, which was strongly, you know, a sort of, there was a sense of alienation about - there's a sense of, you know, what is the world all about, actually, you know, that comes through in the novels of Albert Camus or Alberto Moravia.",
        "And Miles's playing always, you know, even right at the beginning, had a sense of that.",
