        "I suspect that's a good way to put it.",
        "There was a fascinating finding in one of your subjects, someone who had bacterium that had previously only been found in soil in Japan, and he had never been to Japan.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, it's one of the amazing things is that we know so little about the microbes that are all around us.",
        "Often we'll find something that can actually be quite common on someone.",
        "And it's the first time we've have really seen it or has only seen it in really extreme places.",
        "And so - then we just have those two data points, and so it's hard to know what to make of that.",
        "And as another example, one of the samples from me, I had microbes that tend to be associated with pesticides.",
        "And so it's hard to know just from that one sample what does that mean?",
        "But it invites more study, so that, you know, whether I bumped into a plant that was covered in pesticides?",
        "It's some daily thing, you know, I'm doing, exposing me to more than I would like?",
        "And, you know, it's all the questions we would ask of - about a forest, we can ask about our own bodies, we can ask about our homes.",
        "And so as a scientist, it's actually a really exciting time to be able to go into these habitats.",
        "I think medically, as a human - and this is why we get the emails - it's also really frustrating if you then have a problem that emerges from having, you know, not the right kinds of bacteria on your body or a pathogen or not enough species if you feel desperate enough to send a scientist the picture of your belly button.",
        "Well, in the rainforest you expect to a find a species, beetles previously unknown to science.",
        "Are you finding bacteria previously unknown to science?",
        "Yes.",
        "So the way we study these bacteria is by looking at their genes.",
        "And many of the, sort of, letters of these genes that we see, no ones ever seen before.",
        "And so we're finding not only whole new species in belly buttons but whole new lineages.",
        "And so then the study of those lineages begins, sort of, from stage one.",
        "You know, they don't have names even their families often don't have names.",
        "And so it's really a pretty amazing time.",
        "I think it's very easy to imagine that we understand most of what's living around us.",
        "But the truth is if, you know, when you're in your house or your studio, in that house or studio with you are thousands, maybe tens of thousands of species, most of which no ones ever, every studied.",
        "I wonder, some people - there is now a class people who go into belly buttons as a daily practice, laparoscopic surgeons.",
        "Have you spoken with them about what they find in people's belly buttons?",
        "So I've received a few emails but we haven't actually sampled any laparoscopic - well, we don' know if we've sampled any belly buttons that have had laparoscopic surgery.",
        "We probably actually have.",
        "But we do hear lots of anecdotes about belly buttons that we didn't know before.",
        "For example, it turns out that in Japan, traditionally, mothers tell their children to never wash their belly button or they'll get a stomach ache, which is actually an interesting sort of metaphorical concepts for some of what we're thinking about in terms of health of microbes and your skin.",
        "You know, we would urge people not to be so hyper clean in their lives that they both get rid of the bad bacteria and the good ones.",
        "And so Japanese mothers seem to have known quite a bit."

        "And if they require more energy, then, potentially, that weakens them.",
        "And eventually, if the oceans become too acidic, then they won't be able to lay down their skeletons at all.",

        "Did you factor the acidic rise into your equations when you were thinking about this?",
        "Or were you just thinking about the temperature rise?",

        "We did not.",
        "It was definitely flagged as a potential big problem.",
        "It's probably more insidious than even sea-surface temperature rising.",
        "And the reason for that is that some corals do appear to be able to adapt to the rise in sea-surface temperatures.",
        "But there's really no evidence at all that shows that corals can somehow adapt to a more acidic conditions.",
        "But because we didn't really have any empirical evidence yet about the effects of ocean acidification, we didn't feel comfortable to apply this to our analyses.",
        "So, we left the ocean acidification simply as a big potential threat in the future.",
        "So, the news is worse than you're saying, actually.",

        "But you do have - give us some hope that, you know, because the folks who study the acidity say, well, if even if we stopped the CO2 at levels today, we're going to lose heck of a lot of coral.",
        "That is potentially true, yes.",
        "Well, the hope is that we have seen that if we really apply good conservation measures to coral reefs, so, for example, if we have places that are very well-protected, that some coral reefs that have these other stressors such as the effects of bleaching, they're able to recover more quickly.",
        "So, one of the major themes here at the International Coral Reef Symposium is that if we can apply what we know about corals to help them get through the crisis that is currently occurring because of increased CO2 levels, that they just might be able to survive, that we can hopefully - there will be pockets of coral reefs that can survive, maybe whole tracks of coral reefs that can survive, if we just really try hard.",
        "And we hope that it can be done.",
        "But obviously, in the overarching problem is increased CO2.",
