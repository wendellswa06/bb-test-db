        "In your story, you quote an Iraqi official who says that the main reason behind these attacks is a direct response to the Crocker-Petraeus report, which said that there were signs of improvement in security.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "Well, I think that that is something that people do feel that there is a real, that - we often see this, that when there are improvements, the insurgency attempts to reassert itself and say, no, we're still here, we can still destroy everything.",
        "And the Crocker-Petraeus report really reflected quite a bit of change on the ground, especially in Sunni-majority areas, and also in Baghdad.",
        "And there has been the feeling here that maybe in fact the insurgency could be if not beaten, reduced enough that people could go on with somewhat more normal lives, and there's obviously an effort to prove that wrong, to show that in fact they are still very much a factor that can't be ignored.",

        "Charlayne, how has the region been affected by this conflict?",
        "Well, everybody is nervous about it because as we've been talking over the months, this area is one of the most volatile, and one that threatens this new attitude, this new effort towards the democratic dispensation on the continent.",

        "But at the same time, the continent is also bearing many of the ills that are often attendant with changes in climate that have been linked to greenhouse gas emissions.",
