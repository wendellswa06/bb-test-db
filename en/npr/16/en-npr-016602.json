        "We've seen a lot of major moves in leadership and democracy.",
        "What do you look ahead to in 2007?",
        "I'll start with you, Gwen?",
        "Well, it - that's a very difficult question to - in the end to predict, particularly in this region, because people here - security experts, diplomats, regional leaders, they're all concerned about the stability of the region in 2007.",
        "So I think that a mark of leadership for the coming days, much less the coming months, will be seen in terms of understanding the commitment that leaders have toward a peace process, toward peace talks for Somalia.",
        "Now, 2007 will also be quite interesting in Kenya itself because there are presidential elections that are coming up at the end of the year.",
        "So I'm very eager to see what's going to happen in the next several months.",
        "Charlayne, from the southern Africa region, what do you see ahead?",
        "There's going to be a new leadership for the ruling African National Congress in December, 2007.",
        "And there's a huge cacophony now going on, big debate, a lot of it raucous and raunchy and a lot of it looking at the whole soul of the African National Congress, which has been described as a broad church.",
        "But this is vibrant democracy.",
        "I think that we sometimes judge Africa by different standards, but look at America's election this last time around.",
        "So let's hope that the debate that's going on and the intensity will in fact make for stronger rather than weaker democracies.",
        "Okay.",
        "Ofeibea, what do you see coming in the year ahead?",
        "This has not just been a year of pain.",
        "Of course, there's also been some good stories, and especially the Democratic Republic of Congo managing to hold its first democratic elections in 40 years.",
        "And I think as Kofi Annan, the U.N.",
        "secretary-general, leaves and everybody wonders where the Africa will be on the U.N.",
        "radar, that is - although there was violence, perhaps, a positive note to end the year on.",
        "That was NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton in Dakar, Senegal; NPR's Gwen Thompkins in Nairobi, Kenya; and NPR's special Africa correspondent Charlayne Hunter-Gault in Johannesburg, South Africa.",

        "If I told you that motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of traumatic brain injury in young people, you probably would not be surprised, right?",
        "But do you know what ranks right behind motor vehicle accidents?",
        "Sports - yep, like football, hockey, baseball.",
        "Earlier this week, the American Academy of Neurology said it's time to change the way we deal with concussions in athletes.",
        "Included in the new recommendations: Any athlete who gets hit hard should be removed from the game and evaluated by a doctor trained to handle concussions.",
        "They also recommend that a certified athletic trainer be present at all sporting events for kids and adults, including practices.",
        "Joining me now to talk about concussions and the new recommendations is my guest, Dr. Jeffrey Kutcher.",
        "He is chair of the Sports Neurology Section at the American Academy of Neurology.",
        "He's also director of Michigan NeuroSport, and the team physician for the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.",
        "Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Kutcher.",
        "Sure.",
        "A concussion is a physiological injury.",
        "We understand when a force is applied to the brain, the brain moves quickly; it disrupts neuronal function.",
        "So it is not so much a structural injury in the classic sense.",
        "There's no swelling, there's no bleeding.",
        "There's no cell death.",
        "But there is a disruption of neuronal function, which causes symptoms that we typically, you know, describe as the clinical syndrome of concussion.",
        "And I was surprised to read that it's true that concussions are second only to motor vehicle accidents, sports concussion?",
        "Well, that's an estimate from the CDC, and I think it illustrates both how common concussion can be in sport, but also just the vast number of people that play sports in this country."

        "And what about these new recommendations?",
        "You're saying anybody hit hard should be immediately taken off the field.",
        "Well, actually, the recommendation is anybody who is suspected to have suffered a concussion.",
        "So it's not just being hit hard, but this is where it gets into people who have experience on the sidelines in evaluating athletes, have a much better sense as to what hit, what kind of hit, what symptoms to look for.",
        "In those cases, all those athletes should be removed and evaluated further.",
        "And so you're saying, then, that you need those specialized -specially trained people to evaluate the people.",
        "So they have to be there during the game.",
        "That would be the best-case scenario, sure.",
        "Yeah, but how realistic do you think that is?",
        "Well, not very, overall.",
        "And I think this highlights that the position statement that we put out on Monday are recommendations.",
        "They're the best-case scenarios.",
        "They're things that we think we should take as priorities, and we understand that they're not at the level of regulation.",
        "So I think it's something that we have to think seriously about, and try to reorganize our priorities a little bit.",
        "Are you concerned about athletes that suffer multiple concussions, or just one concussion at a time?",
        "Well, I think the important thing here is that not only are all concussions different, but all athletes are different, and individuals will respond differently to one or multiple concussions.",
        "And we need to move beyond the concept that we treat concussion like a very simple, straightforward injury.",
        "Three means you're out, four means you're out - that kind of thing doesn't apply.",
        "So it really depends on that individual's story.",
        "But in the general sense, we are starting to feel that there is some evidence that multiple concussions may lead to long-term consequences.",
        "But that story is just being told, and we need to do a lot of research to figure that out."

        "We reported earlier this year about new research into the long-term effects of concussions, what those effects may have on pro athletes.",

        "In some ways, they do.",
        "I think, you know, our goal, - and I will say it's also the goal of many other physician groups, anybody who takes care of athletes - you know, our goal is to look out for the health of those athletes.",
        "And that's from, you know, ages youth sports all the way to the pros.",
        "So in some ways, you know, they're all kind of similar, and we need to be looking out for our junior high kids as much as our high school kids, as college kids and pro kids.",
        "And I remember some of those reports were saying that even Lou Gehrig himself might not have suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease.",
        "It might have been from repeatedly getting hit in the head.",
        "I think that is that's a little stretch.",
        "And I say that because there were some cases described where there were damaged motor neurons in the same way that cortical neurons in the brain were found to be damaged in some athletes who had had multiple hits.",
        "But that certainly doesn't mean that Lou Gehrig didn't have ALS, and it doesn't mean that trauma causes ALS.",
        "It's a different entity altogether.",
        "In hockey - there was a recommendation about hockey.",
        "People are hit in the head all the time there.",
        "Yeah and, you know, it's not always being hit to the head, though, either.",
        "I want to emphasize that.",
        "You can get a concussion from anytime the brain moves quickly.",
        "So whether that's a blow to the body or the head, it has nothing to do with the actual force that hits the skull.",
        "So it doesn't have to be just a hit to the head.",
        "There was a story earlier this week that concussions were being under-diagnosed in hockey players.",
        "I think we need to be better about diagnosing.",
        "I think in some ways - a lot of times, concussions are under-diagnosed.",
        "But also, I think they're over-diagnosed in some other instances.",
        "And we need to be better at clarifying when somebody has a concussion."
