        "And it is more than just sort of the obvious, most common presentation of a headache and dizziness and some nausea, sensitivity to light, confusion.",
        "Those are sort of the common ones, but you can also see a personality change.",
        "You can see individuals just being more introspective or more manic.",
        "You can really sort of scan, you know, the whole brain function list of what the brain does, and anything that can get affected, you can see.",

        "What is the damage to them, and should we have parents sign a waiver with that as a major possibility - future damage to them because of concussive hits when they are that young?",
        "Because it just seemed it was like, this is the worst PR thing I've ever heard anybody do, after all that's been published.",

        "And it certainly makes sense.",
        "I can't point to any data that makes that statement more clearly.",
        "But you know, I think the idea is, we want to look at total dose effect and not just, do you have a clinical concussion?",
        "But how many hits is somebody taking over their lifetime?",
        "And is it worth having them start hitting at 8 or 9?",
        "They have to learn the game if they want to keep playing it.",
        "So at some point, you have to introduce that contact.",
        "At that age, I will make the point, though - and this is just from my own clinical experience - the football players at that age typically aren't generating enough speed, and they pretty much just fall over each other.",
        "It's the hockey players at that age that I really worry about because they can skate a little faster, and generate a little more force.",
        "Would that include women's or girls' field hockey?",
        "You don't hear much about that.",
        "Well, absolutely.",
        "You know, any sport where athletes are moving fast, or objects are moving fast around the field of play, you have to be concerned about.",

        "And so that's a sport that is definitely a concern.",
        "And so where do you go with this research now?",
        "Anything else we could expect to hear from...",

        "Do we really know what the risks are?",
        "And are all the things we're doing, all these guidelines we're coming up, with making a difference?",
        "And the only way to do that is to follow a population of athletes - a large population - early on, and follow them through their careers.",
        "And that, obviously, will take a lot of money and a lot of organization.",
        "And we're working with different organizations now to try to set something like that up so that we can get a better sense as to what the long-term effects are."
