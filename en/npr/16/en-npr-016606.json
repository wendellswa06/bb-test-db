        "Well, it is actually neglected, and a number of the researchers I spoke with made that point, and that's why they're interested in it.",

        "Well, one thing that a number of researchers are looking at is this phenomenon called adrenarche or adrenarche, it has different pronunciations depending on who's saying it, but it's basically the maturation of the adrenal glands, which are on top of the kidneys.",
        "And when the innermost layer of them mature, they start to send out this surge of hormones, notably DHEA, which is an androgen-like hormone, and that seems to be involved in a number of things that happen during middle childhood.",

        "And it actually seems to be involved in muscle maturation, and one of the things that happens in middle childhood is that kids lose that toddler unsteady gait.",
        "So they start to have a more adult-like gait.",
        "And then in the brain, it does seem to be - although the work is very preliminary - it does seem to be involved in the maturation of certain parts of the brain that hook up these social and emotional brains, in a way, so kids can start being part of a social scene.",
        "They can start being part of their culture, which is another hallmark of middle childhood.",
        "Your article also noted that at this point, the brain is pretty much as big as it's going to be in adulthood.",
        "So what does that - what difference does that make?",
        "So the brain is about, you know, 90, 95 percent fully grown, and a lot of the synapses have already been formed, but then there's the pruning that goes on in middle childhood, the great pruning, just fantastic amount of just cutting back and setting - establishing the connections that are going to work for the individual.",
        "And what happens is the hormones of adrenarche seem to be involved in first of all the maturation of parts of the brain that are - you know, a lot of the brain actually at that point is slowing down its development, less sugar, glucose being used there, but in a couple parts of the brain, there seems to be an increase of sugar use, which suggests that these are the important parts of the brain, and these are the ones that are involved in social cognition, recognition of things like fairness.",
        "And also these hormones help to - they're protective against a lot of - a lot of the things that happen, for example they're protective against oxidation, and they seem to help preserve what's going on so that you have the establishment of these links, and then you have this hormone that's helping to kind of set them.",
        "So that seems to be what the role of these adrenal hormones is.",
