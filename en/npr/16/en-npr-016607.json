        "That's right.",
        "Well, one of the things happens, kids usually learn about death, starting at around age two or three, and depending on how they're taught it and whether they have a religious component to their upbringing, that may be an important part of their terror management.",
        "But when they hit middle childhood, they're able to conceive of themselves dying and not be totally freaked out by it.",
        "Oh not just their parents, but they realize they will eventually die?",
        "They realize that they will eventually die, and at a younger age, it can lead to just a strong sense of, you know, just undifferentiated panic.",
        "But in middle childhood, they manage to start controlling that, this terror management, which is a hallmark of the human species that allows us knowing that we're going to die to still get up in the morning and do things."

        "One of the researchers I spoke to said that we overindulge our toddlers to a degree not seen anywhere else in the world, and that this actually sets up the expectation that kind of spills over into later youth of chores, and that if you want kids to do chores willingly, it actually does have to start earlier, when you're just having them always doing, contributing chores, even if it means that you have to actually do a lot of it because they're incapable as toddlers.",
        "And that by the time you get to middle childhood, it's harder to start establishing those rules.",

        "One of the things that's been an interesting aspect of looking at this cross-culturally is how little actual teaching goes on.",
        "In traditional cultures, a lot of learning happens through the kids just being immersed in whatever it is they're doing.",
