        "Thanks, Virginia.",
        "Natalie Angier, you say this is a time when children's brain is at its peak for learning.",
        "Why is that?",
        "What's happening?",
        "Well, what seems to be going on is because most of the brain is already in place, and so the synapses are there, and then it's a question of really kind of setting the patterns and emphasizing some and de-emphasizing others.",
        "And so this is a kind of optimal time for learning, because the brain is all there.",
        "All the pieces are there, and it's still at its most almost liquid phase in its ability to set up connections and to make connections so that that's why it is that kids at this age can learn practically anything.",
        "And then as you get older, of course, the options start to decrease because, in a very physical sense, the brain starts to harden.",
        "So this is an age when the brain is at its maximum size and its maximum flexibility, and so it is really prime to just absorb what it needs to know and synthesize and collate and do everything that it needs to do to...",
        "So sign them up now for piano, guitar, sports.",
        "Anything that - you know, one of the other things that does seem to be the case is that it really helps if kids are passionate about something.",
        "So all the experts I talked to said make sure that the kid has something they care about.",
        "Don't just let the kid coast.",
        "Don't just let them kind of watch TV or play - find - they have to find something that they care about, and that that will help them to sort of expand in all the other areas.",
        "That seems to be the rule for kids around the world.",
        "All right, let's take a call.",
        "Nick is in Duluth, Minnesota.",
        "Welcome to the program.",

        "I work as a recess monitor for a K-through-eight school, and I see the changes from year to year and every year from all these different kids, like, all the time.",
        "One thing that I could say is as they get older, there's a lot less whining that goes down.",
        "But I think that happens to fall in as more routine that's given and the more, like, options and choices that we give.",
        "Like, the example that I was giving earlier to the person who screened the call is I said I had this kid that was on the wall - because we have two choices.",
        "You've got to sit on the wall, or you can go to the principal's office when you put your hands on somebody or you're being disrespectful.",
        "And this kid was sitting on the wall already.",
        "And I was, like, hey, buddy.",
        "What are you doing on the wall?",
        "And he was like, well, I was going to do something bad, so I thought I would just come down and sit myself down and have thinking time for five minutes.",
        "Oh, my goodness.",
        "And he's just a kindergartener.",
        "Wow.",
        "And I was sitting here, I'm like, OK.",
        "You're doing all right, man.",
        "That sounds good.",
        "You do what you got to do.",
        "And so he made that decision for himself already.",
        "And I'm like a question I had is - I was going to ask if - your guest - do you think the social technology that we have as advanced has hurt the way of the developing of a child?",
        "Could you see, like, we take away electronics as well, because we don't let them have in that school, cell phones or anything, just because it's a distraction for them, you know?",
        "Interesting.",

        "Thanks, Nick.",
        "Yes, actually a lot of the people I spoke to do things, you know, if there's one thing you can do, it's to turn off all the devices.",
        "They actually see these as being interfering with establishing these kind of social connections because almost all learning that happens happens in a social context, and that's what we're designed to be, very, very social.",
        "So kids learn from each other.",
        "They learn the rules of games from each other.",
        "They - so interacting with each other and not just looking at, you know, glowing blue rectangle, I think, is an excellent idea.",
        "Have you seen - I'm putting you on the spot here, but have you seen any science that looks at what all these - the screen time does with this hormonal process that's going on in the brain?",
        "You know, this is an excellent question and they're interested in that.",
        "And we don't know yet, and it's a difficult - these are difficult studies to do because they just started being able to do some of these sort of brain scans on kids.",
        "And so, you know, there's been, I think, an understandable concern about putting kids through some of these machines.",
        "But now, it's been shown to be safe, so they're just starting to do those sorts of studies, to see what actually is going on, how much time you spend watching these, you know, whether it's an iPhone or a TV.",
        "How that may be affecting brain development is something that they're just starting to do those kind of studies on.",
        "All right.",

        "Good.",
        "I was calling up, just following - well, first of all, you were just talking about the hormones that are going on and also following up with the fourth grade teacher that called about how at the beginning of the school year, the end of school year is a huge difference in kids.",
        "And my son has a summer birthday, and we kept him - we actually kept him back so that he would be the oldest in his class.",
        "He's a third grader right now, and he's had a really hard year this year.",
        "He's been having hard time going to school.",
        "He's been - he's the biggest kid in his class.",
        "He's starting to really change and like get that body odor thing.",
        "And I was just wondering - my question is, is what are your thoughts on, you know, those summer birthday kids, where they're at, like, where, you know, should the boys be held back.",
        "You know, that's a big thing that we heard is that boys being held back and they don't mature fast.",
        "And because we've had - we've been struggling all year with him at this age.",
        "And it's (unintelligible) before, but this year, it's really been a struggle for him.",
        "So...",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks, Chris.",
        "And let me just note that you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "So, Natalie Angier, more anxiety there in school.",
        "Well, it is true that boys do mature more slowly than girls do, and it seems to happen on the brain level as well as physically and anatomically.",
        "Summer birthdays, I'm not aware of anything that's been looked at on this score.",
        "But I do think that if the kid is having troubles - to the extent that you can get them involved in a social group, that seems to be the cure too a lot of problems, to have them involved with a sport, have them involved with, you know, playing in a band, anything to have him interacting with other kids.",
        "That this seems to be the way in which kids really can pull out of themselves.",
        "And so I think, to the extent that can be done."

        "And if you talk to any of the experts that I spoke to, they'll all have a different age when they're sort of putting the bookends around middle childhood, and it can certainly be as late as seven or eight for a lot of kids before they really enter this age of making sense.",
        "So I don't think it's anything to worry about.",
        "I do think that to the extent again, as I said, getting the kid into a social group and having them out in the world is perhaps the best thing for a lot of problems.",
        "And when kids become very inhibited and shy, these are things that can then kind of grow and then difficult to get a handle on later.",
