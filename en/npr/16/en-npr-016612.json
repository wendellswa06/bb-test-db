        "I mean, she was referred to as a cougar, and it seemed like part of what was happening was, you know, in this sort of 24-hour news cycle which allows us to receive all this information that there also is this need to kind of quickly put these women into types.",
        "And I think our popular culture have kind of used cocktail waitress or lingerie model or model in general as a really easy way to mark someone as a type.",
        "And it just seemed unfair to me that while, yes, there's a financial discrepancy there and thus a power imbalance, that shouldn't automatically imply that in some way, because these women performed these particular jobs, that they were somehow predisposed to fall for, you know, this famous golfer.",
