        "Yeah.",
        "Well, they're - I think they've been sort of caricatured, and the two things that sort of have been used against them have been a look and has been an occupation.",
        "And when you start talking about the way that they dress or a particular look, then, again, I think you start getting into very dangerous territory because it's essentially saying that - it's impugning someone because of, you know, the length of their skirt or just how low-cut a shirt might be.",
        "And, you know, this - I don't think any of these women will, you know, fall into the category of having been inappropriately dressed for the situation.",
        "I mean, one of the things that's happening, of course, is that as these things come out of the woodwork, well, yeah, the photographs that are appearing tend to be photographs taken when they were at a bar or in a club or at a party.",
