        "The last time he played ball, it was in the St. Louis Cardinals organization in 2016.",

        "But then, as you move to the second administration, the two major legislative initiatives - social security reform, which was dead on arrival, and immigration reform - went nowhere.",
        "So, it's very mixed even in those terms.",
        "Setting aside issues like the Iraq war, the war in Afghanistan, questions of expansion of executive authority, I think those things are going to take years, maybe decades, to sort of settle; it's going to take a lot of time.",

        "In fact, compared to some of the mansions in the neighborhood where they'll be living, it is pretty low key and fairly modest.",
        "It's a ranch house, it was built in 1959, and so, driving by, it's not going to wow you, and you're not going to think, well, a former commander-in-chief must live there.",

        "There's kind of some in between, where, I would say, the neighborhood he's returning to is fairly friendly confines.",
        "This is the same neighborhood where they lived previously, so they have some old friends in the neighborhood, and it is a Republican neighborhood, kind of old money.",
        "And so, that will be comfortable for them, but there certainly are folks in Dallas who are not excited about the president living here, whether they completely disagree with his politics, or the other concerns that I have heard from folks are traffic and terrorists, and just wondering whether having a former president here could tie up traffic and also make Dallas a target.",
        "And we've also seen protests both at SMU and within the Methodist Church about bringing the library here.",
        "So, it's an interesting mix of reactions, but as you drive around the neighborhood where they'll be living, you're already seeing some yard signs pop up that say, welcome home, W.",

        "There's going to be both a library and a museum, and then they're also building a separate policy institute at SMU.",
        "And professors at SMU have raised concerns about whether this is going to be a legitimate scholarly institution and have said perhaps this would just be kind of a purveyor of partisan propaganda and not something that would beef up, kind of, the academic credentials of the university.",
        "So, there are concerns about that, and I think people will be watching closely to see what types of folks they hire to lead that institute and what their political leanings are.",
        "As I understand, there were also some concerns that the president's involvement in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan might not be in harmony with Southern Methodist University's philosophy as a Methodist university.",
