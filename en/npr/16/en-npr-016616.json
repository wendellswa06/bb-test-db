        "The Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson says he's changing this $700 billion financial industry bailout plan, shifting away from a plan to buy mortgage assets that plunged in value, taking a look at how to get consumer credit flowing.",
        "What does that really mean on a practical level, both for government and for, you know, real people?",
        "Well, what it means is that first they figured out that trying to buy asset-based mortgages and figuring out how to price them and all that was too complicated and it really wasn't doing anything to get any credit out there to people.",
        "And secondly, going to now help to bail out the credit card companies and the auto loan companies is helpful to people who have loans and who have credit cards loans."

        "But the arguments for not going to other sectors of the economy seem to grow more and more irrational as we go to different sectors.",
        "And the question is, how many sectors are we going to in - with this bail out, and how to some people get covered and others not?",
        "And if Mr. Paulson wasn't even sure that what he did so far would work - and it didn't - how do we know that this will work?",
        "Well, I mean, this is just - this is getting just plain nuts frankly.",

        "But I was nominally supportive of the $700 billion one because it was very, very clear that you were having this credit crunch, and it was spilling over into the general economy and so forth.",
        "But I mean, in any other circumstances this would look like a bait and switch where the guy says, oh, you know, please give me this money because I'm going to need to use it for X, and then he suddenly turns around and then uses it for Y.",
        "And then, again, you also have all of these, as Mary said, you have all of these people basically lining up for their handout.",
        "You've got American Express which reconsolidated as a banking investment company, and they'll say, oh, we need to some money as well.",
        "I mean, you're - I mean, it sounds a little bit extreme to say this, but you really are running into a direction of practically, you know, nationalizing just about every major industry in the country.",
        "And also with that, Robert, a crisis of confidence is what we still have.",
        "Because no matter what they do, the essential problem is that credit has not begun to flow and seems to be frozen.",
        "No one is really sure when this is all going to end, or how far it's going to go, and people who have money as sitting on it.",
        "And when institutions get money, and organizations - now credit card companies, before that banks - they want to sit on some of it because they want to see how this is all going to play out.",
        "So Paulson hasn't found the magic bullet to make anybody do anything to free up credit.",

        "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announced that they would adjust home loans so that more people in trouble can stay in their homes.",
        "And the details, again, are developing, but we're talking about something that looks like people who are more than 90 days late on their loan payments would get adjusted mortgages having to do with interest rates.",

        "And if you have 80 days, you know, why not?",
        "And should you wait until you have 90 days?",
        "And secondly, the idea was that when your mortgage was renegotiated, it would be something like 30-something percent of your - no more than 30-something percent of your income would be what they would charge you for the new mortgage.",
        "And the question was, how is that all calculated?",
        "And what about people who don't have Fannie Mae, Fannie Mac - Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae mortgages?",
        "So that what it did was, made people heartened at first and then they started figuring out the details and then saying, OK, now who doesn't this cover?",
        "And how is this going to work?",
        "Well Robert, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup are all saying that they'll play ball along roughly the same lines.",

        "And as a result, the people who are being sort of like left out on the side are indeed some of these people with these mortgages.",
        "Now, the free market or conservative Republican approach would be saying well, you know, these are the people who should have known better and just, you know, you know, let them deal with it themselves.",
        "Unfortunately, we've got into a situation where those bad mortgages are having a ripple affect across the entire housing industry, causing even those people who have been - who have actually played by the rules, have actually made their payments on time, their housing values have also started to fall.",

        "OK.",
        "So those are the names you're going to be hearing.",
