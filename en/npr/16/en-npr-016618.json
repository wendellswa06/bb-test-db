        "If Mr. Comey is alleging the president did something inappropriate, I don't want to read a memo.",
        "I want to hear it from him.",
        "So there are calls for the president to produce this memo if he's got it or to at least confirm the nature of this conversation.",
        "But here Graham is saying, I want to hear from Comey.",
        "Is that likely to happen?",

        "On the contrary, I have - my foundation -The Halley's Comet Foundation is - our mission statement was, initially, when I formed the foundation and acquired non-profit status some six and a half, seven years ago was to introduce young people, young men and women to, not just to sail and experience, but also to make them aware of career opportunities that might exist in the maritime industry.",
        "Well, that's fascinating.",
        "I have a great uncle who was a merchant marine and they're certainly - it's a fascinating field.",
        "It's certainly not something that you're going to find a lot of people who are gang members doing.",
        "Why did you choose to focus on gang members to go on this very important journey?",
        "Well, the truth of it is - the gang member aspect of it is sort of an addendum.",
        "While my focus, as a former social worker, was to try and to get as many kids who are at risk involved in our program.",
        "Initially, what we want set up to deal with adjudicated youth, that is kids who have - young people who have been put through the system, who was already been incarcerated and that type of thing.",
        "But - and Amistad, quite frankly, was not set up for, specifically, for that purpose, but I said this would be an incredible opportunity to get young people involved who are in that situation because the impact on them working as a team together of going through an experience of going to sea, preparing the vessel, learning how to sail, learning meteorology, learning how to read the ocean and realizing what the importance of the preservation of the oceans are to them and their generation and the generations to come.",
        "It's just too great an opportunity to miss out on.",
        "So John, you have the situations where you have the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade in the U.K."

        "There was no adequate food.",
        "There was no medical care of any serious sort.",
        "True.",
        "So when you think about the young people that you're going to be taking on this trip, they're going to be living a very different experience.",
        "What are you going to try to tell them about the experience of the actual Middle Passage while they are manning the ship?",
        "Well, they'll become aware of the numbers involved, which historians still are in a conflict over and some sociologists, those who study such things.",
        "The actual numbers of people that were abducted and enslaved, and remembering that these were men, women and children.",
        "That these were in fact the ancestors of a great many African-Americans, and particularly those from the inner cities.",

        "The mission statement of Amistad would be as a healing agent, to show people what had happened to a race of people, and how they still overcame incredible, incredible odds and incredible suppression, to rise in the point that we have risen to today as a race of people.",
        "How did you decide - I have to go back to the sailing thing.",
        "Sailing is often considered a sport or a pursuit of the elite and of - the white elites specifically.",
        "How did you come to this?",
        "When I was a child, I grew up in a single-parent household like most kids, but I used to go take my mom down to Branch Brook Park in New Jersey, and I would rent a rowboat for about six to seven hour, and I'd row her on the lake and I always had an affinity for the ocean and for sailing.",
        "As I became older, I learned how to sail on a little catamaran, and as - my dad and I got to know each other as I - when I was a young adult, he had left.",
        "I realized that the affinity that I had for sailing and for fishing and for the ocean were something genetic because my father - John Amos Sr., who's now deceased - was a fisherman.",
        "He was former military and he had a 24-foot sea ray outboard boat.",
        "Ultimately, I bought a boat and when I bought the boat, I realized, the look of it, it looks like a pirate ship and was so attractive from the standpoint of capturing kids' imagination.",
        "That as a former social worker, I couldn't help but envision a boat as being the tool to attract the attention and the participation of young people in a structured sailing program.",
        "When you think about all the different things you've done.",
        "Kunta Kinte was an iconic character.",

        "Obviously, you ended up leaving the show.",
        "A lot of folks missed you.",
        "Do you think that there is a way that you now continue to reflect people's aspirations and people's need to see a future for themselves no matter what background they come from."

        "Well, I'd like to think Captain Bill Pinkney from the Amistad Project is a greater reflection of that image of aspirations and people dreaming about, doing the impossible, they may think I've done as an actor.",
        "And I say that because he's the only African-American who have circumnavigated the world solo.",
        "That is, he's the only African-American on the record, and maybe one of seven or eight, no more than 10 human beings who have sailed around the world alone.",
        "Now, the significant aspect of that is, not only did he sail around the world alone, but he was able to communicate with thousands of school children who took parts of a virtual passage with him via satellite (unintelligible).",
        "So on this vessel, or rather on this passage that we're proposing with the Amistad, Captain Pinkney will be able to continue the legacy that he started of, by - we'll have a live feed on Amistad.",

        "Well, that's the big question.",

        "On the other hand, there are those who are hopeful that after 18 months of lawlessness and anarchy, now that Hamas has a firm monopoly on the security services that some law and order might finally be restored and people will once again feel safe to walk in the streets and going out at night.",
