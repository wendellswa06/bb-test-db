        "When we watch crime reports on the nightly news, you know the images you see: a sketch of a criminal wanted for a burglary, a missing child's photo which has be aged to account for the years since the child was last seen, or a reconstruction of the face of an unidentified murder victim.",
        "All of these images are the work of forensic artists.",
        "It's a tricky trade, there aren't too many of them.",
        "These folks help identify victims and capture criminals, balancing art, science, and detective work all at the same time.",

        "Yeah, Rachel.",
        "And Domenico, so this allegation is that the president revealed sensitive intelligence related to the fight against ISIS, intelligence that, according to multiple news reports now, came from Israel.",

        "Is it possible that President Trump told the Russians this information and had no idea where it came from and that it could jeopardize our intelligence partner?",
        "Well, that was the sort of little bomblet that the McMaster dropped as he was leaving the briefing yesterday.",
        "I think he ended up raising more questions than he might have answered, this fundamental question of how the president is receiving and processing information.",
        "It sounds like it was passed to him in a casual manner.",
        "And some of the details were left out, and he sort of brought it up casually with the Russians.",
        "He doesn't get daily intelligence briefings.",
        "It's not clear.",
        "You know, he's - at times, they said he doesn't need it every day.",
        "And some officials have then said, well, no, he is getting them regularly.",
        "So this has been an issue.",
        "And I'd also just add a quick note about McMaster.",
        "I mean, he's supposed to be the adult in the room, the person at the president's side who can guide him through these sorts of tricky questions.",
        "And yet, he was in the room, and yet this episode seems to have been handled pretty poorly.",
        "Do we know any more about the nature of the information the president revealed in his meeting with the Russians?",
        "The basic information is about the Islamic State and a laptop computer and a bomb that they could put in a laptop computer and get on a plane.",
        "So that's the fundamental thing.",
        "We don't have additional details beyond that other than to say, again, the U.S.",
        "and Russia are both against the Islamic State.",
        "But they take different sides in terms of supporting or opposing President Bashar Assad.",
        "And therefore, sharing any sensitive information has been taboo."

        "But - but on the other hand, I mean, there are a lot of ex, former, you know, intelligence people who are really angry and are venting their anger in the media.",
        "But I'm assuming that the immediate target and the immediate objective of the intelligence services is just a way to calm things down, to get things back to normal and to try to make sure that this doesn't happen again, which is not - you know, not necessarily something easy to do.",
