        "About 10 million dogs and cats have already been chipped in the past decade.",
        "The advantage of the chip over a metal tag is that the chips don't fall off and owners can update their contact information quickly.",
        "There are dozens of heartwarming tales about pet owners finding long-lost animals with the help of a chip.",
        "The problem is that not all chips can be read by all scanners, and not all shelters use the same scanning device.",
        "Mike Zawistowski is science adviser to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.",
        "He says the dispute is between companies that make and sell the chips.",
        "Fifteen, 20 years ago, I think each of the companies thought that they were going to somehow or another be able to dominate the marketplace in the way that we saw the competition between VHS and Betamax.",
        "One company, California-based Avid, decided to encrypt their chips, saying it would prevent fraud.",
        "That angered many vets and shelter operators, who said it'd cost them extra time and money to get the data.",
        "Another company, Banfield of Portland, Oregon, started selling European-style chips that can only be read by a higher-frequency scanner.",
        "Avid sued Banfield in 2004.",
        "Avid spokesman Dan Knox said American pets should get the American standard microchip.",
        "Wherever an animal is going to be living, that animal should have the technology in use in that country implanted.",
        "A Banfield spokeswoman in Portland said the firm wants shelters to use the international standard chip.",
        "They even got Congress to adopt a measure in support.",
        "But there's more at stake here than bragging rights between the two companies.",
        "In fact, at least one dog, a pit bull named Hailey(ph), was euthanized despite having the Banfield chip.",
        "The shelter did not have the newer European scanner.",
        "It happened last year at the Stafford County, Virginia, Animal Shelter.",
        "(Soundbite of dogs barking)",
        "Chief control officer Mark Knoll(ph) walks me through the kennel out back and stops at one cage with a big grey dog they picked up last month.",
        "He came here as a stray that came in on the 25th.",
        "It was scanned on the 25th by one of the shelter workers.",
        "It's initialed and it's property of the county now.",
        "This dog, like all the others, was scanned, but it didn't have a chip or an owner who could be found.",
        "As for the euthanized dog Hailey, Knoll would not talk about that case on tape, citing the possibility of a lawsuit.",
        "But he confirmed the dog owner had a European chip sold by Banfield's chain of animal hospitals.",
        "Since then, the Stafford Shelter uses several kinds of scanners.",
        "But Knoll says it's not foolproof and makes his life more difficult.",
        "It would be very beneficial to pet owners, animal control officers, veterinarians, anybody that works in the animal field, it's best for the animals if we did come to a uniform decision on what equipment to use out here."

        "You might even tell me what you were doing with your hands, what you were tasting, smelling, hearing.",
        "But if I ask you about the day before or the day after, you couldn't tell me much.",
        "So that's sort of how this process works when it comes to the composite imagery part of it.",
        "There's lots of different aspects of forensic art.",
        "But memory definitely is affected by the amount of stress, the amount of violence, trauma related to the associated event.",
        "So the now, one of the things that we've heard from memory research is that - I'm sure I don't have this exactly right - but that, you know, if you experience something when you're frightened, then you're maybe more likely to remember that better when you're frightened again, or you know, if you're in similar emotional circumstances, that would be something that might help recall those memories.",
        "I think that it might be, you know, a reference to reinstating the context of the event, a technique some interviewers use to pull back..."

        "So Karen Taylor, I guess what I was asking was when you interview people to do these kinds of drawings, do you have to get them in a particular state of mind or - what do you do to prepare them to get the best information from them?",
        "Well, first, I should address maybe a little bit about the expectations of composite sketches.",
        "There's a friend of mine, an anatomist named Dr. Robert George, who has said that forensic art is actually portrait art minus a tangible subject.",
        "So you have to realize that we're tackling a very difficult task here.",
        "You also have to remember that there can be any number of complications along the way.",
        "When a face is seen by a crime victim or a witness to a crime, there's that period of encoding the face in memory, that acquisition period.",
        "There's a period of time in which the face is stored in memory.",
        "And then the sketch artist comes in at the time when we have to try and retrieve that encoded and stored memory.",
        "So difficulties can occur anywhere along the path of that process.",
        "Also, we have to consider that there are variables in the witnesses' degree of involvement with the crime.",
        "And each interview has a different dynamic.",
        "So it's hard to simply say, you do this, this and this for any given interview.",
        "For instance, somebody could be very actively involved, or they could be actually a crime victim who was physically assaulted and injured.",
        "They might be more passively involved, having just maybe viewed an incident, but they don't have that adrenaline pump, not being personally threatened.",
        "Or they may be totally inactive, having no knowledge that a crime has actually occurred, that they'd seen anything of significance.",
        "So to try and answer, the interview varies considerably depending upon the complications involved and depending upon traits of the witnesses.",
        "Is this an elderly person?",
        "Is this a very young person?",
        "Is this someone with a language barrier?",
        "Is this someone who has seen a face at night or at a distance?",
        "And all those things have to be taken into account as I prepare for an interview.",
        "Now, Mary Manhein, how does anthropology - how does the science of anthropology contribute to this kind of work?",
        "And tell us a little bit about what you do."

        "Well, as you noted, Paul, we are the FACES Lab, and as forensic anthropologists who work with many, many different states, we often are called upon to create an image from just the bone.",
        "So we're asked to do 3-D facial reconstructions on those skulls of persons who are unidentified, and perhaps that's the last hope for a lot of people, a lot of law enforcement and families who want to get these people identified.",
