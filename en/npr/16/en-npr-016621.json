        "And so the - what about race?",
        "Race, typically, is in our ancestry.",
        "We call it - sometimes, it's in the face as a general rule.",
        "We take measurements all across the skull.",
        "We also look at what are called morphoscopic features, which are non-metric features, non-measurable features, that tell us about populations.",
        "And ancestry or race is absolutely one of the hardest questions we have to answer, but it's one of the most important things to answer when you're trying to rebuild a face.",
        "And in actuality, it's the substrate of the skull, the architecture of the skull that guides us.",
        "But we will say, as a general rule, we believe this person could be a white individual or a black or African-American individual, or perhaps Hispanic, Native American.",
        "And then we are able to give this information to our facial reconstructionist.",
        "In our case, it's generally Irene Vere(ph) who works with me, who is just a phenomenal reconstructionist.",
        "And she takes that information, and that will guide her in determining how wide to make the nose, how deep-set, or perhaps to make the eyes, the morphology plays a role there, or how to create the mouth, the ears.",
        "So there's features on the skull that guide her.",
        "And then we also place tissue depth markers on the skull at very specific areas, cut to very specific links and millimeters that help guide her in developing or recreating the tissue.",
        "Now, is this normally done in the context of some sort of police investigation?",
        "Right.",
        "Law enforcement comes to us, and they say, we have a case, Mary.",
        "We have no idea who this is.",
        "Can you help us with it?",
        "So we'll do our regular profile, and then if we have no luck in putting that profile out to the public, we will go ahead and do a facial reconstruction.",
        "And we will often times publicize that, either through the local media or through our website called identifyla.lsu.edu or through the national website called identifyus.org, and that's through the National Association of Medical Examiners.",
        "And this site, the main - the national one and our site are increasing in numbers every day.",
        "So people can go to the national site and they can come to our site and look up images that we've created on people who are unidentified, and they can also look up information on missing people or query different states to find out about all of these cases that we're trying to resolve across the country.",
        "I was going to ask you why you were called the bone lady, but I'm starting to get it.",
        "The - who gave you that name, anyway?",

        "So that's why I named my book that because that's what they call me.",
        "Right.",
        "Now, Karen Taylor, the police and law enforcement people are a pretty skeptical bunch.",
        "They really need to see evidence before they'll believe anything, I think.",
        "Do they buy these sketches?",
        "Do they buy into this?",
        "Do they think it's helpful?",
        "It varies around the country.",
        "Certainly, once a police agency or a detective sees a couple of successful cases, they're convinced that there is some potential value to their investigation with this work.",
        "So nothing encourages like success.",
        "So...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "...it just takes one good hit, as we call it, and they keep coming back.",
        "Now you've had a pretty good track record with this - all kinds of different agencies you've work with.",
        "Well, I've been very fortunate to have the most rewarding career -personally rewarding - imaginable.",
        "I worked for almost 20 years at the state police, the Texas Department of Public Safety here, but also for other agencies around the country, and in fact, outside the country.",
        "But there's still is, I believe, a lot of lack of understanding about this field.",
        "It is deceptively complex - both the part about identifying criminal faces as well as the unidentified deceased faces.",

        "There are certain things - as I know that you're interested in the psychology of it - there are certain things that are intriguingly similar that come into play for both types of cases.",
        "For instance, when you see a face, we tend to think that we recognize someone by the shape of their lips or their eyes.",
        "And in fact, the studies in the cognitive psychology field tend to prove out that that's not quite exactly what happens.",
        "Rather, we are encoding the array of the features, the holistic property of the way your faces light out.",
        "When you see someone walking to you that, you know, maybe they're a block away, the reason you recognize them may well be - you can't see every eyelash or every freckle, but you can see the layout of their face.",
        "And that's what we're trying to capture from words alone in a composite sketch.",
        "The good news is with skulls, as Mary was discussing, when we try to use all our various formulas for developing the features to create a skull-to-face reconstruction.",
        "That is given, that wonderful holistic property that layout, that all-important layout of the facial features that overrides everything else, it seems, for triggering recognition and triggering the memory of a face is given in the skull.",
        "So even if we don't get everything absolutely perfect in the facial reconstruction, whether it's being done on the skulls by - as a drawing or as a sculpture, if we can put out something that shows the layout, that spatial arrangement, it may well work.",
        "And another thing that seems to go on is that family members who are searching for a missing loved one seem to be able to extrapolate, seem to be able to interpret in a way that maybe others just glancing at a item of forensic art and don't see the resemblance to the target subject.",

        "It's actually relatively common, in doing the composite sketching process, that the mind seems to seek something familiar when trying to retrieve a facial memory.",
        "And it's relatively common for a witness to say, hey, he reminded me of so and so, and that maybe someone they know, but it may well be a celebrity face.",
