        "And my first question is always, okay, if we know what works, then why are we not doing this wholesale?",

        "And I went up to New York, and I visited the Children's Zone, which is run by a gentleman named Geoffrey Canada, which has received write-ups in the New York Times Magazine among other places.",
        "And it's just a fascinating program that he's got going there, where his idea is essentially that it does not good to, you know, educate a child in a state-of-the-art school and then send that child home in a neighborhood or a family that's crumbling, where the child doesn't, you know, doesn't eat properly or does not have, you know, adequate health care or adequate parental involvement.",

        "They need mothers, you know, to create intact families with father involved as opposed to, you know, the father-free environment, which so many kids are raised in now.",
        "And it's not that I disagree with that, but I don't think of it as an either-or, either we do that or we do this.",
        "My idea is that we need to encourage that, but in the meantime we also can look at what can be done as a society - what we can do in a purposeful, structured way as a culture, as a society, as a city to encourage, you know, better from our children and better for our children.",
        "And the thing that really concerns me when we talk about programs, you know, having such a stigma for African-American kids is that this country has historically used social programs to socially engineer desirable results.",
