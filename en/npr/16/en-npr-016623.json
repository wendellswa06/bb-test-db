        "Somebody wrote me and suggested that I needed to check out this program.",
        "What intrigued me, though, about the program was what Mr. Harris eluded to was the fact that the kids - the young men have such a large role in determining, you know, how it's shaped and how it plays out and what it is that they're going to do.",
        "They helped to design the program.",
        "I thought that was a very novel approach.",
        "And Reagan High School, Mr. Harris, tell us just a little bit about it.",
        "Reagan High School sits in east Austin, predominantly at this point Hispanic, but a large African-American population.",
        "We have a very - we're a very high-needs campus in terms of economics and other factors that these young men encounter.",
        "We're going to take a short break and talk about this more when we come back.",

        "Why do you think you're able to get through to them?",
        "I think primarily I take a very deep interest in the young men in our program, as actually my job doesn't end at 5:00.",
        "I attend their baseball games.",
        "I make visits to their homes.",
        "I get to know them in a very personal way.",
        "I treat them as I would my own son if I had one.",
        "And since I don't have one, I pretty much tell them that I have adopted all of them as my son.",
        "It's expectations.",
        "I create very high expectations for them.",
        "I challenge them, and I also empower them.",
        "Andy many of these young men are eager to show us adults that they have leadership skills and there are things that they can teach us.",
        "And it just is a good feeling to them when they know that someone is supporting them, even when it's not a good day or a good week, but rather than judging them, casting them out as, you know, unsuccessful, we're able to sit down, discuss what happened, put together a plan for success and then to know that an adult is following behind them to make sure that their goals are reached."

        "I wanted to ask you, Leonard Pitts, programs like this one - a wonderful examples of Mr. Harris and - but sometimes aren't programs like this dependent on one particularly electric personality?",
        "I don't think so.",
        "I did not get that even from Mr. Harris.",
        "I did not get that from the Harlem Children's Zone.",
        "As a matter of fact, both Mr. Harris and the Harlem Children's Zone made sure to point out that there are other people, you know, doing the same thing in other places.",
        "I think, you know, more than an electric personality - not to take anything away from Mr. Harris or Mr. Canada - but more than electric personality, I think what young people want is to know that somebody has made an investment in them - not just that somebody's interested, you know, but that somebody has made an investment of time and of emotion in them.",
        "I think that - the early returns - the early thing that I'm seeing from this experience is that that seems to be the determinant factor.",
        "It's often less what the individual components of the program are than the fact that somebody has made this investment, that somebody cares.",
        "And Mr. Harris, I wanted to ask you, a lot of the times we hear about these kinds of encouragements.",
        "It's often in the context of a football coach or a basketball coach.",
        "You're talking about much more fundamental issues of life.",
        "Certainly.",
        "It's been a motivating factor to a young man who comes from a fatherless home, for a young man who has educational difficulties.",
        "It's really standing in the trenches with that young man from beginning to end to provide the level of service that they feel that you care and you really want them to be successful.",
        "If you could say I'm a coach, I'm a coach.",
        "But I'd like to also say I'm more of a life skills coach, teaching these young men the type of things that they need that will make them productive citizens, that will make them effective parents, that will make them the type of young men who will strengthen the fabric of our American society.",
        "And do you see that this program could be transferable?",
        "As you say, it's in five schools in Austin, but any reason it couldn't be in places in Michigan or California or New York?",
        "The XY-Zone program and curriculum is designed so that it could be nationwide.",
        "And one of the dreams that communities in schools that we've often discussed in the big picture of things is that someday that this program is nationwide, because we believe in it so strongly.",
        "And just the results that we've been able to see from it being in our school system so far leads us to believe that it can work anywhere if given the chance.",
        "Wilton Harris, thanks very much for being with us, and continued good luck to you."
