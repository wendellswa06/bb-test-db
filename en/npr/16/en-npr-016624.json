        "Our goal is to work with communities, go to our underserved communities, low-income, highly-populated refugee and immigrated populations, and trying to work with University of Utah departments, colleges who are interested in investing into the community and tapping into community agents who are already services within the community.",
        "And together with the partnership, reaching out to those communities and learning, you know, from the communities that they are also an asset to who we are - economically, culturally, diversedly(ph) - and also promoting education.",
        "Of course, we'd love all of our students in Utah to consider the University of Utah.",
        "But if we can get any child into higher education; any parent, more knowledge on how they can support their children achieve his goal, we're really educating families.",

        "From early childhood development all the way through higher education, vocational training - trade school, however we can get our young people more educated and into economic and financial freedom…",

        "This last program, yeah.",
        "But I think that, you know, that it maybe necessary for the programs to be diffused, because again, I don't think the problems that we're dealing with are all tied up in just the child life.",
        "There are all the elements around the child.",
        "There's the community and the family when the child is growing up.",
        "A lot of those aren't really healthy for the child's development either.",

        "Just - I mean, in historical terms, overnight - changed the world.",
