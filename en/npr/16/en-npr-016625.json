        "Just six months after Pearl Harbor, an outnumbered and outgunned United States Navy shattered four Japanese aircraft carriers and scored an improbable victory.",
        "But the admiral who commanded US forces that day got very little credit for that famous victory, and most historians associate the name Frank Jack Fletcher with ineptitude and timidity.",
        "John Lundstrom, the leading historian of the period, is trying to set the record straight in a new book called \"\"Black Shoe Carrier Admiral.\"\" He's curator of military history at the Milwaukee Public Museum, and he joins us now from the studios of member station WUWM in Milwaukee.",
        "And, John Lundstrom, it's nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "It's very nice to be here, sir.",
        "Let me ask you first, I guess you'd better define that phrase `black shoe admiral.'",
        "A black shoe in the United States Navy was an officer who was a service officer who commanded battleships and cruisers.",
        "And this is opposed to having brown shoes, which were naval officers who were pilots, who were aviators.",
        "And this...",
        "So there was a dichotomy between the two of them."

        "And this goes back to a strong prejudice which existed at the time of, well, the early opening days of the Second World War for the United States Navy.",
        "Aviators, the brown shoes, felt chafed whenever they were commanded by a black shoe, someone who they felt did not understand their business.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "It was a case where the aviators themselves weren't quite senior enough, didn't have the rank--there weren't enough of them at the top ranks.",
        "So they had to turn these aircraft carriers, which of course is the prime aviation weapon, over to men who really hadn't trained in them.",
        "And this was also the opening months of a war in which the battleship was displaced as the central unit of the fleet.",
        "Before, everything had been organized around the battleship.",
        "Suddenly, after Pearl Harbor, the United States was using an untested instrument, the aircraft carrier--often, as in the case of Admiral Fletcher, in the hands of people who hadn't commanded them before.",
        "And they were using them against the Japanese who used the aircraft carrier to win at Pearl Harbor.",
        "So you had to be able to--you had to fight people that probably knew how to use the carrier better than you did.",
        "Well, I would defer to the judgment of history to sort that out, but I...",

        "Yeah.",
        "When you--when you have all of those songs back to back, the one thing that you hear, Roberta, and I know that you've heard this really since the beginning, it really came out from critics from the day we heard it, is how clear your voice is.",
        "People liken it to a bell.",
        "You've heard all of the praise, I don't have to list it.",
        "But you must understand how uniquely clear that voice is.",
        "It is.",
        "In addition to working in studios where black vocal instructors were teaching young black students who were interested in being opera singers the art of singing, you put me in a room with Leontyne Price, which I had the opportunity to do, to play for her, an aria from Puccini's opera, La Boheme.",
        "When you're exposed to Leontyne Price's voice and you can--you can sponge that up, you can register that.",
        "Her pitch is immaculate.",
        "That made a very profound impression.",
        "And then I had a dean at the School of Music at Howard University who would say to me, Roberta, go sit in there with the tenors; sing with the second sopranos.",
        "Because I had perfect pitch.",
        "Somebody would say, dah, and I would say, no, dah.",
        "I could get it up, you know, just by picturing it.",
