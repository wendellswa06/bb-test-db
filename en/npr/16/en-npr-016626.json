        "As a journalist, I have lot of people that I talk to and that I stay in to - in contact with - as I'm sure you do, too.",
        "Yeah, we call them sources.",
        "Sources, exactly.",
        "But, you know - and a synonym is acquaintances or, you know, casual relationships.",
        "And in my own life, I had moved up to Northampton, Massachusetts, from Manhattan in the early '90s.",
        "And it was the first time I realized how important these people were because gone from my life was the butcher who gave my kids bologna when I'd walk into the store, the people that I'd have a 10-minute conversation with on the street, but of course would not invite up for the weekend after I'd moved.",
        "And I suddenly really felt that I didn't belong in this new place because all of my anchoring relationships were gone.",
        "So when I saw Karen's term, I immediately knew what she meant by it.",
        "There's another term you use in the book that I also found really descriptive and - that these are the supporting players in the biopics of our own lives.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "They - some of them make cameos, some of them have these supporting roles and they're more important than others.",
        "I mean, it represents a very large swath of people in your life because if you think of all of the relationships on a continuum, going from strangers, complete strangers to soul mates, there's a vast territory just beyond strangers and just short of friends.",
        "Even though we use the word friends to describe, you know, my friend from church, my friend from work.",
        "But when it really comes down to it, they're not really friends.",
        "I mean there's just so many friends, close friends you can have.",
        "When somebody says I have 679 friends on Facebook…",
        "Facebook, yeah.",
        "…they are talking about consequential strangers.",
        "I see.",
        "And the other part that I found fascinating about the study -and that is that our friends, for the most part, are people more or less our age, who have similar political leanings, they're people like us as opposed to our consequential strangers, who have a much more diverse - well, they are more diverse to begin with, and they have much wider range of opinions.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And they give us a different perspective.",
        "They give us new information.",
        "Our intimates know what we know.",
        "And if you want - one of the earliest studies that relates to this book was a study done by Mark Granovetter, who is a sociologist.",
        "And he described a theory of the strength of weak ties.",
        "And what he had done was, he wanted to find out how people got their jobs.",
        "And this was in the early '70s, when most people thought it was through nepotism.",
        "You know, you know somebody and that's how you get a job.",
        "Well, every time he interviewed people for this particular study and he'd say, oh so, you got your job through a friend and they kept correcting, no, no, he wasn't really a friend.",
        "It was an acquaintance.",
        "So, it was an old boss, a colleague in the same industry, the uncle of a best friend - you know, people that weren't really close.",
        "And he found that person after person said the same thing.",
        "And of course, lots of research has been done since then, really defining the fact that we get information, we get novelty, we are exposed to new experiences and, as you say, a different perspective through our consequential strangers, not through the people we are closest to."

        "But they feel more free talking to me about this kind of thing, you know, I mean, these are people that are, you know, I'm physically touching.",
        "You know, I've got a very close physical relationship with, you know.",
        "But, yeah, I think a lot of times they feel more free talking to me about their friend who is having drug addiction problems or if they are -you know, things like that, that they just might not want to talk to their family about.",
        "Also about the reasons they're getting their bodies pierced, which they might just say, oh, it seemed like a good idea, Granny.",
        "But to you, they might tell you the real reason.",
        "They might tell me the real reason.",
        "And a lot of times, we don't even talk about that, you know.",
        "It really is, especially with repeat customers.",
        "They just - they come in.",

        "You know, they always remember my name, and they'll see me out in public and want to stop and chitchat.",
        "But, yeah, I mean, I think in a way, it's a valuable service to - to provide for people.",
        "It's just that little bit of extra input, maybe, that they feel like they can get a different prospective from me.",
        "Well, Melinda Blau, somebody like a body piercer is exactly who you're talking about.",
        "We're talking with Melinda Blau about the consequential strangers in our lives and the role they play for us.",

        "And this is a very similar phenomenon, where they go - you go to your hairdresser, you know, the old - what was the ad -only your hairdresser knows for sure…",
        "Knows for sure…"

        "And in the book, you describe that the overwhelming percentage of these consequential strangers, Melinda Blau, are very positive in our lives.",
        "Absolutely they are because - among other reasons, because you can walk away when it's not.",

        "If you're going into a deli and the manager is obnoxious, you go to another deli.",
        "So we can usually walk away.",
        "And we also talk about in the book the fact that there are a few situations where a neighbor, for example, who's very nosy, a co-worker in the same office who shares the cubicle with you, you're trapped with that kind of person, and those consequential relationships - consequential-stranger relationships, can go sour, and it's more difficult to walk away.",
        "But by and large, most of them are extremely positive, and Jennifer's experience is very typical.",
