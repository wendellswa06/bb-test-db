        "So 10 years ago, I sold my car, and I'm an active member of the bus community - which is a community, interestingly enough.",
        "And so every morning at 8:20, I take the bus into work.",
        "And I've met on that bus - I've met an archivist in Salt Lake, a physician from China, who occasionally I sit next to, and she tutors me in Chinese phrases that I never would have had the opportunity of learning.",

        "Well, some difference but actually, there is a community of similar folks, similar faces.",
        "There are regulars, and then there are the occasionals.",
        "Exactly."

        "Is the bus driver the ringleader?",
        "No, no, actually they - this one probably stays to himself, but the group in the back, I mean, you wave to the familiar ones, and there's a group, you know, in the back that might be college students, and then there's a professional area in the middle, of people that are reading or something, and then there are folks in the front of the bus, and they're the ones who like to talk with the bus driver.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So you can kind of pick your spot as to which group in the bus that you want to be part of, but…",
        "I'm also a part of a bus community, and we were lucky enough to have a very gregarious and entertaining bus driver but who also knew when to keep quiet when we all fell asleep.",
        "Right, exactly, when you want to read.",
        "We pretended to read.",
        "I actually have a bus driver in the book because the wonderful thing about the bus that you're describing, Mark, and maybe yours, Neal, as well, but you have people up and down the socioeconomic ladder.",
        "And the research is very clear that a varied - what we call in the book a social convoy, and those are the people that you meet as you make your way through life.",
        "If you picture yourself in a vehicle, and as you're going through life, there are people close to you, but then there are your consequential strangers.",
        "And the more varied your social convoy - it doesn't have to be big, it just should be diverse - the more likely you are to get better information and have all the benefits of consequential strangers, even health benefits.",
        "And the bus driver that I wrote about actually came from very humble beginnings, and she referred to the bus as her window on the world.",
        "And very interesting research, sociological research, shows that having a diverse network of people is tantamount to having a good education, and that it allows you to move up the socioeconomic ladder simply because you can mix it up with a lot of different kinds of people, which serves you in good stead when you're in interviews, when you're at a cocktail party - so that you can talk about anything.",
        "That's great.",
        "It's also social capital.",
        "I think it's kind of a glue that keeps a community together, in a way."

        "It was used by a psychologist in the early '80s, and I love the image because it tells us that relationships are fluid, and they change as we change.",

        "So that if you get sick, if you move, if you change jobs, you have all these resources.",

        "We don't notice the people, and if anything - I was saying before, I don't expect people to walk around saying that he's a good consequential stranger of mine, but by Karen naming this group of people, I think it gives us a chance to notice and value them.",
        "And that's what I'm hoping that the book will do.",
        "Ruth, we will pay more attention to lifeguards.",
