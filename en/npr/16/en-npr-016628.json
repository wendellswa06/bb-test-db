        "And in fact, it's something you challenge.",
        "Well, we challenge it because first of all, you know, you can't have, as I said before, many, many close friends because it's a lot of work.",

        "So…",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So, the question was a little bit vague.",
        "But really, most of the more recent studies that have been done show that people have significant people in their life, at least 10 - some as many as 20 or 30 - not very, very close, but they're significant.",
        "They're people that make you feel grounded and anchored in the world.",
        "And then we have all these other people on the periphery, and it's - as John Cacioppo, who wrote the book on loneliness, literally said, it's impossible to feel socially isolated after reading this book because you start to realize, no, you're not isolated.",
