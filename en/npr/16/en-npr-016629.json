        "Yes, that was the goal of the study, and that's what we determined here.",

        "Why was the tobacco plant chosen?",
        "Well, there's a virus called tobacco mosaic virus that used to be a big problem for the tobacco farmers.",
        "And since then, crops have been developed that resist this virus.",
        "But this is a virus that spreads very rapidly throughout the plant and it can be a vehicle for carrying a cargo into the plant, another gene that can code - that has a blue print to make a new protein.",
        "And so, it's a very rapid technology.",
        "You infect the plant in one site.",
        "On one leaf and it spreads throughout the plant and in about a week, you can have all the leaves of the plant infected with the virus and making the protein that you code for.",
        "Wow!",
        "So, this plant grows very quickly.",
        "Well, the plant grows quickly, but it's a plant that's already grown that's infected by the virus.",
        "So, the plant is already big and there can be as many of the plants as you choose.",
        "So, the technology is scaleable.",
        "You can make a lot of one product or you can make a lot of different products for different people.",
