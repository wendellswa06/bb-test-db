        "In lymphoma, there's a special opportunity because they have a target we already know about.",
        "The problem is that it is a different version of the target for every single person.",
        "So that's why we needed the technology that was fast and could be adapted for making many different individualized, customized products.",
        "Just by taking a sample of the cells from everybody else.",
        "That's right.",
        "Each person donates a sample of their tumor and from that we get the genes, the code for this protein, insert them into this virus, make a plant, produce that protein, and inject it back in.",

        "Well, there are number of companies interested in this technology or other versions of this kind of approach.",
        "And there have been trials already done with proteins made a different way.",
        "And three such randomized trials were done and reported in the past few months.",
        "Two of them were negative and one of them was positive.",
        "So we have a mixed score card at the moment on this whole approach.",
        "But we hope that this rapid technologies like this one, or others like it, will allow us to have the vaccine ready quicker and be able to administer to people earlier before they've had other therapies.",
        "So are you saying that this tobacco plant idea was tried three times?",
        "Not the tobacco version, but other versions of making similar proteins by other methods.",
        "And would you expect more success with the plant or just about the same way?"

        "Great show, great topic.",
        "My question is in a simplistic way, does the doctor feel that the response generated by the tobacco plant is related to the fact that there is a quantitative amount of the protein being produced and why does that not occur in the host individual that has the lymphoma.",
        "In other words, what is it about the plant injected protein that is getting the immune response that's lacking in the host normally?",
        "Good question."

        "Yeah, that's a really good question.",
        "What we're trying to do is to get the immune system to start to start doing something that it wasn't doing on it's own.",
        "So the product that we produce, plants or otherwise, is changed in its form from the version that is on the tumor cell.",
        "And it's got different sequences in it, different sugars on it.",
        "And sometimes we even chemically couple it to some other molecule that attracts the immune system.",
        "So we are taking something that is already in view of the immune system, and we're altering its form and getting the immune system to wake up and recognize it.",
        "So it's been modified to tweak the immune system a bit.",

        "Hi.",
        "I was just wondering with the next phase of clinical trials if, how will you determine the response versus the control group.",
        "Whether or not you are going to give the experiment group the normal courses of chemo and what not, or if you would hope to do this quickly enough that you would see a response before the typical protocols would ramp up into an advanced state where it might be difficult to tell what would be the normal rate of recession(ph).",
        "Yeah, that's a good question there.",
        "A number of ways of testing this, one is to wait for people to have other therapy so their tumor is shrunken down to the minimum it could be.",
        "But we know it usually does come back.",
        "During that window of time, we can get in there with a vaccine.",
        "Even better idea might be to give the vaccine before they've had other therapies that suppress the immune system.",
        "And if this technology is quick and we can deliver the product to the person within a month or two, then we can get in there before the other therapies.",
        "So, there are two kinds of trials that can be done.",
