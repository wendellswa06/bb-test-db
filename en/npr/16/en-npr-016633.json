        "We haven't had any more reports of gunfire since late last night, but communications obviously inside the city is very difficult, so it's hard for us to tell exactly what's going on on that level.",
        "Yesterday, Sergeant, the mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, issued what he called an emergency SOS to the country, asking for help.",

        "I think you--the National Guard is a function of the state government.",

        "Different from what they were a week ago, Alex.",
        "Before these London bombings, a lot of the talk in Congress was about letting some of these provisions expire; not all 16, of course, that the president was referring to, but a few.",
        "And I think some still may, but the administration clearly has a new pressure point here in these London attacks.",
        "And one of the best intelligence systems in the world in Great Britain was apparently caught flat-footed by these attacks, and the emphasis of the moment is going to be on new means of gathering intelligence to prevent such attacks in the future, and including in this country.",
        "So when is the full Congress going to act on these proposals?",
        "It will take some months before Congress finishes its work on this, but we have a critical moment in the process this week.",
        "On Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee is going to mark up a bill that promises to be a good deal stronger than what might have been contemplated even a week ago.",
        "It's been rewritten in just the last few days since the bombing attacks in London, and the chairman of that committee would like very much to press for some new intelligence-gathering powers and certainly for renewal of the ones that the president was referring to.",
        "Meanwhile, in the Senate, where the bill has not moved quite as far along yet, the Intelligence Committee there is talking about adding an administrative subpoena to the Patriot Act.",
        "That would allow the FBI to compel documents or access records without any kind of court order whatsoever, a strictly administrative power.",
        "That's going to be controversial, I would imagine.",
        "It will be a big one.",
        "The Senate this week is also talking about terrorism because it's talking about a spending bill for the Homeland Security Department.",
        "That's right, and about a lot of amendments that might alter the way we go about protecting ourselves in that respect.",
        "One month ago, the Senate Appropriations Committee thought they could actually reduce spending on rail security by about a third next year in the Homeland Security spending.",
        "Well, after last week in London, that's clearly going to change.",
        "There's going to be one amendment not only restoring the original funding but doubling it, and there's another one that would raise spending on rail security by over a billion dollars over the next five years.",
        "So that's going to be the direction of the debate this week on that issue.",

        "He could please one side of his base and maybe another side of his base with the other pick.",

        "But Stalin was out to show that anything you capitalists can do, we Communists can do.",
        "And it wasn't long before the Soviets, with an assist from spies like Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, developed their own nuclear bombs.",

        "In 1955, President Eisenhower flew to Geneva with a proposal to be presented to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and Prime Minister Nikolai Bulganin called Atoms for Peace, a way of bringing nuclear weapons under control.",
