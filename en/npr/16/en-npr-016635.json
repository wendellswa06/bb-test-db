        "Some students were killed there, weren't they?",
        "And that would be about the extent of their memory or their knowledge of it.",
        "So what I tried to do in this book was fairly modest; in addition to re-creating some of the atmosphere in America at the time and trying to put flesh and bones on the names of the victims, the ones who were killed, was to look at the existing record, the public record that is in newspaper clippings and court documents and the archives here at Kent State University, it's on the Internet, and put it together in a concise form, so that people would have access to quite a bit of information, but again, in a concise form about this event.",
