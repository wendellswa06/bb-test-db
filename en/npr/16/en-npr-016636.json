        "He was active in the demonstrations, but to give you an idea, again, of the sort of campus it was, he had called his mother the day that the anti-war rally was to be held and, more or less, asked her permission to go to the anti-war rally, and she said, `Well, you do what you think is right,' and he thought that it was right to protest the war in general and specifically the Cambodian invasion.",
        "He had transferred to Kent State from the University of Michigan where, like his older brother, he had been a fraternity boy.",
        "He was--I've read letters that he wrote to his grandparents, and it's quite heartbreaking to read these letters and to see that basically, he was snuffed out of existence for doing nothing but expressing his opinion.",

        "Yes.",
        "I was only 13 at the time, but weirdly was quite the radical, along with about three or four older friends of mine in junior high.",
        "And we were just livid with the administration for the invasion of Cambodia and then with the governor of Ohio for sending in the National Guard at all in the first place and then for the shootings.",
        "And I followed it and thought about it, you know, every May 4th since then.",
        "As a matter of fact, the year after, me and those four friends wore black arm bands to school, and everybody was going, `Oh, who died?",
        "That's how--you know, like the previous guy was talking about, most people didn't--at that time weren't following it that closely, the war or even knowing that just right across, you know, the state line, something like that had happened."

        "And as a matter of fact, I asked some Kent State students about that when I was here last fall, the fall of 2004.",
        "And one answer I got was--they said--the gentleman I was interviewing, he said two words: `the draft.",
        "And the absence of a draft probably accounts for about maybe 75 percent of the quiescence that you now find on American campuses as regard to the Iraq War.",
        "And that if there was a draft, that would change quickly, you think.",
        "Yeah.",
        "He thinks so and I think so.",
        "I don't know that you would see a repeat of the 1960s, because there were a lot of other factors that went into creating the atmosphere of that era.",
        "But I do think you'd see a lot more student activism were there a draft, were students today--and now you would have women facing the possibility of being taken into the armed services and sent over to Iraq.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
