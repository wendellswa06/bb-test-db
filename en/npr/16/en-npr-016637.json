        "And he knew a lot of people that knew a lot of things, but he also knew people that were prejudiced in the sense that they had their own agendas to face.",

        "His carrier, the Yorktown, was damaged in battle by Japanese aircraft, and a lot of people think that the best thing Admiral Fletcher ever did in his career was to go to the other admiral who was on the scene, Raymond Spruance, and say, `Hey, you're in charge.'",
        "Well, you should read what Admiral Spruance has to say about this.",
        "He always acknowledged that Fletcher was his commander.",
        "And he also acknowledged that when Fletcher turned command over to Spruance, the battle was already won.",
        "So there's, again, new information coming on this to show that maybe Fletcher did a pretty good job at Midway, and that's something that Spruance himself has always acknowledged.",
        "Well, Spruance himself--most historians say his truly brilliant moment was later that day after he was in command and decided to, well, pull back and not expose his forces to attack by Japanese surface forces.",
        "So an important contribution that Admiral Spruance did make."

        "Absolutely.",
        "It was the right thing to do, but Fletcher's Yorktown that was badly damaged and was immobile at the time was actually closer to the Japanese than Spruance was.",
        "So that's why Fletcher had to leave the Yorktown behind or risk being attacked by Japanese forces at night.",
        "But if Frank Jack Fletcher is rendered more or less invisible by Raymond Spruance and Chester Nimitz, for that matter, at the Battle of Midway, he is castigated, especially by members of the United States Marine Corps, for what he did at the landings at Guadalcanal.",
        "Exactly.",
        "He pulled the carriers out supposedly to refuel, but it's a case again of not having the whole information.",
        "These histories that were done and--virtually all the criticism of Fletcher was on histories that were written by 1950.",

        "There was a raid later that day by Japanese aircraft.",
        "And that night it was Admiral Fletcher who said, `I'm taking your air cover and pulling out.",
        "I don't want to expose my forces to air attack.",
        "And of course what happened that night--not necessarily his fault--was the battle of Savo Island in which Japanese surface forces came down and crushed the cruisers for the most part that were guarding the landing ships, which all had to pull out.",
        "The Marines were then left on Guadalcanal with their ships unloaded.",
        "Correct.",
        "Mostly unloaded.",
        "But the key to looking at the situation is to understand what Fletcher knew at the time.",
        "And the only way you can do that is go back to the dispatches and files and such, and to understand that when he pulled his carriers out, first of all, he was short on fuel, and that's not something you can argue with now, the new information.",
        "And second of all, he thought things were going quite well, and he thought that the transports that left the Marines had unloaded everything and were going to come out with him.",
        "The communication was extremely poor between the landing force and the carriers; they were about 60 to 70 miles away.",
