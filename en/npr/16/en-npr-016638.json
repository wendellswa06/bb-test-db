        "Well, the principal problem or the principal thing that you have to understand is Fletcher only had three carriers.",

        "You're looking at an operation in 1942 that had three carriers.",
        "The next major invasion--would've been in November 1943--had 19 carriers.",

        "His contemporaries included Bill Halsey, known as Bull Halsey to the public, never to anybody who actually knew him--nobody called him that to his face.",
        "But Admiral William Halsey was one of the great heroes for many in the Second World War, highly aggressive and very colorful.",
        "And the much less colorful, dour even, Raymond Spruance, who was brilliant.",
        "Well, he definitely suffers because, first of all, he's not around very long.",
        "He's relieved from command after the beginning of the Guadalcanal campaign.",
        "And he's more or less sent to the North Pacific a little later in the war.",
        "And he never got back into it.",
        "In fact, there were histories done in 1943 that were sponsored by the Navy that actually failed to mention Fletcher even being at Midway, let alone being in command.",
        "So something's going on behind the scenes with Fletcher.",
        "What do you think it is?",
        "I think it's a case of, first of all, he was the first one to command.",
        "There was a lot of jealousy involved in that by certain people who thought, again, they could've done a much better job.",

        "Well, he was.",

        "After the war, he never did anything to try to clear his reputation.",
        "Well, one problem was he lost all of his papers.",
        "In fact, a lot of his papers are sitting right now--for Coral Sea and Midway--are sitting in the Yorktown three and a half miles down.",
        "They're probably in perfect shape; I'd love to see them, but I don't think I will.",
        "And his papers for Guadalcanal were lost to him because he never had a chance to come back and get them.",
        "And there are admirals who have written on Guadalcanal, like Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner, who did it on the basis of the papers they were able to save.",
        "And he had kind of a choice to make when this all began happening.",
        "He either was going to enjoy his retirement that he'd been waiting for or he was going to fight these battles for the rest of his life.",
        "And he just simply chose to retire.",

        "What's so remarkable is that when he went on board an aircraft carrier the first time in January 1942, a month after Pearl Harbor, he'd never been on one before.",
        "And he had to learn how to fight.",
        "He had to know where to get the right advice and who to listen to, and how to do it.",
        "And the carrier that he commanded, the Yorktown, was probably the best carrier the United States had in 1942, the most advanced in terms of doctrine on how it fought.",
        "It's just ironic that it was the one that was sunk at Midway because even at Midway it by far was the best-handled ship.",
        "But to be able to step in when you don't have the knowledge, intimate knowledge of a technology, and be able to pick it up as well as he did, not to lose your shirt, considering what he was facing--he was always facing odds--is terrific.",

        "Cleveland comparatively is David but still a very good team, especially in the postseason.",

        "Now, a key for both teams is going to be jumping out to early leads, especially for Cleveland.",
