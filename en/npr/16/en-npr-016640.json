        "And I think that is a productive exercise to have scientists and the public sitting around the table making sure each one understands what the benefits and risks are and putting in place policies that allow these types of experiments to go on so that they're safe and so society can benefit from the knowledge and innovation that comes out of that work.",

        "She said it was troubling that the IRS targeted conservative groups as they applied for tax-exempt status as 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations.",

        "What are the big issues that you see looming for Mesa, assuming these cuts do go through?",

        "They've actually started planning for uncertainly and they won't be directly impacted, but we have that second tier of suppliers who have been hurting for quite a number of months because as Boeing and the Honeywells and the General Dynamics have scaled back and they've become more conservative - not knowing what would happen - they, of course, have either cancelled contracts or not let any new contracts."

        "Here's what he had to say.",
        "I think that Indiana has neglected veterans.",
        "I think that veterans are uneducated as to what their benefits are, and there has been little effort undertaken to communicate and get that to veterans.",
        "What is going on here?",
        "Why are vets in Indiana receiving less money than vets in other states?",
        "Well, there could be a lot of reasons.",
        "Back in 2010, a VA survey found that, nationwide, fewer than half of veterans understood their benefits, whether it was medical care, college tuition or pension and disability payments.",
        "And vets who retire from the military tend to receive more benefits.",
        "And they often congregate around military bases, and Indiana has no active duty military base.",
        "But Bauerle believes that one of the big reasons is Indiana vets aren't getting enough help filling out the forms.",
        "And if you don't fill out the forms the right way, the VA rejects the claim.",
        "But filling out forms for federal benefits - isn't that really the VA's problem and not something that Indiana and the state has to worry about?",
        "States often try to help their vets.",
        "Indiana is one of 28 states which have county veterans service officers.",
        "They're supposed to help vets get the benefits they've earned.",
        "They're hired by counties, and they often operate on a shoestring.",
        "Here's how General Bauerle describes some of these offices.",
        "Some counties have an individual that works three days a week, part-time and doesn't even have an office or a computer to support their veteran."
