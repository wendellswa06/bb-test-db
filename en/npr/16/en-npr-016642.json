        "About 60 percent lived in the South, about 60 percent lived in urban areas - obviously there's a lot of overlap there, there's urban areas in the South.",

        "What are the chances of him actually getting the job at this point?",
        "They're certainly worse than they seemed several days ago, precisely because he just didn't appear ready to handle what he knew would be the main hostile questions from his Republican inquisitors.",
        "But still, he has a better chance of becoming the next Defense secretary than anybody else does.",
        "It's extremely rare for the Senate actually to reject a presidential Cabinet nomination.",
        "The last famous case was back in the time of the first George Bush with his Defense secretary nominee John Tower, another former senator.",
        "So it's possible the Republicans might choose to filibuster this nomination.",
        "It's conceivable that Senator Hagel might decide to withdraw, but the odds are he'll be in office as the next Defense secretary.",
        "What did these questions and this hostility that we saw coming from these senators have to do with the actual job of secretary of Defense?",
        "Well, very, very little.",
        "Most of the questions were about the most controversial aspects of Senator Hagel's past positions on American policy towards Israel, about strategy in Iraq, about possible future strategy towards Iran.",
        "Those are all important issues in which the Pentagon is involved, but they're decisions that a president makes.",

        "Those are going to be very important tasks for the next Defense secretary, and they barely came up.",
        "Well, let's move on to another topic in the news this week.",
        "The New York Times was attacked by Chinese hackers, leading to reports of similar Chinese cyberattacks at Bloomberg News and The Wall Street Journal.",
        "Why are the hackers targeting U.S.",
        "newspapers?",
        "There's an immediate reason, which is that both - in the past couple of years, both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal and some others have done very important exposes of the financial empires that many senior members of the Chinese communist government have amassed in the last generation or so.",
        "So that's why they were trying to see if there were sources within China whom the government could then track down.",
        "I think the larger way to see this episode is one more front in the endless and crucial war the Chinese government is waging to control what its people know.",
        "I think on the long run, it's a losing struggle for the government, but that's why they were undertaking these attacks."

        "And it seems like they're taking a little bit of heat for this.",
        "It's possible that people who'd been in New York for a long time, especially during Ed Koch's time as mayor, remember the best side of what he did, which was to be a kind of symbol of peppiness for New York at a time in the late '70s and the early '80s when the whole city really seemed to be in much more trouble than is easy to imagine now.",
