        "We've almost forgotten what a real recovery looks like, what Americans can achieve when we limit government instead of limiting the dreams of our fellow Americans, that's what a real recovery looks like.",
        "Mr. Romney pointed to the plodding pace of job growth over the last few years and the fact that more than 12 million people remain unemployed.",
        "Now, how is it that he's fallen so short of what he's promised?",
