        "She studies cohabitation at the University of Denver and is also a clinical psychologist.",
        "In her 10 years of practice, she's seen a significant increase in the number of people coming to her for help with cohabiting relationships.",

        "That's something that people often don't recognize is that ending a cohabiting relationship is very much like getting a divorce.",
        "And since roughly half of people cohabiting for the first time go on to marry, Rhoades is concerned that eventually a dating couple with issues can become a married couple with issues - potentially even divorce.",
        "The research on whether cohabitation increases the risk for divorce is still being debated, but Rhoades and her colleagues have found that couples who move in together before getting engaged or committing to marry are a little more likely to have lower-quality marriages.",
        "But she doesn't advise people not to cohabit period.",
        "Instead, she says, take the decision seriously.",
        "Make sure you're on the same page.",
        "You know, you don't want to wind up in a relationship where, you know, you think you're moving in together because it's a step toward marriage and you're partner's just thinking she lives closer to where I work.",
