        "(SOUNDBITE FROM FILM, \"\"ZERO DARK THIRTY\"\")",
        "That's a fictionalized account from the movie \"\"Zero Dark Thirty,\"\" but it's based on real events, videos of brutal interrogations existed, but the CIA destroyed them in 2005.",
        "The public learned of that destruction of evidence two years later.",
        "By then, fear of terrorism began to mingle with worry about what had been done to fight it.",
        "In 2009, Senator Dianne Feinstein became chair of the Senate intelligence committee.",
        "Based on a chilling report on the Bush era tactics, the committee voted to launch a full investigation.",
        "The struggle between those responsible for oversight of the CIA and the agency was messy from the start.",
        "The CIA has said very little in public about its take on the dispute, but Feinstein walked through her side of the story, from 2009 to the present, in an extraordinary broadside on the Senate floor last month.",
        "I rise today to set the record straight and to provide a full accounting of the facts and history.",
        "Disputes about the most basic things intruded the moment her committee tried to launch the investigation.",
        "The Senate wanted papers delivered to its offices.",
        "The CIA insisted that staffers come to a secure location in Virginia, a special compartmented intelligence facility known as a skiff.",
        "And there were other issues.",
        "Who had access to the computer system...",
        "And who could see the documents and when.",
        "The CIA insisted that before Senate aides could review the emails and memos and cables, every single item had to be reviewed, first, by a CIA hired contractor.",
        "When Senate aides finally got access to the electronic files, 6.2 million pages in all, they were a disorganized mess.",
        "The documents that were provided came without any index, without any organizational structure.",
        "To wade through the jumble of documents, the Senate asked the CIA for a search tool and when they found something important, they'd hit print and set it aside for later review."

        "And so it went until Senate aides noticed some key documents went missing, erased from their secure computers in that site in Virginia.",
        "The CIA initially denied deleting the documents, but 870 pages had gone missing in February 2010, 50 more that May.",
        "It was an echo of how the torture video tapes had been destroyed years before.",
        "Again, Senator Feinstein.",
        "This type of behavior would not have been possible had the CIA allowed the committee to conduct the review of documents here in the Senate.",
        "In short, this was the exact sort of CIA interference in our investigation that we sought to avoid at the outset.",
        "And until Senator Feinstein laid out this timeline, all of this was playing out behind closed doors and things were just heating up.",
        "Using the CIA search engine, Senate staffers found important notes to former CIA director, Leon Panetta, what came to be known as The Panetta Review.",

        "There are races across the country so close that they are still viewed as toss ups in these final hours.",
        "And there are, of course, big questions about top leadership in both the House and the Senate and the balance of power among governorships.",
        "To get a sense of the shifting landscape, we turn now to Stuart Rothenberg.",
        "He's editor and publisher of the Rothenberg Political Report.",

        "Let's begin with the House and the question of a shift of power there.",
        "In one of your recent reports, you posed this question: Will the House losses be bad or horrendous?",
        "I think you used the word bloodbath in that report.",
        "What's the answer?",
        "How bad will it be?",
        "There will be a bloodbath, I believe.",
        "It all depends on your definitions of this.",
        "But we're talking 1994 levels or larger.",
        "1994 Democrats lost 52 seats in the House.",
        "I think we're talking something above 45.",
        "Probably above 50, possibly above 55.",
        "So these are big numbers.",
        "Now, I ask a question, how bad would it be?",
        "That's of course from the perspective of a Democrat.",
        "For Republicans they have a lot of momentum going into this.",
        "Is this just anger or is it also a smart strategy and prodigious spending on their part?",
        "Well, I think for Republicans, they've seized advantage of this environment, which is about change.",
        "They've resisted some Democratic efforts to pull them into a detailed debate over issues, as they should have.",
        "And wisely tried to make this a referendum on the president on change.",
        "And I check on the Democratic Congress.",
        "That's been the best strategy.",
        "For Republican voters, it's an anger about bigger government, health mandates, more spending.",
        "For Independent voters and swing voters, this election is more about jobs and the economy and promises about getting the economy going again that have not been met.",
        "So, some little different concerns by different voters, but it all adds up to an electorate that wants change.",
        "Are Republicans helped in some way by recent recruiting among Democrats?",
        "The Democrats recruited several more moderate members of their party to run in some of these House races, in Republican leaning districts -districts where they would've had a hard time even without the GOP wave.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "There are now 48 congressional districts that were won by John McCain in 2008, but are held by a Democratic member of Congress.",
        "Those present terrific initial opportunities to Republicans to win back those districts that are basically Republican and basically more conservative.",
        "Let's turn to the Senate, and specifically some of the very tight races in places like Washington state, West Virginia, California, Illinois, Pennsylvania.",
        "What's going on in those races in the final hours?",
        "Well, Democrats are simply trying to hang on and these races are toss up.",
        "Democrats have a slight advantage in California.",
        "Washington, the Democrats had a slight advantage.",
        "Now it looks like a toss up.",
        "Republicans have narrow advantages, I would say, in Illinois and Pennsylvania.",
        "And in the governor's races, the Republicans at one point were talking big numbers, turnovers in 10 or 12 of the state houses.",
        "Are those numbers still possible?"
