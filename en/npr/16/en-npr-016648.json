        "So tell us more about what Congress wants to do about that.",
        "Well, Congress is trying to find a way to make Medicare more efficient, not necessarily by cutting benefits or raising taxes or cutting payments to doctors or hospital, but by creating new systems of care and payment that would reward higher quality care and pay less for care that wouldn't necessarily lead to better health.",
        "Now, that's easy to say but figuring out which kind of care is which is not so easy.",
        "And since all of that care is income to health care providers, there's an awful lot of yelling and screaming going on right now, much of which is scaring seniors.",
