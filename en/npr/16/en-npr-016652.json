        "Yeah.",
        "That's for me one of the most interesting things about the perfume is that you think about the ways in which it encapsulates the history of the last century, right?",
        "It's - because Coco Chanel is pretty clearly anti-Semitic.",
        "I mean, there's not any getting around that.",
