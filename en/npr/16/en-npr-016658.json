        "Since a minute or two after the shooting, several police cars have been driving slowly by, with officers looking at Butler, Drummer and the other neighbors who are out.",
        "You notice how there's no real engagement, right?",
        "You don't see cops getting out the car and talking to people and asking questions.",

        "They tell us a passenger in the van was hit, wounded in the head with the bullet lodged in his skull, behind his ear.",
        "Drummer, Butler and other neighbors express other frustrations over the lack of good jobs in Englewood, the problems with the schools, the easy availability of guns, the dearth of resources for mental illness, and that many residents appear to be caught in a cycle of dependency on drugs and alcohol and reliance on government programs.",
        "These are all huge inner-city problems that at times Drummer and Butler say can seem insurmountable."
