        "Conrad sees big, new problems with the idea of big, new government programs.",

        "They'd have to use a special set of rules known as reconciliation.",
        "Conrad knows this: he just thinks it's a terrible idea.",
        "The rules were built to help senators ratchet down budget deficits, and that's a problem, says Conrad.",
        "He warns that if Democratic leaders use reconciliation rules to pass health care, it will force the Senate to gut the bill like a fish: cutting out the new insurance company regulations, changes for doctors and hospitals, anything that doesn't have to do with the budget.",
        "Now, because Conrad is at the nexus of budget expertise and political centrism, Senate Democratic leaders and committee chairs asked him to device a plan that could pass the Senate and get some Republican votes.",
        "Enter the health care co-op.",
        "This cooperative model would be very competitive, would get 12 million members in very short order, would become the third largest insurer in the country, would provide meaningful competition in the states that now have virtually none…",
        "That's Conrad stumping for the co-op idea on Fox Business Network.",
        "Health care co-ops would be to private insurance companies what credit unions are to private banks.",
        "The co-op would provide health insurance, but it would be a nonprofit business owned by its members.",
        "A big plus, says Conrad, they'd be a lot cheaper in the long-term.",
        "The idea already has support from centrists of both parties.",
        "But it's not gaining Conrad any fans in the more liberal parts of the Democratic Party.",
        "There are a lot of things that can be said about him that are excellent.",
        "This is Charles Chamberlain of the liberal progressive group, Democracy for America.",
        "But the co-op proposal is a political compromise.",
