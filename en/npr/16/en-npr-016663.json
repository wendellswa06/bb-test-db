        "The only cars that come by are the cars that are going to be parking nearby.",
        "On the other hand, there's the problem of having to drive your car almost everywhere.",

        "It is now a prosthetic device.",

        "The era of the cul-de-sac is certainly threatened.",

        "Lucy says the first American cul-de-sacs were built in Radburn, New Jersey in the late 1920s.",
        "By the mid-50s, they were everywhere.",
        "Lucy says developers had learned that cul-de-sacs allowed them to fit more houses into oddly-shaped tracts of land, and build right up to the edge of a river or a property line.",
        "Going over the lines had two problems.",
        "One, it was expensive to try to traverse these obstacles.",
        "But second, it made connections to other neighborhoods or other subdivisions, and that was contrary to the notion of safety.",
        "Lucy says safety has always been a big selling point for cul-de-sacs.",
        "From the beginning, builders noted that they gave fire trucks extra room to turn around in, and they prevented strange cars from speeding past your house on the way to somewhere else.",
        "Early ads for cul-de-sacs often pictured children riding bikes in the streets, he says.",
        "But these days, those images seem grimly ironic to the people who actually look at safety statistics.",
        "For example, according to Lucy, cul-de-sac communities have turned out to have the nation's highest rate of fatal auto accidents involving young children.",
        "Even worse…"
