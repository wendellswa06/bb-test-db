        "These were common, yes.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So in seven minutes, he spoke about one and only one thing, and that was his concern that a military confrontation between the United States, Iran and Israel could take place, A.",
        "But B, potentially escalate into a nuclear conflict.",
        "And that speech was given about 10 days before my friend Jeff Goldberg's articles in the Atlantic came out saying, I, Jeffrey Goldberg, am worried about this as well, in so many words.",
        "Not agreeing with Fidel, but laying out on the basis of his reporting over the last several months the potential, in his view, of such a - of a crisis involving the United States, Iran and Israel, and potentially going nuclear.",
        "So Fidel read the article.",
        "He reads widely.",
        "And I think felt that this was somebody he wanted to hear from more, and so invited Goldberg to come down and talk about just those issues.",
        "And while Fidel's views may not hold much sway in Washington or, perhaps, in Tel Aviv, it is interesting that he told Jeffrey Goldberg he's been speaking about this with the Iranian president, Ahmed Ahmadinejad.",
        "Well, he did mention a discussion that he had with him when Ahmadinejad was in Havana not long after, actually, Fidel got sick.",
        "At the end of 2006, when Cuba then chairing the non-align movement, hosted a very large gathering of leaders from non-aligned countries, including Ahmadinejad.",
        "I think the important part of the discussion with Goldberg - and Jeffrey's blog on the Atlantic goes into a more detail about this and I know he'll write more about it...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...was Fidel's insistence that Ahmadinejad respect Jewish history, respect the Holocaust, respect the state of Israel, and that that clarity with which Fidel communicated that to Goldberg for Ahmadinejad and Iran to hear was really quite important given the stakes and given the concern in the Middle East.",
        "And given, I would say, the standing that Fidel Castro has in the non-aligned movement and for, potentially - I hope at least - those listening in Iran.",
        "And it was interesting that he was pointing out to the Iranian president that, yes, Muslims have had it hard being disrespected by the West, but Jews have had it harder.",
        "Maybe the committee's greatest challenge is predicting who will come to a polling place and what kind of disability they'll have.",
        "Given that any disability could come through the door, task force member Clyde Terry says it's all the more important to purchase voting machines that accommodate as many people as possible.",
        "No."

        "You get it?",
        "Yes, it was very interesting.",
        "I mean, you know, he was - there was no pause when Fidel was expressing his view of Jewish history and also his interest in the Inquisition which, of course, Bibi Netanyahu's father is a great scholar of, as Jeff Goldberg's article explains, it was very clear that there was great sort of sympatico for Jewish history, for the state of Israel from Fidel.",
        "And he made a point of talking about, as Jeff writes, the kind of environment and the Catholic education he received of anti-Semitism in Cuba when he was a small boy.",
        "And he expressed a kind of outrage at the ignorance that that reflected of his own society.",
        "We're talking with Julia Sweig, a senior fellow and director of Latin American Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, who accompanied Jeff Goldberg - excuse me - accompanied the correspondent of The Atlantic for his conversations with Fidel Castro recently in Havana.",
        "You can find a link to those blogs that we've been talking about at npr.org, just click on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "And this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And as he was talking about, Fidel, in that seven-minute speech you referenced, said he was alarmed, not merely worried, that the - at the prospect of war with Iran, and that it might escalate into nuclear war.",
        "And of course, he had firsthand knowledge of one of the most dangerous nuclear incident in history.",
        "Yes, you're talking about the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.",
        "And we talked about the most dangerous day of the Cuban Missile Crisis, October 27th, which is the day on which a very young Fidel Castro - by comparison to his 84 years today - wrote a now-infamous letter to Nikita Khrushchev.",
        "And I'm going to - I won't try to quote this accurately, I don't have it in front me - but essentially saying: if the Americans invade us, which they're likely to do -Fidel was convinced that the United States was planning an invasion - you, Khrushchev, should go ahead and strike first with the nuclear missiles against the United States.",
        "And that was, of course, an enormously inflammatory letter.",
        "And Khrushchev didn't listen to Castro, but from that moment and from the peril and danger of that moment, what I gather and what came out from this interview was this Fidel Castro, the 84-year-old Fidel Castro, being extremely worried that rational people can do irrational things in the heat of the moment, and that President Barack Obama and the other actors on this stage might be pulled into a situation that they don't themselves want to be in but could be, as Fidel Castro was himself.",
        "And that was the alarm that he was expressing, the unintended consequences, if I can try to paraphrase him accurately, the unintended consequences that would come in the aftermath of the imposition of sanctions against Iran.",
        "That was the alarm of which he spoke.",
        "Did you get any sense from him, a reinvigorated Fidel Castro, that he might, well, want to retake the reigns, that he might want to get more involved in Cuban politics?",
        "Not at all.",
        "I mean, I have to say, I spent three days with him.",
        "We were with him on three different occasions, when Jeff was in Havana with me and then Jeff left, and then I sat down and did a separate interview myself with him and then saw him the next day.",
        "So, over the course of a week, there was a lot of time with him.",
        "And I did not see any evidence - and this was both in terms of what he talked about and what he didn't talked about, how he spent his time and how he didn't spend his time - that this is a person who's getting back involved in the nitty-gritty of governance on the island, doing the domestic heavy-lifting of transforming that economy that his brother is doing, nor the conduct actually of foreign policy.",
        "While I was there, Raul Castro was receiving heads of state from Africa.",
        "He was meeting with heads of delegations from political parties in Spain.",
        "He was doing the stuff of foreign relations of a head of state.",
        "But Fidel, by what he didn't say and didn't do, in at least in that week I observed, seemed to be making very clear that those two areas are his brother's domain and not his."

        "Did you go with him to the aquarium?",
        "Yes, I went to the aquarium.",
