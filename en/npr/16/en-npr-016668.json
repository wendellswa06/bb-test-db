        "Mm-hmm.",
        "…was just habits, right?",
        "So, by actually breaking that - I have to admit I'm back on the bean a little bit right now - but by sort of giving up everything, it was just amazing to see - by giving up everything and sort of dropping out of the culture and dropping off the grid, what would emerge.",
        "And we made some really amazing discoveries as a family as a result of that which really made, you know, a great adventure for us.",

        "Well, we inherit so many kind of social rules from the culture.",
        "And when two people come together in a marriage, they, you know, they kind of have agreed to abide by those rules.",
        "And what you don't realize is if you decide you're not going to consume resources, you're kind of breaking the social rules and you have to rebuild the rules of your marriage all over again.",
        "So, it makes for stress, but it also makes for two people actually deciding how they want to live their lives together.",
        "So you get a little bit of stress in their marriage but also the chance to build together and to become closer.",
        "So we had this amazing opportunity to redesign our whole life, to take our whole life apart and redesign it and author it.",
        "And that was pretty exciting.",

        "But I was so worried in 2006 about global warming, I just couldn't keep writing about history anymore.",

        "You didn't play our message, but you are on our show in the midst of this as a result of that piece in the New York Times.",
        "But there was also some unanticipated fallout from that New York Times piece.",
        "Well, sure.",
        "I mean, I think what we were - I kind of didn't realize this when we started, but what we were talking about is that a lot of our problems come from the fact that we consume too much.",

        "So we need to do something about our lifestyle.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "It's pretty insane when you think about it.",

        "I recently had a baby and in doing some research on disposable diapers versus cloth diapers, I found that it could be more of an impact on the environment to use a cloth diaper because of the amount of water and then place it and cleaning them and, you know, introduce detergents.",
        "So what was your environmental goal?",
        "So, Mary, with the cloth diaper versus plastic diaper debate, one of the things we always have to look at when we do this kind of research is who is funding the studies.",
        "And you can believe that it wasn't the cloth diaper people that funded those studies.",
        "And if you think about it, plastic diapers make up just the largest single item that goes into the landfills every day here in the United States.",
        "So we -without looking at the industry-funded studies, we just realized that the best thing environmentally for us to do is to use cloth diapers.",
        "But more importantly, my little girl who is old enough at that stage was able to tell me that she was much more comfortable in them.",
        "And, Michelle Conlin, I don't think there was anything involved in this whole project that drew more double takes and dropped jaws than the no toilet paper.",
        "No.",

        "We should be talking about the fact that we're simply cutting down too many trees.",
        "And it's just fascinating to me how people want to focus on this whole toilet paper (unintelligible), which is if you think about it, it's a giant distraction, right?",
        "It's a giant distraction from the real issue, which is that there's an environmental crisis going on.",
        "And I want us to talk about and put our energy into tackling that, and to get away from this culture of distraction that we're sensationalizing something like a toilet paper thing.",
        "Well, it's - I have to say that some people - you said it in the film when - just after that scene in which Colin talks to Isabella about that wonderful, in fact, you say, some people are going to hear this thing about no toilet paper and just think you're a whack job."

        "Yeah.",
