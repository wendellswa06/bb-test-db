        "Well, that sounds like a reasonable argument, but not necessarily one that would hold up in terms of who owns the doll.",

        "And Mattel, is it saying that Bratz is cutting into its sales of Barbie?",
        "And those sales, objectively, have been down 12 percent over this last year.",
        "Those have been down.",
        "Several years ago it was a much worse case between Bratz and Barbie, that they were more heavily at war.",
        "But one thing that Bratz has done is it's opened the door for a number of other competitors - like the Hannah Montana doll - which have kind of cut into Barbie's share.",
        "There's also the case that kids want iPods and consumer electronics right now, which is part of the reason, too, that you saw the big decline here in the U.S.",
        "Well, there's one twist in this and that's that the designer, Carter Bryant, has settled with Mattel.",
        "What does that mean in terms of this case?",
        "Is that good for Mattel theoretically or good for MGA?",
        "Well, one thing that's changed is the mix of people who are in the trial.",
        "It used to be the case that it was Mattel, MGA and Carter Bryant.",
        "And there was a sympathetic character, being Carter Bryant there, who could look like that he was being picked on by Mattel."

        "So I don't think it's certain she'll get what she wants.",
        "Isn't this the country that provides North Korea with a lot of its food and other essential supplies?",
        "Well, it does, but it fears that if it simply cuts them off in an attempt to use its leverage, there'll be absolute pandemonium inside North Korea and (unintelligible) the refugees."
