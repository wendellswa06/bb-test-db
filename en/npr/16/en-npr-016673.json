        "Forty percent of the oceans are seriously impacted by human activity.",
        "Tell us what that means, how bad - is that so bad or not so bad?",
        "Well, I found it quite surprising.",
        "When you look at individual activities - climate change, fishing, pollution - you get only a partial picture of what's going on.",
        "And when you actually overlay all of these different activities onto the ocean to get the big picture, you finally get a sense of the whole cumulative impact that humans are having on the oceans.",
        "And as you said in the introduction, it is a vast ocean.",
        "And to have over 40 percent of it being heavily impacted in a degraded state, that to me is quite alarming."

        "Where are some of the worst places?",
        "By far, the biggest impacted places are in the North and Norwegian seas, around great Britain and Norway, and in the South and East China seas, which are in Indonesia, Malaysia and around the Chinese and Japanese coastal waters.",
        "When you say impact, is that like a cumulative score of different kinds of insults…",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "So it's the sum - it's a process of pulling together the impact of all of these different activities that we included in our analysis and accounting for the way that the different marine ecosystems at those locations respond to those different activities.",
        "Summing that all up into a single score that gives you a sense of the relative impact of one place, or the relative condition of one place, to any place else on the planet.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Jane Lubchenco, you also had some work published in the journal Science this week, documenting a dead zone that's appearing off the coast of Oregon.",
        "Tell us about that.",
        "One of the surprising impacts that climate change appears to be having are changes, not only on ocean temperatures and in the acidity of oceans, but also changes in ocean circulation and in coastal winds.",
        "What we've documented off the coast of Oregon is now in six of the last six years - the appearance of a zone of low oxygen and sometimes even no oxygen, appearing in the summertime.",
        "This is unprecedented.",
        "The paper that we published shows the 60-year time record of data of dissolved oxygen, showing that this is really anomalous for the Pacific Northwest coasts.",
        "And it's quite surprising and startling.",
        "So these are zones of low oxygen that are created by changes in the coastal winds that affects the upwelling dynamics, the delivery of nutrients to the surface ocean and result in massive blooms of microscopic plants, which when they decay and the bacteria decompose them, they use up all the oxygen in the water.",
        "So the bottom line is there is insufficient oxygen for most animals.",
        "And if they can't swim away, which some of the fish can certainly do, then they suffocate."

        "It disappears in the fall, when the winds switch around to being more down willing, favorable.",
        "So it's just a seasonal phenomenon.",
        "So you can predict it now, when it will come and go.",
        "Yes.",
        "Actually, when - now that we know enough about the dynamics, we can look at what the coastal ones are doing, and have some ability to anticipate.",
        "But if you look globally at other similar ecosystems around the world - the Humboldt Current system of Peru and Chile, the Benguelan Current system of Namibia and South Africa, the Canary Current system of Morocco - each of those has similar dynamics.",
        "They're all coastal, ocean upwelling ecosystems that collectively represent 1 percent of the surface area of the oceans, but have historically provided 20 percent of the fisheries.",
        "And they're all changing in ways that are surprising.",
        "This increased appearance of zones of low oxygen, no oxygen, spreading, becoming more chronic, is indeed a surprise.",
        "Would you think that this is just - you mentioned other areas that you think we're going to see more of these areas blossoming, so to speak."
