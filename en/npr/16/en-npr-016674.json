        "Well, I think that the case study in the southeast U.S.",

        "The per-person loading of sewage effluence, for example, has been reduced by a factor of 10.",
        "Unfortunately, the population has grown by a factor of 10 during the same interval.",
        "The key issues are non-point source pollution.",
        "And in the southeast U.S., 60 percent of that is over land, 40 percent is atmospheric.",

        "Off the east coast of the United States, that population is in danger of extinction.",
        "Actually, it's going extinct now.",
        "The catch, which always overshot the quota up until about five years ago is now really going through the floor.",
        "In the last couple of years, they've caught only 10 percent or less of the quota.",
        "Meanwhile, on the eastern half of the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean, they are overfishing the quota wildly.",
        "I mean, it's just uncontrolled fishing there.",
        "The quotas, on both sides of the ocean, have been much too high for a long time.",
        "But in the east, there's also no enforcement.",
        "The overcapacity is incredible.",
        "So, over there, I think in the next few years, it will start collapsing.",
        "Here, it's already collapsing, and those fish really are going extinct at this point.",
        "It's not to say that they will go extinct, but at this trend, they are declining very rapidly toward extinction, and there are very few juveniles coming out of the spawning area in the Gulf of Mexico.",
        "And every year, during the spawning season, there are still fishing gear in there that is killing the last few of these giant animals that are there, aggregating in order to spawn.",
        "And while they're spawning, they're getting killed.",
        "Is this the sushi problem?",
