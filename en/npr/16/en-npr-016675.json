        "And it's not an election.",
        "They don't need to see that 51 percent of people are buying only sustainable fish for it to make a difference, because what happens in the market is 2 percent of people are buying only sustainable fish.",
        "So, some small marketer says I want to capture 2 percent of the market.",
        "I'm going to market only to those people who are interested.",

        "We already have 10 percent of the market ourselves.",
        "We don't want eight.",
        "So, we'll compete, we'll start selling only sustainably sourced fish.",
        "And it's at the point, actually, where even Wal-Mart - of all the things that can afford to lose market share - has announced that in five years, it will sell only sustainably sourced fish.",
        "So, this small effort for people who have fish guides, like my group puts out, or go to the Web site and look for sources of sustainable fish, is really making a difference.",
        "Now, Wal-Mart is big enough that they can go and demand that the people who are producing for them, like the shrimp farmers who are doing terrible things to the waters in Southeast Asia and in South America, that they do things a lot better so that they can have a source that Wal-Mart can come up with and say this meets the standards that we're going to be implementing over the next five years.",
        "Whether they really will do that and how well it will work remains to be seen.",
        "But where we are now with that compared to where we were five or 10 years is really quite a big difference based on just a few people, relatively, who have said somewhat publicly, you know, we are ordering only sustainably caught fish.",
        "We're going to ask the waiter and we're going to talk to the chef.",
        "And it gets known, and it makes a difference.",
        "And if you want sources of information, you can go to our Web site, blueocean.org.",
        "We have, you know, we have a list that evaluates these things.",

        "While they do have a lot of bite catch, there's also a lot of inadvertent catch in small scale subsistence kinds of fisheries in various parts of the world as well.",
        "So I think that's really an important concern, and I guess the key thing to remember is that if fishermen are targeting a fish that reproduces, that matures at age two and they inadvertently catch something like a loggerhead sea turtle that matures at age 30, there's no win for a loggerhead in that kind of setting because the fishing intensity is driven by the animal that matures at age 2.",
