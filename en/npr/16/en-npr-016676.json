        "You know, it's interesting because the public is still enraptured with the documentaries that show the beautiful ocean.",
        "The problem is there is less and less of that beautiful ocean around.",
        "Public - people get tired of seeing the gloom and doom pictures of the ocean, but scientists confront that every day.",
        "And I guess the point that we're trying to make is that people need to look beyond that blue veneer and recognize that the ocean has places, it has habitats, it has organisms on which we depend.",
        "And so, sustainable fishery isn't something that would be nice to do.",
        "It's something that's necessary to do to support so many of the people that depend on marine fish as their primary source of protein.",
        "All right.",

        "Have you got some for us?",
        "I do think we have a lot of, well, maybe not good news but good opportunity to address some of these issues.",
        "It comes back to a point that Larry just made that there are places in the oceans.",
        "And what we did, by mapping all of these different human activities onto the oceans is reveal that it's not a single, uniform distribution of the impact of its activities.",
        "It's very patchy.",
        "There are high impact places.",
        "There are very low impact places.",
        "And that presents opportunity to think about how to protect or manage well those places that remain in relatively low impact, and think about effective strategies for mitigating the places that are receiving high impact.",
        "And so the opportunity is there because of this patching nature of the impacts that we're having.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Do we have any success stories?",
        "What about the Great Barrier Reefs…",
        "Well, exactly…",
        "…in Australia.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And Jane mentioned just earlier that, you know, like in the Great Barrier Reef and in California, these networks of MPAs, where you set aside some of the ocean for fish to recover from fishing, allows success.",
        "These fish come back, the communities become more resilient and healthy.",
        "And that's just to address the issue of fishing.",
        "And there are opportunities to regulate land use, activities to limit pollution.",
        "And there have been many examples of that that have improved the health of waters in coastal areas.",
        "So there are many examples of success stories.",

        "Anybody?",
        "Larry?",
        "I would say, you know, compared to effects that we know to be important, like the impacts of fishing, coastal pollution and so on, this will be a very small treatment.",
        "It'll be at a local scale.",
        "And so compared to the issues that were raised, again, in Ben Halpern's paper, about climate change and so on, it strikes me as a fairly small concern relative, in fact, an unknown concern relative to things that we know to be seriously problematic.",
        "I wanted to add a comment about the Great Barrier Reef, because what they've done there goes beyond a network of marine reserves.",
        "What they've done is fully zone, for different human uses, the entire Great Barrier Reef.",
        "And so they're taking into account not just the impact of fishing, but all the various human activities that people want to conduct in the Great Barrier Reef.",
        "Some 30,000 people were involved in making comments on that plan.",
        "And so it's one of the most comprehensive.",
        "It is the most comprehensive ocean zoning plan in the world.",
        "And if you stretch that reef out along the Pacific Coast of the United States, it goes from Washington to Southern California.",
        "So it's a big area.",
        "And what they've done there, I think, shows a way for the rest of us to consider the implementation of this ecosystem approach."

        "Yes.",
        "My name is Dick Russell and I'm the author of a book called \"\"Striper Wars: An American Fish Story,\"\" which is in part the story of how the Atlantic stripe bass made a tremendous comeback after the mid-1980s, when a five-year moratorium was placed on fishing, the kind that Carl Safina was calling for today for bluefin tuna.",
        "But it's also the story of how today, the stripers are in trouble again, and especially in the Chesapeake Bay area, because their main food source, the menhaden, are being overfished by a big company out of Reedville, Virginia, that turns these fish and reduces them into fish meal and fish oil.",
        "And in New England, the herrings are being overfished tremendously - again, a forage species - by these big factory trollers.",
        "And the bluefin tuna, for example, aren't getting enough to eat here.",
        "I wonder if the panel could address the importance of forage fish which is generally been overlooked in the past, and also of course as part of the need for ecosystem management.",
        "All right, Larry, you're shaking your head violently.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "You know, I think you're absolutely right.",
        "And one of the problems with…",
        "What is a forage fish?",
        "A forage fish, you know, basically, we use that term for a perfectly self-respectable fish that gets eaten by another fish that we care more about.",
        "So…",
        "These giant schools of fishes?",
        "We call it forage fish because something we care about eats it.",
        "They don't think of themselves as forage fish.",
        "That's not their purpose in life.",
        "But I guess the key thing is that most of fisheries management has focused on species of interest like stripe bass or like menhaden as if they don't relate to each other."

        "And one of the things that we're keenly aware of now is that ocean food webs are tightly related, and that removal of upper predators has a big impact on things below it in the food web.",
        "Daniel Pauly coined the term, fishing down marine food webs, which makes it clear from the data that gradually, we've mined off the upper level, trophic levels from these food webs and worked our way down into the forage fishes.",
        "The controversy over stripe bass and menhaden is because we're fishing two trophic levels.",
        "So we want both the predatory fish and the food of the predatory fish.",
        "And who gets the fish is an allocation problem.",
        "Should the menhaden fisherman get them or should the stripe bass get them.",
        "But it's clear, we're pushing ocean food webs too hard, too fast, and we have to deal with those kinds of conflicts.",
        "And I think your case is an important one because it points about the connectedness of these systems.",
        "Carl and then Jane, comment.",
        "Fishery management has approached things in a sense backwards by always asking what's the most we can take out.",
        "And so it's like what's the most herring we can take out, where, really, the question is how much do we need to leave in, and why do we need to leave it in?",
        "And why do we need to leave it in?",
        "We need to leave it in to spawn more herring, but we also need to leave it in because we want to have tuna fisheries or we want to have stripe bass.",
        "So we have to consider these things.",
        "And really, fishery management just needs to be sort of flipped upside down to ask the question in a different way to get what we need.",
        "Jane?",
        "The question posed also raises issues related to aquaculture, because much of the act of fishing that's going on for these forage fish, small pelagic fishes, is used to convert into fishmeal, which in turn is used to grow salmon, in many cases, shrimp, cod, other species, especially higher trophic level species that are being farmed.",
        "And it does raise some very fundamental issues.",
        "As aquaculture grows in value and importance, and is seen increasingly as an important mechanism for feeding a growing, burgeoning human population, there really needs to be much more careful thought given to what levels of fishing are sustainable in the ocean that support this aquaculture enterprise.",
        "And many of the seafood watch cards - Carl has mentioned his, the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Environmental Defense - have other seafood choice cards that alert consumers to what is sustainably caught or farmed."
