        "They can be if they're done properly.",

        "And if so, if they believe that was an effective means of dealing with dumping plastics at sea?",

        "It is still the case, legally, as far as I know.",
        "And I'm not sure whether I think that that's an effective way of dealing with it because just grinding it into very small particles makes it available to become a different problem to different kinds of organisms.",

        "They see that local efforts have been - bear fruit in reducing - there was moratorium put on the horseshoe crab fishing, things like that.",

        "And so since we don't have to necessarily pay all the costs of these things in our time, some people feel that, you know, it's just better to go and get what you can get while you can get it.",
        "That's, I think, one of the main disconnects.",
        "It's not a question of science versus non-science so much as it's a question of short-term thinking versus long-term thinking.",
        "And as the science usually tends to lead us toward more of the long-term thinking, and that's why it's sometimes not really lined up with the politics, because the politics is what people now are thinking and doing.",
        "But there are a lot of people who should be in the political debate who are not in the political debate.",
        "And those are - all of the unborn people who are about to come in the next generation, and for all the other generations.",
        "If they were here to speak on their own behalf, the politics would be very different around these issues.",
        "They'd have something very different to say than the people who are saying, well, for right now, I'd make more money catching more fish.",

        "And there's a thing called the tragedy of the commons that has to do with what happens if, you know, if you - if everybody is a sheep farmer and you put more than your share of sheep in the meadow and everybody does that, the meadow gets overgrazed and everything gets wrecked.",
