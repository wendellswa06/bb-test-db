        "So it's unclear why the prices in Trump Tower have dropped so significantly.",
        "O'BRIEN: Some people have attributed it to the fact that people don't want to be in the same building with the Trumps now for a variety of reasons, not necessarily even a political - it's just a pain in the neck to be in a building that the Secret Service and the New York Police Department are routinely locking down.",
