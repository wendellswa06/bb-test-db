        "The Red Cross has fired two senior supervisors and a third volunteer, in response to allegations of fraud and mismanagement.",
        "All worked with hurricane victims in Louisiana until yesterday.",
        "A Red Cross spokeswoman says the group will refer the cases to authorities next week for possible criminal prosecution.",
        "NPR's Howard Berkes has details.",
        "Actually, details are lacking, because the Red Cross won't release them.",
        "Here's what spokeswoman Carrie Martin is saying.",
        "Three people were relieved from duty because Red Cross investigators determined that accusations against them, specifically related to waste and abuse, were substantial enough to remove them from duty immediately.",
        "We do anticipate criminal referrals this week.",
        "This is a pending investigation and I can't comment any further.",
        "The cases do seem related to an internal report, dated December 5th, naming at lest two of the three people disciplined yesterday.",
        "The report was produced by criminal attorney Jerome Nickerson and security guard Michael Walters, who served as Red Cross volunteers in and around New Orleans.",
        "They found evidence that truck loads of relief supplies from one Red Cross center were swapped with supplies from another without proper paperwork.",
        "That's a recipe for theft, says Jerome Nickerson.",
        "We obtained statements from volunteers that they were engaged in swapping, that they were submitting fraudulent greenies, the requisition forms to obtain materials for swaps.",
        "And when we attempted to locate what happened to these swapped goods, we couldn't find what happened to them.",
        "And the concerns become products that have a high black market interest: coffee, canned meats, things like this were being taken into the black market.",
        "Nickerson and Walters recommended dismissal of the supervisors involved.",
        "But that didn't occur until yesterday, more than three months later.",
        "The Red Cross won't explain the delay.",
        "But Nickerson says the report was initially ignored.",
        "When we attempted to close in, people were threatened, investigations were blocked, and ultimately, my partner and myself were removed from New Orleans.",
        "At the end of Savall's performances, musicians intone a plea for peace based on a melody known across the Mediterranean, in Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Armenian and Ladino."

        "This - we're trying to expand this conversation.",

        "This is fairly inspiring.",
        "I mean, it sounds like what you've motivated people to do is say, no, I think you're wrong, but let me tell you what's right.",
        "And that's probably a pretty good feeling.",
        "It is a very good feeling.",
        "And I feel like we've woken people up to look at things that are in their daily musical life and see them in a different way.",
        "I think that sometimes girl singers got marginalized as, oh, that's the girl singer with this incredible producer and these amazing musicians and songwriters.",
        "Well, we've had a few conversations about voice as a form of authorship."
