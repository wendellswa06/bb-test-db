        "He was a technologist by training.",
        "But he also knew how to install satellite dishes, and so when the revolution started and became a full-blown civil war, he managed to set up a satellite connection, and using a live-streaming system, he started broadcasting to the world, telling people who was going on.",
        "And he quickly developed a reputation as being one of the best sources for information as to what was going on, even before Western reporters got inside the country.",
        "An advocate or a reporter?",
        "In his case, he was both.",
        "He focused really hard on getting factual information out as best he could, and you could see him struggle with it live sometimes when he'd get contradictory information.",
        "But at the same time, he was a civilian.",
        "He was literally in the crosshairs.",
        "He knew that his city was about to be bombed, and he wanted to make sure that he could document what was going on.",
        "And so if there was any question about a ceasefire violation, the world would know about it, and ultimately he ended up dying several hours before the NATO bombing raids started and as he went out one last time to try to document the ceasefire violation."

        "And that's precisely what happened.",
        "As soon as Benghazi was taken over by the rebels, he was able to set up and maintain a single satellite connection near the Benghazi courthouse, and volunteers would even try to protect him to make sure that no one could come near the entrance of the building because it was so important that they kept that single feed going.",
        "And that ended up becoming Libya Alhurra TV, as they called it, or essentially Free Libya TV.",
