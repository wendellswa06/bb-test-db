        "I mean, in Joe Simon's case, you've got the creator, with Jack Kirby, of \"\"Captain America.\"\" And I think one of the really apt things is that before his death he got to see the character he created become a success on screen, as well as in the comics.",

        "Same thing, too, with Jerry Robinson.",
        "Yes, a contributor to the golden age, but a crucial figure in a silver age.",
        "Yeah.",

        "And that grew out of Joe's original inspiration.",
        "Again, Archie and Walter's work on \"\"Manhunter\"\"; I read those books with a passion because they were reinterpreting this idea in a modern setting, much as writers have been doing with Captain America all along.",

        "So he found himself going down lines in the comics that put him against the establishment.",
