        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "And my personal memory reflecting on her death has been in the empowerment in birth of so many women who attribute their success in their major right of passage to midwives like Abby, and how many midwives have been trained by Abby as well and have been inspired as midwives and professionals and community leaders in her community.",
