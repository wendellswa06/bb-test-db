        "Yeah, in 1951, when they took her cells, we didn't even have the concept of informed consent that we have today.",
        "So they were doing research on people, you know, that varied from - you know, taking of tissue samples was absolutely standard, but so was doing things like injecting people with radioactive material to see whether - what kind of harm that would do.",

        "If you didn't have money to go to a hospital, you went into these public wards.",

        "And one of the things - oh, uh-huh?",
        "But in the beginning, the doctor who grew her cells, George Guy, just gave them all away for free.",
        "Anyone who wanted to use them in research, he would just, you know, put some in a test tube and send them off.",
        "And it wasn't until several years later that people started actually mass-producing them.",
        "There was a factory set up where they were grown, to the tune of about six trillion cells a week and sent out to labs around the world.",
        "And that's when they started being actually sold for profit.",
        "And that happened in the beginning, really, just to allow science to move forward.",
        "You know, for scientists, growing cells took so much work that they could not - they couldn't get much research done.",
        "It was sort of like if you had to build a microscope from scratch every time you wanted to look through it.",
        "And so the selling of cells was really just sort of for the sake of science, and there weren't a lot of profits.",
        "But, of course, now that's sort of a different story.",
        "But there's no way you could trace how much was actually made off of HeLa cells.",
        "Today, you can - anyone can go online and buy a vial of HeLa cells for about $250, or you can buy products made using them for up to, like, $10,000 a vial.",
        "And there's a lot of sort of discussion about, okay, so what of that is HeLa cells?",
        "You know, if you'd taken Henrietta's cancer and put it on a table, it would have died.",
        "It took innovation and various, you know, other things to make the cells grow, but obviously, they needed the cells in the first place.",
        "So teasing out how much of that was HeLa and how much of it was everything else is pretty tough."
