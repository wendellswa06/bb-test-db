        "There's this extraordinary moment in your book where - this is before the big factory, with the six trillion cells a day.",
        "This is a moment where they set up a smaller factory to replicate her cells at the Tuskegee Institute.",
        "This is at the height of polio research, and they need these cells to test the vaccine that's going to save, well, many, many, many people's lives.",
        "Yet at the same time, getting back to that racism part of this, upstairs at the Tuskegee Institute, the syphilis experiment is still going on.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's an amazing moment in the history of science.",
        "Here, the Tuskegee syphilis studies are one of the most famous sort of unethical studies done in this country, where black men with syphilis were essentially studied to watch how syphilis killed them from infection to death, without being offered treatment once it was available.",
        "And that was happening on the same campus, yes, right, like, down the hall from where there was this first factory set up to grow HeLa cells.",
        "And at the time, no one knew that Henrietta was black.",
        "So they didn't know these cells had come from a black woman.",
        "And what's interesting is that the first HeLa production center set up at Tuskegee was actually - the reason it was at Tuskegee was because there was one, a black man who was on the board of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis who really fought for it to be at Tuskegee because of the prestige that would come with it, the jobs it would bring to black scientists.",
        "So at the same time you have this very prestigious, you know, cell production factory going on that these cells are going out all over the world and literally saving - helping to save millions of lives, white people, you know, everyone, at a time when, you know, black people couldn't even drink out of the same drinking fountains.",
        "So here you had black scientists at an all-black institution using a black woman's cells to save millions of white people who wouldn't have let them sit next to them, and who had no idea that any - that there was any role that black people were playing in the production of the vaccine.",
        "We're talking with Rebecca Skloot about \"\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.\"\" And we want to hear from people on both sides of the equation.",
        "If you'd made - signed one of those consent forms that allows your tissue to be used or your blood to be used for research or if you work with HeLa cells, give us a call: 800-989-8255.",

        "And while he was on the operating table in Boston on a 14-hour procedure, a fellow came to us and asked us for consent to take the CNF fluid and tumor samples, as well as surrounding tissue samples and use them in what they were hoping would be the largest low-grade glioma brain tumor study in the world.",
        "And my wife's a health care professional, and her first reaction was emotional, and she said absolutely not.",
        "And my reaction was we absolutely have to do this because every advance that has come to treat our child and to save his life has come from these studies, from these samples and tests that have gone before us.",
        "And, you know, after this fellow did a fantastic job of, you know, talking through the details and getting rid of the emotion, my wife was willing to sign the consent.",
        "It's interesting listening to your guest today, though.",
        "I wonder if these cells have been sold or something now.",
        "But the other thing we did, we also - we had a baby on the way, and we cord-banked and packed all of the umbilical cord cells from our next-born and are storing them for the potential treatment for himself, as well as his brother.",

        "And 50 years from now, who knows what that's going to mean?",
        "And so despite the fact that, you know, she was initially identified, you know, or that her name was released, if her name hadn't been released, I mean, people still do have concerns about the cells being used in research.",
        "So it's not just about her identity, but that definitely gave us the ability to talk about her story.",
