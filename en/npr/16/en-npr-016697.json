        "Before we had HeLa cells, we couldn't culture human or animal cells.",
        "It wasn't possible.",
        "So we could never study cancers.",
        "We could never study skin grafting.",
        "We couldn't study things that have brought us and saved so many lives today.",
        "We just couldn't get these cells to survive in culture.",
        "Henrietta Lacks' cells provided us with a tool that never - that we would have waited another 10 years to develop.",

        "Thank you.",

        "And it's pretty astonishing the personal response that people have to this story.",
        "There are, you know, probably thousands and thousands of scientists who use HeLa cells in their labs, who feel very personally connected to them.",
        "There are so many people out there who, you know, I'm alive - certain people are saying, you know, I'm alive today because I took this drug that was developed using HeLa cells, or my mother is because she did.",
        "A lot of people assume that scientists are sort unhappy about this story being out there.",
        "I think they expect that scientists will be mad that I've sort of outed them about any of this.",
        "And, in fact, what I hear overwhelmingly from researchers is just gratitude.",
        "And they say, you know, I've been using these cells in my research my whole career.",
        "I feel like I owe a lot of my professional to them.",
        "In a lot of cases, they just say I never stopped to think about where they came from or whether she gave permission.",
        "And they're really glad to know.",
        "And I often get calls from scientists, saying, you know, and I worked with this other cell line, you know, MCS-72.",
        "Do you know who those came from?",
        "And so I think I could probably spend a lot of years trying to find - write books about other cell lines now, too, which I'm not doing.",
        "It's interesting.",
        "We mentioned that started in a community college biology class.",
        "And you were a little befuddled by the scientific terms.",
        "You understood right away that there was a great story with Henrietta Lacks.",
        "Your penance for finding out this great story is you've had to learn an awful lot about biology."

        "I had no interest in becoming a writer.",
        "So my interest in HeLa cells really initially was as a science person.",
        "But at the same time, I just sort of became obsessed with this question of who was she, and did she have any kids, and what did they think about all this stuff that was done with her cells.",
        "And then eventually, when I got interested in writing, yeah, I sort of went down that path.",
        "And I think some would say my penance was the - you know, it took me about 12 years to write the book and to do all the research and find everything.",
        "So, yeah, I spent many years trying to sort of uncover the story of both the science and the person behind it all.",

        "But I want to follow up on what the prior caller had mentioned, and that's even to this day, I want to make sure that it's clear, even to this day, if tissue is collected for clinical purposes and then used for research, and if that tissue is going to be otherwise discarded, it can be used for research without any kind of consent or without the patient knowing that their tissue was used for a cell culture.",
        "And up to this point, up to this last caller, the impression was being given that times have changed.",
        "And in that case, as long as there's no patient identifiers being revealed, tissue that is otherwise going to be discarded can be used for research.",
        "Right, absolutely.",
        "And that's - you know, it's a big source of debate right now, you know.",
        "There's - I think people for the most part do not know that that's what's going on, and one of the things that's been pretty amazing to me in traveling around talking about the book is just the volume of people who say we're not okay with that.",
        "The general response from the public is this research is important.",
        "We want this research to happen.",
        "We just want to know.",
        "And there's actually, after my book came out, there started to be some studies about people's attitudes towards research being done on their tissues without consent, and overwhelmingly, it matches up with what I've been seeing on my book tour.",
        "There was one study that found that 76 percent of people didn't know that their tissues were being stored for research, and that of the people who did know, only eight percent had found out from their health care providers.",
        "The rest of them found out in other ways.",
        "And one study, which I think is sort of amazing, is that 76 percent of parents said that they were very or somewhat willing to allow their children's samples to be stored for research if they were asked permission.",
        "But if they weren't asked permission, that went down to about 25 percent saying that they would allow it.",
        "So people really are starting to say, you know, we do want you to ask.",
        "And we're also seeing a lot of lawsuits that are sort of emphasizing that point, where people are actually suing over their tissues being used without consent."

        "But then, you know, we also know, well, we can actually find out people's identity from these samples.",

        "He would sell his blood products.",
        "And that was how he was able to support himself.",
        "Because he would get sick with hemophilia, he would have these attacks - that he couldn't work.",
        "And - but at the same time, he really did want his - this valuable, you know, product that his body produced to do something good for science.",
        "So he tracked down this one researcher who he believed would be the most likely to develop the hepatitis B vaccine.",

        "And, you know, and that - one of the - some of the resistance to talking about tissue rights and giving - letting people know when their tissues are being used or when they are commercially valuable, one of the big, historically, the reason that some people have been resistant to that is basically, well, people are going to hold out for profits.",
        "They're going to interfere with the progress of science.",
        "And we sort of, historically, that hasn't been the case.",
        "And, you know, people like Ted Slavin have behaved in that way.",
        "And, you know, one of the things that's tough about this issue is - and the previous caller mentioned this - that, you know, science benefits, it's sort of there's this attitude that everyone owes it to science to donate tissues and let this research be done, consent or not, because everyone benefits.",
        "But in fact, of course, in our country not everyone does benefit, because we don't all have access to health care.",
        "And I guess you've gone through what might be described as the five stages of Lance.",
        "So you get situations like Henrietta's family, where this one woman did so much for science yet her family doesn't access to health care because they can't afford health insurance, so they don't benefit from the advances made using their mother's cells.",
        "So, often this idea of universal benefit is really what the discussion comes down to."
