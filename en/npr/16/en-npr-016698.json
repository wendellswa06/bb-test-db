        "And let's see if we get one more call in.",
        "This is Mary, Mary with us from Portland.",
        "Hi.",
        "I was wondering, you discussed a lot about the issues of using someone's cells for medical research.",
        "But when I was reading the book, it seemed like there was a lot of parallel issues for using someone's story, even when people would benefit by reading the story learn stuff.",
        "I was wondering if you - how much you had thought about this, particularly early on in your research, when the family was more reluctant to talk to you.",
        "Yes, a lot.",
        "And this is something - yeah, the book is about many different things.",
        "It's about the importance of sharing information with the public or scientists being able to talk to people.",
        "It's about research ethics.",
        "It's also, in a lot of ways, about the ethics of journalism.",
        "You know, I tell the story of many writers, journalists of other kinds who came along before me, and had impacts on the family.",
        "And I did wrestle with that quite a bit as I was working on the book.",
        "You know, it took me about a year and a half to convince them to even talk to me because of all that they've been through.",
        "And along the way, part of how I convinced them to talk to me, was by telling Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, in particular, you know, you can come with me when I do my research.",
        "I'm not trying to hide anything from you.",
        "And she really wanted to learn about her mother and these cells, so she would.",
        "She would come with me.",
        "And because of that, she ended up in a situation she wouldn't have been in otherwise, and some of them - I mean, she very much wanted this information.",
        "But in some cases, she wasn't necessarily prepared for what we found.",
        "And I really wrestled with that.",
        "And, you know, in some certain situations, it became very dangerous for her.",
        "I mean, she came very close to having to a stroke at one point during the research process, because of some of the stress involved with some of the information we found.",
        "And a lot of how I dealt with that was by putting it in the book.",
        "And so that is the reason, in a sense, that the story of Deborah and I is in the book and - as a sort of sense of disclosure.",
        "That's all.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "I just have to pack it up.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But, Mary, thank you very much for the call.",

        "And we want to thank Rebecca Skloot for her time today.",

        "This week marks the anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks.",
        "And while al-Qaida remains a threat to the United States, the Islamic State or ISIS is clearly the terror group that's grabbing headlines right now.",
        "The effort to combat the militant group is likely to require coordination from intelligence agencies, but confronting the ISIS threat is somewhat different than post-9/11 efforts to shut down al-Qaida.",
        "Former CIA field officer Robert Baer says right after 9/11, intelligence agencies shifted their focus to technical collection.",
        "Collecting on cell phones, running algorithms through them, determining who was in al-Qaida, who was in the Taliban.",
        "And in this, you know - integrating this with the drone photography from cameras because they turned away from human sources.",
        "The enemy was up in the tribal areas of Pakistan where officers couldn't go up there, just impossible.",
        "Well, now the terrorist group that, of course, is most prominent that most people are concerned about is ISIS.",
        "How distinct are they from al-Qaida and do these two different groups require a different approach?",
        "Well, it's night and day with ISIS.",
        "First of all, they're technologically head and shoulders above al-Qaida.",
        "They are dealing in communication systems, encrypted communications systems.",
        "In fact, it's the same encryption the United States government has.",
        "It's almost impossible to pin down their location.",
        "So how do you get ahead of them?",
        "To get ahead of them - I don't know that we can get ahead of them.",
        "What we're left with is essentially invasions or turning the locals against them.",
        "I think it's dismal what our intelligence is.",
        "When I first came into the CIA, you could go everywhere, talk to everyone.",
        "And it was pretty good.",
        "But then again, it was easy in those days.",
        "Today, it's virtually impossible to penetrate these groups.",
        "You look at the ISIS hostage takers.",
        "How do you get inside that group?",
        "Fine.",
        "You could take somebody and, you know, send them to Syria hoping they could join.",
        "But chances are they would be found out and executed.",
        "And no one is going to make that decision to send somebody in to try this.",
        "Well, I was going to say - 'cause it seems like it might be easier to infiltrate ISIS because of the fact that they use Western recruits."

        "And the way he could prove that he was black enough was - to some people - was to go - appoint a black police director.",
        "What he did instead was hold, you know, at heart, a technocrat, and he did what technocrats do.",
        "He recognized that crime was probably and still is Newark's foremost problem, everything derives from that.",
        "He conducted a nationwide search for the best possible police director, all signs pointed to the success of the New York Police Department during the Guiliani years.",
        "So he went east, 10 miles and picked probably the top cop in the NYPD who happened to be a white Irish man from the Bronx.",
        "And it caused all manner of upset in Newark, but they - the two of them pressed forward and they are beginning to show some positive results.",
        "At the same time, though, the model of - or at least, some of the approaches of New York policing included some very controversial fatalities, you know, Amadou Diallo and Patrick Dorismond…",
