        "Now is the time for all of us to show solidarity with the people of Darfur, not only in words, but also in action.",
        "Horace, what's the significance of these talks?",
        "The significance of these talks remain the commitment of sections of the African Union as one could see in the pedantic work of Salim Ahmed Salim, the efforts of African civil society to bring peace.",
        "And Ahmed Salim Salim and United Nations have been working pedantically so that the war, the slaughter, the removal and the manipulation of the situation in Darfur can end.",
        "Just one indication of manipulation is that, last week, we saw where the French government, along with French, so-called nongovernmental organizations were kidnapping over 100 children from Chad, saying that they were orphans from Darfur when this was part of an operation of trafficking children in Africa.",
        "So the whole mess in the Sudan, in the Southern Sudan, in Darfur, is caught in this vortex of militarism, manipulation, food as a weapon of war, humanitarianism.",
        "And so what the African Union is seeking is to do is to try to bring peace and to demilitarize the society.",
        "And this would mean that governments, like the government of the United States of America, should stop its hypocrisy of crying genocide in one breath and giving intelligence and military support to the Bashir government in another breath.",
        "So tell me more why do you - what do you think that the U.S.",
        "should be doing at this point?",
        "And both Moragne and Lawson and others say they're tired of airlines charging for everything from extra baggage to extra legroom.",
        "As for the base fares, though, many travelers say they aren't too terribly high if you buy far enough in advance.",
        "But Moragne notices that while the price of fuel plummets, airfares are still up.",
        "They're not coming down, relatively speaking, the way gas has come down.",
        "Do you think they should?",
        "Or do you...",

        "That's true.",

        "But the airlines say it's not as much you'd think.",
        "And the fuel price plunge comes after near record high prices.",
        "John Heimlich, chief economist for the industry group Airlines for America, says airlines are using their windfalls now to pay down debt, to give investors dividends for the first time in decades and to improve the flying product.",
        "So we continue to see new aircraft coming into the system, facilities improving, a more stable, better-trained workforce in flight, you know, tablets, proliferation of Wi-Fi.",
        "And now you're seeing it in more international markets.",
        "But at least some of those amenities won't be free to all passengers.",
        "Airlines have begun offering far fewer cheap seats.",

        "I think it would be fair to say that the game here is pay-to-play.",
        "If you want the cheapest fare, don't look for the primo product.",
        "Looking ahead to 2015, Hamlin says travelers should continue to expect jam-packed planes and high fares.",
        "As demand for air travel continues to rise, recent mergers reduce competition, and airlines have reduced excess seat capacity to better match demand.",

        "So what's Baghdad like in this Election Day?",
        "Well, at the moment, it's pretty calm because the city's effectively been shut down to vehicle traffic.",
        "There's been a vehicle curfew declared.",
        "So all you see is people here and there walking to their local polling centers.",
        "Most of the shops are shut because it's a public holiday.",
        "And right now, very few people have gone to their polling centers but the expectation is the numbers will increase after mid-day, after people have had a bite to eat.",
        "So what were the last few days of campaigning like?",
        "The last few days of campaigning were very much like the rest of the campaign, in fact, in that the prime minister was at the center of the debate about whether or not he should get a third term.",
        "Nouri al-Maliki, of course, has been prime minister since 2006, and there's been a lot of opposition to his rule, particularly from minority groups, including Sunni Arabs and Kurds.",
        "The campaigning has been, of course, blighted by several major attacks.",
        "On Friday, a political rally for the political wing of a Shia militia group was attacked.",
        "The attack was claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.",
        "That's the al-Qaida-inspired group that also is quite active in Syria.",
        "And then just on Monday, in fact, upwards of 60 people were killed - several of them security forces, as the security forces went for early voting ahead of today's general election.",
        "So, it's been very bloody as well as being quite dynamic, in terms of people sort of making last-ditch attempts to garner votes.",
        "You know, I just want to remember here, there are three major groups in Iraq: Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs and Kurds.",
        "Nouri al-Maliki, the prime minister, is Shia.",
        "His government is Shia-led.",
        "And you just said that the opposition has largely been from those other two groups.",
        "And we were just talking about sectarian violence.",
        "Is there a connection between the politics of Iraq right now and the violence in Iraq right now?",
        "Well, first, let me just stress that the prime minister isn't, by any means, leading a unified Shia community.",
        "There's a lot of dissent within the Shia camp against his rule as well.",
        "A lot of the violence is said to stem from Sunni militant groups who are getting fuel from the fact that there is a lot of disaffection in the Sunni community.",
        "And the politics very much plays into that.",
        "Political leaders regularly criticize the prime minister and his government for not doing enough to reach out to Sunnis to provide them with jobs, to provide them with adequate security and adequate economic opportunity.",
        "And as a result, while most Sunnis do not actively participate or support any form of militancy, they're probably less likely to want to deal with the security forces and the authorities, and to provide intelligence and to provide support to them.",
        "What kind of a case is Nouri al-Maliki making for himself?",
        "Well, he's sort of presenting himself as the bulwark against a very strong extremist militant group that is pushing against Iraq's western front.",
        "That's, of course, the Islamic State of Iraq in the Levant.",
        "As far as he's concerned, he is sort of the guarantor of Iraq's security, and the person who will stand up to Sunni extremists who are flowing in from Syria and supported by Saudi Arabia and Qatar.",
        "And these are his words.",
        "Of course, the criticism of him is that he's not doing enough to actually bring Iraqi Sunnis into the fold and bring them into the political process, and offer them things so that they're less likely to passively support or look the other way in the face of militancy."

        "Last week, just before the peace talks began, the Southern government walked out of the Northern government.",
        "And this is very dangerous because it suggests that, not only will we have a war in Darfur, but we have a potential collapse of the comprehensive peace agreement where over three million people have been killed in the past 21 years of fighting.",
        "So we have a very dangerous situation.",
        "And what we need is to focus on the question of peace, demilitarization, and to end the kind of political leadership we have in Khartoum.",
        "All right.",

        "So in an interview last year on NEWS & NOTES, Mo Ibrahim explained the idea for the prize.",
        "(Soundbite of archived NPR recording)",
        "The idea for us was to enable a living president to live a full life after leaving office, not to fade away in obscurity, but to engage with the civil society to take up causes, either for women's rights or for children's or for democracy or for human rights or whatever cause is closer at hand and the heart.",

        "After 1986, when Samora Machel was killed in this place accident that - allegedly, the plane was brought down by the Apartheid forces - the - Chissano became the president.",
