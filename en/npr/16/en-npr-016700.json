        "So what difference does the presence of jackrabbits make in Yellowstone?",
        "White-tailed jackrabbits, like many other rabbits, play a role because they're food for some of the larger predators, in this case for coyotes.",
        "And so when rabbits become so diminished, we know that coyotes turn to other prey species, and in our particular case we know that they've been eating prong-horn fawns and also elk calves.",
        "So baby antelopes and elks, that's what they're going after instead?",
        "More so antelope babies, and there are some data to confirm that they're also eating elk babies.",
        "And the reason that this is important is because of course keep in mind with wolves reintroduced, there's been great attention and focus on not only wolves but also grizzly bears, and I think some of the small things that run the world have fallen off the radar.",

        "Your paper notes their passing from these parks, but then you go on to something that seems just as troubling to you, which is that hardly anyone seemed to notice.",
        "And that's the interesting part, because I think as conservationists and as scientists, you know, we need to look and consider all of the parts of the puzzle and how the system works if we ever want to restore it."
