        "In other words, these were not domesticated plants.",
        "This ancient community was simply taking seeds and plants from the wild and growing them in fields.",
        "They hadn't started breeding crops yet and selecting varieties for yield and other desirable qualities.",
        "We do not have any clear evidence that it was very conscious in the beginning.",
        "But 2,000 years later, they had clearly started breeding emmer wheat, so that the ears were stronger and made harvesting a lot easier.",
        "Riehl's findings, which are published in the latest issue of the journal Science, give a rare close-up picture of the early evolution of farming.",
        "Melinda Zeder is a curator of Old World Archaeology at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.",
        "It's allowing us to push back our picture of early agriculture to these very, very initial stages, when people are beginning to play around with plants and their environment.",
        "Zeder says the findings change our understanding of where people first started farming.",
        "Until now, she says scientists had thought agriculture began in the western parts of the Fertile Crescent.",
        "This new find is far to the east.",
        "It really forces us to broaden our viewpoint on early agriculture to include this vast region of the whole Fertile Crescent.",
        "She says the findings confirm that rather than starting in one place and spreading, farming began with many different communities experimenting with agriculture around the same time.",

        "When you say new physics, you mean that we have to change our understanding about what we think the atoms are made out of?",
        "Not exactly the atoms, but it would be - it's possible that there are new particles out there, new heavy particles.",
        "There are perhaps super-symmetric particles that people are looking for in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN that are affecting this measurement, this very precise measurement.",
        "So you're saying that let me see if I can parse this a bit that the proton size may be the same that it always has been, but that these other spooky particles we don't know about may be affecting the measurement of how we measure it.",
        "That's exactly right."

        "Wow.",
        "Yeah, so this it's a really very interesting story here that people with relatively small experiments, sometimes tabletop-size, can get some of the same physics that we get out by building big, powerful colliders.",
        "There are kind of two complimentary approaches to finding new physics.",
        "So what you're saying is that they didn't need to use a big, fancy Hadron collider.",
        "They just needed some desktop - more or less - sized physics experiment.",
        "Well, if you can do both, that's much better - build the collider and do the precision experiments, because they both tell you different parts of the story.",
        "Well, if you know this now, can you use those giant colliders, like the new Hadron Collider, the Large Hadron Collider, could you tweak an experiment to see, now, maybe we should look for some of that new physics?",

        "I imagine other people will be checking or conducting new experiments.",
        "That's right.",
        "So the most important thing to check first is that the theory was correct.",
        "The experiments have been put well under control, I think, and the first place people are going to look for a boring sort of mistake is in the theory.",
        "They have to run through a lot of very complicated calculations to extract the proton size from the laboratory measurement.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Tell us what kind of particles they might be looking for that would affect how you measure the protons.",

        "There - some of them are aesthetic.",
        "Some of them are observational, like dark energy and dark matter.",
        "We don't know what those things are, and so there must be something besides a standard model of physics."

        "One of the things that might solve some of these problems is the super-symmetry theory, which says that for every normal particle, like an electron, there's also a much heavier counterpart.",
        "And those heavy counterparts, you can make in a collider, or you can see their effects in a precision experiment like this muonic hydrogen result.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "No, very interesting question.",
        "That prediction has been around for a very long time.",
        "And there have been a few hints up till now that that theory might be correct.",

        "A few athletes risk prison but for many more, the issue is their legacy -the Hall of Fame, the yellow jerseys and the gold medals.",

        "So when you replace it with a muon, you can probe for this new physics in a better way.",
        "And similarly, when you look at the muon by itself, look at what its magnet is, there's a strong disagreement with theory there, also.",
        "So it's another tantalizing hint that there might be some new physics out there, like new particles that we'd like to see."
