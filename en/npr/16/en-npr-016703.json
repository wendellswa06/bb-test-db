        "I hate to use this phrase, but time will tell as far as, you know, what emphasis we give it.",
        "When we start writing about these people in the history books 20, 30 years from, will the conversation be different about performance-enhancing drugs?",
        "Will there be a level of acceptance?",
        "Well, you need to legalize this, medically monitor it; others who say, that's crazy.",
        "And it will always be the kind of cat-and-mouse game and you know, catch and punish, the way it is now - or try to punish.",
        "And it's - whether you return a gold medal or, I guess in baseball, the proof thus far has been that no athlete who has been connected with performance-enhancing drugs has thus far received anything close to the requisite votes to make it into the Hall of Fame.",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "The Baseball Writers of America, who vote in the players, have been very cranky on this issue.",
        "And even guys who, you know, perhaps are peripherally involved.",
        "And nothing - there's no evidence, there's nothing close to proof other than a body getting bigger and maybe a surge in offensive production if you're a batter, someone like Jeff Bagwell from the Houston Astros.",
        "Right, there is - you know, there's no sense now that baseball writers want to let these guys in.",
        "Mark McGwire, who famously kind of admitted -kind of acknowledged that he had used banned performance-enhancing drugs, his numbers, with each vote, have gone down.",
        "So as I said, the mood is not good right now as far as induction and voting into the Hall of Fame.",
        "But again, who knows what that'll be like in 20 years?",
        "Bring us up to date, in the meanwhile, on what's happening there in San Francisco.",
        "Yesterday the jury asked to hear some testimony read back to them.",
        "Yes, that was the testimony of Cathy Hoskins(ph), who has this for a title, was the former personal clothes shopper - I have to get one of those people myself - clothes shopper to Barry Bonds, who in her testimony, said that she had witnessed, back in 2002, Bonds being injected by his former personal - Greg Anderson.",
        "A lot of people know about Anderson because he was in jail for the duration of this trial for his refusal to testify.",
        "Cathy Hoskins said she didn't know what was in the syringe, but she said she saw a regular-sized syringe, and that Bonds was being injected around the navel.",
        "That's consistent with human growth hormone injections, that are often - the player will squeeze a little layer of fat around their belly and inject right there."

        "That was considered the prosecution's key evidence.",

        "Bill Strickland is editor-at-large at Bicycling magazine and has covered Lance Armstrong for many years.",
        "He spent a year with Armstrong and wrote a book, \"\"Tour de Lance.\"\" In a story in this month's issue of Bicycling magazine, Strickland wrote about Armstrong and doping, and why he's now changed his mind.",

        "Hi, Neal.",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "I - you know, I've been a fan of his since 1994, a longtime follower.",
        "Throughout his career, as different circumstantial evidence came up and charges came up, I sort of varied in whether I thought he could have ridden clean.",
        "But I always thought it was important to sort of hold the line until I thought 100 percent that I knew he had doped, before I said anything publicly.",
        "And there's a moment in your story where you're riding in a car with Team Lance, and his trainer says: Oh, he's one of us.",
        "Yeah, it was at the Tour de France in 2009, his comeback year.",
        "And I was never - you know, I was never going to - say, Lance's kids' birthday parties or anything.",
        "I was never that close.",
        "But I was definitely on the outer ring of the inner circle - I guess is the best way to describe it."

        "Well, that's what I'm trying to figure out, and that's what really intrigues me about the story - is, what is his legacy?",
        "Unlike with Bonds or McGwire or Marion Jones, you know, Lance Armstrong is an icon of hope to many people, to the cancer community, because of his past.",
        "He overcame cancer, came back to the sport and won his tours.",
