        "I think there are many people in the anti-Lance faction - and Bill lays that out in his article - there are many here who say it is significant what he did, that - Greg LeMond famously said this would constitute the greatest fraud ever in sports because, you know, if Lance Armstrong built what he did, which touched so many lives, on banned performance-enhancing drugs, at least partially - I know, and Bill pointed out in the article - these athletes don't just get up off the couch and become these supreme athletes.",
        "But if that was part of it, and he consistently lied about that, a lot of people will feel defrauded.",
        "And I'm not just talking about the alleged fraud that's going on now with the investigation.",
        "I'm talking about how he gave a lot of people hope - that you really can, you know, get up out of your deathbed and do a remarkable thing.",
