        "I think I probably qualify as America's oldest geeky dad because having built the first programmable computer in America at the National Bureau of Standards in 1950, by 1957 I made the world's first digital image, which was my son when he was born.",
        "And that image I made out of square pixels which, of course, has survived to this day until just recently I decided we could improve on that.",
        "And so my son had to wait 53 years for his father to fix his pixels.",
        "And in the current issue of the Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, there are pictures of my son today with these variable shape pixels, which are much better.",
        "And as a result, he now has the opportunity in his capacity as the communications person at Intel Corporation to be able to make photographs much better than any one that his father or anybody else has made in the past half century by using this knew notion of variable shape pixels.",

        "You have to tell us who you are so our whole audience knows of your infamy.",
        "Well, I was one of the designers of the SEAC computer at the National Bureau of Standards in 1950, which enabled us to do things that nobody else could do because we have the only computer that was workable in America.",
        "And of course, starting the field of digital imaging was one of things that we did in 1957.",
        "And so to this day, my son has been living with these lousy square pixels.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And he just recently had the opportunity to improve on that at the age of 53."
