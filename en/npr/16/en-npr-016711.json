        "He's not, strictly speaking, President Trump's lawyer.",
        "And what he is saying is that President Trump is not considering or talking about firing Mueller.",
        "And he blamed the speculation on the media, though the speculation could have been caused by the president and his outside lawyer.",

        "Cube's writing and rapping with NWA on their legendary Straight Outta Compton album in 1988 introduced the world to the thoughts and sounds of what came to be known as gangster rap.",
        "A few years later, Cube made history again when he starred in the film, Boyz 'N the Hood.",
        "Though it is now commonplace for rappers to become actors, Ice Cube was one of the first to make the successful transition into film.",
        "Yet over the years, many in hip-hop, especially those of the younger generation, seemed to have forgotten about Cube.",
        "They see him only as an actor and producer, and don't take him seriously as a rapper.",
        "The fact that several of his more recent albums prior to Laugh Now, Cry Later seemed to suffer from a lack of focus aided in this regard for his efforts as a lyricist.",
        "But on Laugh Now, Cry Later, Cube takes it back, as they say.",
        "Here, he reemerges as a conscious gangster, and this allows him to tackle pressing social issues like police brutality, the prison industrial complex, racism at large.",
        "And he even takes a few jabs at the current political situation, stating at one point that, they ain't looking for Osama, ask Biggies' mama.",
        "Comments like these were routine back in the early '90s, but have been few and far between since that time.",

        "Having earned his stripes as an OG, having predicted that Los Angeles would explode in urban unrest as it did in 1992, and by being one of the early adapters in making the rap-to-acting transition, Cube established his street cred' a long time ago, and he has evolved since that time.",
