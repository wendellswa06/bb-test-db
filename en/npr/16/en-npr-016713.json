        "And the history of distrust in government goes back much farther even than that.",
        "Yeah, so this it's a really very interesting story here that people with relatively small experiments, sometimes tabletop-size, can get some of the same physics that we get out by building big, powerful colliders.",
        "There are kind of two complimentary approaches to finding new physics.",
        "So what you're saying is that they didn't need to use a big, fancy Hadron collider.",
        "They just needed some desktop - more or less - sized physics experiment.",
        "Well, if you can do both, that's much better - build the collider and do the precision experiments, because they both tell you different parts of the story.",
        "Well, if you know this now, can you use those giant colliders, like the new Hadron Collider, the Large Hadron Collider, could you tweak an experiment to see, now, maybe we should look for some of that new physics?",
        "Absolutely, yeah.",
        "That's going to be one of the important implications coming out of whatever we find out of LHC.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And how do we know that, you know, maybe they made a mistake in measuring here?",
        "I imagine other people will be checking or conducting new experiments.",
        "That's right.",
        "So the most important thing to check first is that the theory was correct.",
        "The experiments have been put well under control, I think, and the first place people are going to look for a boring sort of mistake is in the theory.",
        "They have to run through a lot of very complicated calculations to extract the proton size from the laboratory measurement.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Tell us what kind of particles they might be looking for that would affect how you measure the protons.",
        "Well, one of the interesting possibilities are the so-called super-symmetric particles.",
        "It's an idea that we have in physics that what we we don't really like the standard model.",
        "It works great, but there are a lot of problems with it.",
        "There - some of them are aesthetic.",
        "Some of them are observational, like dark energy and dark matter.",
        "We don't know what those things are, and so there must be something besides a standard model of physics."

        "One of the things that might solve some of these problems is the super-symmetry theory, which says that for every normal particle, like an electron, there's also a much heavier counterpart.",
        "And those heavy counterparts, you can make in a collider, or you can see their effects in a precision experiment like this muonic hydrogen result.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And so you would be looking for those particles in the collider to see if they exist.",
        "That's right.",
        "Can you actually predict what they might be?",
        "That's right.",
        "There are predictions.",
        "Yeah, and we hope that the collider will be able to produce some of them, if they exist.",
        "And did you have to come up with that prediction now that the measurement is off for the proton?",
        "No, very interesting question.",
        "That prediction has been around for a very long time.",
        "And there have been a few hints up till now that that theory might be correct.",
        "Another interesting hint is the measurement of the little magnet, which is embedded inside the muon.",
        "The muon is a particle that they use in this experiment to orbit the proton instead of a normal electron orbiting a proton.",
        "So when you replace it with a muon, you can probe for this new physics in a better way.",
        "And similarly, when you look at the muon by itself, look at what its magnet is, there's a strong disagreement with theory there, also.",
        "So it's another tantalizing hint that there might be some new physics out there, like new particles that we'd like to see.",
        "So you did the experiment by taking away the electron that goes normally around the proton, and you put a very heavy muon in there."

        "Different experiments, but they both involve the muon, and it's possible they're hinting at the same new physics.",
