        "That he's planning on them.",
        "He said that again, at the Pentagon, just last week.",
        "It didn't get much coverage, but it was to me the most critically important thing he said.",
        "He also has said, on a number of occasions, that the longer that we stay there with our current forces in Iraq, the more we're going to end up doing things by ourselves, instead of the Iraqis doing it for themselves.",
        "So, I don't think there's the slightest doubt, that before our election, you're going to find significant troop reductions.",
        "And the president will find someway to claim that this is progress or a step towards victory.",
        "Before the elections.",
        "I mean, you're suggesting - maybe more than suggesting - this is politics, not ground conditions.",
        "No, the president has got no alternative here.",
        "The American people, after three and half years of significant losses - opening up an opportunity for the Iraqis to have a nation - have, I think reached a conclusion that it's now basically got to be up to the Iraqis.",

        "Do they want to build a nation?",
        "Do they want to make the compromises that have to be made, politically, to bring in the Sunnis?",
        "And only the Iraqis can do those things, and our military cannot do those things for them.",
        "Senator, you had a plan defeated on the floor of the Senate, last week, to set a date for withdrawal of troops.",
        "Republicans say there's a distinction between what you were doing and General Casey's plan.",
        "That this is condition's on the ground, not a deadline.",
        "Is that a fair distinction?",
        "Well, first of all, my resolution - which got the support of almost all the Democrats, including all the potential contenders for the president - said simply, that we should begin, by the end of this year, a phased redeployment of troops.",
        "That is what is going to happen.",
        "That is what Casey's planning on.",

        "And unlike Medea Benjamin and Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa, Raquel says she decided not to march in this year's demonstrations.",

        "It's the division.",
        "It's the increased racism, the anti-Islam, the sense of refugees - we don't want them here - or immigrants - we don't want them here - among a certain portion of the population.",
        "So on that level, you could say we haven't progressed very much.",
        "Destiny, how do you assess the impact of the big marches?",
        "I would agree that progress takes time, but I think we're already seeing huge strides.",
        "I mean, these marches activated a lot of women.",
        "And yes, some of it came as a reaction to an administration that we felt very threatened by.",
        "But I went to the Women's Convention in Detroit back in October.",
        "And even just the grassroots efforts of teaching people how to plan a protest, how to fundraise for their organization, you know, you took a lot of people who had strong opinions and, you know, might be sharing that with their friends, and you turn them into activists and leaders who are now going to, you know, hopefully be able to create this revolution.",

        "And that's something that I don't see happening on a larger scale.",
        "I will say one positive thing that I think has happened is that there has been a shift in our collective consciousness.",
        "So if you think about maybe a year ago, a year and a half ago, when people would talk about things like white supremacy or misogyny or rape culture or sexual assault, you would kind of get looked like you had a problem or like you were some kind of radical.",
        "But now, we know that those are things that are so pervasive, and everyday people are having these conversations at the dinner table.",
        "But I want to go back, Destiny, with you on this whole question of inclusion that Raquel raised.",
        "I mean, from a different perspective, you identify as a feminist, but you also identify as pro-life.",

        "Well, you know, I mean, the point about being a king now is it's so ceremonial and you don't have any decision to do.",

        "But they're not going to get him.",
        "The fact is that the next in line is Prince Charles and Prince Charles will be, unless he predeceases his mother, he will be the next king.",
        "And of course, what really finished him off in public estimation, I think, was Princess Diana.",
        "The public sided hugely with her, felt that she'd been very badly treated and that the remaining royals behaved abominably, really certainly stupidly when she died by failing to respond to the public mood.",
        "And also they don't operate as representatives of a focus group.",
        "You could gather two dozen ordinary people in a room, all of whom would probably say, oh, Prince William, he seems much more engaging, much pleasanter, much less wacky than his father, and they will ignore it simply because they've always done it that way.",
