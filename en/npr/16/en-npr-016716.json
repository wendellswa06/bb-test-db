        "And we had woman after woman walk up to us and say, I disagree with you on the abortion issue, but I'm glad you're here.",
        "I mean, that is the beauty of intersectional feminism.",
        "And so when you get to know me and know more about my story that, you know, I came from an unplanned pregnancy, from a mother who got pregnant college at 19 years old, and the only reason she was able to choose life for me is because of a support system that so many women don't have.",
        "You know, we talk a lot about access to abortion and that being, you know, one of the choices, but we don't really look at the other choices.",
        "Whether it's the exorbitant expense for adoption or how are we supporting women well who do choose life if they're single or young or students or any of these other things?",
        "And so we really want to shift that focus to there's so much common ground that pro-choice and pro-life feminists can absolutely agree on when it comes to finding those resources for women to help them with the other choices.",
        "One of the other things that has happened this year is that there have been a number of jurisdictions, not necessarily in response to Code Pink and the women's marches, but street activists in general are trying to make it more difficult for groups to demonstrate in the streets when they are disruptive.",
        "In fact, a number of jurisdictions have taken steps - or states - state legislatures have taken steps to impose hefty fines on people when they believe that these demonstrations have been disruptive.",
        "Your colleague, Desiree Fairooz, was arrested actually for laughing during the congressional confirmation hearing of Jeff Sessions to be attorney general.",
        "The charges were eventually dropped, but I wanted to ask you about that.",

        "Well, for example, just even in front of the White House, we can't physically get in front of the White House anymore.",
        "They put these barriers so that you have to go away from the street to Pennsylvania Avenue that's right in front of the White House and be in Lafayette Park.",
        "So I think that's terrible.",
        "But I'm asking you about that because it started during the campaign, where demonstrators were punched, and that is a reality where there have been periods in which street demonstrations have more or less tolerated and periods in which they really aren't.",
        "And this seems to be another period in which there seems to be less tolerance for it, and the administration has made no secret of the fact that it does not approve of these kinds of things.",
        "I just wondered, is it affecting the way you and your fellow organizers think about the kinds of things you're willing to do?",
        "Well, it's harder for some people - certainly for undocumented people, and that's why we have to give tremendous kudos to those in the undocumented movement who are coming out to protest and are chanting things like undocumented and unafraid.",
        "But many people who are undocumented are now afraid to come out to protests.",
        "And I think people of color find it harder to come out because they have been so targeted by the police.",
        "So I think a lot of our protests are smaller than they have been in the past.",
        "And yet, you see safer venues, like the protest for the women's march, where people do come out in larger numbers.",
        "And the great thing, I think, about the women's march this year is it's the women's marches.",
        "So they've been all over the country, and I think that actually gives a lot of strength to the movement.",
        "Before we let you go, this is one of those common polling questions that, you know, everybody asks, but I still feel myself wanting to ask, do you feel generally optimistic or pessimistic about the direction that the country is going to - I don't know.",

        "I would say, today, I am optimistic.",

        "But moving forward, I am optimistic.",
        "I've been working with other black trans women who are activists and organizers over the last few days, and we've been strategizing and figuring out how to get our power together.",
        "So I think also - part of it is also looking at the leadership that is at some of these organizations that are doing this liberation work.",
        "Do we see women of color in leadership positions?",
        "Do we see black women?",
        "Do we see disabled women, transgender women?",
        "Are they getting the support that they need in that leadership?",
        "And so I think if people can make those commitments as we move forward, then I will continue to be optimistic.",
        "Medea, final thought?",
        "I think as an activist, you kind of have to be optimistic because it's what gets you out of bed every morning and gets you out organizing and convincing other people to get involved.",
        "I think we're in a strange place in this country with Donald Trump in the White House, and I think the global community is looking at us and saying, what happened to the United States?",
        "I think we want to rejoin that community.",
        "I think most people want to be a nicer nation, want to have somebody that's a nicer face for us in the White House.",
