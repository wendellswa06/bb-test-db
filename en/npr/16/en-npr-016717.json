        "He has some work to do with Democrats.",
        "But, again, he's got a great foil I think in the Ryan budget, which, as you know, slashes spending tremendously.",
        "More than two-thirds of the proposed cuts in the Ryan budget come from low-income programs.",
        "And yet, Ryan doesn't really reduce the deficit, because he's got so many tax cuts for the wealthy.",
        "Republicans, like former Bush White House aide Pete Wehner, think the president is weighing in with too little too late; only after Republican House Budget Committee Chair Paul Ryan put forward his deficit plan.",
        "Presidents have a tremendous ability to run ahead and grab the flag and to lead.",
        "But Obama is in a weaker situation than most presidents, primarily because he's been missing in action on the budget issues.",
        "And he can't make up for that in a single speech.",
        "But Wehner acknowledges the president's strategy to lay low and smoke out the GOP might have political advantages.",
        "There's no question that Obama wanted Republicans to go first, which they've done.",
        "And I think to their credit, they went first.",
        "And Obama now is going to try and tell the public that he wants to achieve the same ends, but he wants to do it through more reasonable means.",
        "And if he can get away with that, his chances for re-election are going to be vastly improved.",
        "Here's House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in an interview yesterday.",
        "I don't think there's any question what we're demanding for the debt ceiling vote is to be able to tell the American people that we're not going to keep spending money we don't have, in the way that's been the habit in the past."

        "His maximum leverage in the debt ceiling fight is the real need to not have the country default.",
        "For as much as the conservatives want to huff and puff about it, if they would permit the country to go into default for the first time in our history, the Republicans would be really playing with matches if they decide that they can take this up to the 11th hour.",
