        "A-ha.",
        "So, as opposed to picking up the recycling people leave out on their lawn, this is after they sell the house and you going in and look for whatever might be able to be recycled.",
        "Well, people contract with me to either come in and get rid of their stuff.",
        "But I can probably say that I've been 100 percent landfill-free, and I've been able to recycle everything that I have taken thus far.",
        "But in terms of foreclosures, I am seeing an uptick - and this is my first year in business, a pretty good uptake in the amount of calls I've been getting from real state agents for foreclosed cleanouts.",
        "Having moved house few years ago, now, but nevertheless, the amount of stuff one can accumulate is simply astonishing.",
        "Oh, it's out of sight.",
        "I have done jobs where I have filled upward of three 30-yard dumpsters, and I still have not finished.",
        "Wow.",
        "So, it can be quite expensive."

        "And one final question.",
        "Again, you're dealing with the aftereffects of evictions, a lot of the time, or foreclosures, any bad feelings?",
        "Yeah.",
        "There's - you know, one of the last large cleanouts that I did was at the end of last week.",
        "And it was the family, a very young family, and the couple had twins.",
        "And because of money constraints, they just couldn't keep it together and they ended up splitting up.",
        "And especially with my background as a history teacher, it's very easy to piece together stories.",

        "It suffered greatly when he refused to lower his standards and morals to bend under the pressure of loan officers and banks to provide less-than-legitimate appraisals.",
        "Now, the results of those corrupt appraisals have wrecked havoc on the economy.",
        "And legislation against flaky appraisals is beginning to take effect; his business is beginning to grow again because people recognize his appraiser's work has always been of the highest quality.",
        "He's even been hired to review files for the growing number of legal cases over fraudulent appraisals.",
        "It's wonderful to see his dedication to legal and moral practice be rewarded.",

        "So there are remodeling projects out there available, the business is just changing a little bit?",
        "Yes.",
        "While we still work with remodelers and homebuilders, the senior assisted living memory care units seemed to still be enjoying a real surge as we're all growing older and looking for a place to live and with some maybe extra care.",
        "And do you worry that you're going to take up the slack in this market before the regular market of remodels and new construction get started again?",
        "I really think that, Neal, the senior housing market is so strong and the interest rates are really very moderate that those that are constructing these large senior living complexes are not feeling the downturn that the single-family homebuilder is.",
        "I guess they look at the same demographic numbers that you and I look at and say, there could be a future in this.",

        "And are the kinds of people the same kind of clientele you usually had over the years?",
