        "It is a scary situation.",

        "In an online post, the Department of Homeland Security says that the personal information provided by DACA recipients won't be proactively shared with immigration enforcement agents.",
        "But if ICE officials ask for the data, the agency will hand it over.",
        "And it says the privacy policy can be modified or rescinded at any time without notice.",
        "And what that means in plain English is...",
        "Leon Fresco is a D.C.-based immigration attorney who worked in the Obama Justice Department.",
        "...When ICE wants to place someone in removal proceedings, it can ask for any information it wants to do that.",
        "And the administration has not denied this meaning.",
        "Stephen Legomsky was chief counsel of U.S.",
        "Citizenship and Immigration Services when DACA was created back in 2012.",
        "He says the government didn't just give people a promise that their data would remain confidential; it also actively encouraged people to apply with that assurance.",
        "If it were to then turn around and say, gotcha (ph), now we know where you live.",
        "We're coming out to get you to deport you.",
        "Then there is at least a fair argument that fundamental fairness has been violated and that means it can be a due process challenge.",

        "Let me give you the context.",
        "Tiny El Salvador has a third of its population living outside the country.",
        "And as one economist with the United Nations told us, this has been a really big benefit for the government there.",
        "Not only are these migrants here sending a lot of money back home, they're not demanding education, health care, jobs.",
        "Well, I don't think she is qualified, no. And undoubtedly she's a pleasant person.",
        "Undoubtedly, she's a good lawyer.",
        "And obviously she's very loyal to the president.",
        "But there are thousands and thousands of good lawyers out there.",
        "I don't think they are--merely by being good lawyers are qualified for the court.",
        "Now it may be that she has hidden philosophical resources and knowledge of constitutional jurisprudence that we don't know about, but we certainly don't know about it.",
        "Some have wondered why conservatives are so upset with this nomination in that if she is showing her loyalty, she will undoubtedly rule with conservatives such as Scalia and Thomas once on the court."

        "But how can you know what anyone will do or say once on the court?",
        "How do you know what kind of justice John Roberts will be, for example?",
        "Well, we know that John Roberts is an extraordinarily capable attorney, far more so than the average or even the high-average run.",
        "And we do know that he has intimate knowledge of constitutional law and philosophy and we do know that as a young man he expressed conservative views when he was working in the Reagan administration.",
        "But he did not express those views either in any decisions that he gave or during the confirmation battles.",
        "Well, that's one of the concerns I have because I think Roberts is a brilliant lawyer and we overlook the absence of a clear statement of views, but now we have a second person who has no paper trail, in fact, even much less than Roberts had.",
        "And I think that tells young lawyers, particularly conservative lawyers, that if you want to be considered for a position like that, you don't express controversial views.",
        "In fact, it's best that you don't represent any views, which I think is a great loss.",
        "Which is what happened to you.",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, I--yes, I had expressed a number of views, shall we say?",
        "I wonder--there's been intense opposition to Harriet Miers' nomination on the part of conservatives.",
        "Do you think that this opposition will go anywhere?",
        "Do you think it'll have an effect on either Miers withdrawing her name or President Bush, in fact, withdrawing her?",
        "No, I don't think--President Bush is a stubborn man or firm if you wish to put it that way and I think he's annoyed with the conservatives for opposing this nomination.",
        "I don't think he's going to withdraw it at all, and if he won't, I don't think she will withdraw her own name.",
        "So I expect that she'll be confirmed, but I'm concerned that once more we will have missed a chance to begin the reform of the court and we will have dealt a blow to conservative legal philosophy.",
        "Finally, your nomination generated its own verb `to Bork,' meaning to defame or vilify a person with the aim of thwarting his or her appointment to public office.",
        "So is Harriet Miers being Borked by your side now?"
