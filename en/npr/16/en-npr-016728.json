        "If there's a gag order, a restriction on your ability to talk about the subpoena, you ought to be able to object to that in court.",
        "There is a provision that requires the automatic disclosure of the name of your lawyer if you seek legal advice; I think it's unnecessary, and it could have the effect of discouraging people of seeking legal advice in the first place.",
        "And I don't think that's really the goal of this legislation.",
        "We want to make sure we respect the right of due process, and that we're as clear as possible in setting specific standards for getting these powers in the first place.",
        "So what you're trying to do, then, is to give people who are being pursued under the Patriot Act by some agency of the government some sort of way of asking the question, does this really have to happen?",
        "Exactly.",
        "I mean, what civil liberties are all about are making sure that Americans, especially those that aren't guilty of any crime, have an opportunity to seek due process or representation, have an opportunity to argue their case, and in the case of these gag orders, argue their case before a judge.",
        "Now the House and Senate negotiators worked something out last December.",
        "It did not go far enough, the compromise they produced?",
        "The board is really directing how the Voice of America is run today.",
        "I think we deprive our children tremendously in this country, if we don't provide them with the opportunity to have that educational benefit of working and living with people of different races, colors and ethnic groups, that's a major setback for our country.",
        "And the American president, utilizing the bully pulpit of the Oval Office, needs to make that case every single day if we're going to succeed in this effort.",
        "The only Hispanic on stage was New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson.",

        "There was plenty of debate in the run-up to the decision to make the exam mandatory in California, a debate that's played out across much of the country.",
        "Nearly half the states have exit exams now, which usually focus on math and writing skills.",
        "Proponents argue that a high school diploma ought to be more than a certificate of attendance, and that higher standards will force both students and schools to do better.",
        "Critics charge that it isn't fair to measure an education on the basis of a single test, especially one they say penalizes minorities and students with special needs.",
        "Exit exams have been around for years now, and there's still argument about whether they do what they're intended to do.",

        "And, Susan, you've been writing about this for The New York Times.",
        "And you pointed out that all this is taking place when allegations of sexual assault or harassment have touched Fox News, the Trump campaign, you might even say both political campaigns if you consider the way the Trump campaign brought back up with the questions about Bill Clinton's conduct, then there's Uber, all the incidents on college campuses.",
        "And you said that in a way, the Cosby trial was also a trial about how society grapples with the combustible questions of power, predation and due process that complicate he-said-she-said narratives.",
        "And you said that the jury is still out.",
        "But as a person who follows this closely, I'm wondering if you feel you learned anything from this latest chapter in this ongoing story?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think I learned a lot about the real tension between the issues of how you fairly establish credibility and what the line is when you believe women, when you don't, what memory does when you're trying to recall events preceding around and after sexual assault and why it's really hard according to legal experts to successfully prosecute cases that are he-said-she-said cases.",
        "What's interesting about this one is that, as people said in the program preceding, there have been so many other women who have accused Bill Cosby of a similar M.O.",
        "but only one case was admitted to trial.",
        "And that's because a lot of people argued that a lot of these accusations were settled, they weren't proven.",
        "To introduce them might be prejudicial.",
        "There are all kinds of legal challenges.",
        "And they're all kinds of questions about who we believe and why.",
        "Ahmad, you know, I think that - people might think this happened in part because of the high-profileness (ph) of it, the celebrity, you know, kind of clouded people's judgment or at least affected people's judgment.",
        "You know, you've been reporting on that.",
        "Do you think that that might be so?",
        "Well, actually, our colleague David Schaper, who we heard from earlier, he's done some reporting on this this week on all these cases.",
        "And the reporting that he did kind of indicates that it's not really about the high-profile nature.",
        "And about 3 to 6 percent of cases - criminal cases - end up hung.",
        "And the biggest issue really is evidence being closely balanced.",
        "In other words, neither side really has a slam dunk.",
        "So that's the biggest predicting factor.",
        "And they don't really see evidence of high-profile cases being more susceptible to this sort of thing.",
        "You know, Eric, what do you think about this?",
        "I mean, given that, you know, the whole question of the celebrity factor and also what Susan was writing about, the cultural moment where this is being talked about again, you know, what are your thoughts about it?",
        "Well, I think we're seeing two different things happen here.",
        "One thing that's interesting to me about Cosby is that this all - this stuff all became public, like, almost 10 years ago.",
        "Andrea Constand made her allegations when this act supposedly happened in 2004 and then sued him in 2005.",
        "And several women came forward then.",
        "There was reporting done on it.",
        "And then we all got cultural amnesia about it or something, and people forgot that it happened.",
        "And then when Hannibal Burress, a comic, joked about it in a viral video just a few years ago, it brought it all back, pulled everything back into public view.",
        "And we had a very different reaction to it.",
        "And so what's interesting to me is that now that these allegations have come forward in a different time, there's much more belief accorded to the women who are making these allegations."
