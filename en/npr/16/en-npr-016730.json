        "Unfortunately, the White House waited very long to get engaged.",
        "We have only a few areas of disagreement, and that's why we requested of such a short term extension.",
        "Because I feel we could get these issues resolved in a matter of weeks, if not days.",
        "Could the Congress just keep on voting these extensions if you can't reach some kind of agreement?",
        "I don't think that's desirable at all.",
        "One, I believe we can resolve the few differences that remain, and two, it just doesn't serve us well to keep coming back to these issues, to keep passing the short-term extensions.",

        "The domestic surveillance question, we don't have all of the facts or information, even the relevant committees, the intelligence committee, doesn't quite have all the facts or information available as to what the program consisted of.",
        "And the Judiciary Committee wants to hear it clearly from the Administration about their rationale.",
        "But that is really a question surrounding a single specific program.",
        "What we're trying to complete with the Patriot Act is a very broad, comprehensive piece of legislation that deals with law enforcement powers.",
        "It's much more comprehensive and I do think it serves us well to get this work completed and get the bill signed into law.",

        "Senator, thank you very much."
