        "Tomlinson says to some extent, pressures have emerged under both Democratic and Republican administrations.",

        "Much of the pressure, according to staffers interviewed for this story, comes from the VOA's director, David Jackson.",

        "On January 12th, Jackson wrote, quote, \"\"Postal Service back on its feet and a new stamp without SH\"\"--meaning Saddam Hussein.",
        "Sounds like good radio and good TV pieces for us.\"\" Jackson added, \"\"Please send me copies of the stories when done.\"\" The VOA director attached his message to an e-mailed news release from the Office of Global Communications at the White House.",
        "Here's how the story sounded a few days later.",
        "There has been some rare upbeat news over the past week.",

        "In February 2004, it was the graduation of 11,000 Iraqi secondary school teachers.",
        "And, as the e-mails show, both were inspired by press releases put out by the Coalition Provisional Authority, the US military-led group running Iraq at the time.",

        "That's not journalism.",
        "That's not the way it's done.",
        "And however innocuous you try to make it sound, it comes across as propaganda.",
        "Ungar's currently president of Goucher College in Baltimore, but he was director of the Voice of America for more than two years starting in 1999.",
        "And he says the directives from Jackson and Iliff violate the spirit of the VOA's charter."
