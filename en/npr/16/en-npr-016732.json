        "He gave a speech then when he first proposed funding - well, he was actually supporting the creation of Radio Marti and talking about Cuba.",
        "And it's been -and his famous applause line there was Cuba Si, Castro No. It was an event that a lot of people here in Miami say that's really galvanized the Cuban-American community as Republicans.",

        "It can be a very touchy subject, and some - many people suggest that Obama could become somewhat of a lighting rod that could actually hurt him with the kind of the mainstream of the Cuban-American community here.",
