        "And, as I understand it, the test was administered, but not required over the past two years.",
        "What was the debate like to make it a requirement?",
        "Well, I think that the proponents, the opponents of the test have argued that California's education is very, there are some real inequities there.",
        "You have a class of students who have gone to the poorest schools, they've had the least experienced teachers.",
        "Often they've been taught math by teachers who are uncredentialed.",
        "And there's a strong argument made that these kids who have been showing up for four years, passing their courses, to deny them a diploma now in that context is unfair.",
        "There was also a lobby on behalf of special education students, and they actually succeeded this year in getting a one-year reprieve for that group of students.",
        "They won't be required to pass the exam this year.",
        "Now how tough is this test?",
        "It's, you know, it's really not that tough.",
        "It's been said that it tests ninth or tenth grade English and eighth or ninth grade math, and the threshold for passing it isn't that high.",
        "Students only have to get slightly more than half of the questions correct.",
        "So, you know, the math portion, which a lot of kids seem to have a lot of trouble with, it's pre-algebra.",
        "You know, its things like square roots and those dreaded, if a train leaves Penn Station at 8:00 a.m. kinds of questions.",
        "But, it's not that difficult.",
        "It sounds a lot more like arithmetic than algebra.",
        "Correct.",
        "Correct.",
        "And in fact, I mean, employer groups and some educators say the test ought to be much more rigorous than it is now.",

        "And Arizona has a test called the AIMS, which is now required for graduation.",
        "If I tried taking that exam, I would not have passed it, but I have a bachelor's degree and I speak Arabic and a couple of other languages fairly fluently.",
        "So you're suggesting that the test is, shouldn't be taken as the sole measurement of one's education.",
        "Well, that and, quite frankly, if I couldn't get a high school degree, then I wouldn't have been able to get a college diploma, as well.",
        "It would've denied me access to a high-paying job, to future education, and quite a bit of other things, while not even measuring my potential as a worker in the modern environment."

        "The people with special needs saying we ought to put this off for at least a year.",
        "Exactly, and they were able to win a one-year reprieve.",
        "I think the issues are going to come back next year, however, because, you know, the context hasn't changed dramatically.",
        "And one of the things that's controversial in California, is unlike in other states, there's no alternative in California.",
        "It's this test.",
        "Whereas in other states, if you don't pass the test, perhaps you could complete a special project, or you can figure out some other way to demonstrate that you've mastered the material that you need to know out of high school.",
        "But in California, the only way that you can demonstrate that is through this one, standardized test.",
        "And I've read some estimates that as many as 40,000 students or so are expected to fail.",
        "That's correct.",
        "It could be anywhere from ten to fifteen percent of the class of '06.",
        "And, you know, unfortunately, they won't know until mere weeks before graduation, because the results from this latest round of tests won't be in until mid to late May.",

        "Don't ever do this again ever, my sister.",
        "That's true.",
        "More than half of the states now require passage of some sort of test to receive a regular high school diploma, and this movement is spreading because, frankly, employers and institutions of higher learning no longer trust a regular high school diploma, that it represents a set of skills.",
        "And so the test has been added as a guarantee that students who graduate also possess the skills that they're supposed to.",
        "And, you know, I guess the concern is that it creates winners.",
        "People with diplomas have a more meaningful diploma.",
        "But it also creates losers.",
        "Well, not very many.",
        "Frankly, the number of students who are prevented from graduating solely because they can't pass an exit exam is quite small in most states.",
        "Most states who can't pass the exit exams are also unable to complete the other requirements of graduation, like taking a certain number of courses in particular subjects and receiving the appropriate grades.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And so to say that this is the one requirement ignores in fact that it's one of many requirements to graduate.",
        "Similarly a student who is unable to pass classes in reading or in math and can't receive the appropriate number of credits also cannot graduate.",
        "The difference is that we no longer trust, because of severe grade inflation, that the grades in those courses are meaningful, and that passing those courses alone guarantees that students possess skills.",
        "So, we've added a test, in many states, to try to improve our confidence in these diplomas."
