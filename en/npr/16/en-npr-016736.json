        "Employers will pay a high school graduate more than a non high school graduate who is African American or Hispanic.",

        "I would argue that the preponderance of evidence is now come out from research that shows that you don't really improve schools by focusing on standardized tests.",
        "What you do is you boost the test scores on the test that you teach to, but when you use independent measures, you don't find the results.",
        "Texas has been, for example, a serious indicator of that.",
        "According to the TAS test, the gap got closed between blacks and Latinos on one side, and whites on the other side.",
        "But when you look at the new test it put in and the NAPE(ph) test, you find out that wasn't true, in fact the gap had gotten wider and the Texas Higher Ed authorities said they had more need for remediation not less.",

        "And indeed, we have a problem where schools are often letting kids slide.",
        "What we are arguing for is, let's get the kinds of evidence out of the schools to make sure the schools are not letting them slide.",
        "But let's also get the evidence to make sure that the schools have themselves what they need to work with all the kids.",
        "What the California law suit showed that was the basis of part of our discussion is that there are horrendous inequities and kids are not being taught what they need.",
        "Again, a child who gets that diploma is better off, all else equal, than without it.",
        "And you know with all due respect to Jay, the evidence I've seen is generally having that diploma is a critical difference for your life chances and your income.",
        "Well, let's give Jay a chance to respond.",
        "And he's right, there have been some analyses that do show that the standardized test results are illusory.",
        "Well, actually we have a study that's in, just posted on Teacher College Record where we compare the results of high and low-stakes tests that were given to nine percent of all public school students nationwide and no one has an incentive to teach to, cheat on or otherwise manipulate the low-stakes tests.",
        "These are things like the Iowa Test of Basic Skills or the Stanford Nine that were given at the same time to the same kids.",
        "As it turns out the results of those two tests correlate really well.",
        "And so whatever teaching to is occurring with high-stakes tests, is good.",
        "Basically what's happening is it's guiding our teachers, our school system, telling them what it is that we want them to cover.",
        "So, rather than teachers covering whatever they may happen to like, which may or may not be the skills that our students need to succeed in life, what the test is helping do is informing school systems about what it is they need to cover and when schools are teaching to those tests, they're actually teaching skills that students need."

        "Here's an e-mail question, this from Andy.",
        "Good afternoon, if the student should fail this test, wouldn't that trigger a higher dropout rate among students?",
        "Well, the data is, Jay is right, the great majority of the kids who fail these tests are not doing well in school to start with, but there is a slice of students for whom it is clear it has propelled them, the failure on the test seems to have propelled them to drop out.",
        "There's also some evidence that we gathered in Massachusetts that the dropouts are leaving earlier and they're partly also dropping out because the grade retention is going up, and grade retention is a very powerful predictor of increased likelihood of dropping out.",
        "So, there is some effect.",
        "Now, it's interesting that in this debate you have both the argument that we need higher level tests and because their low level people aren't dropping out, I think the clear implication is that if the level on those tests gets more difficult, you'll have fewer people passing them and a greater dropout, at least in the short run.",
        "But I really have to add one other thing.",

        "Independent panels in Massachusetts and New York have looked at them, they really aren't very good tests, and they certainly don't meet what our kids need to know to succeed in college.",
        "Now if we want to improve the quality we have to go improve the quality of the actual teaching and learning, use better measures, but again, there's no need to make it narrow high stakes.",
        "We're talking about exit exams for high school and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",

        "Scott's calling us from Manheim in Germany.",
        "Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my call.",
        "Yeah, here in Germany, we don't have standardized tests for the whole country, but we have them for each state.",
        "And the state I live in, Baden-Württemberg, for example, you have to be able to recognize three of the Beethoven symphonies in order to pass the high school test.",
        "So, I would be curious to see what your panel thinks of that, and what do people really need to know?",
        "And what do people really need to know?",
        "That's, I'm not sure that I could pass the Beethoven symphony test, but if it's Gershwin I might do better.",
        "But, Jay Greene, what do people really need to know?",
        "The only reason that I'm happy about publicizing it is because there's so much negative news.",
        "Well, this is why we have 50 different states, and different countries have different tests.",
        "And so, each state gets to decide for itself what it thinks its students need to know.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And frankly, in Germany perhaps it's quite important to know how to recognize certain symphonies, and so we allow that kind of flexibility by having a lot of different tests based on each community's particular needs.",
        "But I think that, again, one thing that I want to respond to that Monty was saying earlier is that we're not sufficiently giving resources to schools and how can we hold them accountable if we're not given them sufficient resources.",
        "It's important to point out that we have actually doubled per pupil spending, adjusted for inflation, over the last 30 years, so we're now spending more than $10,000 per pupil.",
        "And during this time, test scores have been flat.",
        "Graduation rates have been flat.",
