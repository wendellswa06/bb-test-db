        "Okay.",
        "And let me put this question to you Monty Neill, E-mail question from Ryan Levinson(ph) in San Diego, How do the GED and exit exam compare?",
        "If a student can take the GED for an equivalency diploma, can they take the exit exam early to get an actual diploma?",
        "Which exam is harder, and if the GED is harder, then how can the difference be reconciled, considering the end result of the student is essentially the same, i.e., completion of high school.",
        "Well, one, the GED, economic reviews show the GED is simply not as valuable as a high school diploma.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Exactly why that's the case is a matter of debate, but it seems pretty clear that's now true.",
        "The GED was recently made more difficult.",
        "As to whether it is more difficult that the high school exit exam, you have to do a state-by-state comparison.",
        "It may be more difficult in some and easier in others and I don't think any such study has been done.",
        "It's very difficult to do because you can't just simply look at the questions, you'd have to give these different tests to different people.",
        "To different groups of people, but...",
        "And probably pay them to spend their time doing it so...",
        "Would you say their about the equivalent, Jay?",
        "Yeah, I agree with Monty that I don't think anyone precisely knows and it may be that in some states it's harder and in some states it's easier.",
        "The fact that it's not the same difficulty to receive a high school diploma everywhere in the country, and in fact in every school, is okay.",
        "Again, it reflects some various in local standards and so I'm not too troubled by the fact that the GED may not be exactly the same as exit exams.",
        "And another quick e-mail, this from Shara(ph) in New York.",
        "With special needs, learning disabled children is there some discussion of allowing these kids extra time to complete the exam, are the allotted the same amount of time to complete it, and does a student's score appear on his or her permanent school record or is it merely pass/fail?",
        "And I guess that would vary from state to state as well."

        "In fact, they often are not, and this has led to the basis of several lawsuits.",
        "That decision in California your reporter referred to at the beginning of the broadcast, that legislative action was taken in response to a court decision.",
        "And, in fact, the people are back in court because they are arguing on several different grounds, the unfairness to the kids and the lack of resources and the lack of accommodations, in some cases, are all issues at play in whether or not to use that test for students in California with disabilities.",

        "Iraq's marshlands at one time sustained as many as half a million people, but when the people known as the marsh Arabs supported a Shiite uprising after the 1991 Gulf War, Saddam Hussein built dams, dikes and canals to deflect water away from the 3,600-square-mile basin between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.",
        "Water to marshlands was allowed to flow once again after the US invasion of Iraq, and the area is starting to look again like what some people thought was the biblical Garden of Eden.",

        "Oh, my goodness, Neal.",
        "There's actually--before I came to talk to you, I was in Montreal attending a scientific conference publishing the results of our two years' worth of collection of data.",
        "And the scientific conclusion of monitoring the areas that have been inundated and recovered indicates that the biodiversity, for some strange reason, of the re-inundated areas is, in fact, more diverse and more vigorous than the portion of the marshes that remained undried, the 7 percent that existed between Iraq and Iran, the Hawizeh Marsh.",
        "And this is actually probably a support for the theory of evolution, as it were, in the sense that the drying caused possibly the survival of the most vigorous of these seed beds, and the more dynamic of the species that were basically on the perimeter of the marshes.",
        "And the reintroduction of the water caused a cycle of rebirth that is even stronger than the static conditions of the Hawizeh Marsh.",
        "We're still trying to look at the data and trying to figuring out why is that.",
        "It's an incredible story."
