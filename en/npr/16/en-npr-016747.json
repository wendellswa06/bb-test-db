        "A bit, but there's also a lot of other things involved.",
        "A week before Congressman Akin had come out against the school lunch program - saying he was opposed to federal involvement in the school lunch program - he's very conservative on a number of issues, and a lot of people are just now been paying attention to what he's been saying.",
        "On the other hand, Senator McCaskill, Claire McCaskill has her own set of issues.",
        "She has been hammered by the Republicans for a couple years now for her perceived closeness to President Obama and also her own problems with a plane that her family failed to pay property tax on for three years here in St. Louis County.",
        "And finally, we've seen an ad from the Akin campaign attacking Claire McCaskill, and we played her ad attacking him last week.",
        "This is what his ad sounds like.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT)",
        "Ever wonder why Claire McCaskill called the stimulus bill wildly successful, the stimulus that didn't create jobs but cost us billions?",
        "Well, now we know: The stimulus made McCaskill rich, more than $1 million paid to partnerships owned by McCaskill's family.",
        "When she gives us excuses, just remember this:",
        "There was a group that went through the bill line by line.",
        "Claire McCaskill, getting rich off us, line by line.",
        "And that might be an effective ad, it might not be, but it's no good at all if nobody sees it.",
        "Is there any money to run that ad?",
        "There's very little, but I think one of the reasons they put it out, they only earmarked about $50,000 in airtime, which is small, even by Missouri standards.",
        "But I think they're hoping that some national groups come in.",
        "However, there is a problem with that ad.",
        "It's - all of our studies looking at it at the Beacon but also other news outlets; it's inaccurate."

        "A political ad that's not completely accurate?",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "Yes, yes, it's inaccurate, and I'm not taking sides on this, but the HUD documents will show that while her husband, who is a wealthy developer, did have - does have a role in a number of these partnerships that actually his share of it, which was stipulated on her financial disclosure reform, was $26,000 for all of these, not a million.",
        "OK, so as we go through this, there's also been debates between the candidates.",
        "How has that come out?",
        "Well, there's only been one so far, and this was about a week and a half ago.",
        "And it was - they pretty much plowed some similar ground, but this was the first time they'd both been on the same stage together.",
        "And Congressman Akin, as I said, who is very conservative, is very clear, making clear his points about less government, more freedom, as he calls it.",
        "And he is critical of Social Security and Medicare, a number of things.",
        "McCaskill was pointing some of that stuff out, and again, he was pointing her closest to the president.",
        "Now, he contends that she was not ladylike enough in that forum, although actually if you listen to it, eh, it's not that, it wasn't that harsh on either side.",
        "And afterwards she characterized her opponent this way.",
        "This is somebody who kind of makes Michele Bachmann look like a hippie.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "And Ken, a real issue for Republicans now, national Republicans, who said hands off Akin after the legitimate rape comment, they now see their prospects of taking over control of the Senate slipping away unless they can win in Missouri."

        "Well, it's iffy with or without Akin, but a lot of Republicans - I mean, we've seen this both with Roy Blunt and Kit Bond, senator and former senator here in Missouri, and as well nationally, as well, saying that, look, we distanced ourselves clearly, completely from Todd Akin's remark, but we need four seats, three if Romney wins, to win back the Senate.",
        "And Claire McCaskill until this comment was very, very vulnerable.",
        "As Jo said, the Air Claire comment about her plane and things like that, her perceived closeness to Obama.",
        "So they want the seat, and a lot of them are willing to go past the Akin apology.",
        "And Jo Mannies, she all but campaigned for Todd Akin in the Republican primary, and would any of the other Republicans in that primary have been more difficult for her?",
        "Yes, I think there's no question.",
        "In fact, I wrote a story this week that said this is an unusual matchup of the candidate who was supposed to have no chance of winning re-election against the candidate who was supposed to have no chance of winning the primary.",
        "All the polls had showed that Akin was not supposed to be winning the primary, but he did.",
        "He did handily.",
        "Congressman Akin often underperforms in polls.",
        "So even some of these polls that show her with a few points ahead, that's something that most of us who have been covering him for a long time keep that in mind.",
        "He often underpolls.",
        "He actually performs better on election night.",
        "So too close to call at this stage?",
        "Correct.",
        "He has a base of supporters, homeschoolers, social conservatives who will come out no matter what.",
        "It doesn't matter what the weather is, doesn't matter anything.",
        "They will come out.",
        "And so he has before beaten better known rivals who he wasn't supposed to win, and so that could happen.",
        "I think it is too close to call, I really do.",
        "Ken?",
        "One thing that perhaps may hurt Akin is the fact that - understanding out there that Mitt Romney will take Missouri, and the Romney camp knows that.",
        "And because of that, they're taking resources out of the state and focusing them elsewhere, like in Florida, Virginia, where it's very, very close.",
        "So if there's a lack of Republican money in there, that could also hurt Akin's attempt at winning."

        "Right, Chris Christie thinks something dramatic will happen, and something dramatic could happen, but whether it will change the numbers is another thing.",
        "But obviously, Romney wants to make the point that the president is a great orator, he knows what he's doing, and he's been very successful at this.",
        "And the Obama people have been saying that Mitt Romney had 23 debates this year, and he really wiped out the rest of the Republican field because of his showings in the debate.",

        "Anything he's got, any ammo in his locker, he's going to see if he can get it off tonight.",
        "Really, it's his last chance to make a first impression with many voters.",
