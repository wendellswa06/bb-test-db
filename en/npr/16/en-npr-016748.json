        "My question for both of them would be that 22 percent of children in this country (unintelligible) live in poverty, and I'd like to see what either candidate would address, since I haven't seen that number be brought up in any form in the national discussion.",
        "Ken, poverty, in general, has, well, not gotten a lot of attention, except in the 47 percent discussion.",
        "No.",
        "And Mitt Romney has still not recovered from that, and that's really because he was starting to make a move, even though that there was momentum coming out of the Democratic Convention, Romney was ostensibly going to make the move, and then he's been saddled by that 47 percent.",
        "But Republicans can make the case that, look.",
        "We still have 8-plus percent unemployment, which no president since FDR has been elected with that high of an unemployment number.",
        "So the people are still enmeshed in poverty.",
        "There's still unemployment, still no great sense that things will change.",
        "But the latest polls show that more people are confident about the future than they have been before, and obviously, that's a good plus for the president."
