        "It has absolutely gotten toxic.",
        "I think it started - perhaps, it started with Bill Clinton in '92, followed by George W.",
        "Bush, followed by Barack Obama.",
        "There are several reasons.",
        "First of all, I think a lot of the stuff you get from cable television - and I'm singling out Fox News and MSNBC - they seemed to like to rile up their supporters and - by preaching to the converted.",
        "There's no reason for anybody to tone down their rhetoric.",
        "But also, we've seen - when there are several members of Congress who try to work with the other side, Republicans trying to work with Democrats and vice versa, they're almost immediately challenged as either traitors or sellouts or being hit with primary challenges from the right or the left.",
        "So you can talk about bipartisanship and reaching across party lines, but the folks back home, the ideologues back home really don't want it.",
        "And it's a byproduct of the primary system where, in Republican primaries, you generally win by outflanking to the right, and in Democratic primaries, a lot of places, you can win by outflanking to the left.",
        "And it's going to be interesting to see what happens this year in California, which has a new system this year.",
        "Right.",
        "What happens in California - and we saw this in the June primary - everybody runs on the same two - the ballot, all the candidates, regardless of party.",
        "And the top two finishers move on to November.",
        "So there will be a lot of Democrat versus Democratic and Republican versus Republican, especially in congressional races.",
        "So I think the answer to your question, Eric, is that every challenger has an advantage on this question, because they can promise to change this for the better.",
        "Every incumbent has a real disadvantage, because they already know it's not going to change any time soon.",
        "But thanks very much for the call.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "There's a question here at the microphone in Saint Louis.",
        "Yes.",
        "My name is William from Chesterfield, Missouri.",
        "I'd specifically like to ask the candidates what policies would they advocate for to address education in this country, specifically to - to address high school dropouts, to close what is referred to as the achievement gap, to raise K-12 academic gains across the board and to keep college affordable and accessible for all.",
        "Well, we already talked about that last point with an earlier questioner.",
        "The dropout rate, this is an indictment of American education, Ken.",
        "That's absolutely true, and especially if you compare it to European nations, what's it like.",
        "And I have not seen - I mean, it's clearly a problem.",
        "It's growing problem, and we've seen it from more than just the Obama administration.",
        "But again, with all the issues out there, I have not seen this addressed as fully by the candidates this time.",
        "And let's see if we can get another caller in on the conversation.",

        "And again, I think this is something that - it's very likely to come up tonight, Ken.",

        "And we saw that when Mitt Romney named Paul Ryan as his running mate, we thought that this would be the overriding issue in his campaign.",
        "For better or for worse, Paul Ryan will make the case that the - Social Security, Medicare is in danger of getting - going broke, and there need to be cuts, serious cuts.",
        "But at the same time, there are a lot of seniors, a lot of people who are just frightened by the thought of long-time entitlement program being weakened.",
        "So I guarantee that will come up this year.",

        "It's an earned credit.",
        "People paid into this their whole lives.",
        "But I think it's fair to point out that both Republicans and Democrats at this point, I think, say this would not change under anybody's program for anybody over the age of 55.",
        "Well, that's, you know, that's certainly the Paul Ryan/Romney point, although a lot of people like to call it the Romney/Ryan campaign.",
        "But, obviously, all the issues about Medicare - once Romney picked Ryan, that was the poster for the Democrats there.",

        "Washington himself was a victim of some of this.",
