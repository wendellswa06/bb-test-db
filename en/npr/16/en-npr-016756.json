        "The administration needs a lot of Republican support.",
        "It takes 67 votes to ratify a treaty.",
        "The treaty has 58 votes on the Democratic and independent side.",
        "That leaves nine Republican votes to get to 67, a heretofore impossible task on major issues.",
        "Nevertheless...",
        "We do see that there is a momentum moving in a good direction.",
        "That's Rose Gottemoeller, assistant secretary of state for arms control and one of the chief negotiators of the treaty.",
        "Right now, only three Republican senators - Richard Lugar of Indiana, and Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine - are on record supporting the treaty.",
        "But based on various comments that other Republicans have made, there could be as many as eight more Republican votes in favor.",
        "More than enough, says Daryl Kimball of the Arms Control Association, to ratify New START.",

        "You can't say the GOP opposes New START.",
        "You've got Republican senators who want to do this.",

        "And because they say the treaty would limit the development of an effective missile-defense system.",

        "Could you kill three to five key leaders of al-Qaida in Pakistan and have al-Qaida in Pakistan be so significantly weakened that it was very difficult for it to launch any attack against the West of any sophistication?",
        "Yes, I actually think that's possible.",
        "The list would include leaders like Ayman al-Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden's replacement, as well as longtime operatives with experience planning attacks.",
        "But Leiter says that wouldn't necessarily end the threat.",
        "It would be a meaningful tactical step toward defeating that specific enemy, but it doesn't speak to the broader terrorist threat which is emanating from the region or the broader specific threat from al-Qaida.",
        "In other words, the U.S.",
        "needs to worry about more than just a handful of bin Laden associates hiding out in Pakistan.",
        "Now al-Qaida, which means the base in Arabic, isn't just a group but is becoming more of a movement with global reach.",
        "A movement like al-Qaida that's more than two decades old, even as weak as it is now, its survival is not predicated on two to three people or four or five people."

        "For months now, officials have been making the case that al-Qaida's affiliates are America's chief concern.",
        "Al-Qaida's arm in Yemen, for example, has leveled a number of attacks against the U.S.",
        "in the past two years but those were independent operations, and al-Qaida's core had little to do with them.",
        "So in a sense the terrorist threat has moved beyond bin Laden's replacement and the men around him in Pakistan.",
        "What's more, other Islamist groups - groups that haven't adopted al-Qaida's name - are starting to target the U.S., and they wouldn't be affected if al-Qaida's top tier was eliminated.",

        "TTP, the Haqqani Network - these groups vaguely subscribe to al-Qaida's ideology, but they have a completely different leadership.",
