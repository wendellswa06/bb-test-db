        "Steve, welcome back.",
        "Oh, glad to be back, Renee.",
        "And Steve, as many listeners well know, has just returned from Karachi, Pakistan.",
        "And over a couple of weeks, he did some reports to start a series called The Urban Frontier.",
        "And we're going to report on a number of cities at home and abroad.",
        "And of course, Karachi being one of those megacities that we'll be talking about in the future - Steve, it raises a question, now that you're back: Do other cities look different to you, having just spent this time in Karachi?",
        "Oh, they do, Renee.",
        "And this is a subject that I've been fascinated about for years.",
        "I've read a lot about different cities around the world, and we shouldn't compare them too much.",
        "Every city grows in a unique way.",
        "And yet listen to this piece of tape that we played last week from the mayor of Karachi, one of the world's largest cities.",
        "The mayor is Syed Mustafa Kamala.",
        "My city is a dirty city.",
        "It's not clean.",
        "The garbage is the main problem.",
        "But think about that for a minute.",
        "We've got this huge city with huge problems, huge ethnic issues, religious issues, in a country that's concerned about democracy and dictatorship, concerned about the future of Islam.",
        "And yet when you get down to the city level, it gets down to the same question that people often face in Chicago: who's picking up my garbage, and am I going to be happy with the government if they're not picking up my garbage?",
        "It's a very familiar discussion to a lot of people.",
        "And as I've studied this, I've begun to see many more parallels.",
        "I came home from this trip and opened my newspaper, and there I am reading about water shortages in your state, Renee, in California, that are impeding development in many cities, and it turns out Karachi is facing the same problem, only in a more extreme way.",
        "They've had to build a huge desalination plant, use salt water, make it drinking water, and they're considering more.",
        "And so you have this situation where cities around the world are facing similar problems.",
        "Now, one thing about Karachi that came out in your reports is the ethnic politics of that city.",
        "There was also political violence there.",
        "How much of that felt familiar to you?",
        "Well, I mean the ethnic politics, the identity politics certainly feels familiar.",
        "That's something you get all over the world, including the United States.",
        "And you also do get a reminder in a place like this that it can go too far.",
        "And one of the many people we heard from was an ambulance driver who was nearly killed because he was just the wrong shade of person in the wrong place during a gun battle.",
        "They took him, you know, out of the ambulance for shooting purpose.",
        "They wanted to kill him because of his appearance.",
        "And I yelled at him, do not shoot, he's our man."

        "And there you go, Renee, the contrast of the challenges for this city.",
        "They can devolve into group identities and ethnic politics and tear each other apart.",
        "And I should mention that there are efforts, even in the last few weeks, in Karachi to avoid that, to make sure the different political parties and ethnic groups come together at least a little bit, at least have a truce.",
        "They can devolve into that or they can concentrate on making a living or, if you like, making money.",
        "Each one of those issues gets right back to the question of land and who controls it, who controls the real estate, who gets to live on it.",
        "That's a fundamental question that people are battling over or arguing over all over the world.",
        "And how we decide those questions could have a lot to do with our future.",
        "And in the future on this program, we will be looking at some of those questions in other cities.",

        "Children in Britain, the U.S.",
        "and many other Western countries are usually given the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine at age 1.",
        "But when three researchers, led by Dr. Andrew Wakefield, published their report linking that vaccine to autism in 1998, it unleashed an anti-vaccine movement in the U.S.",
        "and in Britain that had long been dormant.",
        "Late last month, an official British medical investigation found Wakefield's methods, quote, \"\"dishonest and irresponsible.\"\" Among other things, the panel found he handpicked the children used in the study, but Wakefield dismissed the findings.",
        "The allegations against me and against my colleagues are both unfounded and unjust.",
        "I repeat unfounded and unjust.",
        "One of the most passionate advocates for childhood vaccinations is Dr. Paul Offit.",
        "He's the co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine and the head of infectious diseases at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia.",

        "Thank you.",
        "How important was Dr. Wakefield's study linking autism to the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella to kick starting the anti-vaccine movement here in the United States?",
        "Well, I would say the anti-vaccine movement really started in the early 1980s with a television show called \"\"DPT Vaccine Roulette\"\" that aired initially on a local D.C.",
        "affiliate and then was on the \"\"Today Show\"\" and took off.",
        "I think that was the birth of the modern American anti-vaccine movement, which largely floundered after that.",
        "I think it sort of lost steam.",
        "But that was certainly regenerated when, in 1998, Dr. Wakefield and his colleagues published that paper in Lancet.",
        "And what was the result of that paper's publication?",

        "I'm Robert Siegel.",
        "For a lot of bands it was really bad, and for the industry overall it was very bad.",
        "You know, it's hard to tell exactly how bad but you can say it was down in double digits in both attendance and gross dollars.",
        "Acts as big as the Eagles and Rihanna canceled shows.",
        "Hundreds of millions of dollars were lost.",
        "I think that one of the problems that we've had in the past is that we've treated this industry as though one size fits all.",
        "Mark Campana is co-president of North American concerts for Live Nation, the biggest concert promoter in the world.",
        "We know that our attendance was down and we know that ultimately there was a great deal of discounting done in the marketplace in order to drive sales."

        "When the company tried to unload unsold tickets by offering discounts, it really upset fans who had bought tickets early at full price.",

        "The company will do away with many fees, like the ones you used to have to pay to print your own tickets at home.",
        "There will be discounts if you buy early.",
        "And the company has a new pricing model: It's called dynamic pricing but it's basically just many different tiers of tickets at different prices.",
        "It promises to lower the average cost of tickets while offering expensive options to fans who can afford them.",
        "This summer, Ray Waddell says, promoters seem to be taking lessons from those few tours last year that did work.",
        "They had to have a show that was very attractive to consumers, something different like Roger Waters' The Wall or James Taylor, Carole King, or it had to be, as in the case with the last one I mentioned, it had to be a really strong package with a lot of value.",
        "So, value and packaging are the guiding lights of this summer's tours.",
        "Live Nation is sending John Legend on the road with Sade and Cee Lo Green out with Rihanna - artists who could headline their own tours, sharing the bill in arenas or amphitheaters in order to lower the risk that their shows won't sell out.",
