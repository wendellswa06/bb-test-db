        "Not just this vaccine but other vaccines, as well.",
        "I think as a consequence of that papers being published, we had a measles epidemic in 2008 that was bigger than anything we'd seen in more than a decade.",
        "There were a little over 130 cases of measles, with some children being hospitalized.",
        "But in the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was far worse.",
        "There were hundreds of children who were hospitalized, and four children died.",
        "I mean, died of the false notion that the MMR vaccine could cause autism.",
        "Now his paper in Lancet didn't confirm a link between autism and the MMR vaccine, but it strongly suggested that there could be a link.",
        "When it first came out in 1998, were you intrigued at all, I mean, or were you skeptical right away?",
        "Oh, I think anybody that saw that paper saw it as a very thin, flimsy piece of evidence.",
        "I mean, it was not a study at all.",
        "All it was, was a report of 12 children, eight of whom had been diagnosed with autism within a month of receiving the MMR vaccine, and it was Dr. Wakefield's contention that these children also had intestinal inflammation.",
        "It should have never been allowed to be published.",
        "I mean, we really shouldn't be able to publish hypotheses.",
        "I could, for example, argue that I think peanut butter sandwiches cause leukemia.",
        "I'm sure I can find five children with leukemia who had eaten peanut butter sandwiches in the last month.",
        "I would like to think that wouldn't get published.",
        "I'd like to believe that the editor would come back to me and say, you know, you have to look at tens of thousands of children who either do or don't eat peanut butter sandwiches to see whether or not the instance of leukemia is greater in the peanut-butter-sandwich-eating group.",
        "Why do you think so many parents, even parents who do immunize their children, believe some of these findings?",
        "The notion that this could be a cause was seductive.",
        "Certainly, the medicine had little to offer to counter that.",
        "All that medicine could say was that it's not this.",
        "And I think for parents who are looking for an answer - and in this case, it was an easy answer - it was very seductive, even though it was wrong.",
        "Dr.",
        "Offit, this is no news to you, but you are actually a lightening rod for those who oppose or who are anti-vaccine.",
        "You've actually received death threats from people who believe you are profiting from what they call the vaccine industry.",
        "I don't work for the pharmaceutical industry.",
        "I am an employee of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.",
        "And the reason that I went into pediatrics, or the reason that I had children, or the reason that I worked on a vaccine that can save children's lives is I feel a deep and abiding love of children.",
        "It's why I do what I do.",
        "You know, in a better world, and it's clearly a world in which we don't live, it wouldn't be about me any more than it would be about Andrew Wakefield.",
        "It would simply be about the science.",
        "I mean, it's unfortunate that we feel the need to attach personalities to these hypotheses.",
        "It's perfectly reasonable to have the hypothesis that MMR caused autism.",
        "You can argue my child was fine from a parent standpoint, then they got a vaccine, then they weren't fine anymore.",
        "The good news is that that's a testable hypothesis, and it has been tested.",
        "And you'd like to believe that once, and in this case tens of millions of dollars have been spent trying to address these parents' concerns, that the parents would believe the science.",
        "But instead it sort of devolves, I think unfortunately, into this kind of battle of personalities."
