        "AIG was once the world's biggest insurance company, with operations in more than 130 countries around the world.",
        "But CEO Edward Liddy told NBC's \"\"Today Show\"\" this morning the detour from traditional life and property insurance into complex financial products has been disastrous.",
        "Our insurance policy holders, they are in good shape.",
        "They're secure.",
        "They're protected.",
        "It's all of the other ancillary businesses that are causing this, and it's the decline in asset values around the globe.",
        "AIG has been trying to sell off parts of its business, but Liddy says would-be buyers are having trouble raising money as a result of the worldwide credit crunch.",
        "He made no promises during a conference call this morning about how quickly the restructuring might be completed.",
        "You know, we'd like to do it tomorrow.",
        "But the practical reality is the marketplace is a pretty crummy place to be right now.",
        "You all see that.",
        "When the world catches pneumonia, we get it, too, in spades because we are so large.",
        "We want to execute this plan in a diligent and deliberate fashion as quickly as we can.",
        "AIG almost didn't get that chance.",
        "Credit rating agencies were considering downgrading the company, a move which might have forced AIG to post billions it didn't in collateral.",
        "That downgrade was headed off, though, when the federal government stepped in to rescue the company for the fourth time since September.",
        "They did get a little bit more breathing room.",
        "Morningstar analyst Bill Bergman says the Treasury Department is buying extra time for AIG by making available another $30 billion from the bank bailout fund.",
        "The government is willing to forego dividends on that money and another $40 billion the Treasury had already loaned AIG.",
        "The government also agreed to accept a lower interest rate on money the company borrowed from the Federal Reserve.",
        "They made a lot more money available on top of the money that was already there, and they also eased the terms on which people can access that funding.",
        "So why is the government being such a pushover?",
        "Two words: systemic risk.",
        "AIG is so entangled with its insurance customers and big banks, that allowing it to fail would pose huge risk to the taxpayers and the economy as a whole.",
        "CEO Liddy says much of the money the government has already loaned his company quickly made its way to the coffers of other firms.",
        "This flow of funds through AIG to other financial institutions is a good indication of how intertwined we are with the global capital markets and how government actions that have been thought of as strictly assistance to AIG have benefited the entire financial sector."

        "Billionaire investor Warren Buffett warned in his annual letter to shareholders over the weekend complex financial products like the ones AIG was selling are a time bomb precisely because of this web of mutual dependence.",

        "It's not just whom you sleep with, but also whom they're sleeping with.",
        "AIG, for instance, might have been in a contract with one other bank, but that other bank is also - it has contracts with three or four or five or 60 other different banks.",
        "Bergman's favorite line in the Buffett letter is the one that comes next.",
        "Summing up the notion of systemic risk, Buffett wrote: Companies with the best chance of getting government help when they're in trouble are the ones that sleep around.",
        "There's an incentive to, you know, to threaten us and perhaps even cause the loss that's being insured against, because that helps get your government aid.",

        "Isn't it fair to say, though, that the Taliban would be negotiating, at this point, from a position of strength and the Afghan government would not?",
        "This is - you're absolutely right.",
        "These kind of talks will succeed only if we speak from the position of strength first, and second if the Taliban are assured that their local and foreign supporters and backups are diminishing.",
