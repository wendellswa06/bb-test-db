        "Because this migration policy that China has in Tibet have encouraging thousands of Chinese traders to move to Tibet has been very provocative.",
        "And one of the problems with it is that the Chinese dont allow anybody to discuss this.",
        "No Tibetan is allowed to criticize that policy and I think we see today one of the classic examples of what human rights people say which is if you dont allow a certain amount of freedom of expression, you tend to create bigger problems for yourself further down the line with just peoples acute anger and frustration.",
        "The frustration and the anger that youre talking about, is it because China is seen as essentially suffocating Tibetan culture and denying freedoms?",
