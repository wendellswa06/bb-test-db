        "The problem is that theyre made to live with the Chinese people - just really they end up not by force but by some kind of social policy pressure, leads them to have to live in the Chinese language environment where their own culture is very much denigrated, really.",
        "Unidentified Boy #5: Aiyah!",
        "But the real pressure has come from the Chinese policy on religion which is not even its official policy.",
        "It's a kind of secret policy for Tibet and also in Xinjiang(ph), the Muslim restive area to the north where all students in universities and at most schools, and all government workers, you know, even the girl who cleans the floor in the dormitory where we live, none of them are allowed any religious practice if theyre Tibetans and if theyre Buddhists, its not admitted by the state and yet it dominates the lives of probably half of the urban population.",

        "But I have a feeling that it isnt whats going to happen politically once behind the doors of the monasteries and once the phone lines have been cut off.",
        "Some people say they have been in Lhasa, I think, were probably going to see a return to their traditional heavy-handed politics of Chinas leaders - the Communist Party ruling the borderlands with a very heavy fist.",
        "I hate to put you in a position of predicting disaster, but are you anticipating a crackdown on the scale of what we saw in Tiananmen Square in 1989?",
        "No, I dont think were going to see hundreds of dead.",
        "The Chinese are very aware of what theyre doing and they will know how far to go and when to stop.",
        "And the people in the streets will also get over what must be an emotionally, terribly dangerous time for them when they quite clearly - we know this from numerous phone calls and messages during the night - that people are enormously exhilarated and many people described it as weeping with relief at being able to finally show again after 20 years what they actually feel.",
        "That exhilaration is going to fade off as they see the bodies in the streets and hear the sound of gunfire, and people are going to, as it always happens, they'll quickly realize that theres a very severe prospects, a very tough time is ahead.",
        "Weve been talking with Robbie Barnett, adjunct professor of contemporary Tibetan studies at Columbia University.",

        "If a politician can't lie, what's left?",
        "Washington was one of more than a dozen states with laws making it illegal to say false things about a candidate for office.",
        "Last week, the Washington State Supreme Court, by a 5-4 vote, held the law unconstitutional.",
        "Justice James Johnson wrote for the majority that the notion of the government as the final arbiter of truth was fundamentally at odds with the First Amendment.",
