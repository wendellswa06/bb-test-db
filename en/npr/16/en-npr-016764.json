        "Albertine, Lee writes after he takes a dose, was like a soup of New York City neon.",
        "She was a catalog of demonic euphonies.",
        "And the memories that conjures up: It's the all-stars, he writes, laying down their groove and it's you dancing, chasing the desperations of the heart, chasing something that's so gone, so ephemeral, you know it only by its traces - how a certain plucked guitar string summons the thundering centuries, how a taste of fresh cherries calls up the indolent romancers on antebellum porches."
