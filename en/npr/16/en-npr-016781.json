        "Hi, Farai.",
        "Good to talk with you.",
        "Well, tell us a little bit about the importance of Unity, first of all, and about this conference.",
        "Well, the Unity Conference is - the Unity group is a coalition of the Journalists of Color Organization, the National Association of Black Journalists, National Association of Hispanic Journalists, Asian-American Journalists Association, and Native American Journalists Association.",
        "And it is, as you said, the largest assemblage of journalists of color in the country and possibly the world, even though we are not sure about that.",
        "But in any case, they have been doing this since 1994.",
        "They restate - did it every five years.",
        "They it rescheduled to every four years to take advantage of the presidential election years.",
        "Richard, let me ask you just to cut in a little bit, about the importance of this conference.",
        "I mean, four years ago, you had a huge amount of political participation in terms of people who came, who were candidates, or of course the sitting President.",
        "What's the importance of this convention politically?",
        "What has it been in terms of journalist?",
        "Sure.",
        "Well, last year, both Senator Obama and Senator Clinton were at the National Association of Black Journalists Convention.",
        "At that time, the talk and all the media was, is Obama black enough?",
        "This was an occasion, and he's used the occasion to address that issue and say - and he said enough already, you know, I am definitely black enough.",
        "After that, he went and talked with the Trotter Group, which is the group of African-American columnists.",
        "And at that meeting, we saw a more nuanced version of Obama who had a black perspective on world events and on national events.",
        "You can't underestimate the importance of being able to reach journalists who are spreading the message as perhaps this week's flap over the New Yorker illustrates.",
        "Now we spoke with Unity President Karen Lincoln Michel.",
        "She said that this report was, quote, \"\"inaccurate\"\" and she said she was unable to confirm their attendance, said that Obama would release a schedule in the next 24 hours which would clarify his attendance.",
        "What do you make of that?",
        "Well, all I know is that the press secretary for the German prime minister announced today that Obama will be meeting with Angela Merkel, the prime minister of Germany, that same day.",
        "So it could be that maybe they are trying to get Obama to come some other day, but it's not going to be that day.",
        "And McCain of course, is scheduled to be in Columbus, Ohio at the Lance Armstrong's \"\"Live Strong\"\", a town hall meeting and event for cancer research.",
        "If your report is correct, what does it say, if anything, about the influence of this group and what I mean specifically is that we have seen just this week, both candidates speak to the NAACP.",
        "And what makes Unity different is that it really is this conglomeration of the black, Latino, Asian-American, and Native American journalist groups.",
        "But does this kind of mean that the diversity moment is over?",
        "That there's just enough room for two in ten days?",
        "No, I am not sure about that.",
        "Both candidates also have sought Latino votes like going to Latino organizations.",
        "And every time I would ask the McCain campaign about attending Unity, they would always say, well, you know he is going to the Urban League and the NAACP.",
        "So that's the way they look at it.",
        "They are not really looking at this as journalists, I don't think, as, you know, which interest groups can I check off, which boxes should I check off for various interest groups.",
        "And McCain has checked off his black box and so therefore he didn't feel the need, and the Latino box with the Latinos to attend Unity.",
        "All right, well, I want to thank you so much for your time."

        "I was signed for eight years and $136 million by the cubs, and so -",

        "I mean, Alfonso Soriano, late of the Yankees and the Rangers signed for eight years and $136 million with the Cubs.",
        "Carlos Lee who was a pretty one-dimensional slugger got $100 million from the Astros and Gary Matthews Jr. who's had only one good year got $50 million from the Angels.",
        "So teams have a lot of money and they're eager to spend it.",
        "Boston Red Sox have bid over $51 million for the right to negotiate with the Japanese pitcher.",
        "Well that number actually I think more has been made of that number than truly deserves.",
        "It's really a phantom number because that's only the number that they had to commit in order to speak with Matsuzaka.",
        "Who knows how the contract is going to be structured?",
        "Basically, all they did is they said the first $51 million of whatever we decide this fellow was worth is going to go to the Sabu(ph) Lions his former team by contract that he had, that they have with the pitcher.",
        "But, you know, there's all sorts of ways to structure the new contract with the pitcher that can be creatively done within the rules.",
        "And that can make the 51 seem a lot less than it does right now.",
        "And one of the most intriguing players out there, on any number of levels, is Barry Bonds, the multiple MVP award-winning outfielder, now for the San Francisco Giants who will, if unless, barring injury, break the all time home run record next season.",
        "Well he needs to play for a team first.",
        "He needs to find someone who wants to employ him and that's becoming increasingly difficult.",
        "Now, of course he will find someone because right now he's perceived asking price or perhaps literal asking prices too high and not enough teams want to deal with the distraction.",
        "And certainly, the Giants are a team that's put up with that distraction.",
        "They know that their fans like Barry Bonds.",
        "And so I think it's fair to say that the Giants will ultimately probably sign him because there aren't enough other suitors.",
        "But right now, I think Barry Bonds is dealing with the fact that many fewer people want him for anything close to the price that he and his nation want than he thought.",
        "And as he looks at the prices you mentioned that Alfonso Soriano is getting, he must be saying I'm Barry Bonds, why can't I make as much as Alfonso Soriano?",
        "Well, he's 41 or 42 years old and Alfonso Soriano is 30 and in his prime.",
        "Barry Bonds had his moment in the sun remember at the end of the 1992 winter meetings he signed, I think he was a $43, $75 million contract, which at that time was obscene.",
        "And he was the highest paid player in the game for, you know, probably about ten minutes until some utility infielder came along.",
        "Yeah, back then, we thought that was big bucks.",

        "Go ahead.",
        "Yeah, and Manny has been outstanding.",

        "He's very strange and he doesn't really get along with everyone in Boston.",
        "But he's simply too productive, and he's too important as a compliment to David Ortiz - their left handed slugger - to let him go.",
        "It's one thing if they could trade him for somebody really good in return and certainly if the expectation in Boston is that if they were to trade Manny Ramirez, they would sign J.D.",
        "Drew, the reasonably multi-talented outfielder who had been with the Dodgers, and much younger.",
        "But I still think that Boston isn't going to be able get enough for Manny Ramirez to have it make sense.",
        "But if he goes to the Giants, if they do trade Manny Ramirez to the Giants to play left field, that leaves no spot for Barry Bonds in San Francisco and makes it very interesting to see what happens with Barry.",
        "And the thought that then Barry might come to Boston where John, you'll not that he does also like David Ortiz's bad left-handed but I think they could work aware on that.",
