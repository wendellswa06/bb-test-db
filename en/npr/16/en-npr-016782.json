        "Dontrelle Willis, the wonderful lefthander for the Florida Marlins, might now be so expensive that the Marlins will decide to trade him, and you might find him in a large East coast market by the end of this week.",
        "I think it's unlikely but it's certainly possible.",
        "Manny Ramirez is somebody - the slugger for the Boston Red Sox - might be traded, and that is of course the previous caller brought, and Adam Dunn, a less known slugger for the Cincinnati Reds is someone who I think can be in play as well.",
        "We should watch out for him.",

        "He toured Iraq back in March, met with Iraqi and U.S.",
        "Military officials but he was not accompanied by any of this top network anchors.",
        "Is that a double standard?",
        "I think there has been a little bit in this area because it just seems like when you look at the reports across the nation, anything that Barack does related to the Muslim world, Islamic communities seems to get far more attention than the attention that we've been giving to Senator McCain in this area.",
        "And I think it's important for him to go, I think it's important for him to do, and in some ways maybe this is about answering a question a lot of voters have about him in terms of his foreign policy experience when it's stacked up against Senator McCain.",
        "Bruce, some conservatives are irked by this.",
