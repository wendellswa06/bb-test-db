        "Well, as I said, these things have been observed before, and we had a low-resolution view.",
        "So we knew that it looked like - that you could compare it a way like chainmail.",
        "It's individual proteins that assemble themselves.",

        "And so it turns out there's also a number of pathogens that wear these coats, and so we would really like to look at what they look like and how they're able to interact with the host.",
        "And another interest is that because they are these highly ordered structures - and really the proteins, they assemble themselves, and that's a property that material sciences are interested in.",

        "If the bacteria have this chainmail that surrounds them, how do nutrients and things get in and out of them?",
