        "You've seen them all the time on Flipper, things like that, and scientists studying dolphins have known for several years that each dolphin has its own distinct whistle, a signature whistle or a name, if you like.",
        "A dolphin voices its signal.",
        "Other dolphins in the area know who is doing the talking, so to speak.",
        "Well, now, one group of researchers has discovered that those whistles are even more unusual than they first thought.",
        "It turns out that the dolphins will understand the whistles even if they are manufactured, even if they're synthesized whistles.",

        "Thanks for inviting me.",
        "Tell us about these signals that they're making.",
        "Is it too much of a stretch to say that the dolphins have names and they're calling each other by these names?",
        "I think that's a pretty reasonable parallel, especially given that we found that they are able to recognize these signals based on just their structure and not by voice cues, which is the more typical way animals recognize each other, which is when, for example, somebody you know calls you on the phone and you recognize who they are without them even saying their name, and dolphins can do that too.",
        "So this latest research shows that, you aren't showing that the dolphins have the signature whistles, that you know that, but rather that other dolphins can recognize the whistles.",
        "Yes, and we knew that they could recognize natural whistles from a previous set of experiments, but what these experiments added to that was understanding how they recognize them, which is, again, using the structure of the sound rather than voice cues, sort of unintentional cues, which is what most other animals use."
