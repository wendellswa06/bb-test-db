        "Absolutely.",
        "The federal loans are typically a much better rate.",

        "Private loans are, and what students will find is that those loans are going to be a lot more stringent on the rates.",
        "When you get back into the repayment, sometimes they can be a little tougher to deal with as well.",
        "Now the other thing that you also want to take into consideration as a student is you don't want to consolidate your private loans along with your federal loans, Stafford loans, if you will.",
        "When you do that, the higher rate is going to apply; and if you consolidate the two of them, you may have lost a lot of benefit from those federal rates that you did have.",
        "So, in a way, it makes more sense to kind of pay off the private loans first.",
        "Is that what I'm hearing from you?",
        "I would do separate consolidations.",
        "OK.",
        "You can consolidate your private loans without having to tie in your federal loans.",
        "When you start tying in the federal loans with a private lender - they'll be more than happy to do it, but they're going to do so at a higher rate.",
        "Some people who I've met, who will remain nameless, have just said well, I'm just not going to pay.",

        "It's gone.",
        "That's not a good option for dealing with student loans at all.",
        "The student loan agencies, they are more than willing to work with former students, be they students who have dropped out of school or those students who have graduated from school.",
        "The key thing is to communicate with your lender to let them know what your current financial situation is.",
        "There are all sorts of tools and mechanisms that are available to students in order to be able to either postpone the immediate payment or to establish a payment plan so that they can actually handle it.",
        "But if you are not communicating with the lender, you're absolutely not going to see these loans go away.",
        "They just don't disappear.",
        "What about bankruptcy for people who may have had a setback?",
        "You are saying that, basically, talk your lender.",

        "When it comes out to student loans, bankruptcy is really not even a last resort tool anymore.",

        "In essence, they gave you a hardship exception but it's rare to see a hardship case really come through.",
        "In essence, what you need to be able to prove for a hardship case is to show that you can't restructure or make any kind of payments on these student loans at all.",
        "I'm hoping that it doesn't end up that the only field that we see from now going forward is billionaires.",
        "But sadly, we - that's the way we've been trending.",
        "The bankruptcy law that went into effect last October in fact made that even more difficult for students to deal with because before these loans we're really only talking about federal loans.",
        "And there was a discrepancy between whether the federal loans were the only ones which were exempt from discharge, or were all loans that were education-related exempt from discharge.",
        "Let's, briefly mention deferment.",

        "Short-term strategy?",
        "Neither?",
        "It might be the only strategy that works right now.",
        "Whatever you defer, I believe you're still accumulating the interests that those loans have.",
        "So you can defer and make interest-only payments or you could defer or not make payments at all.",
        "The problem is it's still there and you are not really dealing with the root of the problem.",
        "The root of the problem is that you have this enormous amount of debt.",

        "But there is still a great deal of debt out there for everybody.",
        "I know that when I was in law school, one of my advisers told me something that was very, very important at this point in my life.",
        "She said if you live like a lawyer when you are in law school, when you become a lawyer you're going to live like a law student.",
        "Meaning, simply this, the loan limits are very high these days for students to be able to take care of their housing, perhaps their transportation, their books, in addition to their tuition.",
        "You don't have to borrow all of the money that's there.",
        "We look very carefully at the schools that we choose to go to.",
        "We should also look very carefully at the money that we borrow to go to school.",
        "And we just simply don't do that.",
        "We have a way of taking the money because it's available and it's there for us to take without thinking about it down the road.",
