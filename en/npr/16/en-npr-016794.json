        "There is no reason beyond, you know some bureaucrat or feeling like he needs to be, you know very self-important and advising him that he could no longer do it.",
        "As we heard from Mark in Buffalo, there is technology available, encryption technology that could make it secure in the same way that a president's telephone calls are - are perfectly secure and have been for years.",
        "So, you know to me this is an example of - it's really sort of a non-issue.",
        "And it's an example of the kinds of things that come up when you do go in - in the bubble because it's always easier to say no than to say yes in a - in a strange way when it comes to national security issues of - of all kinds, that's one of the reasons why the whole eavesdropping thing got out of hand because if there was a question of do we eavesdrop or not, the safe answer would always be eavesdrop.",
        "When it comes to a question of can we secure the president's communication or not, the safe answer is, well have him not use a BlackBerry.",
        "So what - it's up to the president, and he hasn't made a decision on this by the way.",
        "It's not like he has agreed to have his BlackBerry taken away.",
        "It's in - it's up in the air right now but it's up to him to say no, I'm going to keep my BlackBerry and that should then set a tone for some other things.",
        "Now when it comes with physical safety, there he needs to defer to the Secret Service.",
        "But when it comes to through these bogus national security claims, he needs to be you know rather contrary in raising objections.",
        "No, no but it's the idea that you become so yeah the idea though is you become so comfortable with your BlackBerry that you might type something that you know wouldn't say in conversation or it slips out of your mouth."

        "And they can't do that anymore to the same extent.",
