        "It's nice to know that you have such an extended family, particularly when you look at the anthology that they created, so you get a true sense of, you know, how relationships go together.",

        "He began by paying homage to Sylvie.",

        "Our family's insistence on acknowledging our origins year after year intrigued the Library of Congress.",
        "Five years ago, it entered the clan into the Local Legacies division of its American Folklife archives.",
        "Dr. James Billington, the librarian of Congress, came down for the weekend with a crew of documentarians.",
        "He explains what drew them.",
        "This is such a unique thing, a hundred years of a broad, inclusive, extended family with such a wonderful American story of accomplishment and the bonding of people together over a long period of time and a wonderful chapter that isn't--hasn't been told often enough in the African-American experience as well.",
        "Some media came, too.",
        "My sister Pat couldn't leave her TV producer persona behind, and she got reporters from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the Charlotte Observer and a representative from Kodak to cover the story.",
        "David Kassnoff of Kodak said to me he felt that it was a unique opportunity to capture a wonderful even through pictures.",

        "You're dating yourself.",
        "Anyway, on Sunday, despite the threat of thunderstorms, we all went back to Shelby in Cleveland County for the reunion's closing luncheon.",
        "My effervescent 85-year-old aunt, Vivian Davidson Hewitt, pointed out that reunions are no recent trend for our family.",
        "And you must remember that family reunions in the month of August, which is primary reunion month, didn't start happening until 25 years ago after Alex Haley did his book \"\"Roots\"\" and people became very interested in their history and their genealogy.",

        "Keeping family members connected, with or without documentation, is vitally important, says cousin Leonard Mauney.",

        "Look at here.",
        "If you look over there and see all of those families, we are descendants of those.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "I think you could read it on one level as, you know, Watership Down or Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH, it's just sort of an anthropomorphized animal adventure.",

        "And, you know, we can sort of sadly feel for animals in ways that we can't feel for that other.",
        "There's a terrific part of the novel where the lions come to the Tigris River to get a drink of water and encounter a turtle and have a long conversation about the walkers as he calls them - the men - and what it is they're fighting about.",
        "And he doesn't know.",
        "Right.",
        "I think most of the animals don't.",

        "But yeah, the turtle lost most of his family to some of the oil that was spilled in previous wars, and that's based on reality.",
        "So it's not really a, you know, paint by numbers allegory in that this is all based on, you know, real events.",
        "So I think that, you know, it's nice because people will read each of those events and hopefully bring their own perspective to it, you know, rather than having me impose my intent on them.",

        "To some extent.",

        "That if you're at the movies and you put even a child, an infant, in danger, the audience will stay with you.",

        "And actually, there was more dialogue to begin with when I wrote the script.",
        "Comic-book scripts look a lot like a screenplay, where you describe all of the action as well as all of the dialogue.",
        "But Niko's art was so lavish and told the story so much more clearly than my words could that I ended up backing off a lot and just letting his pictures tell the story.",
        "How do you do that?",
        "Does he, then, have to adapt the art to your new script?",
        "It's sort of a back and forth, where we would talk every day.",
        "I would send over the script, then he would send over some sort of thumbnail sketches, and we'd adjust back and forth.",
        "It's part of the joys of doing, you know, a graphic novel as opposed to doing monthly comics, where, you know, we had the luxury of time to really go back and to tweak every page and make it exactly what we wanted it to be."
