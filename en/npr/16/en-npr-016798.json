        "I mean, I pitched this to DC Vertigo Comics right after the real event happened, so it was sort of at the height of Dixie Chicks paranoia.",
        "So, you know, I'm appreciative of my publisher of letting us tell this story.",
        "But yes, over the course of three years - you know, it's probably about a year of writing and, you know, probably close to two years of Niko just slaving away.",
        "And I was just, you know, working at it every day.",
        "You get this opportunity to do a graphic novel, an original piece of work in extended form, because you do write two very popular and successful and critically applauded regular series.",
        "Thank you, yeah.",
        "Y: The Last Man, which is sort of a political satire I guess you could call it, about gender politics, about the story of one man who survives a plague that kills all the other men but leaves the women behind.",
        "And Ex Machina, which is a political thriller about a retired superhero who runs for mayor of New York City.",
        "If you go out and buy the copy, you'll be pleased to know he's not entirely retired.",
        "And you do go back in his past to tell stories of his exploits, though he's not your classic superhero, is he?",
        "No, he's definitely not.",
        "And you know, he had the superheroic past and decided that, really, all he was doing is maintaining the status quo and thought that he could effect more change as a politician.",
        "So it's sort of a balance between sci-fi jet-pack action and boring political stuff, although I like the boring, political stuff.",
        "You like the boring political stuff.",
        "He gets elected mayor of New York after he saves one of the two towers from collapsing, and it's interesting.",

        "And he was saying that he thought really, after 9/11 we needed to find a new model for the superhero in a new world.",
        "And he particularly pointed to your book.",
        "Oh, well that was nice of him.",
        "Yeah, I think - I was living in New York during 9/11, and I was sort of eager to respond to it in some way.",
        "And I think, you know, seeing Bush in his flight suit, or Kerry running on his war record, or The Terminator being elected governor of California, it did seem that we wanted our leaders to be heroes more than ever, you know.",
        "And is a hero even a real thing, or is that just something we impose on people?",
        "And comic books have been asking that question since Superman was created, so it seemed like the perfect genre to talk about the post-9/11 world.",
        "And I guess after 9/11, a lot of people in the comics industry, or even wider than that, you know - say where was Superman?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "It is true.",
        "But I think, you know, since the days of Stan Lee, he's always know that, you know, superheroes aren't pure escapist fiction, that they do work best as sort of timeless metaphors for, you know, meaningful things in our lives.",
        "So that's what I'm trying to use superheroes for, not just escapist entertainment.",
        "How unusual is it to get the opportunity to do a book like Pride of Baghdad?",
        "It's fairly unusual in that I think most of my contemporaries work on existing characters: your Spiderman or Batman or what have you.",
        "But I really have a passion for creating new things, and yeah - Y and Ex Machina have afforded me a certain latitude, and I sort of wanted to cash in those chips on hopefully something meaningful.",
        "Is the production process so long that it's - you said you've been working on this for three years.",
        "What, has it been months since you did your last work on this?",
        "Yeah, it has been.",
        "Although, you know, as Niko is finishing up, I would sort of take time to noodle with it, you know, and change a line here or there.",
        "But because I'm working on so many other monthly comics, I'm always busy with something.",
        "But yeah, for something like Y and Ex Machina, you really do get the instant gratification of, you know, almost immediately after you've written it, it's put out in the world, and you're getting hate mail on the Internet or what have you.",
        "So it's been interesting to work in a vacuum for so long.",
        "So the book comes out today, so I'm really excited to hear what people think.",

        "So hopefully Niko and I will work on something new.",
        "And I don't want Niko to get pigeonholed as just an animal artist, since he draws incredible people as well.",

        "Today the city is still on the mend, but there are signs that New Orleans may be coming back into tune.",
        "As NPR's John Burnett reports, the hardest job may be keeping it that way.",
        "(Soundbite of music)",
        "A tourist could walk through the French Quarter, listening to arpeggios, glissandos, slurs and rolls pouring out of open doorways, and draw comfort from the belief that the city is back stronger than ever, after its near-death experience.",
        "But that would be wrong.",
        "Because the music of New Orleans isn't born and doesn't grow in these clubs.",
        "It grows out in the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Wards in what I call the cultural wetlands of not just the city, but of the country.",
        "David Freedman, a native of New Orleans, is general manager of radio station WWOZ, a pillar of the music community."

        "And so she used the tales and the stories as a means of preserving the language, and for young people I think that's especially important because if there's no reason to learn the language then it soon goes out of practice.",

        "And so she began telling these tales in English and traveling around, because she knew that beyond the pueblo community that these tales had lessons for young people, lessons about behavior, humorous lessons at times.",

        "This is something she wrote: Storytelling was done mainly in the wintertime, not summer.",

        "The bear and other animals had gone hibernating, and we had heard the last of the thunders.",

        "They held out their arms, and it was raining even though the sun was shining.",
        "And to them, in pueblo culture, that means that the spirit has reached its destination, and this was a message from Esther Martinez that indeed her spirit had reached its destination.",
