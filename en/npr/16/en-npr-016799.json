        "Why was that such a discovery to understand that the dolphins could recognize a synthetic whistle?",
        "I would think, you know, if I call someone's name and someone else calls someone's name, don't we both recognize the name no matter who's calling it, even if a speaker were calling it?",
        "Yes, well, that's true for us, but interestingly, really most other animals that have been studied, if not all, do not use distinctive sounds to refer to other individual animals.",
        "Instead they tend to produce sort of a species specific vocal repertoire, and then they have individual variability in how they say sounds, just the way, again, you know, your voice sounds different from someone else's voice, and that's how animals recognize one another, not through a distinctive signal that is essentially a name.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Now, what does this tell us about the way that dolphins communicate?",
        "Does it mean that if they have names for each other, they may have a language also?",
        "Well, I think it's definitely too early to say that this would be anything, part of a language, but it is an important component of language, to be able to communicate referentially, in other words, to use arbitrary signals to refer to something, and that's what our words are like, and in this case dolphins are using an arbitrary whistle sound to refer to another dolphin, and since they learn these signals, it also shows that they're capable of acquiring new signals, which is, of course, another important aspect of language as well."

        "Now, which part of the whistle do they recognize?",

        "You know what I'm talking about?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, what they seem to be cuing in on is really what we call the contour, which is a pattern of frequency changes over time.",
        "And I know you probably didn't pick up on too much of it because they're kind of high frequency and fast, and so we tend to look at them visually on the computer.",
        "But that's what they're cuing in on, and they do vary aspects of it and sometimes repeat certain components of the whistle.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "And we, one possibility is that when they vary aspects of the whistle, it may be conveying additional information sort of superimposed on the identity information.",
        "Mm hmm.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Where were they?",
        "Those are anywhere probably from about maybe six to 20 kilohertz, and our upper frequency hearing pretty much cuts off at 20 or lower, depending our age, so it's pretty hard to listen to those, to get a lot of the variability in them by listening."

        "Yeah, well, there's a lot of different places we can look at, but one thing that's very interesting about dolphins is that they do imitate one another's signature whistles, in addition to producing their own.",
        "So trying to understand how that might function in their natural communication system would be really fun and interesting and as well as understanding how some of the other sounds that they produce function.",
