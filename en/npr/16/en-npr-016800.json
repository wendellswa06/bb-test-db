        "That's NPR counterterrorism correspondent Dina Temple-Raston.",
        "There is some new research that is reminding us of the power of suggestion.",
        "My colleague Steve Inskeep spoke to NPR's Shankar Vedantam about this.",
        "It's research showing how people believe differently when they believe that other people hold a stereotype about who they are or what they're like.",
        "NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam has been looking into this research.",
        "Hi, Shankar.",
        "Hi, Steve.",
        "What's the research?",
        "Well, it's about an idea known as stereotype threat, Steve, and we've actually talked about this in the past.",
        "The idea of stereotype threat is that when there's a stereotype in the air about you, you are worried that your behavior might end up proving the stereotype true, and it adversely affects your performance.",
        "Your anxiety might actually make you more like the stereotype in some ways.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Turns out you don't even have to remind people about the stereotype.",
        "You just have to remind people about the context in which the stereotype is activated for stereotype threat to kick in.",
        "Oh, and that causes anxiety that might make you perform differently or act differently in your life.",
        "That's right.",
        "And sometimes just being reminded of the context is enough to trigger a stereotype threat.",
        "Studies find, for example, that if you ask kids to write down if they are male or female before taking a math test, girls will often perform worse than if you hadn't reminded them about their gender.",
        "So merely reminding children about gender unconsciously activates the stereotype that girls might be worse than boys at math, and this can affect the performance of girls."

        "And now you've got some research that says something else about stereotypes, right?",
        "That's right, Steve.",
        "Most of the work on stereotype threat has looked at minorities and other underrepresented groups.",
        "This research looks at a majority group - American Christians - and it looks at a stereotype about American Christians - that Christians and science don't get along.",
        "We often see headlines in the news that say creationism and evolution are in conflict.",
        "And many people have a stereotype that there's something about Christianity and science that don't mix.",
        "I was speaking with Kimberly Rios at Ohio University, and she told me that she noticed something on a recent trip to Morocco.",
        "When she talked to people there about religion and science, she found that Moroccans had a very different concept than the one in the United States when it came to Christianity and science.",
        "In Islam, which is the predominant religion in Morocco, they don't seem to have this conception that Americans do about Christianity - or religion, in general - and science about these two bodies of thought being incompatible.",
        "And when I talked to people in Morocco about this notion, that surprised them.",
        "OK.",
        "What did the research find, then?",
        "O'DOWD: Across the region, about 350 subdivisions are actively selling new homes.",
        "In a normal market, that number is more than 600.",
        "Swann says when things are really moving in this city, you'll know it.",
        "Arrgh it is.",
        "Well, she conducted a survey and a series of experiments.",
        "And she found that many non-Christians in fact do think that Christians aren't good or aren't interested in science, so there is a stereotype about Christians having problems with science.",
        "She then ran an experiment with Christians and non-Christians volunteers who were asked to solve problems of logic.",
        "Christian volunteers reminded about the stereotype that Christianity and science don't mix did worse than Christian volunteers who weren't reminded of the stereotype.",
        "This, of course, is classic stereotype threat.",
        "She also found that when she gave volunteers a test, Christians did worse when she labeled the test as a test of scientific ability, rather than a test of intuitive ability, even though the test was exactly the same, presumably because labeling it as a test of scientific ability triggers stereotype threat just like the girls asked to list their sex before taking a math test.",
        "Those who thought the test was about scientific reasoning - for those people, there was a difference between Christians and non-Christians.",
        "But for those who thought the test was about intuitive thought, there was no difference.",
        "Wow.",
        "So you have evidence there that having the stereotype in your mind makes you anxious in some way, affects your performance.",
        "And this is the key - the most troubling part, Shankar - you're telling me that, again and again, people who are reminded of a stereotype about themselves end up behaving in ways that conform to the stereotype.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "And it seems paradoxical because the people don't necessarily need to believe the stereotype themselves.",
        "It's just the fear that other people might believe the stereotype and your behavior might confirm the stereotype that makes you question your own behavior and impedes your performance."

        "That means they couldn't mathematically get enough delegates to get the nomination on the first round of voting.",
        "Kasich's already there.",

        "So Cruz is getting out of the way, not campaigning in Oregon or New Mexico, letting Kasich make his play there, and Kasich is getting out of Cruz's way in Indiana.",

        "They're mostly John Kasich or Ted Cruz supporters.",
        "In terms of the voters, though, I sort of met a cross-section of people.",
        "There was one guy in Southern Indiana that I had spoken to the other week, and he was torn between Cruz and Kasich.",
        "And he said after this sort of non-compete, he decided to go with Ted Cruz even though he has some reservations because he really wants to stop Donald Trump from getting the 1,237 delegates he needs in order to secure the nomination on the first ballot.",
        "And the non-compete is kind of tricky to understand.",
        "I mean, Ted Cruz - he's holding a big rally tonight at a basketball gym in Indiana.",
        "But John Kasich - you know, even though he's not holding public events, he is also here in the state, and I was told that he's holding a fundraiser.",
        "Meanwhile, what are they up against in terms of Trump support or in terms of the kind of stop-Trump movement in Indiana?",
        "There are ads showing that are part of the stop-Trump movement, but Donald Trump himself has also been airing a number of television ads across the state.",
        "And he has a fairly solid support base.",
        "I think one thing to remember also is that Indiana - it has a very large manufacturing sector.",
        "It's a sector that's sort of taken a beating, but it's still around here.",
        "And so there are many white, working-class voters that Trump seems to do fairly well with.",
        "And I think he has a natural support base.",
        "The other thing is that the assumption that this Cruz and Kasich sort of non-competes would help Ted Cruz could possibly be a bit of a miscalculation.",
        "I spoke with one woman who really liked Governor Kasich, but she decided to go with Donald Trump.",
        "And so, you know, it's sort of tricky to see where all those votes may fall."
