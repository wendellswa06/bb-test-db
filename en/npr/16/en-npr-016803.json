        "No, no. It's, you know, the military's just, it's a small, tight-knit, and also a very supportive community, but it can also be a, you know, a judgmental environment where, you know, perception can override reality.",
        "It's very much like a small-town environment.",
        "The difference is that, you know, everyone has the same employer, which is Uncle Sam.",
        "What is the zero defect mentality?",
        "Right, right.",
        "The zero defect mentality just means that, you know, you can't really have a chink in the armor as a sign of weakness, and, you know, giving 110 percent and being at your best everyday is tough, but it's often required of our soldiers and especially the leadership.",
        "When you were growing up in an army family, how was this communicated to you, that the expectations were also there for you?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, there was also was just, you know, very high expectations in school, with my grades and, you know, just being, you know, the best student and person that I could be.",
        "You know, my father used to tell my sister and me that, you know, he wasn't raising sparrows.",
        "He was raising eagles.",

        "That's right.",
        "...doesn't strike me as awful.",
        "No, no, it wasn't, and, you know, I'm very proud of my dad and his 30 years of army service, and I think he did a great job raising us within the military environment.",
        "You don't talk about your own birth family, but if you don't mind my asking, if it's not too personal, did your mother feel a pressure to succeed, to be perfect, to have zero defects?",
        "You know, I think, you know, I actually dedicated my book to my mother and also to the families in our armed forces.",
        "But my mother, you know, she was an army wife during the '60s and '70s, and when my father, and '80s and '90s, actually, but when my father went off to Vietnam, my mother found out two weeks later that she was pregnant with my sister.",
        "And, you know, back then, there was no support for military families and for what my mother was going through.",
        "But my mom worked.",
        "My mom went back and got a college education at the age of 40, and she went on to get her master's, and she also, you know, was president of the Officer's Wives Club, so she kind of did it all.",
        "She was a superwoman, and I'm just as proud of my mother as I am my father.",
        "Well, no. It wasn't, I'm sorry, I guess I didn't understand what you were asking.",
        "Did her experience, in part, lead you to want to explore this aspect of military life?",
        "Because as a reporter in the Fayetteville area, you were reporting on all aspects of the military.",
        "But, kind of, is that partly what encouraged you to look at the whole role of the spouse?"

        "I think it did because, you know, I learned a lot from just watching my mother, you know, at a very young age.",

        "I chose to tell it from the perspective of army wives because I believe these women are the glue that keeps their families and the army community together.",
        "And one thing, too, I want to add, Michelle, is that, you know, the army is an amazing life.",
        "Most army couples who have made the military a career will tell you it has also been a very satisfying life.",
        "That doesn't mean that it's been an easy life, but I believe it is a noble one, and military wives take a lot of pride in knowing that their spouses are serving our nation.",
        "I'm gonna get to our calls in a moment, but I wanted to ask you this.",
        "A former army officer once told me that one of the reasons that the military is known as being one of the most successfully integrated, racially integrated, organizations or institutions in the country, is that they make it clear what you need to do to be successful, that there's not a hidden agenda, that there's no, there's not a hidden code of, you know, it's we say that this is what you need to do succeed but it's really that, that they kind of spell it out for you.",
        "But in your book it sounds as if there is not that instruction manual for the wives, that it's this kind of Byzantine experience where they're really left to figure out for themselves what is expected of them, but they're punished for it when they are wrong.",
        "Is that true?",
        "Or is there, is that a wrong perception on my part, that really there is some way to know what's expected of you?",
        "Well, there, you know, there's no formal punishment, but I think it's a woman who marries a soldier and knows nothing about, you know, military life or the military experience.",
        "She has to learn as she goes.",
        "And like anyone in life, you learn from your mistakes and hopefully, you learn from them and you move on, and you don't make the same mistakes again.",
        "But, you know, the Army does have classes to help new wives, and these are free programs.",
        "The issue is, not every wife is going to take advantage of that.",
        "But I would say, you learn from your neighbors, who are also in the military on post, and you learn from your new friends, and the women in your unit who are seasoned wives and who have been in the military community for decades.",

        "What's your thought?",

        "When I got married, I'm a former Marine, and I brought my wife down to base, I was pulled aside several time and actually counseled by officers or higher enlisted men because of how she would dress or her purple, she had purple hair, she was into punk at the time.",
        "It became a very big issue for quite a while."

        "Not between us, between me and the officers because I would be instructed that I should make my wife dress better or make my wife do this, something different with her hair, and I don't believe in that as, you know, I don't make my wife do anything.",
        "What was their, why should you have made her?",

        "Well it was...",

        "I guess, you have to understand, in the Marine Corp, appearance is everything to an extreme.",
        "Anybody who doesn't fit a very specific mold is expected to do everything to try to get there and it extends to the wives, it extends to the entire family, and the fact that something like that glaringly different, it was offensive to a lot of people.",
        "Thank you, Doug.",
        "Tonya, how widespread is that as an experience?",
        "Do you think that's a fairly common experience?",
        "Well I can understand what Doug was saying, because in the military there is order.",
        "You have structure, discipline, and organization, and there's a good dose of conformity, and so I can understand if your girlfriend or your fiancée or your wife shows up with, you know, purple hair, and if she wears suggestive clothing, that most likely will be an issue and a topic of conversation.",
        "And where in a civilian community, people might kind of whisper about it in the workplace, in the military, a superior will most likely mention that to the service member, even though it should be, you would think, that that's a personal issue, not in the military.",
        "So the conformity need extends both to family members as well as the service member himself or herself?"

        "Did it help that they couldn't understand her when she was complaining about them?",
        "No, they, she opposed it, but my point was, is that my father's now the station captain of Ellsworth Fire Department here in Rapid City, and he's been there for 22 years.",

        "The military itself, within the military community is not a democracy, although we are defending the democracy of our country, and that's just how it works.",
        "Your book tells the stories in detail of four different women and their husbands, four very different stories, four very different backgrounds, and I'm not going to go into detail about all them, but there's some really sad, sad things and some really sad stories.",
        "But the catalyst for the book centers on the 2002 murders at Fort Bragg, which you covered as a reporter when it was, I believe, that four service members killed their wives in the course of something like a six-week period."
