        "That's right.",
        "In the end, did you conclude that the culture played some role in this tragedy?",
        "Well, what happened, the Pentagon released a 41-page report on that and what they discovered was that it was several things.",
        "It was a combination of existing marital problems, compounded by the stress of hectic training schedules and lengthy deployment separations, and it just wasn't one thing.",
        "But I want to talk to you, when you talk about the deployment schedule, help people to see what we're talking about here, because many people have spouses who travel on business trips and things like that and they may not understand what you're talking about.",
        "For example, how much notice would you typically get if you were going to go away on a long deployment?",
        "When would you, when might you find out that your husband might be gone for four months?",
        "Well when your husband finds out and when you find out, meaning the wife, can be two different things.",
        "Sometimes husbands will know months in advance, but they cannot mention it.",
        "Why not?",
        "For security reasons.",
        "They may not be able to mention it until two to three weeks out, but sometimes you'll have a good chunk of time.",
        "You may have half a year you'll know that a deployment is coming up, and other times, you'll have very little notice to prepare for something like that.",
        "Well, you tell a story in your book of one couple, a young, very young married couple, with three little children and they knew that the deployment was coming but they got the phone call and the dad was scheduled to leave the following morning.",
        "It was Fourth of July Weekend, and he got the call while they were watching the Fourth of July parade and just the thought of how traumatic this would be, it just brings tears to your eyes.",
        "Yeah, it was really sad, and I know what that feeling is like, having gone through it myself.",
        "It's the inevitable.",
        "And as Rita, the woman, the wife you're referring to, she said it was like waiting for your execution.",
        "You know it's coming up and you know it's going to happen and then you get the phone call or the day arrives, and it's just a very sad feeling.",
        "I'd like to bring in another guest now.",
        "Joining us now is Margaret Harrell.",
        "She's a senior social scientist at Rand and the author of Invisible Women: Junior Enlisted Army Wives.",
        "She's also a military wife and she joins us from her home in Lake Ridge, Virginia.",

        "They are carrying a heavy load.",
        "There are many single parents in our society who have to serve as both mother and father to children who have to carry on a lot of responsibilities.",
        "But why should the concerns of military wives be of particular concern to those of us who don't have to live that way?",
        "Why should we...",
        "Why should we care?",
        "Care about them?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well I can speak from a couple of perspectives, but doing research for the Secretary of Defense office, the DOD is very concerned about military wives, because they know that it's not just the soldier that decides whether or not to stay in the Army, that it's usually a family decision.",
        "They call it taking it to the kitchen table, and they know families together make these decisions.",
        "So from DOD's perspective, it's an issue of national defense.",
        "But they also recognize, and they actually have a document out called the Social Compact, and in the Social Compact what they say is that they recognize that service members are making a huge sacrifice for their country and that really it's become the right thing to do to make sure that military families are taken care of as part of the deal they've made.",
        "You're saying that the fact that a service member may enlist might be just up to him, but that if he stays, that's a family decision.",
        "That's a family decision."

        "Has the amount of support that Army wives and military wives in general get over the years, has that improved?",
        "That's improved a lot, actually.",
        "There used to be a saying that if they wanted you to have a wife, they would have issued you one.",
        "And people still laugh about that now, but in reality, DOD in general is much more cognoscente of military families and they're working very hard to improve quality of life for military families.",
        "Chertoff told ABC's This Week, the flexibility of British law helped the investigation into this alleged plot.",
        "I would say that if there is anything unfortunate there, it's that even though they've done a lot more for military families, that often what they do is sort of, I say it's my published work, on the backs officers' wives.",
        "In other words, there are a lot more enlisted soldiers that are married today and so they're working very hard to try to take care of those families and those wives.",
        "But often, what they're doing is relying upon the volunteer work of officers' wives to take care of those other wives.",
        "Why is that?",
        "Do they just not know that these pressures are there?",
        "Is it something that's going under radar?",
        "Is it that these women don't complain, so therefore no one knows that they're suffering?",
        "Why would that be?",
        "This is an organization in which the sense is that nothing is left to chance.",
        "Why would they depend on officers' wives?",
        "Sure.",
        "Why is there not a more structured form of support?",
        "Well, it's just that given the world of limited resources, they do what they can with money that they have, but this is a bigger problem than what they can just solve with the funding that they have for family programs.",
        "And really, what they need to be doing, and what they're trying to do, is reach out to all these families.",
        "And to do so, they generally depend upon the unit leadership and often the wives of the unit leadership, if the soldiers are men, to take care of the other families.",

        "I have a comment that I think is very important, that in the military we have the National Guardsmen.",
        "My son is a National Guardsman.",
        "He was deployed overseas, and they lack the support the people have on base.",
        "Things that would not be a problem in a base city becomes a problem when they're away from a base city, so I think we need to remember that group of people also."

        "Margaret Harrell, what about that?",
        "That we're relying more and more on our National Guard troops?",
        "Do you think that her point is valid, that there is less support for those service members and their families?",
        "Absolutely and in fact, I'm leading a large study now that the DOD has asked us to, the Rand Corporation, to look at how better we can support not just National Guard families, but reservist families as well, because there's a recognition that they are different, that they may likely have different needs because their demographics are different, and because they are geographically dispersed and not near large installations to large extent.",
        "Let's go to another caller.",
        "Here's Jan in Memphis, Tennessee.",
        "Welcome, Jan.",
        "Hey, I was going to say, my mother, when Dad was in the Air Force, this started in World War II and went through Vietnam, was not allowed to have a job because the Air Force felt it would take her away from her primary job of supporting my father.",
        "I'm sorry.",
        "Can I stop you right there?",
        "You just made me perk right up.",
        "What do you mean she was prevented from having a job?",
        "Was it a direct order or was it that her husband was told this would reflect poorly on you?",
        "Pretty much it was an order.",
        "These women who were permitted to have jobs, the only wives were the so-called professionals.",
        "In other words, if you were a teacher or a nurse you could work.",
        "If you were anything else it was considered nonprofessional, never mind if they had say my job of working in a hospital laboratory, or say a reporter, even, that was considered nonprofessional and it would take away from her ability to support her husband.",
        "The reason for the absolute conformity with the wives was it was considered that if the husband couldn't count on his wife, his mind would be on his family situation, and not on any potential emergencies.",
        "What did you think about that?",
        "Well, I was a little kid and that was just the way things were.",
        "I mean, I was raised within five rings of SAC(ph) phone.",
        "If my dad was out, if my folks were out bowling, I expected to be in the house beside the phone, either doing homework or having my friends over or watching TV, I could do anything so long as I could get to that phone.",
        "So it didn't occur to me that not letting mother do something was unusual.",
        "I mean, heck, at that time the Air Force could have moved us with thirty-six hours notice, a sergeant appointed to take care of our household goods.",
        "That never happened, but it could have.",
        "But it seems to have made a strong impression on you.",
        "Well, mother was an extremely intelligent person who could have had any one of three or four good jobs, mostly in the financial sector.",
        "Dduring World War II, she ran a portion of an insurance company that had before then been absolutely a man's job.",
        "But because she was married to an Air Force officer she was not permitted to even think about it."
