        "So did you, did you ever find a conflict between your, or have you found a conflict between your instincts as a journalist, and your identity as a really lifelong member of this institution?",
        "I've been able to separate the two and I think I've used it to my advantage, my background with the military.",
        "You know, I could understand military culture and that really helped me tell the story of our army and our military.",

        "I just wanted to ask, is there someone in your book who just surprised you, that just was a revelation to you, told you something about the army life that you just did not know even from your own experience?",
        "Well, you know, I learned a lot from the women and from doing this book and more than anything I learned how important it is to keep your own identity in this world where there is so much conformity.",
        "That would be my advice.",
        "I would pass that advice on to other Army wives.",
        "Know yourself.",

        "And just briefly, is there someone who the Army really failed in your view, who would have really been better suited to another life?",
        "In the book, you know, is the Army really to blame?",
        "That's a question I raise in the book and I leave that up to readers to decide.",
        "I don't actually make that decision for them in my book, because people will have different opinions on that."
