        "And then Paul O'Neill comes in and says here's something that both of us can agree on: We need to change our habits around worker safety.",
        "And management and workers were able to sit down at the same table, and all of a sudden they realized to change those habits, to make safety automatic, you have to do certain things - like, for instance, you have to look at your production line.",
        "When does the manufacturing process get out of whack?",
        "Because an out-of-whack manufacturing process is dangerous to employees.",
