        "Amy, do you see the changes that the president mentioned today as being substantial, significant in some way, or is this really nibbling around the edges of something that you find much more troubling?",

        "There's checks and balances.",
        "And yet, as far as we know, judges on the FISA courts virtually never reject request from the government.",

        "I don't think so.",
        "Yeah, I still think the elephant's going to be a little blurry, but this is a president who has gone quite a ways just over the course of the summer from taking almost a combative trust-me-about-this stance to saying, I respect the American people enough to understand that there are concerns and we should be more transparent than we have been.",
