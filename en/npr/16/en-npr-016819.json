        "Well, Amy, Chuck Hagel and John Kerry, the secretaries of defense and state, will be meeting their Russian counterparts.",

        "Well, that's exactly right.",
        "It's not as if we have cut off all relations with Russia.",
        "We have just decided not to hold a summit that the administration decided didn't have a good chance of being particularly productive.",
        "In Obama's first term, he was able to, as he said, cooperate a bit with Medvedev, discussing things like getting arms control agreements going again.",
        "That's a discussion that they wanted to be ongoing with the Russian government and did not see any signs that there was reciprocation on the other side.",
        "So I would disagree that they had mishandled this.",
        "To me the language sounded, as much as anything, like a couple that's having a marital disagreement.",
        "In fact, the president even said I think it's appropriate to take a pause, which sounded like the parents telling their kids we're going to take a break for a little while.",
        "A bit of a time out being called, David?",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "Yeah, I don't know.",
        "Putin is the kind of guy who just wants to be one-upmanship.",

        "He did it with George W.",
        "Bush over the size of their dogs for crying out loud.",

        "Well, Putin had the bigger dog.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "That's the kind of thing he goes in for, and therefore you don't give him those opportunities.",
        "Putin loves this moment.",
        "He gets to thumb his nose at the president of the United States over gay issues and over the (unintelligible) issue in a way that Russian voters, such as there are voters, will love.",
        "And so we're giving him plenty - an opportunity that he relishes.",
        "The idea is to maneuver things so we don't have these mano-y-mano things, which he specializes in.",
        "There's one last thing that I wanted to toss your way, Amy.",
        "We are in an off year in the election cycle, but there is a hotly contested race for the governor of Virginia, and both candidates are facing ethical scandals.",
        "You have the Republican, the State Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli running against the former DNC Chair Terry McAuliffe, a big fundraiser and close to the Clintons.",
        "Your publication, National Journal, leads its story this way: Pity the Virginia voter.",
        "Amy, so why don't you describe the sorry state of affairs in Virginia briefly.",
        "Yes, well as my colleague Beth Reinhard reported this week, Virginia voters are not exactly thrilled about this particular race, even by the standards of recent electoral politics.",
        "Kind of the mud-slinging that's going back and forth and some of the substantive concerns, too, about money and gifts that have been taken, particularly on the Republican side, has really turned off voters.",
        "And, you know, as entertaining as it can be, I have to wonder whether my friend Tom Perriello, the former congressman in Virginia, is wishing that he had actually gotten into the race and taken his chances this year because I think he could clean both of these guys up.",
        "OK, Amy Sullivan of National Journal, David Brooks of The New York Times, have a good weekend.",
        "Thanks.",
        "You, too.",

        "Like red beans and rice",
        "Although I think of the '60s in many ways as the era of the Kennedys and Martin Luther King and the civil-rights movement, as we should, it was also the era of Nixon, who was one of the most fascinating and enigmatic and in many ways scary figures in American political history.",
        "I think he really was the dominant political figure of the '50s and '60s.",
        "He embodied something about America, but something that's scary about America.",
        "And that is that we love winners.",
        "We don't ask how they won, unless somebody, usually a journalist, rubs our nose in it.",
        "Then we say we had no idea he was taking steroids or whatever the other thing might have been.",

        "But we don't ask.",
        "We don't inquire how people win.",
        "We love that we win.",
        "And Nixon was a guy who knew how to win.",
        "He embodied that scary aspect of America.",
        "Why this period of history?",
        "You mentioned a certain interest or fascination with Richard Nixon.",
        "Was it that that drove you, or were you interested in placing a story in this period of time?",
        "Was it Nixon or Mona Visi or just a fascination with the '50s and '60s?",
        "I think that's a great question, and I think you have to understand the 1960s to understand modern America.",
        "So many of the battles we still fight today we were fighting then - all sorts of traditional understandings about the role of women, about the role of black people - a lot of different things were overturned in that time.",
        "And there was something else they had in the '60s.",
        "There's something we take as a given in politics that Nixon actually invented, and that's the idea that politics, especially for national elections, divided between these hard-working, middle-class traditionalists on this side and these scary liberals on the other side.",
        "That was a new way of dividing the electorate, in 1968 when Nixon mapped it out.",
        "And every year, the candidates, the media, everybody takes that as a starting point.",
        "That was Nixon's invention as a way of breaking up the Democratic, solid South, but it was a new kind of politics."

        "That is - I mean it as a light touch, but the touch is always there.",
