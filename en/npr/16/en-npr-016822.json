        "Pamuk, thank you for joining us and congratulations on your Nobel Prize.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "You know, when you were on this program back in 1995 talking about your novel, The Black Book, you talked about coming from one of those countries, your phrase was on the periphery of the Western world where the art of the novel was developed, and being one of those writers who is grabbing that art from the center to the periphery and then producing something new to show the world.",
        "Is it still a fair characterization of what you've been doing?",
        "Yeah, probably.",
        "But then, now perhaps Turkey's getting away from the periphery and joining towards Europe, of course in a troubled way.",
        "But I think Turkey's not at the periphery any more, moving towards the center of the world, going towards the European Union and West.",
        "That was Turkey's history for the last 200 years anyway.",
        "You've described yourself as really the first novelist to write about modern, urban Istanbul, a city that you watched grow in your own lifetime.",
        "Yeah, Istanbul is my city, my kingdom.",
        "My stories are about Istanbul.",
        "And I accept this honor, this prize, as a celebration of my culture, my language and my town.",
        "Istanbul.",
        "The town I come from.",
        "The town whose stories I've been telling for the last 30 years.",
        "Now, I want you to talk about something that is said in Istanbul and elsewhere in Turkey today.",
        "There are those who still are upset with your remarks about the Armenians and also about the Kurds.",
        "Yeah, but this is not a day for politics for me.",
        "This is a day for celebrating.",
        "This is a day for peace, happiness for me.",
        "But the question that's been raised is is the Nobel Prize for literature in some cases tinged with politics?",
        "You don't see it that way.",
        "I don't know.",
        "That's not the point today for me, really."

        "My whole book, my whole life, is a testimony to the fact that East and West actually combine, come together gracefully and produce something new.",
        "That is what I have been trying to do all my life, trying to prove.",
        "While you have been writing with that intent, others have been theorizing about clashes of civilizations.",

        "I think that was a fanciful idea which, unfortunately, is sometimes coming to be true.",
        "But no, I think that East and West meet.",
        "I think that my whole work is a testimony to the fact that we should find ways of looking, combining East and West without any clash, but with harmony, with grace, and produce something new for humanity.",
        "Do you think that that award of the Nobel Prize to you, a Turkish novelist, might assist not only you, but other Turkish writers?",
        "Of course.",
        "In gaining the respect in Turkey that you're allowed to, example, voice unpopular opinions and shouldn't be thrown into court for it.",
        "First, I look at this.",
        "That it will encourage all the aspiring young authors, all the young people who want to write in remote corners of the world where readership is rather small.",
        "But of course, I believe in that.",
        "What are you working on now?",
        "I've been working on a love novel for the last four years.",
        "The title is Museum of Innocence, but I may not find some time to finish it these days, but I'm very optimistic.",
        "This prize will never change my working habits.",
