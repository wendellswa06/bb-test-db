        "So it works just - kind of like a Jacuzzi whirlpool.",
        "So it kind of sucks the product under the water, tumbles it around, adds agitation",
        "Taylor Farms has added something new to its wash systems - some chemicals that make the chlorine work better.",
        "It still probably will not kill all the microbes on every contaminated lettuce leaf.",
        "But tests show it will keep washwater from spreading those microbes from one leaf to thousands of others.",

        "It is a true test-and-hold program, so we have to wait until we get the negative results to put it onto a truck.",
        "Any positives go to the landfill.",
        "And yes, every five weeks or so, there is a positive - a sample that's contaminated with disease-causing E.",
        "coli or salmonella.",
        "They can't test every leaf so that probably means some contaminated lettuce or spinach is getting through.",
        "But these systems should catch a major contamination.",
        "That's what the washing, and the testing, are supposed to achieve.",

        "You're in the market; you reach for that bag of lettuce.",
        "Maybe it's freshly cleaned spinach, a tightly wrapped head of iceberg, maybe three Romaine heads all in a row.",

        "It's one tablespoon of Dijon mustard, three tablespoons vinegar of your choice, and about five tablespoons of olive oil.",
