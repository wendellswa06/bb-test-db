        "It's a little hard to imagine now what that period was like; how revolutionary it was for a parent to walk in the gay Pride March in New York City, carrying a sign that said, \"\"Parents Unite In Support Of Our Gay Children.\"\" The timing was right.",
        "The time really called for someone like Jeanne, and Jeanne was there.",
        "In 1973, Manford organized the first formal meeting of PFLAG, which took place at a local church in Greenwich Village.",
        "Twenty people gathered and soon after, she began to receive calls from other parents all across the country, who wanted to start groups in their own communities.",

        "He and his wife joined PFLAG, seeking support and guidance from other parents in similar situations.",
        "They don't think they're going out there to become politicians, or advocates, in a unique way.",
        "They're doing what parents should do - which is care for their kids, and keep their family together.",
        "And it's pretty simple, when you think about it at its core.",
        "One of the things my mom talked about being so valuable for her was - in a way - to go to a PFLAG meeting, and see her pain affirmed; see her pain reflected.",
        "Writer Dan Savage's mother was also a PFLAG member.",
        "Savage says that his mother found solace in the group because it helped her understand what it means to be gay, and to be the parent of a gay child.",
        "What Jeanne Manford did was, she put it in people's heads that gay and lesbian people have parents; that we were somebody's children.",
        "And that was the first real, big step in the movement toward full acceptance of lesbian, gay, bi and trans people.",
        "New York City Council member Daniel Dromm is another child of a PFLAG mom.",
        "Dromm was friends with Morty Manford.",
        "And when Morty passed away in 1992 of complications from AIDS, he reached out to Jeanne Manford, who he had never met.",
        "The two became fast friends from the first time that he ever set foot in her house.",
        "The day I first went there, the house wreaked of history.",
        "I walked in, and Jeanne had pictures of Morty on the mantelpiece.",
        "And she took them down and she's showing, to me, them.",
        "As a matter of fact, there's a famous photo of Jeanne marching in that first pride parade.",
        "And she was so proud of having that photo, that that moment was recorded in history."

        "Lipsitz thinks that's why Johnny Otis isn't better known today.",
        "It's as if he took a match and lit the rest of his career on fire.",
