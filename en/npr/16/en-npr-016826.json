        "Exactly, everybody's got to have health insurance in order for the insurance companies to be able to afford to cover people who have pre-existing conditions.",
        "And then the other big part of this was supposed to be this expansion of Medicaid.",
        "About 17 million people were going to be covered by this expansion of Medicaid to - mostly this would be able-bodied adults with income under about 133 percent of poverty, about $15,000.",

        "So basically physicians have been not - the physician pay under Medicare has been not keeping up with inflation really for more than a decade now.",
