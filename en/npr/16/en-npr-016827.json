        "If you live in Michigan, welcome to the Michigan exchange, if you live in Maryland welcome to the Maryland exchange.",
        "It will not matter to you who is building or operating that exchange.",
        "So that's kind of a, you know, inside-the-Beltway, you know, discussion that people seem to love.",
        "But it's not really very important for the - for you once you get to the exchange.",
        "Part of what's important is how much there will - effort there will be and how much money there will be to guide people to get to the exchanges, to help them enroll once they're there.",
        "There are going to be what's called navigators, these are people who are supposed to help people sort out how to use the exchanges.",
        "So there will be some differences among states about, you know, how much effort is put into getting people to the exchanges and enrolled.",
        "But the exchanges themselves should look pretty much the same regardless of who's running them.",
        "Let's go now to Chris(ph) and Chris on the line with us from Columbus.",
        "Yes, Julie, so the insurance companies are going to offer products on the exchanges and off the exchanges.",
        "And as you've already said, they can't charge people...",
        "Whoop, somehow the line dropped.",
        "Well, they can't charge - I'm not sure what the question was.",
        "I'm not sure what the question was, either.",
        "They can't charge - I know one of the things they can't charge women more, depending on how they're - which they used to be able to do, but I'm not - there are going to be - it is - it does get very technical about what companies can offer inside and outside the exchange.",
        "And there is a lot of concern about whether insurers are going to play, if you will, what they're going to offer inside these exchanges and whether there will be enough choice and enough competition.",
        "And that's one of the big things that people are worried about, I know.",

        "That's right, and there are a number of taxes.",

        "So there are a lot of different taxes, and indeed this is, you know, a trillion-dollar bill over 10 years, and Congress was very insistent that this be paid for, and the president also, that this not add to the deficit.",
        "So yes there are a variety of taxes to help offset the cost of this law.",
        "Yet the idea is to constrain the growth of the country's health bill.",
        "Yes, and it is hoped that there will be ways to - that there are efforts underway.",
        "Mostly these are demonstration programs within the Medicare program.",
        "That's what Congress has - the federal government has the most immediate power over to try and find better ways, what they call better incentives to help get better outcomes rather than paying - a lot of the health system is sort of paid by inputs, the more you do the more you get paid.",
        "And that's seen as sort of inherently inflationary.",
        "It gives people, it gives the medical system the incentive to do more.",
        "So the idea is let's change the incentives and have the incentive be to do things more efficiently rather than to just do more.",
        "So one example is hospitals now get dinged if patients come back to the hospital too soon, it's called readmissions.",
        "If you get, you know, discharged, and you come back, you don't get paid extra for another hospital admission.",
        "In fact you get punished for having that readmission.",

        "Although I should say that if you've been continuously covered, you shouldn't have a pre-existing condition exclusion.",
        "That should've been taken care of by HIPAA, which was passed in 1996.",
        "The pre-existing condition exclusions are usually only for people who have had a break in health insurance coverage.",
        "So that actually surprises me, and you should probably take that up with the HR office where you work, or if you have your own insurance, you should really actually argue against that because that is something that you shouldn't have to wait until 2014 for.",
        "Well, with the current economy there was a break between physicians, and they're currently investigating it, but it was somewhat disheartening to come across that.",
        "And I guess I've just been very fortunate to never have an issue with, you know, uncovered expenses through insurance.",
        "But I can definitely see why, you know, experiencing this, you ask, well, why wouldn't you cover it, and I can see why there are countries that, you know, have different health care systems would look at us and say why wouldn't you cover these individuals?",

        "So because of that I was able to get insurance and got the surgery to remove the cancer, and now I'm cancer-free.",

        "And it was expected to run out of money, they only put $5 billion into it, but they closed it down in February, not taking anybody else.",
        "So nobody else is going to be allowed in between now and, you know, 2014, when obviously people like this will be able to get insurance on the exchanges.",

        "The concern is that if rates go up too much that younger, healthier people won't buy insurance because after all, particularly for the first few years, they have the option to buy insurance or pay this fine.",
        "And the fine is very low starting out, it's a couple of hundred dollars compared to what could be several thousand dollars for insurance.",
        "Now the thing that - sort of what could, you know, militate against that is that for younger people there is lower-cost insurance that they can have.",
