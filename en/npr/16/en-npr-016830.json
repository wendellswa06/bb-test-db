        "The other nominee, who we've talked a little bit less about, John Brennan, to run the CIA.",
        "And there's been much less push back against him.",
        "But there's was an op-ed piece in The New York Times by Gregory Johnsen, who writes, in part, under Mr. Brennan's guidance, the United States has adopted a controversial method for determining how many civilians it has killed, counting all military-age males in a strike zone as combatants.",
        "And he goes on: The strikes that Mr. Brennan asks the president to approve frequently lead to civilian causalities.",
        "In contrast, on the other hand, President Obama said in the nomination today, John knows what our national security demands: intelligence that provides policymakers with the facts, strong analytic insights and a keen understand of a dynamic world.",
        "Given his extensive experience in travels, the president said - which include traveling through the Arabian Peninsula, where he camped with tribesmen in the desert - John has an invaluable perspective on the forces, the history, the culture, the politics, the economics, the desire for human dignity driving so much of the changes in today's world.",
        "And there, roughly, we have the view of Brennan as a consummate insider and the view of Brennan as the architect of these very controversial counter-terror programs.",
        "They are very controversial.",
        "And people I talked with at The Pentagon are worried a bit about this.",
        "They say this is a tool that is being used so much, particularly by the Obama administration, much more so than the Bush administration.",
        "A lot of people are dying, some of them civilians.",
        "And the concern is: Where is this whole policy going, using drone attacks in Pakistan, in Yemen, in Somalia?",
        "You could see them elsewhere in the African continent, particularly if there's military action in a place like Mali - a lot more American soldiers going on training missions throughout the northern part of Africa, going after al-Qaida.",
        "So there's a concern about this drone policy sweeping, really, around the world, without any really good controls.",
        "And people I talk with in The Pentagon say, well, hang on a second.",
        "What if we see China using these drones against dissidents someplace?",
        "They're getting smaller.",
        "They're getting cheaper.",
        "They're getting more ubiquitous.",
        "The U.S.",
        "is using them more than ever before.",
        "And really, Brennan is sort of the guy who helped create this, for better or for worse.",
        "Exactly.",
        "It's really a double-edged sword people at The Pentagon will tell you, and they're worried about it.",
        "Let's go to another call.",

        "To figure out what, Gamboa did a vertical compression test on her new patient.",

        "Yeah, I think it's all of the above.",
        "I think some of it is petty politics, easily bruised feelings from Chuck Hagel.",
        "I think some of it has to do with Iran.",
        "They want to be tougher on Iran.",
        "Some of it has to do with what - some of the things he said about Israel.",
        "I think it's all of that, wrapped into one.",
        "Hagel is a real maverick, and he's not easily definable and he's not an easy Republican vote.",
        "And that rubs the people the wrong way.",
        "Thanks for the call.",
        "And, Tom, that caller referenced Hagel's gay comments.",
        "That's a reference to 1998, 14 years ago, when Hagel referred to an ambassador to Luxembourg, James Hormel, as openly, aggressively gay, and said he should not be selected as an ambassador to represent to the United States.",
        "Hagel has apologized for that comment.",
        "His apology was accepted by the gay rights group HRC, the Human Rights Campaign.",
        "Log Cabin Republicans, the conservative gay group, took out a full page ad in The New York Times opposing Hagel's record on gay rights.",
        "Is this likely to a significant factor?",
        "Well, it could be a factor.",
        "And also, Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the first openly gay member of Congress, came out against those comments and said, you know, how can someone, you know, be nominated for a big position in the administration after making those kind of comments?",
        "So this is an issue that probably won't die.",
        "But again, you have divisions, I think, in the gay community, some groups coming out and saying, we don't want see Hagel as a nominee.",
        "Others saying, well, he apologized for his comments, and we'll take him and his word.",
        "The other big line of pushback on Hagel has to do with Israel.",
        "Describe what he is being accused of there and what the arguments for and against are.",
        "Well, referred it one time in an interview to the Jewish lobby, and that rankled a lot of people.",
        "Obviously, it's a loaded term saying the Jewish lobby when he meant to say the Israeli lobby, and how much control it had on politicians in Washington.",
        "And so there was a concern.",
        "Some said that, you know, hinted of a bit of anti-Semitism on his part.",
        "Others came to his defense.",
        "But, you know, heading down that road of talking about the Israeli lobby in Washington is always be very perilous.",
        "He (unintelligible) in an in-artful way and, again, he back away from that and said and I shouldn't have said that Jewish lobby.",
        "I should've said the Israeli lobby.",
        "But I think he'll have problems with that, as well, we move forward in the nomination.",
        "We're talking about President Obama's second-term national security team, and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News.",
        "Let's look at another two opinions about Hagel.",
        "Tom Bowman, Pentagon correspondent, you described him as sort of an iconoclast, a guy who sings to his tune, marches to his own drummer, what have you.",
        "Well, here are - there are two opinions that see that as both a good thing and a bad thing.",
        "First, in the Weekly Standard, the conservative publication, Philip Terzian writes: It is likely that Hagel's appeal to Barack Obama derives from his status as a sometime Republican critic of the foreign and defense policies of the Bush administration, especially after the Iraq war.",
        "Presumably, this gives him a certain independent status.",
        "But it scarcely endears him to former Republican colleagues in Congress, and would hardly set him apart within the Obama White House.",
        "Hagel is equally famous for his choleric temperament and occasional offhand pronouncements that offend such loyal Democrats as Barney Frank.",
        "Simply stated, he says, there is no evidence that Chuck Hagel has the experience or temperament to master the gigantic defense establishment or deal effectively with Congress on delicate issues."

        "Then, on the contrary, Michael Hirsh in the National Journal sees this as a positive point.",
        "He argues: The truth about Chuck Hagel is that he saw, before most, that America was embarking on an unparalleled strategic disaster by diverting its attention from al-Qaida a decade ago.",
        "He saw and had the courage to say that his own president and party were failing to anticipate the enormous cost of going into Iraq and of losing focus in Afghanistan.",
        "He continues: We are still paying dearly for that mistake in blood and treasure, and yet very few people who supported it - senators, pundits, editors - have shown the integrity thus far to admit that they were wrong and that Hagel was right.",
        "This is the Chuck Hagel kaleidoscope.",
        "You can refer it in any way you want, and you'll get the Chuck Hagel that you want to see.",

        "They sent 30,000 troops over.",
        "I was reporting from Iraq at that time, and clearly, the surge did help turn things around.",
        "It brought down a level of violence in Iraq.",
        "So watch for McCain to him hard on that, you know, calling into questions of judgment, for example, on the question of the surge.",
        "But then again, a lot of people at the time were against the surge, and many people today will look at the Iraq war and say: Was it worth it?",

        "So I don't know what his reasoning was.",

        "So, you know, it's hard to see why so many are against him.",

        "There are a couple of comments here and there, couple of positions.",
        "And his supporters come back and say, look at his voting record.",
        "Look at his speeches.",
        "Look at the books he's written.",
        "Look what he said about Israel, for example, that he's a strong supporter of Israel.",
