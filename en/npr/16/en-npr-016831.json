        "Your opponent, though, in the primary, Andrew Romanoff, and certainly your challenger in the race for November will be saying you are an incumbent.",
        "You are the Washington insider, and what we need is change.",
        "Well, I think what I'll say is that I've been there for 18 months, and it's enough to see that the place is not particularly responsive to the needs of Americans and Coloradans, going through the most savage economy since the Great Depression.",

        "Do you think that if you look at the general electorate, one-third of whom in Colorado are not affiliated with a party, does Barack Obama standing next to you in Colorado help or hurt?",
        "I don't know.",
        "I think it certainly helped during the primary, and we'll make a judgment going forward.",
        "I do believe that in a state where you've got a third Democratic voters, a third Republican voters, and a third unaffiliated -and everybody is independent-minded in this state - that what people are really interested in is less partisan solutions to problems, and more interested in trying to have people work together.",
        "It is a huge puzzle to people here why no one in Washington can seem to get along with each other.",

        "What are voters saying there?",
        "Yeah, I mean, I think he just he was able to tap into an excited base of voters.",
        "He obviously ran a good primary campaign, and I congratulate him for it.",
        "I think that his views are far to the right of his party and don't reflect, you know, the mainstream in Colorado.",
