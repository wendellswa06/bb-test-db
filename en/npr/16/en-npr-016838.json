        "It raises money for both bases.",
        "I see no way that this isn't one of the central points.",
        "But there is a great many other areas of the law that could change dramatically because of this appointment.",
        "What about this broader question of trying to predict where someone will land on certain issues?",
        "I mean, is it just understood that that's part of the process?",
        "And was it always this way?",
        "Not really.",

        "They viewed Kennedy as a surprise.",
        "Kennedy's a very - was a very conservative justice except on a couple of issues that really ring the chimes of social conservatives - namely, gay rights and gay marriage and abortion.",
        "The conservatives don't like those surprises, so they look at every aspect of nominee's potential record.",
        "And that's why they like having people with judicial records - so they can see how they ruled on specific questions.",
        "Whatever it is, they want to know where their guy or gal is.",
        "Talk, if you would, about the role that the confirmation hearings themselves actually play in determining who will eventually make it to the court.",
        "I mean, a number of people noted that the most recent justice to be confirmed, Neil Gorsuch, didn't really seem to say a lot about himself over the course of those hearings.",
        "Is that a change from the past?",
        "That's definitely a change.",
        "Of course, you have to understand that we didn't even have these kinds of confirmation hearings really until the '30s, '40s, '50s.",
        "So, in bygone eras, there was, I think, a hesitation by both Democrats and Republicans to really hold a nominee's feet to the fire.",
        "And when there was a huge controversy, it was most often about the nominee's allegedly unethical behavior or something like that.",
        "In more modern times, what really changed things was the Bork hearings.",

        "But the hearings - he was on the witness stand for five days.",
        "That's a long time.",
        "And, when he was done, he had lost the fight, essentially.",
        "And there were a handful of Republicans who were going to vote against him and conservative Democrats who were going to vote against him who had not been pledged to vote against him before.",
        "And, from that, presidents of both parties learned - we're going to prep our people, and they are going to say as little as possible.",
        "And the amount has gone down and down and down and down.",
        "And Gorsuch said the least.",
        "It took pulling teeth to get him to say that Brown v.",
        "the Board of Education was rightly decided because they've all been prepped that if you answer one question, it might lead you down a trail where you have to answer many.",
        "Is this something that people who watch the process closely are concerned about?"
