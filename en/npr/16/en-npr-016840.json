        "Hi.",
        "Thank you for taking my call.",
        "I just wanted to find out -just last couple of days, the Salt Lake City Council unanimously passed an ordinance - made it illegal to discriminate against gays in housing",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "and in visitation and all of these things that theyve been - you know, the gay community has been looking for.",
        "And strangely enough, the LDS Church has actually backed it.",
        "They were big donators, as you know, to Proposition 8 in California.",
        "So, again, you know, this is the step in the right direction.",
        "But, boy, weve got a long way to go before gay marriage is legal and sanctioned by the state.",
        "Just a reminder, Proposition 8 was to overturn gay marriage in the state of California.",
        "But Bishop Robinson?",
        "You know, Im so encouraged about what just happened in Salt Lake City, Greg.",
        "I was there not too long ago and talking with some of the leaders there.",
        "And there seemed to be an indication that the Mormon Church was at least at the very beginning of rethinking their stance on this.",
        "And they realized that with their input into the Prop 8 fight in California, that their standing as a national denomination really had suffered from that.",
        "And I think this may be the first gentle melting of what has been a pretty solid opposition on their part, and I really congratulate them for that.",
        "Yes.",
        "Once you start treating gay people like human beings, theres kind of no into it until we have our full rights.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It was a big black eye for the church, I think, when they supported the Proposition 8.",
        "And I think this is, again, a step in the right direction for everyone involved.",
        "But we've got a long way to go.",
        "Greg, thanks for the call.",
        "Thank you."

        "Appreciate it.",

        "Perhaps well discuss it next time you join us on the program, sir.",
        "Yes.",
        "And Gene Robinson, you used the expression civil rights.",
        "As you know, this became an issue in the battle over Proposition 8 in California, where it was not - just not the Mormon church that was opposed to the gay rights issue, but a lot of African-American churches, a lot of African-Americans who resented the application of the term civil rights to an issue that they thought this did not have any parallel.",
        "The discussion with the African-American community is very complex.",
        "And I'm the last person in the world to say to the African-American community what they should be thinking or doing.",
        "What I will say is that the dynamics that operate in any kind of oppression are similar.",
        "And the way in which we took our prejudice against black people in this country and turned it into laws and customs and Jim Crow laws and voter registration restrictions is the same kind of dynamic that goes on when we favor heterosexual people over homosexual people.",
        "We don't allow them to serve openly in the military.",
        "We don't allow them the secular privilege of marriage.",
        "And remember, we're talking about the secular state here.",
        "No one is saying that a church or synagogue or mosque has to preside over a gay wedding.",
        "What we're saying is that marriage is a civil institution.",
        "When you get divorced, you don't go back to the church or synagogue for your divorce.",
        "You go to the courts, because it is, indeed, the state that effects the marriage.",
        "And that has gotten very confused in this country because we have deputized clergy of all stripes to act as agents of the state.",
        "But when you go to a wedding, you don't know when the civil part begins and ends, and the religious part begins and ends.",
        "And I think if we could separate those two things, many, many people who are opposed to gay marriage and will never be a part of one will see that the civil right to marriage is something that is due all of our citizens.",
        "And really, it is something that religions should stay out of.",
        "We're always worried in the separation of church and state debate, that the state will impinge on the church.",
        "But I think this is an instance in which the church is trying to impinge on the state and impose its own values on the civil society.",
        "And just to stem the flow of the emails, which I know were coming, I think Bishop Robinson is absolutely right very broadly on the question of divorce.",
        "But, yes, there are religious courts that do have jurisdiction over some Jewish marriages.",
        "So",
        "Yes, you're right.",

        "No.",

        "It is rarely a good sign, and it is tough to know how to play this out.",
        "But, you know, what I would say to Jennifer, as she well knows, three of the four dioceses - including her own - that I have attempted to leave the Episcopal Church, are the three dioceses that still, to this day, refused to ordain women to the priesthood.",
        "Terrific.",
        "Gene Robinson, thank you very much for your time today.",
