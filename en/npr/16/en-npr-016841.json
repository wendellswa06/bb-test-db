        "Thank you very much.",

        "Here in Arizona, Prop 102 was passed by voters in 2008 which amended the state Constitution to define marriage to be only between a man and a woman.",
        "This is quite frustrating to my partner and I, as we have been together now for over five-and-a-half years.",
        "I feel there is still intolerance of gay marriage here in Arizona, but I feel that we are making baby steps towards marriage equality.",
        "I would like to see gay marriage fully legal before we die, similar to Canada, Sweden and Norway and a handful of other countries.",
        "And Arizona, of course, I dont have the number of the top of my head, but well over a dozen states have amended their constitutions, which, of course, is going to make it extremely difficult to un-amend them.",
        "Thats true.",
        "You know, we were talking about the civil rights movement of the 60s before, and I find that movement so inspiring.",
        "Black Americans across this nation went out into the streets knowing that they were going to face snarling dogs and fire hoses and sometimes death, and they did it anyway because they kept the big prize in mind.",
        "And that was their full citizenship in this country, their real freedom as promised in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.",
        "And so I think, you know, its going to take some time.",
        "Some of us may not - Im sure Im older than Mark.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Some of us may not live to see it, but its enough that we take our place in this great march forward, because, you know, we know where this is going to end.",
        "That - I know where this is going to end.",
        "Its going to end with the full inclusion of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in the life of the society and in the life of our religious communities.",
        "I believe thats where God wants us to go.",
        "And, you know, Im always nervous -even as a religious person - to claim that I know what God thinks.",
        "But everything that I read in a Holy Scripture tells me that that Gods love is more expansive, deeper, wider, broader than anything we can imagine, and that God is so much better at loving us than we are at loving each other.",
        "And so I think as we move forward in this, we just need to keep that prize in mind, both for our religious institutions, as well as for the culture.",
        "And you may have that optimism.",
        "Nevertheless, I wouldnt pretend to know anything about Gods plan, or if there is one.",
        "But nevertheless, a political strategist can look at whats happened and say every time voters have had the opportunity to vote on this issue, they have voted the other way.",
        "Well, does anyone think that the elimination of Jim Crow laws or the Voter Registration Act would have survived a popular vote in the South or perhaps anywhere else in America in the early 60s?",
        "I think not.",
        "And the notion of putting anyones civil rights up for a vote is just preposterous in the American dream.",
        "After all, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights protects the vulnerable minorities from the will of the majority.",
        "So I think the prior question to be asked is: Is this an appropriate thing to put up for a vote in the first place?"

        "And I would be the first to get in line to hold his feet to the fire about the promises that he made to us.",
        "On the other hand, I think it is simply crazy to pick a fight with, obviously, the most gay-friendly president we have ever had and may have for a long time.",
        "Ive been to Washington, to the White House, and have talked with people.",

        "And lets remember it was Bill Clinton under whom the Defense of Marriage Act was signed.",
        "I think President Obama is committed to doing this slowly and well so that we dont have that kind of reaction.",
        "And I think for us to pick a fight with him at this point is simply against our best interest.",
        "Now, if he doesnt come through on that, I will join right in with you.",

        "Hi.",
        "I just wanted to say that as I thought about this issue, to me the word marriage connotes a partnering of two different things, whether its a cheese and a wine, a great sauce with a meat, any one of this and one of that that got well together.",
        "And Ive just been wondering why is it that this word marriage is so important to homosexual couples?",
        "I have no problem with them having every single legal right that a heterosexual married couple would have, but the word marriage troubles me because it does not mean or connote two of the same things.",
        "Marriage, the word, does have a lot of power.",
        "But I think I would ask you back if the word doesnt mean all that much, then why do heterosexuals want to hold on to it as their very own?",
        "I think words do matter.",
        "And what it matters for us is this: It has a lot to do with respect and recognition.",
        "If my partner is in a car accident and Im running into the hospital to make medical decisions for him, I dont want to have to stop and explain what a civil union is, and what the parameters of that and what are my responsibilities and what are my obligations.",
        "If I say that Im this mans husband, then its very clear what my rights are.",
        "I can get into the hospital.",
        "I can make those decisions.",
        "Anything less than marriage is simply not equal, and we learned a long time ago that separate is not the same as equal.",
        "And I think thats why this word means so much to us.",
        "And at a time when marriage clearly is in trouble - and by the way, it was in trouble a long time before gay people wanted to be married.",
        "At a time when its in trouble, it should be kind of refreshing that so many gay and lesbian couples want to embrace that institution and to live fully into it and live by all of its obligations and to have these kinds of faithful, monogamous lifelong intentioned relationships sanctioned in marriage.",
        "Sidney",
        "I have no problem with people being in a lifelong, faithful monogamous relationship.",
        "But I guess I would ask the same question of homosexual couples, why - that you ask of a heterosexual couple, why the word marriage - when it does connote two different things - and I think that society, we are - where we can easily grasp what a civil union means and - or (unintelligible) other than marriage.",
        "Sidney, I suspect were not going to change any minds here in the next couple of minutes.",
        "But thank you very much for your phone call.",
        "I think it is important to note, Neal, that the definition of marriage has actually changed quite a lot over its history.",
        "Most recently, of course, only 30 or so - 40 years ago, in most states, President Obamas parents could not have been married because interracial marriages were not tolerated.",
        "And so, this notion that marriage has always been the same thing since the beginning of time is just simply not true.",
        "And I would say that this is just the latest evolution."

        "As you look at popular culture, do you -there are more and more gay characters on television, it seems, and in the movies.",
        "Do you embrace that?",
        "Do you accept that?",
        "Or - some people would say on the other side, might say with this another cultural imposition from the coasts.",
        "I think it is just simply the development of our time, you know.",
        "Everything has its moment, and this is the moment when perhaps even coming out of the AIDS crisis - you know, that was a terrible and awful thing.",
        "But perhaps the one bright light coming out of that is that so many Americans discovered that they knew someone gay because they got sick and they died.",
        "And it began this kind of feeling in the gay community that we have to stand up and be who we are.",
        "And religious people have really played an enormous role in this, because as religious people, we believe that God loves us as we are - not because were perfect, but because were Gods children.",
        "And to face into the kind of criticism that has always come from religious institutions has been a big task for us.",
        "I mean, lets be honest.",
        "Ninety-five percent of the discrimination that we experience come at the hands of religious people and religious institutions.",
        "And we have let the Christian right speak -or at least attempt to speak, purport to speak for all Christians everywhere.",
        "And the fact of the matter is that many Christians and Jews - and Muslims, even, today - are finding their way through their - those sacred texts and understanding that they do not necessarily say what they seem to be saying, and that indeed this is just another progression in Gods - in our perception of Gods love for us all.",

        "It's only new on the radar screen of the music industry, hence its labeling by media and press as urban alternative; in other words, urban but different, not sounding like what current hip-hop or rhythm and blues, rock, pop is supposed to sound like according to major recording labels and terrestrial radio station networks."
