        "Right.",
        "Well, the other part of the baby brain is to actually be able to look.",
        "We can now look with diffusion tensor imaging at the superhighways in the brain.",
        "You can see how language areas and executive control areas are related to the reward system.",
        "You know, that squirt of dopamine that I hope you're all getting now as you listen to me talk, and you're imaging your little child and your little grandchild, that squirt of dopamine in the reward system has a lot to do with how it is that we learn at different ages.",
        "So understanding what drives human learning at different ages, and it's different over your - over the lifespan, will help us, help all children because that critical first five years, when typical kids are cruising along, but kids with developmental disabilities are not, is very, very important and also for all of us who want to keep our brains alive all our lives.",

        "There's no universal agreement.",
        "But there's widespread - sort of it relates to the feeling, it feels like something.",

        "It feels like something to be interviewed by you.",
        "It feels like something to be a man.",

        "Of course it has many fewer neurons, roughly a million neurons, but it may well feel like something to be a bee.",
        "And so the question is: How does this feeling, how does this subjective feeling come into the world?",
        "That's always been the mystery.",
        "It's always been the central mystery about consciousness.",
        "Now, Eric Kandel spent his whole lifetime looking at cells of a sea slug and won the Nobel Prize eventually for it.",
        "Can you bring that to a higher level?",
        "Because he was probing an individual cell almost like you're talking about probing individual cells in the brain.",
        "Is that - can you get - can you learn as much as he might have from - or learn more about how consciousness is from those individual cells?",
        "Yes.",
        "So, ultimately, what we're doing - and President Obama is launching a new initiative to try to speed this up - is to record, to listen in.",
        "So you can put a piece of wire into a human brain during neurosurgery, or you can do it in animal brains, and you can listen to the way neurons chat to each other.",

        "I mean, the brain itself doesn't sound like anything (unintelligible).",
        "So here, we're listening to sound track that's made by putting a piece of wire into, in this case, a human brain during neurosurgery and amplifying the electrical signal.",
        "And each of those little clicks is actually a little pulse that's being sent by one neuron to roughly - we don't know - anywhere between 5,000 and 10,000 other neurons.",
        "And so you have to imagine, as we talk right now, you know, there are literally billions of neurons that chatter away in this code either - and they're sending them out, and they're receiving it.",
        "And somehow, out of this cacophony arises, you know, this stable perception arises the fact that I can - I have a voice in my head, and it sounds like you.",

        "Too reductionist here, I guess is what I'm asking.",

        "Yeah.",

        "But the good question you ask is that maybe consciousness requires more than just a reductionist approach.",
        "And so there are some theories that try to address that, that, in fact, argue that the part of the brain that's not reducible, in some sense, that's what gives rise to consciousness.",
        "So we don't know.",
        "But it has been so successful, so that's, of course, what we should do.",

        "Dr.",
        "Kuhl, you - one area you do a lot of work on is in language.",
        "Tell us what you're trying to find out about language.",
        "Language is one of the quintessential human abilities, and we're trying to understand how it comes together in the human brain.",
        "As Christof says, we're - we know that the activity is happening at the neuronal level, but it's when millions of neurons are coordinated to do something like listen to a word and recognize it, to have an idea in your head requires this - that you will compute all the statistics and create an idea.",
        "We're trying to understand how that happens in the baby brain, and how being bathed in one language, as opposed to another, or being bathed in two at the same time - as in bilingual children - how does that change the whole brain?",
        "And, in fact, it does.",
        "What we're seeing is that areas of the brain are different.",
        "The connectivity is different.",
        "The superhighways are constructed differently in bilingual and monolingual brains.",
        "And, in fact, bilingual brains are more creative.",
        "They're more - they're not smarter.",
        "It's not your general IQ.",
        "But it is your ability to be a flexible thinker.",
        "When solving a problem, if you're bilingual - whether you're a baby or whether you're an adult - you're going to be better at solving a novel problem."

        "So we have all these new imaging techniques, not looking at individual neurons, but when thousands of neurons fire in coordination and change current flow, we have babies and adults sitting in something that looks like a hairdryer from Mars, but it's completely safe and completely noninvasive and absolutely silent.",
        "So we can play things for themselves, show them pictures, show them movies and watch their brains as they are processing real words, and link that to their structures.",
        "We have like a - with MRI and DTI, you have a static photograph of that individual child's brain, the connections in that brain, and how this activity fires in the various areas.",
        "So that's brand new and very, very exciting.",
        "You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR.",
        "I'm talking with Christopher Koch and Patricia Kuhl.",
        "We're talking about brain, listening and learning from the brain.",
        "Is there a tool - I'm going to give you the same question I gave to Christopher - to Christof.",
        "If I could give you a blank check and you could invent a machine to study the brain, what would it be, and what would you like to see?",
        "Well, we want to see the next generation of something like magnetoencephalography.",
        "I mean, it is picking up a current flow, and it's able to see with millimeter accuracy, but we want to get even smaller than that - a millisecond accuracy where the activity is in the brain, what's the cortical dynamics that's going on as kids learn.",
        "And how does the structure that was built yesterday operate today as the kid looks forward in their world?",
        "So we want better and more efficient machines.",
        "We want things that will allow us to see with absolute clarity how one brain differs from another.",
        "And why is that important?",
        "Well, we just showed in a study published May 29th that if you take a simple brain measure on a child with autism at the age of two, you can predict better than any other measure that we have how that children's - that child's outcomes will look at age four and age six, not only in language.",
        "This is a language probe at the age of two, how the brain responds to known words, but how that child behaves throughout the language arena and cognition and adaptive behavior, and it gets stronger over time.",
        "So these brain measures are not only going to reveal the wonder of the human brain for all of us over the age - over our ages, but for children who have disabilities, we can get in there early with biomarkers to say where in the brain - one, this child's at risk, but, two, where in the brain, what structures, what superhighways are missing?",
        "What might we do to create better interventions that don't miss that window of opportunity?",
        "We've got to get in there really early when the brain is plastic and change the course of that child's life and that child's family's life.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "What is the physical thing that constitutes thought?",
        "And could you find that by just tracking the electrical signals from the outside inputs?",
