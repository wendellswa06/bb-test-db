        "And before the break, a very good question came in from a young member of our audience, wanting to know, OK, so what happens to all the stuff you - that flows into your brain, all the information and stuff?",
        "What happens to it?",
        "Christof, you want to tackle that?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Jordan, so I think it's a very good question.",

        "In both cases, you have information that flows in, in one case through transistors, in the other case through nerve cells in our eyes.",
        "For example, if I look at you.",
        "And then as you said, we have to track - just like in a computer, we can track so that the electric activity in the various transistors, we can do the same in the brain.",
        "We can track the electrical activity, either using the methods that Patricia Kuhl alluded to from the outside, using EG or EMG, or we can put microelectrodes in it or other tools, and we can see how the electric activity moves through the brain and activates language area or activates a part of the brain that's responsible for seeing, or another part of the brain that's responsible for hearing.",
        "And then ultimately, it activates part of the brain that's responsible for motion, and then we move our eyes, or we speak.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "You talk - you've brought in some references to computer, transistors and things like that.",
        "In your book, you compare the brain with its hundred billion neurons to the Internet, which has several billion computers there.",
        "Could consciousness arise from the Internet?",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "We know what - we know what's out there now.",
        "But could something meaningful like consciousness arise from the Internet?",
        "In principle, yes.",
        "In practice, we have no idea, and I don't think it's a useful research topic right now.",
        "But in principle...",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "Why not?",
        "Well, I mean, let's first look at the analogy.",
        "The brain is a very complicated network that consists of individual elements called nerve cells.",
        "OK?",

        "So maybe it's also possible that collective, as a whole, it also feels like something to be the Internet.",

        "You kind of answered most of my question.",
        "In science fiction, you just have a big enough computer, and it might become conscious.",
        "So - but expanding on that, do you use computer simulations, and is it helpful for studying the brain?",
        "Yeah, it's essential.",
        "So we - for example, right now, at the Allen Institute, we have this very large project where we're recording from brains, human and animal brains, but we also are simulating it.",
        "Because even if you could record from - even if you could visualize the activity of every single nerve cell in something I call a brain TV - imagine a television with something like 200,000 pixel by 200,000 pixel.",
        "And every pixel is the activity of one single nerve cell, and sometimes it turns white when it fires one of these pulses, and sometimes it usually goes black.",
        "And now I'm looking at this picture of 100 billion pixel, right?",
        "I probably wouldn't understand any of it.",
        "So I need a theory.",
        "I need a model.",
        "I need a theory to say, OK, this is language and this is vision.",
        "And it's vision for the following reason, and it's language for the other reason.",
        "And this happens, you know, if you look at the brain TV of a schizophrenic patient because it's hardly different, and that's why the person hears a voice.",
        "And so it's essential to theories, and then it's actually essential to the test in using computers."
