        "So a lot of people encounter the healthcare system, they go through medical evaluation, they're never offered an HIV test, they never disclose or reveal HIV risk behaviors.",
        "And so, consequently, they go for years without having their diagnosis obtained.",
        "We do know that many people, about 40 percent of people, at the time they have their first HIV diagnosis, they already have progressed to disease related HIV.",
        "Meaning that they've been infected for several years.",
        "Now, undoubtedly, some of the people who are going to be tested in this way will be shocked to learn that they have HIV.",
        "And our problems in our healthcare system, I think, are pretty well known - a fact that many doctors feel that they are already very pressed for time, that they don't have the time to spend that they would like to have.",
        "Even people who are privately insured are often dissatisfied with their care.",
        "They feel that their doctors don't spend enough time with them.",
        "So if you do have universal testing and this just becomes one more tests, are you convinced that the medical profession - that the nurses and doctors, everybody involved in the system - who are already pressed for time, are going to take the time to offer people the kind of counseling and care that they need to address this news?",
        "Our recommendations are very clear on these issues; that, first of all, we feel that testing should always be voluntary.",
        "Information about an HIV test should always be provided in a language that the person can understand, so they know that an HIV test is being offered.",
        "They should always have the opportunity to ask questions about the test, and given an opportunity to decline testing if they choose not to have it.",
        "So this information should be provided.",
        "People should know they're going to be tested, and that is very important that people have an opportunity to learn their test and the information is transmitted to them.",
        "And especially for those people who are identified as HIV/AIDS-positive, the first test would usually be a preliminary test.",
        "And then they'd have a confirmatory follow up test.",
        "But it's very important that these individuals receive comprehensive counseling, supportive services, care treatment, and then prevention counseling to allow them to avoid transmitting HIV to other people.",
        "Are you convinced though, that most practitioners already have the training they need to offer this kind of care?",
        "Or do you think more people will need to be trained to offer the kind of care that is going to be needed."

        "We've had a long process with medical providers and we're continuing that process.",
        "We're now engaged on a number of fronts with a broad sector of medical providers to address the - some of the issues you raise: the kind of training, the kind of information, the kind of procedures that need to get set up in clinical setting to allow this testing to happen.",
        "There will be a need for training, there will be a need for procedures, and CDC will be working with our medical partners, our other federal partners, to elaborate what we call implementation guidance, which will be exactly the kind of tool kits, or information you're suggesting, that would need to go out to medical settings that will be doing this kind of testing.",
        "Is it your hope that practitioners will start this right now, or that jurisdictions will start this practice right now?",
        "It is.",
        "We think many jurisdictions can start this.",
        "Indeed, we know that some already have started this.",

        "And so, we will learn a great deal from these earlier - these early initiatives.",
        "We've done a number of projects over the last three years - what we call demonstration projects - to learn how to do this in various clinical settings.",
        "But as we roll these recommendations out in more jurisdictions, those will be wonderful learning experiences to learn how to do this better.",

        "And what are your concerns about these new recommendations?",
        "Well, I have two concerns that I have heard from critics and in the community.",
        "The first is that the use of opt-out tests often deteriorate into testing without a patient's knowledge or consent.",
        "And that violates the most basic rights of patients: the right to make an informed, voluntary decision about whether or not to undergo a test or any kind of treatment.",
        "We had this discussion with Terry Schiavo a couple of ago.",
        "A second concern is that testing is not treatment and there's no guarantee that anyone with a positive test will get treatment here.",
        "I think we all share the goal of trying to get people into treatment to help them live longer and better lives, but this is only a recommendation for testing.",
        "It can't create the link to treatment, and so the only guaranteed consequence of more testing is simply that more people who test positive will be reported to their health department and ultimately to the CDC.",
        "But what about Dr. Mastro's point that it would encourage them to change their behavior?",
        "I'm going to go to a caller for a moment, but Dr. Mastro, do you just want to address that point before I do?",
        "Dr. Mastro?",
        "Yes, there is actually a difference between opt-in and opt-out testing, and we advocate opt-out testing, which is really to set up a situation where testing would be offered and it would be the default, if you will, always with the information provided and the opportunity to decline.",
        "It's proven over the last couple of years that the requirement for extensive focus pretest counseling as well as explicit written informed consent have proven to be barriers in many clinical settings.",
