        "Joe, you're on the air.",
        "What are your thoughts about this?",
        "My question is - especially in the field.",
        "People are coming in to, like, city centers or, like, county health centers and they want to be tested and it's basically a free-service provider or a very, very small fee, depending on their income - but they always have that option, you know, to be tested for HIV.",
        "There's all these other, you know, blood viruses or sexually transmitted diseases and there's always that big, you know - they check it off to have that done.",
        "I mean, if the blood is already being drawn and the testing can be done, why don't they just make that mandatory and, you know, they can record and also let these people know - that are carrying this disease, unknowingly - you know, let them know where they're at and what the risks are involved.",
        "So, you know, they might change their behavior.",
        "You know, most people will when they're informed on it.",
        "We have this large group of people that are completely living in denial or unaware…",
        "Okay, I think we understand your question and Dr. Mastro's time is limited so I think I'm going to thank you for calling and Dr. Mastro, why not make it mandatory?",
        "Very briefly if you would.",
        "We believe very strongly that all HIV testing should be voluntary.",
        "It should be voluntary and with the full knowledge and awareness of the individual with an opportunity to decline.",
        "We don't feel there's really a role for mandatory testing.",
        "Okay, thank you.",
        "We need to go to a short break right now.",
        "Dr. Mastro, I want to thank you for your time.",

        "When we come back we'll continue our conversation with Wendy Mariner.",
        "Plus, we'll hear from the director of health from the District of Columbia.",
        "Stay with us.",
        "It's TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "I'm…",
        "(Soundbite of music)",
        "This is TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "I'm Michel Martin in Washington.",

        "Would it work where you live?",

        "I just wanted to add a comment, that a couple of years ago, before I got married I wanted to get tested.",
        "And my doctor - primary care physician - was doing regular blood work.",
        "And when I mentioned this he said, well, you're better off just going to one of these clinics downtown and not do this through your insurance, because he said in the event of a false positive, he says, it's going to open up a can of worms.",
        "Or it's something like a bankruptcy that's never going to leave your record and it'll be - even if it's false, even if you go back and you're healthy and there's no HIV - the fact that you had that false positive is going to all of a sudden cause problems and paperwork and so forth, so he recommended I do not get tested.",
        "What did you decide to do?",
        "Well I just had him do the regular blood work and I got tested elsewhere, and I was fine.",
        "Do you mind if I ask how long ago this was?",
        "Two and a half, maybe three years ago.",
        "Maybe the testing has become more accurate now, I don't know, but this was at a large primary care physician hospital in Kansas City.",
        "That's not that long ago, either.",
        "No."

        "Wendy Mariner, what about that?",
        "Do you think that that's a common experience, that there is still a view that… First of all, are false positives very common - and I'm going to ask Dr. Payne this later when he joins us - but are false positives that common?",
        "Is it still that stigmatizing that you feel it would be in some peoples' interest not to be tested?",
        "I'll leave the false positive rate to the physicians and speak to the discrimination.",
        "And unfortunately, there is still stigma - as much as we would like to think that it is unnecessary and shouldn't exist - it still does exist and it can cause complications.",
        "There are indeed some individual insurance policies that could be affected by this and there may indeed be some social, housing, employment stigma that can arise.",
        "It's unfortunate.",
        "But despite that - and thank you for calling, Michael.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Bye-bye.",
        "Can it really be in anyone's interest not to be tested, even considering what you just told us?",
        "No, it's not that it's not in anyone's interest.",
        "Certainly, I think we would all encourage people to know whether they have HIV just like we would encourage people to know whether they have any other kind of illness: heart disease, cancer, other sexually transmitted diseases, as well.",
        "The question that we are concerned about is whether you need to have an opt-in - I'm sorry - an opt-out testing system to accomplish that, and I don't think it's necessary.",
        "What would be preferable?",
        "Certainly it would be preferable to have a system in which physicians were encouraged to offer HIV testing.",
        "There's nothing wrong with that and that's something to be encouraged.",
        "What we probably need more of is treatment programs that people can - where people can get the kind of care that they need and ways to get people to that program; accessible clinics, accessible transportation.",
        "And when that's available people are more willing to get tested because they know that they can in fact be helped.",

        "Well, I am a healthcare provider.",
        "I'm a physician.",
        "I strongly am supportive of the CDC recommendation that the testing be part of routine screening as patients enter the healthcare evaluation.",
        "There is historical precedence for testing.",
        "When I was a medical student we always, on everyone, tested them with something called a VDRL, which was for syphilis, and there was of course a time in our history when syphilis was epidemic.",
        "It is no longer, and the VDRL has been taken off the automatic testing panel.",
        "But now we have another epidemic on our hands and in some ways we are battling an enemy we can't see.",
        "And so it has grave implications for all of us - not just physicians but everybody in the world.",
        "So I again, in the short story, would be strongly supportive of the CDC recommendation.",
        "Did you hear Wendy Mariner's earlier point that she feels the same thing can be accomplished without the so-called opt-out provision, which is to say that - CDC's recommendation is that the test be given unless the patient affirmatively chooses to opt out.",
        "You have to put your hand up and say, I don't want this.",
        "And she's saying that she doesn't feel that that's necessary, that that's a step too far.",
        "What are your thoughts about that?",
        "Well, I may have been out of my car and on my way to my office, where I am right now.",
        "I think an opt-out is a copout.",
        "And you're not going to find all those enemies we can't see - and that's a metaphor - without making it automatic.",
        "What goes for one, goes for all.",
        "Why do you think that?",
        "Do you really think that that many people will choose to opt-out?",
        "I don't have a precise answer for that question, but yes, I think many people will choose to opt out."

        "You know, there's no science about this right now as far as percentages.",

        "No, I don't because I'm not in primary care.",
        "I guess I kind of have to trust my instincts.",
        "I'm in an area of specialization that does however, strongly encourage what we call universal precautions.",
        "Well, if the world was perfect we could employ universal precautions.",
        "But the world isn't perfect and using these so-called universal precautions imposes yet another burden on the healthcare provider, whether it be nurse, doctor, aid.",
        "I mean, we can't run around all the time wearing gloves with plastic masks shielding our eyes.",
        "It just isn't possible.",

        "What's good for one is good for all.",

        "We find in a given year, in all of D.C., it's about 18 to 20,000 get tested.",
        "So we think it's had an impact but it will take time to make this routine."
