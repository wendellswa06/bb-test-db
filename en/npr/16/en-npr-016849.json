        "This was in advance of the CDC's recommendation, so why did you choose to do that here?",

        "Well, we knew these were coming out and let me just say that I think the CDC's done the right thing here based on science.",
        "They've really hit a homerun and it needed to be done.",
        "We felt, given our statistics are among the worst in the nation - our AIDS case rate is the highest in the country at 179 per 100,000.",
        "Given that, the CDC recommendation, and the fact that there's now a quick oral swab screening test available which gives you accurate results in about 20 minutes.",
        "You have to follow up with a blood test.",
        "Since that's available, it makes it very easy to do, so we felt it was imperative for us to be in the leading edge of this and we think we're the first to do it as a whole, and we began a program - Come Together Date of contact: Get Screened for HIV - about three months ago and we're having, I think, good success - has been good support in the community.",
        "It's my understanding, though, that of the people you tested so far, about three percent of them have tested positive.",
        "Is that right?",
        "That's pretty close.",
        "We're doing it at a number of places.",

        "Our biggest chain of primary care clinics is doing it.",
        "Four of our student health centers are doing it.",
        "We're doing it in all of our Department of Health-operated clinics, including detoxification, STD and TB, and also in the D.C.",

        "And I think it was stated earlier, over a million Americans have HIV.",
        "Up to a quarter million don't even know they have it.",
        "And given there's effective therapies now - and the point about changing your behaviors and not infect others - it's absolutely essential that we do this - our number one public health issue in D.C.",
        "But what about Wendy Mariner's point that she made earlier, that testing people doesn't necessarily link them to treatment.",
        "And if this isn't done in the right ways, people are just left with some bad news and no way to access the care that they need?",
        "(Singing) On a clear day...",
        "Well, that's a good point.",
        "It's true.",
        "And I think we have all the tools here to do it right, which is why we went ahead.",
        "And I think if you are found to positive - this is in health care settings only, which is important -you would immediately be referred to counseling.",
        "We've taken steps to enhance our ability to do counseling.",
        "Moreover; insurance.",
        "District of Columbia has one of the highest insurance rates in the country - over 90 percent - between Medicaid, the DC Alliance and other insurance programs.",
        "So we think we can refer people, get them the care they need, because it's very important to follow up that with counseling and the drugs, therapy, needed to make it stick and make it work.",
        "So we think we're able to do that.",
        "Wendy Mariner, I know you have go but just one more question.",
        "I was intrigued by the earlier caller who said that his doctor urged him - well, not urged him, I wouldn't say, that's why we - suggested to him, that he might not want to get tested if he really didn't think that he was part of a high-risk group because it could have to have complications, that it could cause him problems.",
        "So I did want to ask, though, if testing were to be universal, wouldn't that be one of the things that would help reduce the stigma - that there would be, first of all, enough data - it would be something that would be a universal experience.",
        "It's like getting pulled over in your car in a way.",
        "You know, how everybody kind of cranes their neck at you and you feel like - well, this isn't personal experience, of course I'm not saying - but hypothetically.",
        "That, you know, it's embarrassing but if it's the kind of experience - if it's the difference between being pulled over and going through a checkpoint.",
        "If everybody's got to go through the checkpoint, there's no stigma attached to it.",
        "So what are your thoughts about that?",
        "Well, I certainly think that a good goal is to make HIV infection like a chronic medical disease, like all others.",
        "But like all others - like heart disease, like cancer, like asthma, like migraines - it should be treated legally in the same way all other diseases are treated.",
        "And that means that the patient gets to decide - with voluntary in form of consent - whether to get diagnosed and treated.",
        "So I don't see any inconsistency there - quite the contrary.",
        "But I do think that the notion that…"

        "And then the second thing - which is going to sound sort of abstract to some people, but it's very real for the population I work with - is that those that are willing to get tested are used to getting paid to get tested.",
