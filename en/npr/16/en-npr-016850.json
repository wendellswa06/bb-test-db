        "And sports, which is supposed to be this meritocracy where if you're good you get to play, there's always been this contested political space.",

        "So, it's really fascinating political space.",
        "Do you agree, Dave Zirin, that part of the problem that athletes have, today's athlete, is when they individually become involved in political issues?",
        "Backing a candidate, or backing a proposition, or some sort of legislation?",
        "Do you see that as a problem for them?",
        "Well, I think it's a problem for the athlete because they have team owners, they have their coaches, they have their own personal entourage who tell them that they need to be quiet, that they've signed away their right to have opinions when they sign that contract.",

        "Malcolm X was a leader of a very small, narrow group of people.",
        "Barack Obama is president of the United States."
