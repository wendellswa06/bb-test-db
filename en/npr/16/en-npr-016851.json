        "And so it's a faulty comparison, and I don't know if he thought he was going to strike a nerve with black folk around the world or people of color around the world, but it was really ridiculous.",
        "I think, actually, it was a very smart move.",
        "I think it got him on the front pages for a period of time.",
        "I don't think that al-Qaeda's issue was with George Bush per say.",
        "I think al-Qaeda was able to make an issue with George Bush because so many people had a problem with George Bush.",
        "When you look at the statements that they've made about why they're doing what they're doing, it isn't tied to any particular administration or president.",
        "It has to do with a fundamental issue about how the United States interacts with the Arab world and their vision of the Caliphate.",
        "When we look ahead to the foreign policy issues affecting this presidency that we have coming up, many people have said that, you know, the issues are going to hit pretty quick of how you balance the promise to get out of the war in 16 months with the promise to now create tens of millions of new jobs.",
        "Those are both two very deep promises, and they're not necessarily in opposition, but they may be in opposition in terms of how much time the president can spend on them.",
        "And they would both radically transform the society at present.",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "So, well, I'm going to go to you, Shaun.",
        "Do you think that there are going to be issues in dealing with these issues of foreign security, including terrorism, and then dealing with the economy at home?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean, it's going to be tough, but I think what Obama is doing, and I even see today the markets are going up, they went up on Friday, he's trying to put the best, most capable people, people that do have big egos, big leadership quotas, he's trying to put the right people in the right places to, kind of, manage the economy, to manage national security, to manage foreign affairs.",
        "So he's bringing the right people to the table.",
        "There's so much for him to do, he knows he can't do it all by himself.",
        "And so I think he's bringing, from either Jim Jones with national security or today we say Geithner and Larry Summers and others dealing with the economy.",
        "This is not something that one man could do by himself.",
        "And so I think people are starting to feel at least a little more comfortable knowing that you may have someone like Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton, who have great world travel - and they do come as a team, whether we like it or not, dealing with international relations.",
        "So Obama is picking the right people to be in leadership, and so he's definitely going to have to manage all of these things.",
        "It's going to be difficult, but I'm encouraged.",
        "All right, guys.",
        "We need you to stay with us.",
        "We're going to take a break and come back and talk a little bit about Saxby Chambliss and a race there - the question of whether or not black folks will turn out.",

        "The incumbent, Chambliss, didn't get 50 percent of the vote.",
        "Now, African Americans turned out in large numbers to vote early for the presidential race, but this could be a case of much lower black turnout.",
        "Democrats are just two seats shy of the 60-seat filibuster-proof majority, and some say a visit by President-elect Obama is the only way to recreate the base turnout on November 4th.",
        "Kimberly, how do you see this shaking out, particularly with the black vote?",
        "This is one of the things that concerned me in the election, that if Barack Obama didn't win, how would the Democratic Party rejuvenate the black vote and the youth vote and the new voters?",
        "Well, now we see that they're going to have to do that a little sooner than the mid-year elections two years from now.",
        "I think that Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton should return to Georgia to rejuvenate that black vote.",
        "I think that a visit, if the seat is worth it to him, especially if Al Franken wins in Minnesota over the incumbent Norm Coleman, to get that 60 votes.",
        "If it is that important to him.",
        "Some people say that he doesn't want to make that trip to, you know, risk his reputation in case there is a Democratic loss.",
        "Shaun, you're in Atlanta.",
        "What do you think Barack Obama hasn't had, perhaps, as much traction in Georgia to begin with?",

        "I mean, I know he didn't win the state, but it was a very narrow loss.",
        "I mean, it really surprised me that it was as close as it was.",
        "I understand the argument that people want him to come here, but I find it very unlikely that Jim Martin's going to win that race.",
        "If Jim Martin lost with all of the black vote, it's going to be very, very difficult for him win.",
        "But the truth is that turnout is low on both sides of the aisle.",
        "I mean, people here in Georgia really have political fatigue right now.",
        "I mean, the commercials are going non-stop, and so people are really turned off, I think, by the race altogether.",
        "And I think Barack Obama also doesn't want to lower himself and kind of get into this very messy political fray.",
        "And even like Kim said, and then come here and campaign for someone that may lose.",
        "The truth is, though, that I think the Democrats really already have a de facto 60-person vote in the Senate.",
        "There are several very moderate and even kind of left-leaning Republicans in the Senate that are going to give them that 60-vote filibuster with some tough issues.",
        "Harry, do you feel as secure about whether or not the Democrats have a filibuster-proof majority?"

        "No, I think it's excellent.",
        "When I first read it, I thought back to, you know, when I first listened to \"\"Rapper's Delight,\"\" and I remember being in the car and, you know, my mother said, this will never last, you know.",
