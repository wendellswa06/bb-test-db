        "Wow, well, this has been one of the most exciting weekends and early weeks in Austria, I think, in its post-war history.",
        "On Friday night as everyone's heading home from work, all of a sudden the social media networks are erupting with news of a leaked video of the vice chancellor of Austria, Heinz-Christian Strache of the far-right Freedom Party, and his young protege in a villa in Ibiza, drunk...",
        "Ibiza being the Spanish island where this video was filmed.",
        "Exactly - just blathering on and on to a Russian woman who they believed was the niece of a prominent Russian oligarch.",
        "And I'll just insert here that I have not had the opportunity to verify exactly what is being documented on this video.",
        "But what it has done is raise all of these questions in Austria about the extent of Russian influence in Austrian politics.",
        "Is that right?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And, I mean, it's funny because these are actually fake Russians.",
        "This is - these are not necessarily people that were sent from the Kremlin.",
        "We don't really know the provenance of the video.",
        "Some people believe it's an activist collective.",
        "Other people are speculating that some secret services of various countries were involved.",
        "But the most important thing to say is that Vice Chancellor Strache hasn't denied any of the assertions.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, let me insert a practical question here.",
        "Where does this leave the government of Austria?",
        "Who's in charge today?",
        "Oh, my goodness, the crisis keeps deepening by the day.",
        "Yesterday, some of the parties called for a vote of no confidence.",
        "The chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, was hoping that he could get rid of Interior Minister Kickl, who has also been the center of several scandals himself during the course of the 18 months that they've been in government.",
        "The other ministers of Transport, Defense and Labor said, we're going to leave, too.",
        "So you're describing all sorts of behind-closed-doors machinations going on here.",
        "But bottom line - as Austria prepares to go to bed tonight, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz is still in charge of the government, but he doesn't have much of a government now that his coalition has fallen apart.",
        "Exactly.",
        "How is this playing as you are out and about interviewing people on the streets of Vienna?"

        "Well, in Vienna, people are extremely concerned.",

        "But you know, the first poll since the scandal came out yesterday, and the Freedom Party lost 4% to 5%.",
        "But they're still polling at 18%.",

        "And there's something tragic about that.",
        "It's as if the stick is over their head that says if you dare have opinions beyond what sport drink someone should drink, or whether they should wear Adidas or Nike, then therefore they're somehow denied their right to be fully formed human beings.",
        "Now, we have just this week, Dave, another example of that involving a Dallas Mavericks basketball player by the name of Josh Howard, who was caught - presumable caught, I don't know what the exact circumstances were about him being on video...",
        "A cell phone camera.",
        "Right.",

        "It was caught on a cell phone camera, it was at I believe a flag football event, like it was hardly some big official game, and what he said was he said no, I don't stand for the National Anthem, I'm black.",
        "And that, of course, you bring in the issues of race, and you bring in the issues of patriotism, and of course sports radio, the confederate confines of sports radio, as I call them, they absolutely blow up with controversy.",
        "Well, I would like to take a step back from it though, and say well, why can't we actually have a discussion about why is this the only country in the world that plays the National Anthem before sporting events?",
        "Why in Major League Baseball, for example, do many teams now do two national anthems?",
        "One before the game, and one during the seventh inning stretch?",
        "Why does patriotism have to be such an intertwined part of sports?",
        "And that's one of the issues I take up in the book.",
        "Now, patriotism and race are also as you mentioned issues that are intertwined with sports, but with regard to race, it goes back I'm thinking as far as sports has been around.",
        "Particularly in, and you talk about this in your book, with figures like Jack Johnson.",
        "Oh, let's go way before Jack Johnson, let's talk about slavery in this country because there's - it's incredibly interesting stories because when you - during slavery, sports were used in a lot of ways like religion as a way to try to keep people calm and pacified on a plantation.",
        "But also like religion, many slaves actually then incorporated sports into their lives as a means of escape, but also as a means of practicing tools of resistance, and also a way to build a sense of community obviously in a very dyspeptic situation.",
        "Now you mentioned Jack Johnson, and that to me was really a jumping off point in the 20th century about the way sports is often the space where for African-Americans racism was challenged in a very, very public field."

        "Has the relationship in your view between sports and politics changed significantly today, and in what ways has it?",
        "I think it's profoundly changed, and I think more than ever this generation of athletes have been robbed of their history, robbed of the knowledge of activist athletes from years past.",
        "I think there's more pressure on athletes to be what sports managers call a global brand, this idea that you can be actually wiped clean of any controversial or political edges and be presented as an empty vessel, as a commercial figure, as a corporation with legs.",
        "And the shame about that is not because I worry about the soul of LeBron James, or the intellectual development of Kobe Bryant, it's nothing as trite as that, it's that I worry about the message it sends to millions and millions of young people is that what you want to aspire to is not having opinions about the world.",

        "They think they don't know what they're talking about.",
        "And when you hear it from your friend or peer, they kind of take it more seriously.",
