        "Good morning.",

        "Well, Ms. Pugh started to serve on the board of the University of Maryland Medical System in 2001.",
        "And there came a time, as she has described it, that she has authored children's books - they're health and nutrition books - animated books, I mean, with illustrations, et cetera - and came a time when she showed the books to one of the board members - not very specific about when that was.",
        "And they entered into this agreement - although she's been very clear to say there was no contract - by which the University of Maryland Medical System paid her $100,000 five different times since 2011 to publish 20,000 books at a time.",
        "Now, I guess we could see the rationale here, that this is - what?",
        "- for kids, for patients in the hospitals, but it's also a board member getting a huge payment without a lot of competitive bidding, it sounds like.",
        "And that's certainly where the first questions start, and it doesn't just surround her, although she's the most high-profile visible because she's the mayor of the city of Baltimore elected in 2016.",
        "But there have now nine board members of the University of Maryland Medical System that have been - the questions have been raised because they all have these kinds of what they call self-dealing.",

        "And when he felt it was dangerous or when he felt he didn't want me outside, he'd send me to his mom's house, Miss May, and she would sit there and she would explain to me - again, kind of a living history - she would tell me why the projects were built, what it was like for mothers of street-gang leaders, how she played a role in this community.",
        "I think probably the most important thing I learned from her was the first she said to me is don't pity me.",

        "So if we go back 30, 40 years in public housing, we might remember something called the man-in-the-house rule, and that existed in many poor communities, that women received aid from the government on behalf of their children, and often they couldn't - they had to hide the men who were living in the home.",
        "So in places like public housing and the Taylor homes with 30,000 people, 70 percent were women with children.",

        "For the first 18 months, two years perhaps, I was really under his thumb.",

        "The squatter wouldn't do it, and J.T.",
        "beat him up.",
        "And I watched him do this.",
        "And you know, just very quickly any kind of romantic illusion I had about these street gangs was just dispelled because of the immediate ways in which they would resort to violence.",
        "And in this community, where this a big underground economy, that's really the side that was most shocking was that at any moment, things could just explode.",
        "It could become very violent either with people getting beat or worse, with drive-by shootings and gun violence.",
        "You talk about a guy named Officer Jerry.",
        "Who's he, and what was he like?",
        "I remember going back and reading the newspaper reports about policing in the community when it was being built, and just after 1970 or so, you'd hear police say this place is too dangerous for us to come into.",
        "I mean, imagine a place where the police felt it was too dangerous for them.",
        "And those statements happened over and over and over.",
        "And what would end up happening is that either police would not come in or you'd get these kinds of rogue cops, these folks like this guy Officer Jerry who would come and shake down residents and act really in an unaccountable way.",
        "And resident rightly just feared the police because they would experience these sorts of beatings and shakedowns, and I talk about and I describe some of that in the book, and also the ways in which other police officers tried to change the image of policing by doing things more responsibly.",
        "So you had a lot of internal divisions within the police and that most of us don't see when we think about some of these inner-city communities."
