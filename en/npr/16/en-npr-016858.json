        "They asked him if the order to kill the interpreters that was issued before is still valid and he said, it is fully valid and it's forbidden to collaborate with the invaders and occupiers in Iraq.",
        "And if you collaborated, you have to face the Islamic justice.",
        "It must be maddening to spend all your time indoors, tending that little garden, as you say, raising tomatoes from seeds, yet given that atmosphere, you know it must be even more crazy to think about going outdoors.",
        "Well, I'm not exaggerating if I said I haven't seen daylight since like three or four weeks because even I'm trying to sleep, you know, the difference in timing between Iraq and the United States.",
        "So - and my fiance is in California, so she's about 10 hours far from me.",
        "So I almost sleep the day here and wake up at night, which is night - it's just midnight now in Baghdad and...",
        "The tourism that forms a large part of the country's economy is - well, that's gone on the rocks, and there's a lot of frustration, too, that change is not happening quicker.",
        "Let's go next to - I'm sorry, did you want to say something, Dalia?",
        "There is.",
        "About 75 percent of Egyptians want to see Mubarak go on trial, for example, and that hasn't happened yet.",
        "And that's just one example of a part of the revolution that has yet to manifest.",
        "Tunisia, very similar kinds of frustrations.",
        "We read of riots in the streets of Tunis in the past few weeks.",
        "Yes.",

        "Monarchies have enjoyed a very different fate, at least in the short run.",
        "Well, you look at the monarchies like Jordan and Morocco for example.",

        "The monarchies are not under attack.",
        "Reform of the monarchy is what people are asking for rather than an abolishment of the monarchy.",
        "And so these countries have more time than other countries that have been led by minority regimes, you know, for decades.",
        "The question today is whether these countries will use the time wisely to get ahead of the street and put in place a serious reform process or think that this time, you know, might give them a false sense of security that they don't need to do much.",
        "You talked about minority regimes.",
        "The one kingdom that is a minority regime is in Bahrain, and that's where most of the trouble has been.",

        "You have 30 percent that are Sunnis, 70 percent that are Shiite.",
        "Obviously, the status quo is not sustainable, and you need a better form to run the country than what exists today.",
        "Let me ask you, though, a broader question, and it relates to some of the things that Dahlia Mogahed was just talking about, and that is this sense of expectation.",
        "A year ago, you would have said there is very little sense that change is even possible.",
        "Now it seems change is happening so fast, people can't keep track of it.",
        "Well, we need to look at the process of change.",
        "On one hand, of course, there's a sense of empowerment that is permeating now across the region.",
        "For decades, Arabs felt the powerlessness - powerless over decisions either taken by their countries or by the outside community.",
        "That is being shattered.",
        "There's a new sense of empowerment that they can have a say in the decision-making process and the future of their own country.",
        "But at the same time, I think it would be wrong to assume that this is going to be a linear process, a process that is going to go smoothly, without any problems."

        "Economic reform has a bad name in the Arab world because it has not been coupled with a political reform process, and therefore many people feel that the benefits of economic reform over the last 20 years have gone to an elite few and have not been trickled to the general public.",
        "And so there are many, many challenges that need to be addressed, and that is why I do not really like to call this the Arab Spring.",

        "It doesn't mean that economic needs weren't there, but they weren't primary.",

        "They're not focusing on the economy, actually.",

        "Everyone has almost flipped from only focusing on their basic needs and economic issues to now only talking about politics.",
        "It's what you hear everywhere in Cairo, and I think that that's going to eventually catch up with Egypt, where they're going to have to think about what are those economic policies, not just what kind of elections they want.",

        "In a pluralistic system, where you open up and offer alternatives to people, then the Islamic parties will have to compete against, you know, a multitude of other parties rather than just against the political establishment.",
        "So I think, you know, this notion, particularly in the West, that you can ignore or exclude Islamic organizations from political activity is simplistic at best.",
