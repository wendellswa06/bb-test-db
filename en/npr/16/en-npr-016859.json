        "Well, in the past there is no question that the United States prioritized stability over democracy, or over reform, if you want.",
        "We've heard rhetoric since the Arab uprisings that suggest that the United States want to pursue a new policy of stability through reform rather than over reform.",
        "Frankly, that has not been yet translated into any meaningful new policy.",
        "First of all, Arab countries are different, and there are different interests for the United States in each Arab country, and that explains in part why the reaction to Libya has been different than the reaction to Bahrain, has been different than the reaction to Syria."

        "I think that's frankly shortsighted.",
        "I think that there is a new atmosphere in the Arab world and that if the United States is going to continue to apply old policies to new realities, it will continue to suffer from a credibility gap, which is becoming, you know, bigger and bigger by the day in the region.",
        "Yet you see the - at least some representatives of the Saudi government, the monarchy there, bitterly criticizing the United States for, as they see, abandoning their old friend President Mubarak in his time of need and making it clear that they would brook no American effort to support the protestors in Bahrain, which they see as vital bulwark against Iran.",
        "I see a growing gap between Saudi Arabia and the United States in the coming period.",
        "When the issues were peace and security, two issues that both countries saw eye-to-eye on, even with 9/11, the two countries were able to cooperate very effectively on these two issues.",
        "Now that the issue of reform has come in, it's a complicating factor.",
        "It's an issue that both countries do not agree on, and I do not yet see any serious move on each part to actually address this and come to terms with it.",
        "I do see a growing gap there.",
        "Let's go next to - I'm sorry, did you want to say something, Dalia?",
        "I was going to say that supporting democracy is in the long-term interest of the United States, and I think President Obama has articulated that.",
        "To make that - if that is really our interest as Americans, I think there's three things that we can do to make that happen.",
        "Number one, we need to step back and allow the political process in Tunisia and Egypt to take its own path.",
        "The worst thing that we can do for our allies, right now, is impose or get - or become too helpful in that political process.",

        "You've seen it in Lebanon where there is no national consensus on the demands of the country and where there are - there is a weak central, if you want, government and sectarian needs and interests.",
        "That might explain in part why we have not seen the same kind of uprisings that we have seen elsewhere.",
        "On the Palestinian issue, I think that I've always said the United States is not going to be able to regain any form of credibility with the region if it argues to the region, that if you are an Egyptian or a Libyan or a Syrian yearning for freedom, then we are with you, but if you are a Palestinian yearning for freedom, it's complicated.",
        "That's not an argument that will win hearts, not just among the Palestinians, but among the rest of the Arab world.",
        "What will happen also if the Palestinians treat also, you know, participate in these uprisings in a peaceful way, I think that will put Israel in a very difficult position, where the Israelis will not be able to, you know, shoot Palestinians for weeks or months."

        "Well, I think there are a number of reasons.",
        "But one possible reason is things according to our research are actually a little better in Algeria.",
        "So what we found in Egypt and Tunisia before the revolutions is that their sense of life satisfaction - it's an index that we measure around the world - the life satisfaction index of Tunisians and Egyptians was plummeting as their GDP per capita was rising, and they were getting accolades from everyone about their economic reform.",
        "It - not only wasn't it trickling it down, but it was actually causing people to plummet further and further into poverty.",
        "We don't see the same - at least not to the same degree in Algeria.",
        "Marwan Muasher has to leave us in a couple of minutes, and I wanted to take advantage of his presence for the moment.",
        "We've been talking about places where either there was dramatic change - Tunisia and Egypt - or whether there are promises of reform in Bahrain or Jordan, and we'll have to see whether that happens or the degree to which that happens in those place.",

        "This is a minority regime where not 10 percent rule over, you know, 90 percent of the population.",
        "Any reform, any serious reform process, for such a regime means that they will, you know, be out of the picture.",
        "Lose power.",
        "And therefore, there is no interest on the part of the regime to, you know, engage in any such serious reform.",
