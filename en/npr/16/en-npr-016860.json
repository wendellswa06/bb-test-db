        "Go ahead.",
        "The comment, first, is about all these dictators or autocrats that have ruled the Arab countries for the past 30 or 40 years.",
        "Those guys have not done anything good for their people other than the whole time, their time is preoccupied with just holding onto power.",
        "And my question is, why, all of a sudden, after 30 or 40 years that the West, and especially the United States, figured that these guys are no good, and now they are on the bad side?",
        "Where, like, Hosni Mubarak, I mean, he served the interest of America more than the interests of his people.",
        "I had - my father, he visited Egypt about two years ago.",
        "And the poverty that he saw in Egypt, he said he's never seen in his life.",
        "And on the other hand, the guy has accumulated 50 or $60 billion.",
        "And I wanted to see why - I mean, I could have told you this 20 years ago, where you guys, nobody wanted him.",
        "And speaking as an Iraqi-American, I know, you know, we've been through a lot in Iraq with Saddam Hussein.",
        "But back in the days when Saddam used to serve the interests of the United States, you know, with the Iraq-Iran War, everybody, you know, including Secretary of State Rumsfeld who went and visited in 1980, shook his hand and patted him on the back.",
        "All of a sudden, he became a bad guy.",
        "And I wanted to see why, all of a sudden, again, with all these guys in the Middle East now that, oh, you know what?",
        "Oh, by the way, these guys are all bad.",
        "We should get rid of them.",
        "Well, things have changed, Ahmed.",
        "But that's a short answer.",
        "As you think of the example of Saddam Hussein, though, these strong men - the autocrats, as we describe them - they did serve a purpose of stability.",
        "They held places together - obviously, Iraq undone, certainly, at the hands of the United States, but clearly a lot of that instability was there already.",
        "That was inherent in Iraqi society.",
        "Saddam ruled with an iron fist, of course, but he held a society - that country together and all the competing interests.",
        "And, Dalia Mogahed, that is not inconsiderable.",
        "You have to count that as part of it.",
        "You certainly do.",
        "And I think one of the most interesting questions I get when I go to Cairo is why did it take Obama so long to side with the people?",
        "In their view, it took him forever, that he only did it at the very end when it was apparent that there was no turning back.",
        "And I think that what's important to understand is at the end of the day, America has its interests.",
        "And its interests were, at one point, served by these autocrats.",
        "When these dictators became unable to deliver stability because the people had risen up and had made their desires clear, had refused to accept the status quo, then America's interests simply shift.",
        "They shift to the people versus their dictator, and that's why we change sides.",
        "I think that that's something we're always going to do as a nation-state with interests.",
        "We will always go with where our interests lie.",
        "And at this point, it is with the people, and so we have to shift our policies to where our interests now are.",

        "According to our research, 83 percent of Egyptians say they supported the protests that overthrew Mubarak.",
        "Eleven percent actually participated in them.",
        "And that's about seven million people, at some point, participated in the protests.",
        "So it was much more than 60,000.",
        "Now, what the future holds for Egypt, will it be a sea change or will it be just an upgraded autocracy?",
        "Of course, it's hard to tell.",
        "But what has changed, and what has changed fundamentally is the psychology of the populace.",
        "It is a - it has gone from submissive and willing to accept abuse, essentially, to one that has a sense of entitlement and a sense of ownership for their future.",
        "And I do think that that is an important change that will ultimately determine the makeup of the next government.",
