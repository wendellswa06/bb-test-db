        "And, Janet, is this the Carlyle Group, the private equity firm that President George Bush advised in the early 1990s?",
        "Well, Carlyle Capital is affiliated with the Carlyle Group, Madeleine, and managers of the group own about 15 percent of this fund Carlyle Capital that we're talking about.",
        "It's one of 55 funds managed by Carlyle Group, and it was also the first Carlyle Group fund to go public last summer at $19 a share on an exchange in Amsterdam.",
        "So even though this is a hedge fund, it is available to anyone, people like me and you on the open market in Amsterdam.",
        "I see.",
        "And I'm sorry, you sound like you have a cold.",
        "So I hope you can...",

        "I apologize.",

        "Just a few more questions.",
        "How does a hedge fund go from billions of dollars in assets to basically worthless?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, Carlyle Capital did have $22 billion in mortgage-backed funds.",
        "There we have it.",
        "And the banks lent it most of that money and they called and wanted their money back.",
        "It's called a margin call.",
        "But the fund couldn't come up with the cash, and when it couldn't meet the bank's demands, its shares started to fall.",
        "And now those shares have lost more than 98 percent of their value.",
        "And this is just one hedge fund, right?",
        "But it's the fear that it could spread?",
        "Exactly.",
        "The fear, Madeleine, is that this is just the beginning.",
        "Some other funds in the U.K.",
        "went under a few weeks ago, and the fear is that we're going to see more funds go down as money or liquidity gets harder and harder to get because of the credit crunch brought on by defaults on mortgages.",
        "And hedge funds rely on credit to finance their investments and they can't get that easy credit anymore.",
        "Justin Urquhart Stewart is a London-based fund manager from Seven Investment Group.",
        "He put it this way.",
        "There are going to be more failures coming through.",
        "And in the words of, I think the motto of the British Royal Tank Regiment, it's mud, blood and green fields beyond.",
        "We're in the mud, we're seeing the first of the blood, and I'm afraid there's no sign of green fields as yet.",
        "So there you have it.",
        "No sign of green fields and expecting more bloodshed."

        "I do think we're going to have to see taxpayer money put on the line to go in and buy mortgage loans and mortgage securities.",
        "It can be done in a way that would not bail out investors or borrowers but at least provide some stability to the market.",
        "So there we have Zandi, who says taxpayers are going to have to get involved in some sort of bailout, and if we don't, it's going to end up costing us even more money.",

        "They believe the economy will improve.",
        "There is so much optimism, but at the same time, there is also a great deal of concern about security issues, as well as local struggles with the economy.",

        "The tourism that forms a large part of the country's economy is - well, that's gone on the rocks, and there's a lot of frustration, too, that change is not happening quicker.",
        "There is.",
        "About 75 percent of Egyptians want to see Mubarak go on trial, for example, and that hasn't happened yet.",
        "And that's just one example of a part of the revolution that has yet to manifest.",
        "Tunisia, very similar kinds of frustrations.",

        "Well, you look at the monarchies like Jordan and Morocco for example.",

        "That is being shattered.",

        "Economic reform has a bad name in the Arab world because it has not been coupled with a political reform process, and therefore many people feel that the benefits of economic reform over the last 20 years have gone to an elite few and have not been trickled to the general public.",
