        "The interesting thing is that most existing political parties just have very little support.",

        "I think the Muslim Brotherhood in particular has been used as a scare tactic for so long by Arab governments to scare people, you know, away from pluralistic systems.",
        "I think in closed political systems, where you only have two alternatives, either the political establishments or, you know, the Islamic opposition, people are going to flock to the Islamic opposition if they're not satisfied with the status quo.",
        "In a pluralistic system, where you open up and offer alternatives to people, then the Islamic parties will have to compete against, you know, a multitude of other parties rather than just against the political establishment.",
        "So I think, you know, this notion, particularly in the West, that you can ignore or exclude Islamic organizations from political activity is simplistic at best.",
        "What we do need to, I think, ensure is that all parties, Islamic and otherwise, commit to the principle of peaceful means and to the principle of political pluralism at all times.",
        "And if Egypt and other countries succeed in enshrining these principles in the emerging constitutions, then over time I think we will have a healthy and pluralistic society in Egypt and elsewhere.",
        "Just as Tunisia and then Egypt led the parade of peoples who started marching in the streets and demanding changes, do they see themselves as models?",
        "If you ask them that question of whether they see themselves - and if so, they must be very proud.",
        "There is a tremendous amount of national pride in Egypt right now, specifically where I've been, where I visited after the revolution.",
        "Just one example of that is before the revolution, about 25 percent of Egyptians wanted to leave Egypt, wanted to migrate.",
        "And it correlated very well with their satisfaction of their standard of living."

        "What's so interesting now is that people's satisfaction with standard of living has actually decreased after the revolution, yet their dedication to Egypt has increased.",
        "Their likelihood of wanting to stay in Egypt, despite all the hardships, has actually skyrocketed.",
        "So in so many different ways, people now feel like they have a sense of ownership, that they have a stake in this game called their country's future.",
        "Before the revolution, they very much saw themselves as observers.",
        "Also saw a lot of people go back who had left and emigrated, and now they want to be part of that future, want to take part.",

        "What do you think?",
        "Well, in the past there is no question that the United States prioritized stability over democracy, or over reform, if you want.",
        "We've heard rhetoric since the Arab uprisings that suggest that the United States want to pursue a new policy of stability through reform rather than over reform.",
        "Frankly, that has not been yet translated into any meaningful new policy.",
        "First of all, Arab countries are different, and there are different interests for the United States in each Arab country, and that explains in part why the reaction to Libya has been different than the reaction to Bahrain, has been different than the reaction to Syria.",
        "And therefore, while it is easy to say that from now on, the United States is going to sort of prioritize democracy more, the interest part of the equation suggests that that so far has not yet been translated into any clear policy.",
        "I think that's frankly shortsighted.",
        "I think that there is a new atmosphere in the Arab world and that if the United States is going to continue to apply old policies to new realities, it will continue to suffer from a credibility gap, which is becoming, you know, bigger and bigger by the day in the region."

        "Yet you see the - at least some representatives of the Saudi government, the monarchy there, bitterly criticizing the United States for, as they see, abandoning their old friend President Mubarak in his time of need and making it clear that they would brook no American effort to support the protestors in Bahrain, which they see as vital bulwark against Iran.",

        "I was going to say that supporting democracy is in the long-term interest of the United States, and I think President Obama has articulated that.",
        "To make that - if that is really our interest as Americans, I think there's three things that we can do to make that happen.",
        "Number one, we need to step back and allow the political process in Tunisia and Egypt to take its own path.",
        "The worst thing that we can do for our allies, right now, is impose or get - or become too helpful in that political process.",
        "Do you see any sign of that?",

        "Yes, hi, I have a question for both guests, actually two questions, if I can.",

        "And my second part of the question is that do you think the U.S.",

        "You've seen it in Lebanon where there is no national consensus on the demands of the country and where there are - there is a weak central, if you want, government and sectarian needs and interests.",
        "That might explain in part why we have not seen the same kind of uprisings that we have seen elsewhere.",
        "On the Palestinian issue, I think that I've always said the United States is not going to be able to regain any form of credibility with the region if it argues to the region, that if you are an Egyptian or a Libyan or a Syrian yearning for freedom, then we are with you, but if you are a Palestinian yearning for freedom, it's complicated.",
        "That's not an argument that will win hearts, not just among the Palestinians, but among the rest of the Arab world.",
        "What will happen also if the Palestinians treat also, you know, participate in these uprisings in a peaceful way, I think that will put Israel in a very difficult position, where the Israelis will not be able to, you know, shoot Palestinians for weeks or months.",
        "Well, it could also be quite a challenge to the Palestinian Authority.",
        "Absolutely, absolutely.",
        "I mean, you cannot really exclude any Arab country from what is going on.",
        "I think that this is a feeling, as we talked before, of power - of empowerment that is sort of new in the Arab world, a feeling that people can effect change and can effect change peacefully."
