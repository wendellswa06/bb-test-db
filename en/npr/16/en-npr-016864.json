        "And Megan, one big change is that Colorado now expects to make money from marijuana.",
        "It does on a couple of fronts.",
        "One, licensing the patients, is a pretty costly endeavor for folks.",
        "It's a $99 fee to become a marijuana patient here.",
        "And then the centers face local licensing fees, state licensing fees.",
        "I think there was a moment when it looked like medical marijuana had arrived in the state because the state legislature tried to raid their cash fund to balance the budget, as they have done with every other fee-based entity in the state.",
        "And were they successful?",
        "No.",
        "It's interesting, a lot of marijuana advocates say as soon as the state sees the benefits of taxation, that is going to change things.",
        "It's - certainly in the debate over regulation in the state, there was at one point a movement to make medical marijuana tax exempt because you don't pay sales tax on your pharmacological - pharmaceutical items.",
        "And lawmakers generally said, you know, we can't go forward with that.",
        "We're bringing in a lot of money on the sales tax and this is a lot more popular with us if there's a state revenue side to it.",
        "So it starts being regulated a little bit more like liquor rather than like pharmaceuticals.",
        "Certainly talking to the folks who put together the regulations, they were pulling from liquor regulations, from the gaming industry, looking at existing for-profit industries that have a recreational side, often.",
        "Yet, you say have a recreational side, they're not supposed to.",

        "There are lot of people who point out that the medical marijuana registry in the state is now overwhelmingly young and male and overwhelmingly going to people who list pain as their ailment.",
        "And of the allowed conditions, it's the only one that there's not a very clear test for.",
        "And these are not dispensaries that are tucked away discretely around the corner.",
        "I don't know if you've gotten a chance to drive around Denver, Neal, but you see a lot of storefront dispensaries.",
        "And I kind of think that it's following a liquor store model in the sense that you get some that are one might say very much of the recreational culture.",
        "Daddy Fat Sacks was a name of a dispensary that has since gone out of business but that we would cite here as sort of a cultural - from the recreational side possibly, certainly a cultural offering.",
        "And then you have folks on the high-end side who are trying to look like health spas and organic food stores.",
        "But you see different types, and you see them all over Denver.",
        "And it's almost a surprise.",
        "They're going to start regulating tomorrow.",
        "Medical marijuana has been legal here for 10 years.",
        "We didn't have storefronts until a few years ago.",
        "In the spring of 2009, the Obama administration's Justice Department put out a memo saying it wouldn't prosecute people who are complying with state medical marijuana laws.",
        "And at the same time, our state health board made a decision that made it possible for people to serve more than a very limited group of patients.",
        "Those two things put together led a lot of people to say, hey, I'm now safe to open up a storefront.",
        "We've had them - a lot of them - in the state for about two years now, a little - about a year and a half now.",
        "And so the state, after seeing what was going on for six months or so of stores opening everywhere stepped in and started regulating.",
        "Was there an effort at self-regulation first?",
        "There was a discussion in the industry.",
        "I sat in a fascinating meeting in the fall of 2010 where you had maybe a few - more than 100 people from the industry and patient advocates, and they got in a room together, and you had one half saying, hey guys, we've got to chill out, we've got to self-regulate, can we knock off the neon pot leafs in the window, can we seek a low profile, basically, and the other half saying hey, you know what, this is in our state constitution, the voters approved it, let's go for it.",
        "We want to hear from those of you in law enforcement in the 16 states and the District of Columbia where medical marijuana is legal.",
        "We want to hear about the difficulties of your job dealing with that or, well, how your job has changed in any case.",

        "They've been published.",
        "Tomorrow's the official dateline that they take effect.",

        "And do you check on how many plants that place grew and how much they sold, and does A match B?",

        "And that's when we take it out of compliance and regulatory, and it becomes a criminal investigation.",
        "We've talked about checking on the users and on the people who sell and on the people who grow.",
        "If is it a wink and a nod, or to the degree it is a wink-and-a-nod industry, are you checking on the doctors who issue these prescriptions?",
        "Okay, with the doctors, again, in Colorado, under state law, remember that our patients, our doctors, our caregiver and the Colorado registry is all handled by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.",
        "Yes, we have a good working relationship with them, but I would even say they are having difficulty keeping up with the mandates and, should I say, the reference calls from law enforcement and the center themselves trying to confirm are these registry cards valid, are they current and how many plants per patient are the cards for.",
        "It sounds like they're being overwhelmed, Megan Verlee.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "There have been - there was, in recent years, a groundswell of people applying for the cards that caused a real backup.",
        "That's been addressed, but we do have this interesting bifurcated system where you've got one agency looking over kind of the medical side of it and the other agency looking over the retail side.",

        "Well, there's a big question in the state right now over caregivers, who are - folks who are not storefront retail but have a group of patients that they're supplying marijuana to.",
        "The state has enacted some actually very - much more stringent regulation of them than there was in the past, and there's a lot of outcry and even potentially a lawsuit right now saying, no, what's in the constitution allows for this very small sale, growing and providing of marijuana, and the state should not get as involved as it has been.",
