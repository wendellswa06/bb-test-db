        "One of the things you have to learn is that to a large degree, this business is now legal.",
        "I would say the compliance and regulatory aspect is legal, following state statutes.",

        "All right, we'll give you grapes there, but there are places in Northern California where this is the most important industry and as you say, juries are reluctant to do it unless there's something involved like a firearms charge.",
        "Pretty much.",
        "I mean, the last strictly marijuana conviction in this county, I probably got, and that was probably 10 or 11 years ago.",
        "And we would not have gotten that conviction today.",
        "And as you look toward the future, I don't think it would surprise people to say that at least in many parts of California, this is a wink-and-a-nod industry, and anybody who really wants to buy marijuana does not have to work very hard to get a card.",
        "Not at all.",

        "They can get their registry card then.",
        "And as James says, you see triathletes, skiers, motorcyclists, a great day at sport, and then you sit down and say oh, it's time to medicate now because I hurt.",

        "Thank you very much.",
        "It's true, and there are 16 states and the District of Columbia that allow medical marijuana in some way or another right now, and actually Massachusetts is considering it, I believe, kind of at this moment.",
        "A lot of states, maybe the majority of them, have looked at a nonprofit model, very different than we have here in Colorado, and often a very state-controlled model, where there's a certain number of centers, they're licensed to certain areas.",
        "Colorado's one of the few states that's kind of taken a free-market approach, where if you meet the state's criterias and have the money to get into this business - there's now a moratorium on licenses, but for a while, you could get into it."

        "It's always structured to go after an organization, a group, a conspiracy.",

        "It's very transparent.",
