        "And Michigan passed a medical marijuana law but does not yet have a statewide system set up to regulate it, correct?",
        "No, we do not.",
        "As of 2008, there was a voter-approved initiative.",
        "It was pretty overwhelming margin of approval of 60-plus percent.",
        "But since then, there have been numerous problems in terms of how this law is being enforced and how it's being interpreted.",
        "There are differences between different counties, different courts and different law enforcement priorities in different places.",
        "Well, you'd think the state attorney general would be the one to set the guidelines.",
        "Well, actually, very recently he has.",
        "Under Michigan's Medical Marijuana Act, patients and caregivers, who are the people who can legally grow and provide for medical marijuana patients, can have up to 12 plants per patient.",
        "But a patient or a person is only allowed to legally possess about two and half ounces of marijuana at any given time.",
        "Well, according to some of the law enforcement I talked to, about marijuana plant is about - comes out to about one pound of marijuana.",
        "So if you do the math there the grower ends up with a lot more marijuana than the patient can legally use or possess at any one time.",
        "So State Attorney General Bill Schuette has said that the - those, essentially, those operations, if there's a person, for example, who is a caregiver supplying for four or five patients, they cannot have, say, 60 plants in one area.",
        "They need to have a separate and secure facility for each 12 plants.",
        "And that's been that idea - well, first of all, it sort of get sort of this whole idea of collective, obviously.",
        "And then, secondly, there have, you know, been differences and interpretation in terms of what is a secured area.",
        "Is it a yard with a fence around it or is it in your basement locked away and completely out of sight?",
        "Megan?",
        "I had a question, because it sounds like there's a lot of control going on at the state level.",
        "But I noticed when I Googled Michigan and dispensaries, it seem like a lot of businesses popped up.",
        "Is there a lot of storefront right now?",
        "It depends where you go.",
        "If you were to go to Ann Arbor, Michigan, for example, there are some dispensaries that are operating fairly openly and pretty much unmolested by law enforcement from what I can tell and throughout the state.",
        "But in Oakland County, which is essentially suburban Detroit, there has also been a flourishing of dispensaries as there have been in various parts of the state.",
        "But the sheriff in that county has taken a pretty aggressive approach to shutting down dispensaries, saying that dispensaries are not explicitly allowed under the Michigan Medical Marijuana Act, which is true.",
        "However, they're also not explicitly prohibited.",
        "Is this driving the cops crazy?",
        "It is driving the cops absolutely crazy.",
        "One law enforcement officer I talked to, who actually works in Oakland County, said, you know, we're pulling our hair out here, that this has just made their lives so much more difficult and complicated and that they really spend a lot of time doing medical marijuana enforcement.",
        "And, but it's very complicated because they don't have access to a registry of patients and caregivers."

        "So the officer that I talked to...",
        "And they don't want to be seen battering down the door of cancer patients either.",

        "A number of years ago, Californians passed Proposition 215, which allowed for the use of medical marijuana and for cooperative distributions.",
        "However, last year, Cailfornians overwhelmingly overturned a initiative to legalize simple possession for everybody.",
        "So clearly, California wasn't ready to simply legalize mere possession of Marijuana for everyone.",
        "But de facto right now in this state - at least in my community - if you get a medical marijuana recommendation and it's not a prescription, it's a recommendation from a doctor, it leads to almost immune from any sort of (technical difficulty) possession or cultivation.",
        "And we're running into situations - I personally have run into situations where persons are on probation or parole for drug distribution that are now cultivating marijuana in their garage, and I mean fairly sophisticated operations.",
        "And simply because they possess that recommendation, we can't do anything to them.",
        "And the parole and probation system has a hands-off approach to it as well."

        "One of the other things that I think is overwhelmingly overlooked in this whole discussion here is the act of cultivating marijuana.",

        "But we don't have home people producing other types of medicine like OxyContin or things of that nature, yet we have people cultivating marijuana in their garage or in their backyards, thousands of dollars a pound and we regularly run into people that are victims of home invasion robberies from (technical difficulty) are stolen.",

        "It that gets brought up a lot in testimony about medical marijuana bills in the state, that there are a lot of opiates prescribed by doctors.",
        "You hear one argument that's been made a fair amount and I think carries some weight is that one reason we have certain doctors who write a lot of medical marijuana recommendations is because most of the health systems in the state don't let their doctors write recommendations for it.",
        "Certainly, if you're a Medicaid or a Medicare patient, that's not covered.",
        "And many of the large hospitals and health systems won't let their physicians do it.",
        "So people will maybe get sort of a primary diagnosis of pain or cancer or something, and then go to a doctor who specializes in a medical marijuana recommendation.",
        "Paul Schmidt, let me turn to you for the last word.",
        "And really going back on all of your experience with the DEA and now here in Colorado, what would you say to police officers who are facing this difficult world?",
        "And obviously it's a difficult world for patients, clearly for growers and people who run dispensaries too.",
        "I would say to my fellow law enforcement co-workers out there not to give up, that it's definitely not time to put our heads in the sand and say, oh, I never thought this would ever happen to us.",

        "It's here.",

        "Well, the story goes on to try to answer that question: Is the human brain sensitive or not to the weak electromagnetic radiation that is delivered from cell phones when you place them by the side of your ear?",
        "And we use positron emission tomography to measure brain glucose metabolism, which serves as an indicator of brain function because when the brain is activated, glucose metabolism goes up.",
        "And what we found was when we compared images of the brain when subjects had their cell phones, the right cell phone activated versus when they had the cell phones inactivated, there was a significant increase in brain glucose metabolism in the area of the brain near the antenna; which indicates that, indeed, the human brain is sensitive to the electromagnetic radiation emitted from cell phones.",
        "So you've seen the glucose activity, meaning something is happening, but you don't know what is happening.",
        "Right.",
        "We don't know where - first of all, we do not know what is the mechanism that is leading to the increase in glucose consumption, glucose metabolism.",
        "We interpret it to mean that the brain is activated because that's what happens when cells are activated: They increase the consumption of glucose.",
        "But how is that brought about?",
        "There's been a lot of controversy, for example, of whether cell phones could increase the temperature of the brain, which in turn could affect energy requirements.",
        "Alternatively, others have said: Could it be that you are changing the electrical gradients across the membrane that make cells much more excitable, or whether you are disrupting blood-brain barrier.",
        "The mechanism, we do not know, and also, the other issue that we don't know, which is the one that has generated the most interest, is how those things relate, for example, to the question of whether cell phones have or don't have potential deleterious effects to the brain.",
        "And based on our study, which documents that it's sensitive, we really cannot infer whether this is a bad or could even have potentially good applications.",
        "So that - our finding does not illuminate or enlighten that very important question of whether cell phone exposure could have detrimental effects.",
        "What it does tell, I mean, in being - in looking at the data in my brain certainly, is that we do have the obligation to evaluate whether there are long-term consequences from this exposure to electromagnetic radiation or not.",
