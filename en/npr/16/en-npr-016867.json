        "Yes, indeed, and I think that we need to - to me, the most important one, and that's the one that we as a research team would like to pursue, is what are the consequences of repeated stimulation of this type into the brain, say after 10, 15 years.",
        "Are there long-lasting changes?",
        "Or is this just an acute effect that if one's cell-phone exposure is interrupted, it has no consequences at all.",
        "And there are no answers for that particular question.",
        "We do not know.",
        "How long - just in your study, how long was the cell phone - did people have the cell phone up to the ears?",
        "Fifty minutes.",
        "Fifty, 5-0 minutes.",
        "Five, zero, 50.",
        "Five-zero minutes, and did the effect go away immediately when the cell phone was removed?",
        "Well, we didn't' study that because the way that we conducted the study, we only get one measurement.",
        "So the measurement was being done the last - so the cell phone was activated 30 minutes before we injected a radioactive glucose, and then it was continued for 20 minutes.",
        "So what we actually saw in terms of brain glucose metabolism were the effects of having the cell phone stimulating your brain.",
        "But it would be, of course, very interesting to evaluate, say, for example, 10 or 15 minutes.",
        "Does metabolism goes back to its previous state, or does it stay activated for a longer period of time?",
        "Unfortunately, our study cannot answer that question.",

        "Suppose I'm fantasizing that that's what happens because I don't know if it does or if it doesn't.",
        "But the issue that, to me, is interesting, but the most important question, is: Does it start to change the way that the brain functions in ways that it does not recover?",
        "That is to me the question that would worry me, if there is a long-lasting effect that persists after the exposure has long gone, in ways that could be detrimental to the function of the brain.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)",
        "And that, there is no data to indicate that that is the case, but also there is no data to indicate towards that we have evidence that that's not going to happen.",
        "And those studies should be done.",
        "How would you do that?",
        "What would the protocol be like?",
        "Would you follow the same people, or do you just do sort of a population-wide study?",
        "It's a very difficult study to do, and I think that in your question, you're already hinting at that.",
        "First of all, you're not going to be able to do a randomized trial, which is the way - the idea, experimental protocol to address if there are differences between metabolism in subjects that you're following prospectively that are exposed versus those that are not.",
        "That is a very unrealistic study.",
        "Nonetheless, within the constrains that one has, certainly you would like to, for example, ideally be able to do a prospective study that follows individuals at one point in time, in terms, for example, of brain glucose metabolism or activation patterns, using all their technologies, and then you follow them and assess if the areas of the brain, which are the ones that receiving the highest amount of electromagnetic radiation and do show the changes versus a control area that's far away.",
        "And this is actually possible for two things.",
        "One of them is we all tend to use our cell phones, in general, on the same side of the head.",
        "And we all tend to use it as to place the upper part in our ear and the lower part towards our mouth.",
        "So based on the cell phone model that you're using, you can very much estimate where the antenna is located and which are the areas that are going to be affected.",
        "One could take that difference, for example, of laterality and of placement within the brain in a prospective design.",
        "It's not trivial because cell phone technology changes, and one of the things, for example, that in the meantime, people say: Well, how are you using this information to give recommendations to others?",
        "Is it of any value?"

        "So I said, well, why not?",

        "The issue that becomes more problematic is you design trials to try to address that question within a certain period of time.",
        "So, say, for example, that I do have a device and I think that if there is evidence that this weak electromagnetic radiation does not have any untoward effects, I think, it is a valid question to try to do research to determine if there are potential therapeutic applications.",
        "But - so if I do a study and I do - I follow my subjects, say, for example, for 12 months or 24 months, does that really answer the question properly?",
        "And it's maybe that if not until I have followed them for five or 10 years...",
        "Right.",
        "...as the brain becomes also older, because what you may not see in a young brain that has much more resilience may become much more sensitive as an individual becomes older and has a cumulative effect from the exposure to that particular device."
