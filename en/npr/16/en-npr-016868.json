        "So I - is the instrument that we're using by itself affecting brain function in the technology we're trying to extract information directly about brain function?",
        "So for the past 15 years, we've been investigating the effects of magnetic radiation and exposure into brain metabolic activity.",
        "And we've shown - this was a recent study - that when we did place the subjects in the magnet and we use that gradient coils which are shifting gradient back - magnetic fields back and forth, we produce a significant change in brain glucose metabolism."

        "And so when we had those results, immediately the question that emerge is if that is the case, could there also be an effect from exposure to the electromagnetic radiation from cell phones?",

        "You start with one question, and you end up with many more questions.",
        "But of the questions that I'm most interested is trying to figure out if there is a design that we can do realistically that - realistically, I mean, that we'll not be incredibly expensive - that can address that very important question: Are there long-lasting consequences from exposure to these weak signals of electromagnetic radiation?",
