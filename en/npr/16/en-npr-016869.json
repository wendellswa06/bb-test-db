        "Ambassador Rice, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Good to be with you, Neal.",
        "And what's happening in the case?",
        "And one of the major security issues, well, not just this week but for some time now, is Iran.",
        "The Security Council added tougher sanctions on Tehran in June.",
        "Now in New York City this week, President Ahmadinejad alluded to war.",
        "Are we out of diplomatic options on Iran?",
        "No, Neal, in fact the sanctions that were imposed by the Security Council in June were extraordinarily tough, and they have been followed by even stronger measures from our own Congress, from members of the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Canada and Australia, among others, such that the Iranian regime is feeling real economic pressure for the first time in a long time.",
        "Their economy is already fragile, but now they're find it difficult to insure their shipping, to find fuel for their aircraft, to bank in the fashion that they've accustomed to banking internationally.",
        "And this pressure is actually creating greater opportunity for diplomacy.",
        "And that's the aim.",
        "We've always had a dual-track policy: pressure on the one hand and negotiations and engagement on the other.",
        "The purpose of sanctions are not to be an end in themselves to change the calculus of the Iranian regime so that they see that it is in their interest to negotiate seriously about ending their nuclear program.",
        "And as the pressure increases, we think they are giving more serious consideration to diplomacy.",
        "Publicly, if you listen to what they say, they have not changed their position a bit.",
        "Privately, are you hearing anything different?"

        "Well, Neal, I think it would be unusual to expect Ahmadinejad, with his penchant for bluster, to come to New York and say the sanctions are killing me.",
        "But what we see and what we hear makes us quite confident that they are indeed feeling this pain and that it is causing them to consider new approaches, including renewed possible overtures towards diplomacy.",
        "Let me ask you about you about another difficult spot: Somalia.",
        "Obviously, well, everybody describes it as a failed state.",
        "There is a vigorous piracy business operating from Somalia.",

        "peace enforcers in Somalia.",
        "Is there any movement on this?",
        "Well, there's no doubt that the situation in Somalia is extremely precarious.",
        "The United States and others in the international community are clear in their support for the transitional federal government, but that's a fragile government that only controls a portion of the capital, Mogadishu, and is being supported by an African Union peacekeeping force that we've contributed a great deal of resources to and logistical support.",
        "The aim is to build up the capacity of the African Union to expand its control over Mogadishu in support of the transitional federal government.",
        "And to do that, it needs more troops.",
        "It needs more logistical support.",
        "It needs more resources.",
        "So we're discussing, here at the United Nations, how to muster that additional support so that the African Union forces and indeed the government can be a sustained and credible bulwark against al-Shabab, which is closely affiliated with al-Qaida, and against other extremists that are terrorizing the population of Mogadishu and beyond.",
        "Have you spoken with the Kenyan foreign minister about his idea?",
        "I have spoken with the Kenyan foreign minister.",
        "He was in New York last week at the Security Council, where he made a very powerful plea for the international community to understand just how grave a threat the situation and lawlessness in Somalia poses to countries in the region, including Kenya.",
        "We're very close to Kenya and to other neighbors of Somalia in working to support them as they seek a solution both diplomatic and security to the situation in Somalia.",
        "We've been actively supporting the Ugandan and Burundian peacekeepers who are on the ground and facing that threat directly, and we continue to work with all of the neighbors and others in the international community on options for limiting the control of al-Shabab, pushing them back and supporting the transitional government as it seeks to assert greater authority."

        "Will there be winners and losers?",
        "Well, Neal, it's not as simple as that.",

        "national development strategy, and it is a core pillar of our larger national security strategy, which recognizes that poverty and underdevelopment in various parts of the world pose a threat to peace and security, can fuel conflict and that we have a strategic, as well as a moral and economic interest, in helping poor countries develop.",
        "One of the hallmarks of this strategy is to promote broad-based economic growth, growth that is sustainable, and it benefits the populations of the states concerned.",
        "We recognize that for assistance and support in various forms, whether it's aid, trade, investment, to be effective, it needs optimally to occur in an environment that's conducive, that means where their governance is responsible, where the leadership of the country in question is actually taking steps to facilitate and support development.",
        "And so there will be a greater degree of selectivity.",
        "We're going to seek in the first instance to partner with countries that are pursuing policies that are conducive to development.",
        "What kinds of questions do people come to you with?",
        "Sure, thank you.",
        "At the same time, we recognize, Neal, that there are some countries where the policy environment isn't optimal, where states are fragile and yet we have an interest in supporting their emerging from conflict or developing nonetheless.",
        "But we will be more selective.",
        "We'll be more focused.",
        "But most of all, we'll be smarter and pursue proven strategies that have succeeded in development rather than a plethora of scattershot policies.",

        "Because, Neal, we seek development in countries around the world for a variety of reasons, but one of them is because countries that are developing and prospering are countries that have greater disposable income that can be growing markets for American exports that can help in the creation of lasting jobs here for Americans at home.",

        "These were very powerful sanctions.",
        "But they were targeted, and they were smart, and they were not designed to impact the average Iranian or the Iranian population, and we don't believe they are.",
