        "And so we can actually listen to the dialogue, then, the back and forth between the frogs.",

        "That's male advertising.",
        "And eventually, in the next clip I think you're going to hear what happens to the male's advertisement call when he hears a call that the female makes.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's see if we can play that clip now.",
        "(Soundbite of frogs)",
        "Yeah.",
        "So that is the acoustic aphrodisiac of the female frog.",
        "So when a female is about to lay her eggs, she puts out that call, which Martha Tobias(ph) in my lab discovered and which Martha calls, for pretty obvious reasons, rapping.",
        "It's like a Geiger counter or machine-gun fire.",
        "And it's so exciting to the male, that if you do it in the lab from an underwater loudspeaker, he'll try to mate with the loudspeaker.",

        "I guess it's - males are alike all over the world.",

        "Now, that is the anti-aphrodisiac.",
        "So females, when they're not about to lay their eggs, if a male approaches them singing, or if he tries to clasp them, they produce that song, which is called ticking.",
        "And it means get off my back.",
        "Literally.",
        "And it's incredibly effective.",
        "You'll hear what it does to the male song in a minute.",
        "But among other things, it's one of the things that persuades the male that he better let her go.",
        "Wow.",
        "So there's no rape in the frog world.",
        "It's a consensual, totally consensual reproductive system.",
        "And as you say, this is all done underwater.",
        "All underwater.",
        "So these animals, they started out, evolutionarily, on land, like most frogs.",
        "But at some point, they - I guess they perceived the advantages of being underwater, where they can't be seen, they can't be heard, and they can live out their reproductive sound lives in isolation and in relative safety.",
        "So there are all these species of these frogs all throughout sub-Saharan Africa, singing underwater.",
        "You can only hear them if you actually put a microphone into the water.",
        "But they do come up for air to breathe.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "They come up to the surface to breathe.",
        "They look kind of - they don't - they come up very - they actually have to come up too often, and the kind of look like little hippopotami.",
        "You can see their little eyes hanging out at the surface.",
        "All right, well, let's go to our next sound and see if we can decipher that one."

        "He gets incredibly excited and keeps on rapping.",

        "In addition to being get off my back, it also makes the male shut up.",
        "So they have very effective vocal communication.",
        "Females can turn males on, and they can also turn males off, at least in the acoustic arena.",
        "Wow.",
        "And so why do you study these things?",
        "What can you learn from these things?",
        "Well, you know, these are the animals, actually, that came to science initially because they were the first pregnancy tests for human cryonic anatatropin(ph).",
        "These animals are incredibly sensitive to sex hormone, and, you know, the hormones are very ancient, evolutionarily.",
        "They're just exactly the same in frogs and in humans."
