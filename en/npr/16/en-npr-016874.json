        "So that's how they came into that world.",
        "And in terms of neuroscience, which is what I do, because sounds are so important to these animals, it's much easier to study the parts of the brain that translate what's heard into what's uttered.",
        "So if you have an animal whose whole life is devoted to one extreme thing, it's there in an extreme way in their brain.",
        "So it's a lot easier to study.",
        "So, you know, we're interested in speech, what's going on in your brain when you listen to me and what's going on in mine when I listen to you, but it's really hard to study in human beings.",
        "It's a lot easier to study in these frogs, partly because they're so single-minded, and also because their brains are a lot smaller.",
        "Now, we keep hearing about frogs being - some frogs becoming vanishing species around the world.",
        "Is this one of them?",
        "No.",
        "I'm afraid this is the one that's going to be left when all the other frogs are gone.",
        "This frog is actually pretty immune to the chytrid fungus, which is one of the things that is contributing to the amphibian die-off.",
        "Of course, the other thing that's contributing to the die-off is changes globally in the climate.",
        "As long as there are standing bodies of water, we're going to have these guys around.",
        "So them I'm not worried about.",
        "I'm more worried about the other guys.",
        "Yeah, I understand that.",

        "I'm sorry to say that these frogs have been released, sometimes by pet store owners, sometimes by zoologists, in practically every country in the world.",
        "And, for example, the San Diego water system is chockablock with these frogs.",
        "You can find them in Chile.",
        "I mean, they're native to South Africa, the ones you're listening to now - to most of Africa, but there's pretty much - most of the continental parts of the United States have one or another of these frog species.",

        "So if you were a science teacher and you wanted to go, let's say, in San Diego, where the frogs are in one place, could you just stick your microphone under in a lake and listen to them?",
        "Well, you know, you'd have to be there - you know, courtship is tricky, right?",
        "You've got to be there at the right time.",
        "But you could certainly put traps in, as some of my colleagues have done.",
        "You put in one of these - they're called funnel traps.",
        "So you put some bones in, you put it in.",
        "You prop up the end so the frogs can come up to breathe, and low and behold, you go and pick it up in the morning, and it's full of frogs.",

        "Actually, I work with Rana pipiens, which is the leopard frogs, the temperate frog.",
        "And they've been able to show that the auditory system of these frogs actually becomes more acutely tuned and sensitive to mating calls during the mating season, and then the sensitivity drops off when they're not mating.",
        "And I'm actually interested in whether there's anything about - since they call nocturnally - whether there's anything about the circadian rhythm, whether they actually get more sensitive during certain times of the day versus other times.",
        "Well, that's an interesting question.",
        "People don't pay very much attention to that.",
        "When they're studying the auditory system, you know, they're generally in the lab, studying it during the daytime.",
        "Maybe we should tell our graduate students to focus on the night.",
        "But one of the interesting things about the frog and its seasonality is that, at least in Xenopus and also in Rana - I published a paper on this - the cells in the part of the brain that are responsive to sound in the auditory mid-brain contain receptors for sex hormone.",
        "So those receptors may, in fact, be contributing to the exquisite sensitivity that you see during the breeding season."

        "So you see how the sound sort of stimulates them in the brain.",

        "And there's actually a theory in human evolution that human speech actually came from the songs that males and females sang to each other in the caves at night to ward off boredom.",
        "So, you know, these - sound is very powerful, particularly in the dark, and probably many of the principles that we see in Rana pipiens and in Xenopus are common principles across many species that communicate with vocal signals.",

        "It's important to note, though, that with 16 parties running yesterday in the parliamentary elections, Kurz did not - or I should say his People's Party did not get the majority needed for them to govern alone, which means that he would have to partner with another winner from yesterday's election in order to actually govern.",
        "And who that partner is, Kurz isn't really saying at the moment.",

        "It's called the Freedom Party of Austria.",

        "I mean, that sounds significant because the Freedom Party has not been in the Austrian government in years.",

        "I mean, so why would this new leader want to partner with them at this moment?",
        "Well, for one thing the other faction that he could form a coalition with, which is a center-left Social Democratic Party, is the same party that his faction was in government with till recently.",

        "It was a year early.",
        "So it's not really plausible for him to join with them now.",

        "And that's the same platform the Freedom Party had.",
        "Although, of course, its message which was much more harsh and xenophobic and led many voters to go over to Kurz and his party.",
        "What's kind of clear from yesterday's vote is that with a majority of Austrians apparently embracing this anti-Islam, anti-refugee message, a partnership between Kurz's party and the Freedom Party might make sense.",
