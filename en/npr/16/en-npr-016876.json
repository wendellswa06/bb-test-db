        "Back in October, Chicago passed a law that requires hotels to provide workers with so-called panic buttons.",
        "These are meant to alert security if guests threaten or harass staffers.",
        "A survey there found nearly 60 percent of housekeepers and other staff have experienced this, and that caught the attention of Kristen Rosen Gonzalez.",
        "She is a commissioner in Miami Beach, Fla., and she recently had her own encounter with sexual misconduct, which, we should warn you, she describes using some explicit language in our conversation.",
        "And I started to think, wow, if that's the statistic in Chicago, I can't even begin to imagine what the statistic is in Miami Beach where we have this ambiance of, you know, partying and decadence and excess.",
        "I'm sure it's pretty high.",
        "So I met with our city attorneys, and we're beginning the process of crafting some type of legislation.",
        "And we've been looking at the Chicago ordinance, and what it will basically do is give all of the housekeepers across Miami Beach the same rights to a panic button.",
        "And that's one way that the hospitality worker can alert the staff that something is wrong.",
        "And would that be the hotel's responsibility?",
        "I understand you're just starting to get going with this proposed legislation, but...",
        "The hotels would have to provide this service.",
        "We don't know what the service would cost.",
        "We're expecting that once we begin the discussion, the hospitality association will probably come forward and give us some sort of projection as to what it would cost.",
        "But I've spoken informally to a few of our hotel owners on Miami Beach, and they said that they would be fine with installing this type of system.",
        "And there's a lot of egregious things that happen.",
        "You know, a man is staying in a hotel room, and he says I need some extra towels, and then when the housekeeper walks in, they expose themselves.",
        "And I know how horrible that can feel because it happened to me recently, and I felt ashamed, embarrassed, disgusted by the entire situation.",
        "I can't imagine this happening to me on a regular basis.",
        "You did go public about your own experience with sexual harassment - this wasn't that long ago - with someone who you considered to be a colleague, a peer.",

        "And when we went out for dinner one night, in the car afterward, he pulled out his penis and tried to get me to touch it.",
        "And it was horribly embarrassing.",
        "At the time, I just told him to put it away, and I kind of filed it in the back of my mind.",
        "But as we were getting closer to the elections, I mentioned to one of my campaign staffers - I said, you know, we're about to get a really bad guy elected.",
        "And she said, well, you have to tell the story.",
        "And at the time, the thought of going public with this story was horrifying (laughter).",
        "I thought the last thing that I would like to be associated with as a commissioner for Miami Beach - and I'm actually a congressional candidate - is another person's genitals.",
        "You mentioned that you're running for a congressional seat in next year's midterm elections that's long been held by Republicans.",

        "You know, I started to ask myself, `Well, is he just pro-choice about embryo research?",
        "What about abortion?",
        "He says he's pro-life, but listen to these quotes from when he ran for the Senate in 1994.",
        "He said, \"\"I'll work hard to keep the federal government out of that decision-making process.\"\" He said abortion was a very private decision.",
        "He said, \"\"I believe that abortion is an option that a woman should have,\"\" and then he said, \"\"I don't think those sorts of decisions need to be decided at the highest levels of federal government.\"\" I read that and I ask myself: `If this man is even trying to sound like a pro-lifer, is he really a pro-lifer in his heart?'",
        "All right.",
        "So the question is: How did he get that 100-percent pro-life voting record?",

        "So, Will, has Bill Frist made any statements, gave any indication at which point he believes the human embryo becomes a life, a life to protect?",
        "No, he hasn't done that, and that's really what he's going to have to do.",
        "I mean, you can't really go forward with the kind of career that Bill Frist envisions for himself and not make clear where you stand.",
        "You can't be emphatically pro-choice about embryos and have said what he said in the 1994 campaign that sounds awfully pro-choice and call yourself a pro-lifer and have a pro-life voting record on these other issues.",

        "But you know, until Frist gave this last speech very emphatically for embryonic stem cell research, he was supporting the president's policy, which was to restrict the research, restricting funding for the research.",
        "And everyone said at that point that Bill Frist was pandering to the right, because in a Republican presidential primary, it's the social conservatives who have the clout.",
        "Look, I think that was true.",

        "I think the political logic was in pandering to the right.",
        "I think for him to come out now and say that he supports the stem cell research means that he's going against the political logic and he must be doing what's in his heart.",
