        "Many of them will say that if this sort of effort had been applied back in 2002, 2003, the problems then were much smaller.",
        "They're aware of the fatigue among donor nations, especially those that have taken casualties here, but I don't hear much concern about other NATO countries.",

        "is going to, is going to stay.",
        "And can you give us any insight into how regular Afghan citizens might be viewing this debate now?",

        "First off, before they'll be able to plan and lead missions on their own - it'll be a few years, they say, before that will happen.",

        "strategy just before this meeting?",
        "Well, NATO officials said that that certainly wasn't helpful to them, and in some ways they see that President Karzai's still having it both ways.",
        "In private, his ministers and his aides can praise the military progress and say this is going great; in public he can go with the anti-American flow and he can condemn these night raids in Afghan homes and continue making peace overtures to the Taliban.",

        "Some people say yes, who you talk to, some delegates say yes and some say no. I think it depends on how passionate they are about Senator Obama as a figure who represents an equally important icon - this idea of the first black president.",
        "Some of the people who feel that way think that she didn't quite go far enough in stressing that her criticisms of him during the campaign were, say, unfounded.",

        "In fact, in an odd sense, as I talked to people, including people who were Native American delegates, I talked to a woman from the Pueblo Nation in New Mexico.",
        "It seems as if in some ways there was a divide more between white women and non-white women in the sense that all the women of color I spoke with, no matter what color that was, really identified with the racial issues as much as or more than gender, and the reverse was true for white women.",
        "Did you feel that those women of color resented being put on the spot - choose between your color and your gender?",
        "Some of them have, but more of the people I spoke with, including some people we brought onto our show a couple of days ago, really resented the idea that history could be erased.",
        "In the sense that black women had to go through a three-stage movement to get the right to vote.",
        "First you had literally the Emancipation Proclamation which said black people are citizens and human beings.",
        "Then you had the women's suffrage movement which meant that black women technically had the right to vote but then not until the civil rights movement really did most black women, think of Fannie Lou Hamer, have the right to shape American politics.",
        "So there has been a very different path to political empowerment for black women than there have been for most other women in America.",
