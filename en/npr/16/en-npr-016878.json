        "And she said to us that her mother essentially would have been put in the foster care system if it was a different time, and she talked about how her mother was essentially abandoned at the age of eight, then moved on to be a domestic servant at the age of 14.",
        "And how, although she - meaning Hillary Rodham Clinton, was comfortable, she could identify with this woman who lifted herself directly out of a path to lack of self-fulfillment.",
        "And so I think that she has some stories that perhaps she did not tell enough to a wider audience.",

        "They were mostly talking to each other.",

        "And ironically, the best example of this is suffrage.",
        "Ironic, since Hillary Clinton was speaking on the 88th anniversary of suffrage's certification, as she pointed out.",
        "And women's suffrage was supposed to be the big breakthrough.",
        "And yet, in the years to follow, it was pretty much of a collapse on every front.",

        "Very few women were able to get into higher office.",

        "That was how long her tenure in the Capitol lasted.",
        "And on many other fronts.",
        "Economically, in the professions, in the media, women were set back in the years to come.",

        "For Michelle Obama she, you know, she had an assignment, a task ahead of her, which was to present herself as not a quote, unquote, \"\"angry woman,\"\" because that's how the media had presented her.",
        "And she was - you know, her mission was to soften her image.",

        "Yes, hi.",

        "And I don't really consider that so much of a feminist, something that feminists should necessarily applaud.",
        "Susan Faludi, what do you think?",
        "Well, you know, I agree that she's hardly presented herself as a fire-breathing feminist, or the stereotype of the quote, unquote, \"\"rabid feminist,\"\" whatever that is.",
        "But I think she's also a work in progress and that over - certainly over the course of the campaign when she was hit with a, you know, an avalanche of misogyny from the media and from her own, you know, political compatriots who told her to, you know, stand down and shut up, basically - that she has moved much in the direction of being vocal about women's rights.",
        "And you know, it's - she has done work, a great deal of work, you know, starting with, in 1995, the conference on women in Beijing, where she gave a very moving speech calling for women's rights, economic development for women around the globe.",
        "And she's worked very hard behind the scenes for that.",
