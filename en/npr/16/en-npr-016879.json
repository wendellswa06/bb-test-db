        "Maybe, that's pie in the sky, but I do feel that way and I think that, you know, I think, to Susan's point when she said, you know, gosh, how unfortunate that we have these groundbreaking candidates.",

        "As far as - but you know, young woman are not surprisingly - some young woman, I know plenty of young woman who are very committed to feminist change, but are they the majority?",
        "Probably not, in a culture that rewards young woman for distancing themselves from feminism.",
        "Probably not, in a culture that tells woman to - has basically served up a kind of commercial form of woman's liberation, where you find yourself emancipated by advancing your self-esteem and feeling a sense of self empowerment by shopping or putting Botox in your face.",
        "You know, in a culture that talks, that is fixated on individualism and celebrity and being the object of adulation, it's a hard sell to say, why don't you embrace a feminism that is collective and more anonymous and is about bread and butter issues.",

        "And the focus of that and that seems really prevalent for me, for a lot of young women, is this sort of freedom, sexual freedom, and its sole focus on just really aggressively sexual experiences, and equating that with feminism.",

        "And recalling my own first time voting, I said, you know, my choice was Dukakis.",
        "And so, how exciting for them that they actually had two candidates that they were even excited about.",
        "But I did not see so much of a age gap, I definitely felt the way it played out in the media, there was a lot more excitement for Hillary Clinton coming from the old guard of feminism and there was a lot more excitement for Obama among younger people.",
        "But I saw an equal number of younger people excited by Hillary.",

        "We want to vote for Barack Obama because that would be good for blacks in America, or good for non-white people.",
        "And I think that we're reaching a point where recognizing that those candidates could just be good for America.",
        "And I did a voter registration drive back in 1992 and I went into it thinking that I was helping voters who were not previously registered.",
        "And I thought how good of me and noble of me to go into these underserved communities and help these voters get connected.",

        "And I think that's a little bit where we are with their candidacies right now, or with the kind of these races behind us and the midst of it is - oh, it could be good for all of us if there was somebody not male or not white who was president of the United States.",
        "Here's an e-mail we have from Jane in Portland, Oregon, I'd like to read.",
        "As a sixty-something white female, women's libber, my take on Hillary's candidacy is this, it wasn't overt or covert sexism of the media that did her in.",
        "She didn't fail to win a nomination because reporters, for example, called attention to her cleavage; it was the sexism that she grew up with that did her in.",
        "Like many of us, Hillary took a long time to figure out who she was, there's a long learning curve to this equality thing, as all depressed classes learn as they struggle on their way up.",
        "Hillary got better and better and more sure-footed as she campaigned.",
        "And last night, she showed everything that she had learned.",
        "She's an object lesson for our generation and especially for the next.",
        "I wonder, Susan Faludi, what you think of that?",
        "Well, I think it's very true.",

        "Was here is a woman who started out, you know, not an ideal public speaker.",
        "A bit uncomfortable, and to see her evolve was thrilling and I think a great sense of encouragement to not just women, but women in particular who, you know, who enter on to the public stage for trepidation and who get knocked down.",
        "And to see Hillary get knocked out time and again and get up and keep on fighting, as Harriet Tubman said, was very important for.",

        "And I have to say I'm 38 years old and that's really embarrassing to say this, but until about a year, a year and a half ago, when I watched a documentary on HBO about Billie Jean King, I honestly had no clue how hard women had it.",
        "I cried because here I have my mother-in-law and her partner who are total feminists and I was embarrassed that I went to college and I didn't realize, you know, what these women went through to get us where we're at.",
        "And I honestly had to thank them when I saw them again and admitted that, you know, as bad as it may be, I had no idea.",
        "And the horrible thing about is that it's almost going backwards, because I see in my nieces that they're so taking advantage of the freedoms that we have as women that they're actually focusing on more their sexuality and the attention that they're getting.",
        "And I think that we need to just put our efforts into teaching our daughters, our nieces, our neighbor girls, anybody that, you know, is around.",
        "Let them understand what we actually have went through to get to this point because, you know, as a 36-year-old woman, at the time when I saw this, I was just embarrassed and I understand it now.",
        "And I think they would, too.",
        "That's truly what we need to do, instead of, you know, taking our ball and going home, as the lady said before.",
        "We need to just refocus our efforts in educating and continuing that education.",

        "I wonder, Amy Richards, what you thought of what Candy had to say.",
        "Well, I think Candy - because we're at the same age, I think that some of our responsibility to feminism is acting on the rights that other generation fought so hard for.",
        "And I hope that the way future generations express their feminism is both in the form of a thank you to Hillary Clinton and Shirley Chisholm and Pat Schroeder.",
        "But also in the form of running for office, it's kind of doing what other generations could not do.",
        "And so, I don't fault people so much for not appreciating or respecting enough what came before, but I do fault them for not being able to act upon what's in front of them.",
        "How could you act upon it if you don't know it's there?",
        "I would love to have the opportunity even in high school to have had a women's study class.",
        "When I was in college, I didn't take any women's studies.",
        "I chose other classes, but I think if it was something that was taught as early as high school we may, you know, be in a position to shape our lives so that we can act on that at an earlier age."
