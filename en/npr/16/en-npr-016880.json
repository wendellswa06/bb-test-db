        "I just wanted to say that, you know, women's history is actually a remarkably recent phenomenon, of the last 30 years.",

        "Hi, my name is Nathan and I live in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho and go to school in New Hampshire where I got to vote in the primary.",
        "Maybe as a white male, I don't have the most informed point of view on this.",
        "But it seems to me that Senator Clinton has been a godsend for feminism, both by creating a new mold for first ladies, fighting for equal pay in the Senate and by making it easier for the next woman, maybe a Kay Bailey Hutchinson and Janet Napolitano to win.",
        "But I think if she won, she might have been a nightmare for her cause.",
        "Her supporters' fervor aside, the right wing has the - talk radio has succeeded in turning her into this polarizing figure despite her local popularity in New York and Arkansas, and I don't think she could have united us as president.",
        "Had she won, the first female president would have been remembered as a divisive figure and also one who had stopped the first black candidate.",
        "And I have to also wonder if the way she ran her campaign in the last two months and her husband's reluctance - apparent reluctance to embrace Obama's candidacy could potentially hurt her next bidder, even the bid of another woman in 2012 or beyond.",
        "I wonder, Susan Faludi, you want to start on that?",
        "Oh, I don't think another woman running - I mean first of all, any woman running, any woman who sticks her head out is, you know, going to get the same kind of flack.",
        "And there will be particular things about that woman that the right wing will focus on.",
        "I mean, we're talking about right-wing commentators, you know, like Rush Limbaugh, who even found something vicious to say about Elizabeth Edwards, so you know, you can't win with these people.",
        "But I think she has moved the ball forward, to use that charming male metaphor.",
        "Thank you.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "That she has cleared and she has absorbed - she's like one big shock absorber for all the women to come after her.",
        "And you know, I think what would really help would be some self-examination on the part of the media, not just the right-wing media, the mainstream media, that called her every name in the book, and we don't need to review it all here.",
        "But we all know it was pretty awful, and yet when invited to talk about the sexism in the media, there was a recent New York Times story about it, Katie Couric was the only one who was willing to acknowledge a deep well of misogyny that is still very much present in the media and American life in general.",
        "I guess I'd like to jump in here and say, while I think that's all true, Hillary Clinton did not run a good campaign.",
        "And Hillary Clinton had a record that could be challenged on, and if you take gender out of it, there were real reasons why Democrats would look at her and say she's not the candidate for me.",
        "So, I think while we talk about the media which with I totally agree with, I think there were just horrible statements - by the same token, you know, when Fox News puts up a chyron that says Baby Mama about Michele Obama, that didn't get nearly as much press."
