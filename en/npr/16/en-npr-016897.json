        "It's a period of time where most cardinals have a strong political orientation or indeed they're very much under pressure from one king or another.",
        "But you come to a point where pressure is put on popes to move back to Rome, some would say because of a number of reformers of the church who wanted the church to reconnect with its traditions with the pope in Rome and freer of political control by a monarch such as the king of France.",
        "How did then, if the popes have been in Avignon, how did we end up with a pope in Rome and an anti-pope in Avignon?",

        "What were the effects at this time of having this dual papacy: one pope in Rome and then the anti-pope in Avignon?",
        "I often say to my students when I teach a course on the papacy, if you think the church has trouble today, it was much, much worse in the past, and I think that's so in various times and places and for various reasons.",
        "This would certainly be one of them.",
        "There very much was a divided church between those loyal to one or another pope.",

        "There was an attempt to resolve the matter, which failed, and meant there was a third person.",
        "Instead of being the one to replace the other two, he simply becomes a third contender.",
        "So you have for a period of time, from 1409, three popes, so that didn't help matters at all.",
        "Well, ultimately, it was resolved.",
        "The schism was resolved."
