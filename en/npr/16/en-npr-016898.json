        "In the summer, the bears live outdoors at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, where Barnes works.",
        "And then we move them into a hibernaculum.",
        "Hibernaculum.",

        "We anticipated they might just tear the place up or go on strike or something.",
        "But they actually showed very natural behavior of getting ready to hibernate.",
        "As you can see on our website, when they start to hibernate, they curl up.",
        "They go to sleep.",
        "They begin to quiet their heart rate, slow their breathing, and their metabolic rate plunges.",
        "Barnes says the study he and his colleagues are publishing today in the journal Science marks the first time bears have been monitored throughout the winter.",
        "So what happens when hibernation starts?",
        "The bear will cool off just by a few degrees.",
        "From a normal temperature of about 99 degrees down to about 90 degrees.",
        "And yet its metabolic rate decreased by 75 percent."

        "It's a combination of very good insulation accompanied by bouts of shivering when the bear's internal temperature drops much below 90.",
        "Barnes says just about everything a bear does while hibernating is remarkable.",
        "Bears don't eat, drink, urinate or defecate for six or seven months.",
        "They make their own water, probably by metabolizing fat, and they get rid of wastes by breaking them down internally.",
        "They're a closed system.",

        "And they can do just fine.",

        "But Seth Donahue says his research shows that doesn't happen with bears.",
        "Donahue is at the Michigan Technical University.",
        "Basically we found out there were no negative consequences of six months of hibernation on the bone strength or mineral content.",
        "And it's not just the bones in bears that stays strong throughout the winter.",
        "They have this neat capacity to conserve their muscle mass, as well as muscle strength.",
        "Craig Heller from Stanford University is an author on the new bear paper.",
        "He says for people bedridden for long periods or people who are contemplating a long space voyage, such as going to Mars and back, figuring out how to make a human more like a hibernating bear would some advantages.",
        "One would be lowering the energy requirement so you don't need as much food and water and resources, but another is just reducing the boredom."

        "You know, I'm not convinced that that's the case.",
        "I'm sure there are players that were banged up, and you're banged up no matter how long the NBA season or how compressed it is.",
        "But to sort of pin the long season for Derek Rose of the Chicago Bulls, for instance, his blown-out ACL in the first round of the playoffs, I don't think is fair.",
        "What we're seeing now, though, is some pretty good basketball.",
        "I think a lot of people were worried that the season would require an asterisk, or as Bill Simmons of ESPN wrote, a footnote at least.",
