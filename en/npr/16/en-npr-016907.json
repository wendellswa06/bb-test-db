        "That apparently is not true.",
        "Theyve been going right to the oiled parts.",
        "That's correct.",
        "When we were down there doing the survey, we saw a lot of birds in the areas that oil had come ashore and fewer birds west of that where there hadn't been oil, or very little come ashore.",
        "And partly the reason was that's the best bird habitat.",
        "It was a very diverse habitat with lots of marsh system, beaches, barrier islands, shallow estuaries.",
        "And it just is good feeding habitat so they're attracted to that.",
        "And as you're going around now, six months out, are you still seeing visibly oiled birds?",
        "Well, I probably was able to look really carefully at 2,000 to 2,500 individual birds, and I only saw three individuals that had oil on.",
        "So that was good.",
        "That was a very low number and I was pleased that that was how few we saw.",
        "So may be not as bad there, as you feared.",
        "But I guess the fear now is what you can't see.",
        "Exactly.",
        "I think at this stage of the game, it's what the oil might be doing and the dispersants that was used to the food chains; are there decreases abundance of food out there in the system; has it affected the behaviors and the reproductive ability of food things, like menhaden, which is one of the fish, or crustaceans or bivalves, all that are important food items for birds.",
