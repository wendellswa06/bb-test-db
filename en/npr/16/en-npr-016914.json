        "In court, state attorneys defended the evidence originally used to validate Ernesto Lira as a gang member: an informant's statement, an incident on a prison yard in which Lira allegedly spoke sharply to another inmate, and a drawing found in his locker that allegedly contained tiny gang symbols.",
        "State experts also claimed Lira's peaceful demeanor and record of good conduct in prison were further evidence of deception inspired by the gang.",
        "That's not unheard of, according to Joe McGrath.",
        "He's the former warden at Pelican Bay.",
        "I know plenty of guys who are very involved in prison gangs, and they're respectful to staff, they don't get into any trouble, they don't get behavior reports, and again, they're quietly running their gang activities through clandestine communications.",
        "The state conceded there was no evidence that Lira actually did anything tangible for the gang prior to being locked down.",
        "Still, officials repeatedly defended the system that held Lira in solitary as fair and necessary.",
        "But that view is contradicted by an internal study that's been circulating in the California Department of Corrections for more than a year.",
        "The report concluded that California's prison gang policy should be overhauled and the Security Housing Units, or SHUs, reformed.",
        "The policy proposals were drawn up by a team of national experts led by Brian Parry.",
        "He's a former deputy director in the California Department of Corrections.",
        "We have to make the system as fair as we possibly can.",
        "My whole goal through that policy was not just to reduce the exposure to litigation, but was to reduce violence.",
        "Put the right people in SHU.",
        "Parry spent more than 30 years working in the California prison system.",
        "He now says he's uncomfortable with the kind of indirect evidence used against prisoners like Lira, such as drawings, and he says as many as 70 percent of the inmates in the SHUs were sent there through evidence of this kind.",
        "Parry declined to comment directly on the Lira case, but he says…",
        "Anybody that's falsely identified and ends up in the SHU for a lengthy period of time, you know, that's wrong.",
        "Parry says he wants to bring California in line with national standards by targeting the most disruptive inmates, whether or not they're prison gang members.",
        "The state could still isolate inmates but only if they're involved in criminal activity or misconduct and only for fixed terms."
