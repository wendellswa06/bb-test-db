        "Since then sources close to the transition tell us there have been more substantive talks between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.",
        "And now there are reports that she has made the decision that this is a job she wants.",
        "You know, at the same time, there were a lot of reservations on the other side from the Obama team about Hillary Clinton's husband, the former president Bill Clinton, and his connections in the business world through his foundation.",
        "What happened to those concerns?",
        "That's right.",

        "We are opposed to guest worker programs because they are a blueprint for exploitation of workers, but that's not the entire policy.",
        "Our executive council adopted a historic resolution in the year 2000, embracing immigrant workers as part of our movement and right now we're advocating there strongly for full legalization for all twelve million undocumented workers.",

        "Right.",
        "There's never been a single guest worker program that worked to the benefit the workers.",
        "Under guest worker programs, by definition, workers come to this country tied to an employer.",
        "An employer not only controls the working conditions for that worker, but also controls the immigration status for that worker.",
        "It is our position that is not good public policy to simply expand that program to include hundreds of thousands of workers who are going to be tied to their employer and, you know, ripe for exploitation.",

        "She says there has traditionally been tension over this issue within the labor movement.",
        "There was always a strain in the labor movement of hostility to immigrants, the view being that immigrant workers undercut the hard-won labor standards of native born American workers.",
        "And then there's always been a second view, this is true for the whole time there's been a labor movement, nearly a century now in this country, that the right approach to this problem was to organize the immigrants and raise their labor standards to the level of others.",
        "And these same kind of debates have actually taken place about other groups of workers.",
        "Women, historically, were treated in just that same ambivalent way.",

        "There's no one conversation that's going to resolve everything, but it's a matter of meeting it where you live, and that's in your emotional house.",

        "It actually turned out that there was tremendous organizing potential in this population and the unions that began to exploit that actually were very successful.",
        "So as these immigrants started to get involved in unions, how did that change what was going on in the unions themselves?",
        "It began to occur to people that maybe the historical approach of the AFL-CIO needed to be re-thought.",
        "And so in February of 2000, the AFL-CIO announced that new position and that was a big deal at the time.",
        "But there's one other important development that occurred between that 2000 policy change and the present, of course, which is a year ago, when a group of unions left the AFL-CIO, led by the SCIU and included some of the other unions that have been very active in the immigrant organizing who are now part of a group called the Change to Win Federation.",
        "And that changed the dynamic a little bit because those unions were the leaders both in winning that policy change and in doing the immigrant organizing in the 1990s.",
        "So in a way that impulse is now concentrated and Change to Win and the AFL-CIO is left with the industrial unions on the one side, which have relatively few immigrant members, though they have some, and the public sector unions, which have hardly any immigrant members.",

        "And it - our emotional preparation tends to be a very haphazard thing.",
