        "If the court upholds the practice of partisan gerrymandering you described, which allows a ruling party to dominate out of proportion to its vote share in a state, then voters shouldn't expect to see any changes at all just more of the same partisan map-making that protects incumbents and preserves the existing power arrangements in each state.",
        "But if the court decides to end its longstanding tolerance for this sort of thing, put limits on it, voters in Maryland might well see another seat or two suddenly become competitive for Republicans.",
        "And voters in North Carolina might see as many as half the seats become competitive for Democrats.",
        "And voters in other states might see the next round of redistricting after 2020 conducted on a more even-handed basis.",

        "And it indicates that the citizenship question did not have its origin in a request from the Justice Department as we were told, that it was not about enforcing voting rights laws as we were told.",
        "But that question was added by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.",
        "And it was added as part of a strategy to restrict the count of Hispanics in 2020 and other immigrants as well and restrain the influence of Hispanics in American politics in general.",
