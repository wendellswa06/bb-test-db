        "Although CITGO declined to comment for this story, the company has denied there was any negligence on its part.",
        "Covered in bandages, Herrera has traveled to Austin to testify before the legislature from his wheelchair.",
        "His case has become a bloody flag for those who believe that tort reform has gone too far in Texas because, after the controversial Texas Supreme Court ruling, there is a good chance that a jury will never be allowed to hear the facts of Mr. Herrera's case.",

        "Workers' compensation insurance will pay him about $37,000 a year for two years, then no more after that.",
        "But in a negligence lawsuit, he might recover his full wages over the course of his lifetime.",
        "If a jury were to decide the refinery was guilty of gross negligence, Herrera could receive punitive damages on top of the salary and medical reimbursement.",
        "But in Texas, the trend over the last decade has been to pass laws that stop pleas for relief before those lawsuits ever get to a jury.",
        "My level of confidence that the supreme court of Texas is going to do anything to help workers is very low.",
        "Buchanan's skepticism arises from a Texas Supreme Court ruling entitled Entergy versus Summers, a case involving a different refinery and contract worker injured on the job.",
        "The ruling essentially changed the refinery owner's legal responsibilities by reclassifying the owners as contractors.",
        "For the last 20 years, petrochemical companies have outsourced much of their maintenance work to independent contractors.",
        "For the refinery owners, it was a tradeoff.",
        "Contract labor was cheaper, but if those workers were killed or maimed as a result of refinery negligence, then Texas law allowed them to sue for damages.",
        "The nine Republican Supreme Court justices changed that.",
        "The court ruled that the state legislature had actually changed Texas law nearly two decades before.",
        "Legislators on both sides of the aisle say the court is simply wrong on this point.",
        "Jeff Wentworth is a Republican state senator from San Antonio.",
        "The court, most everyone of whom has run on a basis of being a strict constructionist and not legislating from the bench, in my judgment, in that case, did exactly that.",
        "They legislated from the bench without any reference or deference to the legislative branch of Texas state government.",
        "He got the refund, and made his way out of the store, and apparently there were still several items in his cart that were unaccounted for, unpaid for and neither did he receive a refund for them, and he went out into the parking lot and an employee confronted him and called police.",

        "Where will we see his imprint in the Bush Administration in terms of policy?",
        "Well, you know the way the Bush White House tends to work you probably won't see that much of an imprint from Mr. Allen, because I think the power in the White House is concentrated in a few hands.",
        "It's the Roves of the world and things like that.",
