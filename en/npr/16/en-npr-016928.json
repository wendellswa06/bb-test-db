        "Let's turn now to Mike LaForgia, himself an amputee, who joins us now from his office in Garden City, New York.",

        "Hi, Neal.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "Based on your experience, I wonder what advice you might offer to the Boston folks who are just beginning to come to terms with their injuries.",
        "Sure, yeah.",
        "And by way of intro, or my circumstances, I contracted - the way I became an amputee is I contracted bacterial meningitis, which is a disease that - it impacts about 3,500 people a year in the United States, and it's a very deadly disease.",
        "And what - for those that do survive, because of the way it affects you, and it's such a vicious infection, your body goes into septic shock.",
        "And if you're not familiar with septic shock, septic shock has an effect in which the body shoots out blood clots to shut off blood flow to the extremities in an attempt to save your life.",
        "And that process ends up causing a frostbite-type effect and results often in amputation.",
        "So although I wasn't expected to survive the night when I first became ill with bacterial meningitis, I did, and I did survive, you know, a 10-day coma and a couple of months in the hospital.",
        "That's the good news.",
        "I did, however, end up with amputations.",
        "Good morning, Steve.",
        "Speaking of which, I'm sure you're going to leave us in an enlightened state by the time you're done today, talking about your book.",
        "The title of your book, give us a thumbnail sketch of how you get something from nothing.",
        "Well, the title of the book, \"\"A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather than Nothing\"\" deals with this question.",
        "It's been around for as long as people have really started to ask questions about the universe and is really at the heart of a lot of the world's religions.",
        "Why is there something rather than nothing?",
        "If we live in a universe full of stuff, how did it get here?",
        "And many people think that very question implies the need for a creator.",
        "But what's truly been amazing, and what the book's about is the revolutionary developments in both cosmology and particle physics over the past 30 or 40 years that have not only changed completely the way we think about the universe but made it clear that there's a plausible case for understanding precisely how a universe full of stuff, like the universe we live in, could result literally from nothing by natural processes."

        "And while it's a little pretentious, I'll be pretentious anyway, the idea, I think, is similar, if you think about it, to the origin of life, Darwin's demonstration that life, which appears to be designed here on Earth, the diversity of life can actually arise, that diversity can arise by natural causes.",
        "And we don't yet know the true origin of life, but we think we'll understand it by chemistry, and what we're discovering is that in fact physics has suggested that maybe the same is true for the whole universe, that we don't need a creator.",
        "And I guess most importantly that the question why is there something rather than nothing is really a scientific question, not a religious or philosophical question, because both nothing and something are scientific concepts, and our discoveries over the past 30 years have completely changed what we mean by nothing.",
        "In particular, nothing is unstable.",
        "Nothing can create something all the time due to the laws of quantum mechanics, and it's - it's fascinatingly interesting.",
        "And what I wanted to do was use the hook of this question, which I think as I say has provoked religious people, as well as scientists, to encourage people to try and understand the amazing universe that we actually live in.",

        "How did the idea - how did - you said that the physics has changed, what we know about the universe has changed so much, dramatically over the last few years, especially the idea that what we think of empty space is really not empty, correct?",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "Empty space is a boiling, bubbling brew of virtual particles that pop in and out of existence in a time scale so short that you can't even measure them.",
        "Now, that sounds of course like counting angels on the head of a pin; if you can't measure them, then it doesn't sound like it's science, but in fact you can't measure them directly.",
        "But we can measure their effects indirectly.",
        "These particles that are popping in and out of existence actually affect the properties of atoms and nuclei and actually are responsible for most of the mass inside your body.",
        "And in fact, really one of the things that motivated this book was the most profound discovery in recent times, and you even alluded to it in the last segment, the discovery that most of the energy of the universe actually resides in empty space.",
        "You take space, get rid of all the particles, all the radiation, and it actually carries energy, and that notion that in fact empty space - once you allow gravity into the game, what seems impossible is possible.",
        "It sounds like it would violate the conservation of energy for you to start with nothing and end up with lots of stuff, but the great thing about gravity is it's a little trickier.",
        "Gravity allows positive energy and negative energy, and out of nothing you can create positive energy particles, and as long as a gravitational attraction produces enough negative energy, the sum of their energy can be zero.",
        "And in fact when we look out at the universe and try and measure its total energy, we come up with zero.",
        "I like to think of it as the difference between, say, a savvy stockbroker and an embezzler.",
        "The savvy stockbroker will buy stocks on margin with more money than they have, and as long as they get that money back in there before anyone notices, and in fact if the stocks go up, they end with money where they didn't have any before, whereas the embezzler, of course, is discovered.",
        "Well, the universe is a savvy stockbroker.",
        "It can borrow energy, and if there's no gravity, it gets rid of it back before anyone notices.",
        "But if gravity is there, it can actually create stuff where there was none before.",
        "And you can actually create enough stuff to account for everything we see in the universe.",
        "But, you know, it's more than that because some people would say, and I've had this discussion with theologians and others, well, you know, just empty space isn't nothing.",
        "You know, there's space.",
        "How did the space get there?",
        "But the amazing thing is, once you apply in fact quantum mechanics to gravity, as you were beginning to allude again in the last segment, then it's possible, in fact it's implied, that space itself can be created where there was nothing before, that literally whole universes can pop out of nothing by the laws of quantum mechanics.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Yeah, I just had a comment.",
        "I thought maybe it would be a better idea to call it God's glue rather than dark matter, just to comment.",

        "Is that correct, still expanding?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "In fact, the discovery of this dark energy has told us that the future will be quite different than we thought, and that's one of the things I talk about in the book.",
        "Because of this dark energy, this energy of empty space, which is gravitationally repulsive, it's causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate, to speed up.",
        "In fact, the discovery of that was awarded this year's Nobel Prize.",
        "But if you think about what that implies for the future, distant galaxies are moving away from us faster and faster, and eventually they indeed will all be moving away from us faster than the speed of light, which is allowed in general relativity, and we won't see them.",
        "And the universe, in the far future, will be cold and dark and empty.",
        "So in fact as my late friend Christopher Hitchens, who was writing the forward for the book before he passed away, used to say: Nothing is heading towards us as fast as it can.",

        "And the answer is it doesn't need to expand into anything.",

        "But if the two-dimensional surface of the balloon was all there was, as it expanded, the balloon would get bigger, and every dot on that balloon, if you painted dots on that balloon, would move away from every other dot, but it wouldn't be expanding into anything, it would just be getting bigger.",
        "So our universe, in fact, doesn't need to expand into anything.",
        "Space can expand on its own, whether the universe is finite or infinite, without boundary and without expanding into anything.",

        "I know there's differences, but is this kind of ether revisited now?",
        "Well, that's a good question.",
        "In a kind of philosophical sense, yes.",
        "Both the Higgs field and this dark energy that's permeating everything are indeed permeating empty space.",
        "And in that sense empty space is - has properties that you would not otherwise imagine, just like we - they used to imagine as an ether.",
        "Of course, a difference was the ether was thought to be necessary to propagate light, and it was also thought to create a special frame of reference, and neither of these things do that.",
        "So neither of these things are of ether.",
        "But in a philosophical sense they hearken back to the idea that empty space is full of something.",
