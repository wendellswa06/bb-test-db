        "And what is it that we don't understand about it, those of us who are not in your situation?",
        "Well, all the things that the previous folks have mentioned about fit and the ongoing pain and discomfort, but as a woman, and the appearance being very important to me, I think it's really important that if any of these are women, that they need to really advocate for something that they can live with so that they're not relegated to have to walk around in long pants and long skirts and that sort of thing for the rest of their lives.",
        "And also, another point I wanted to bring up is the problem of insurance, that unfortunately, a lot of the insurance that Americans have does not fully cover prosthetics, and some, it's not covered at all.",
        "And so this may become an issue because one prosthetic limb is, we're talking $10,000 and up.",

        "So perhaps - we don't know how that's going to be divvied up, but perhaps there will be some help for these people with their prosthetics.",
        "But obviously, that does not - that only covers the people there in Boston from this particular incident, and not the many people around the country who have to live with this, like you, Maryann.",

        "So, you know, innovation has been great, but I think the expectations of what you can do is even greater.",
