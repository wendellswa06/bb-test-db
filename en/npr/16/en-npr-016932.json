        "So I can tell you the - I provide the service to new amputees, and I can't tell you the effect I can have on a new patient walking into the hospital room and to see someone who's an amputee walking with ease, you know, into the room sort of changes your whole outlook as a new patient.",
        "So definitely recommend the Amputee Coalition of America.",

        "How soon after surgery can prosthetics be fitted, and how do you make sure that they're fitted properly?",
        "Well, the time of fitting varies greatly on what the cause of amputation was.",
        "So we're not going to begin prosthetic fittings until the skin is well healed, the wounds are closed and generally until the level of pain is under control to where pressure and manipulation of that limb can be tolerated.",
        "So that can be anywhere from several weeks to, you know, maybe three or four or five weeks, even, depending on what the healing processes are.",
        "If you have an elective amputation and it's - everything is well controlled and the skin is in good condition, it's going to go much faster than that.",
        "If you have a trauma, especially a blast type of injury like the tragedy last week, that's going to be a good bit longer because there may be a lot of surgeries that are going to have to happen in the meantime before that limb is really even fitable, especially if the blast contained contaminants and things that can cause infection over the long term of the limb.",
        "So it can really be anywhere from a few weeks to really several months, depending on the healing capacity of their limbs."
