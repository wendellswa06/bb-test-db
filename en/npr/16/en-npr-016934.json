        "Well, he's a sort of an all-purpose guy that people seem to want around for whatever the situation.",
        "Michael Cohen, to the degree anybody knew who he was before Donald Trump was elected, it was primarily for his very awkward appearances on cable television.",
        "Since then, his name has popped up as the lawyer who made the spectacularly unsuccessful effort to silence a porn star who claims to - that she had an affair with Donald Trump.",
        "Stormy Daniels is definitely not keeping quiet.",
        "That's right.",
        "And - but what we have discovered this week is how many different businesses and how many different industries suddenly decided that Michael Cohen, a lawyer who has a taxi business on the side, was just - had invaluable advice for them.",
        "Novartis, the big drug company, said that they needed his advice on health care policy.",
        "AT&T hired him even though he does not have any telecom expertise that we know of.",

        "The fact...",
        "And he's not an accountant.",
        "None of these things.",
        "The fact is that what he has to offer and what he was selling himself to these companies as is somebody who understands Donald Trump.",
        "And the question is whether he was also selling access to Donald Trump or people around him.",
        "Erick, let me bring you in here.",
        "If he was - and we'll keep it as an if.",
        "But if someone were to be peddling access in exchange for money, that would hardly be a new phenomenon that came to Washington with the Trump administration.",
        "Right.",

        "And what's so interesting here is that he didn't actually move to Washington and yet did this.",

        "Senate and congressional staffers, particularly for leadership - they go off into the private sector as lobbyists and claim they can get access back.",
        "There are actually rules in place to keep former members of Congress from lobbying on certain issues for a number of time using their influence.",
        "This is what Washington has.",
        "What makes this so interesting is twofold in my mind.",
        "One, this is a president who claimed he was going to drain the swamp, And this is the swamp.",
        "But two, it doesn't appear that Cohen really actually was able to exercise any influence.",
        "And as a side note to that, a lot of these companies - no one expected Donald Trump to win.",
        "I don't even think Donald Trump expected to win.",
        "And so these companies were caught flat-footed with no connections to the president who famously was refusing to hire any Republican at all who had criticized him.",
        "So they needed someone.",
        "And here comes Michael Cohen pledging to be able to give them access.",
