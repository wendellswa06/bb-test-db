        "I was getting on the Washington Metro System that day and I was just thinking I had had two bags with me and I could simply walk on the subway with those bags, and I realized how easy it would be to do the same kind of thing in Washington or New York or anywhere else that was done in London; yet at the same time trying to make our subway stops and bus stops like airports certainly isn't practical.",
        "But that's the kind of thing.",
        "I mean, my point is to make you feel really secure, you would have to do things that simply are not workable.",
        "Isn't that part of the catch-22 that Washington finds itself in, to a great degree, the longer we go without another issue problem, terror scare here in the United States, the more comfortable people are going to become to some degree--it's human nature?",
        "The other end of that is they don't want to see those kinds of lines that people complain about at airports with subway systems and bus systems and the like and isn't that the catch-22?",
        "Well, you know, I'm not so sure that after the bombings in London that people are feeling really more secure.",
        "I mean, even though it did not happen in the United States, I think people do understand that if it could happen in London, which after all has had to deal with terrorism far longer than the United States, much before 9/11 because of the situation in Northern Ireland for so many years, if it could happen there where they presumably have had some, you know, experience in training in anti-terrorism measures, I think people do understand it can happen here as well.",
        "All right.",
        "Let me turn our attention to Massachusetts and an interesting case that's coming up.",
        "A man was arrested during a New Year's Eve party at a private home.",
        "He's filed a lawsuit arguing that he has a constitutional right to be drunk on private property as long as he didn't cause a public disturbance.",
        "And what happened, obviously, is during a party that got a little loud, police came to calm it down, saw that he was drunk and they took him into what's called protective custody and locked him up for nine hours until the effects of the alcohol wore off.",
        "He's saying, `Look, I wasn't going to drive.",
        "I wasn't in the public square.",
        "I wasn't bothering anybody.",
        "I should be allowed to be drunk in private.'",
        "OK.",
        "But the second part is--all right.",
        "I'm not through.",
        "The second part of it, though, is he picked up a camera and started videotaping them.",
        "That's when they really got upset with him.",
        "That led to these charges.",
        "It wasn't just a matter of him being drunk, but his point was, like, `If I'm at a private party, I can get drunk.",
        "I didn't plan to drive.",
        "I was going to spend the night here.",
        "Why are you arresting me?",

        "Well, first of all, I think...",
        "Yeah, and there's no law against videotaping somebody.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But, see, George, I think you know a lot of the details of that incident are alleged, and you know how it is when you get into a he said-she said, especially with the cops.",
        "We've all been at parties where the cops have shown up and you know things can get out of control and it's hard to know who's to blame.",

        "He alleges that he was planning on staying overnight, but this was not his home.",

        "That could be the case.",
        "I'm not sure that the friend was standing there with the cops when the argument was going on backing him up.",
        "And if that wasn't the case, the cops have to make a decision on the spot when they've got a conflict here, when they've got somebody who's potentially drunk.",
        "So, you know, I think you've got to remember the cops are in a position legally where they have to protect the public and they have to sometimes protect people from themselves.",

        "But if as ...(unintelligible) I agree with you on that, but if he's at a friend's house and plans to spend the night, what business is it of the cops?",
        "I agree with you.",
        "Ed, you know, I think there are competing interests here between sometimes you have to protect someone from themselves if somebody can get drunk to the point where they are actually a danger to themselves and not just the public, but here you don't necessarily have that evidence.",
        "You have somebody in a private home where they at least say they were going to stay there and there's apparently no evidence to the contrary that they were not going to stay there, they were not driving, and so I think you do have a situation where it comes down to a question of someone's right to kind of entertain themselves perhaps in an inappropriate manner but a manner that's not illegal and yet the police taking action.",

        "All right.",

        "He, of course, was, many say, the reason that Terry was inspired, the muse if you will, to how Stella got her groove back.",
        "And the question here is not so much the McMillan squabble with her soon-to-be ex-husband, her estranged husband, but the idea of whether or not it's an interesting comment on our society that people now tend to go to the media, whether they be celebrity and with the advent of reality television or not, air their dirty laundry in public.",
