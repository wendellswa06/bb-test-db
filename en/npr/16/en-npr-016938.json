        "should be seen as a threat to African-Americans and perhaps to jobs of African-Americans.",
        "And Joe Biden basically said that's the kind of division that the whites have always tried to stick into the debate, and that it's really not a zero-sum game.",
        "So you heard he spoke very, very strongly about that after some of the candidates had not been so forceful."

        "Yeah, a lot of the buzz after this debate was how Clinton sort of seemed more conservative than the other candidates onstage.",
        "And I think this is the issue that the people were really looking at.",
        "This issue of retroactivity - whether if the sentencing guidelines, you know, do change in sentencing for crack cocaine - are made about the same as for powder cocaine conviction; should these people who are in this long prison sentences for selling crack cocaine be let out of prison early.",
        "And Hillary Clinton was alone on the stage, saying that she does not think so.",
        "And you get the sense that she is preparing for a possible run as the nominee.",

        "This is an issue where they could do that.",
