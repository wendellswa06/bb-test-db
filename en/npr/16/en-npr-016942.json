        "Thank you.",
        "I have a question about malicious content and how Bit.ly or if Bit.ly takes any sort of active steps to protect its users from any kind of malicious content on the Web when, you know, you shorten those URLs, and you cannot see the domain name and things like that anymore.",
        "You know, what kind of steps Bit.ly is taking to protect its users from that kind of thing?",
        "All right.",
        "Dave, thanks for calling.",
        "That's actually a great question.",
        "We spend a lot of time and energy on making sure that all Bit.ly links are safe to click through.",
        "We work pretty closely with several partners where we get the standard blacklists of known malicious content on the Internet.",
        "What's interesting about our data is that it's too fresh, like it's coming in as it's created.",
        "So we have this window of time where we actually have links that could be malicious where these other services haven't blocked them yet.",
        "So we've developed our own in-house technology that can find the malicious link, figure out what makes that statistically interesting.",
        "And then, as links are shortened, they go on a queue where they're all checked for malicious content.",
        "And if you attempt to click through a malicious content on Bit.ly, you'll get a page that says stop - this could be really bad.",
        "And that seems to do a very good job of convincing people not to go there.",
        "Interesting.",
        "Now, let's say that one of the link-shortening companies goes belly up.",
        "I'm not saying Bit.ly or whatever.",
        "What happens to all those links that you've created?",
        "That's a great question.",
        "So we have created a redundant system such that if anything happened to our servers, we can point at that redundant flat file system and all of those links will still work.",
        "We're also working in collaboration with the Internet archive on a project called 301Works - and it's 301Works.org - where we're backing this data up, because we really do not want to break the Internet.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "You hate it when that happens.",
        "Do you see the Internet morphing into anything newer?",
        "I mean, do you see, as a coder or some other - something where you'd like to see it go or any kind of - sort of like the blank check to someone like, say, if you could do anything, you had all the money to do something, what would you do with it?"

        "Well, I think, as I said, this is the most exciting time for working with this kind of technology and data, and I think we're going to a place where we have our computers with us all the time.",
        "The computer is acting as an agent on our behalf.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And if you think about all the tasks that we take - that we take part in every day, a lot of them are cognitive drudgery.",
        "They're solving the same problems we've already solved, or they're solving trivial problems.",
        "Even like arranging where to meet a friend for dinner can take 15 minutes of conversation, and that's 15 minutes you're not actually talking to your friend.",
        "So I'd like to see us get to a place where this can be solved automatically, so we can go on being human.",
        "So this sort of an automated process where you say where are we going -I want to know where we're going to dinner and something takes over and rounds you all up and then says here's the spot you all agreed to?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Rather than taking over, something can make a recommendation that you as a human can approve or not approve.",
        "I think that we will see technology in many different forms.",
        "And if you look at - like what Microsoft accomplished with the connect interface, we'll see that in mobile in the next few years, where you just sort of have to vaguely gesture at something and it understands what you want.",
        "And you're excited about working (unintelligible).",
        "I'm incredibly excited about it."
