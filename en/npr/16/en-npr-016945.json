        "Last month I visited this majestic estate atop a mountain near Charlottesville, Virginia for the first time.",
        "The house is a testament to the architectural genius of America's third president, but that's not all there is.",
        "When I wandered down a small hill on one side of the mansion, I found another testament to Jefferson's genius - a lush green and long rectangle filled with perfectly straight rows of countless plants.",
        "This was the main vegetable garden.",
        "He started it at 690-something feet long and it's about 40 feet wide.",
        "And he divided it into 24 rectangular plots.",
        "And Jefferson's one of these people where everything had to be amazingly precisely measured and squared off and so on.",
        "And there were plans from the years right through towards his death of where everything should be planted in the rows in the plot.",
        "Keith Thomson is the author of a book called \"\"A Passion for Nature: Thomas Jefferson and Natural History.\"\" I met him on the day of my visit to talk about the garden that illustrates the third president's passion.",
        "We sat in a small brick pavilion in the middle of the garden and looked across the rows.",
        "Well, basically divided in his day between what he called the fruits, which was things like peas, peppers and so on, and the root vegetables and then the leafy vegetables.",
        "But the distinction was never quite that precise, but it is, I think, it's one of the most extraordinary gardens that exists anywhere.",
        "And on the other side of the garden we're looking out toward the wonderful - the valley.",
        "We're on the top of 1,000-foot mountain, Monticello, little mountain.",
        "He used to come here and read and survey everything.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And I must admit, I can't imagine anything better than having a pavilion in one's garden where you can look from the top of a mountain to survey a lot of stuff you actually owned.",
        "Thomas Jefferson, this garden, I mean, this was designed to feed the people who lived and worked here.",
        "Indeed, yes, and it was a large number of people.",
        "He had his two daughters and tons of grandchildren.",
        "And when he stopped being president, every day there were hangers-on coming by and people would arrive from Europe and come to visit unannounced."

        "And in an age before the word was a term of art, Thomas Jefferson was a scientist.",
        "He loved to tinker, to create and to experiment.",
        "Everything he grew in this garden was a result of an experiment.",
        "If he didn't like a variety, he would just throw it out.",
        "I suppose one way to answer the question is to say what were some of the failures.",
        "Yeah.",
        "He was very enthusiastic about the sugar maple as a way of getting sugar without having to import it from the West Indies.",
        "So he tried sugar maples here, but the climate is not quite right.",
        "They tried grapes, and for some reason or other, which is odd because Virginia now is a major wine-growing part of the eastern United States, they could not establish a really good vinery.",
        "When did he have time to garden?",
        "Well, this is extraordinary.",
        "When did Jefferson have time?",
        "Well, he was always doing five things extremely well.",
        "When did he have time to do them?",
        "I think the fact is that he didn't garden so much as tell people what to grow and they tended it.",
        "Most of the work was done by slaves.",
        "They planted the leafy greens and root vegetables, as well as the fruits and herbs, in precise rows side-by-side along the length of the garden terrace.",

        "There are a lot of people under that Senate bill who would end up paying higher taxes rather than low taxes, right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "And the thinking with putting an expiration date on the individual taxes was that that was a way to keep the deficit increase in line but also a political calculation that whoever's in charge 10 years from now would not be too excited about raising taxes on individuals.",
