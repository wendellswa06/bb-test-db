        "Well, what CVS and Aetna are saying is that they want to create sort of this seamless, simple medical experience where if you're an Aetna-insured customer and you go to a CVS store, it would be like a little health care hub.",
        "Not just a drugstore but you can go and maybe get blood tests, get your - talk to your pharmacist about the medications you're on.",
        "And all of it, perhaps, may come without a copay.",
        "That's sort of something they're dangling.",
        "They haven't announced all the details, of course, of what this will look like.",
        "But they're talking about creating this sort of medical experience that's cheaper and simpler than either running to the ER when you're sick or making an appointment with your doctor.",
        "Which all sounds great in theory but you can also see some of the antitrust implications, I suppose, of this giant synergy of these different kinds of companies, things the federal government will have to think about.",
        "But is it really going to make - I mean, why would the experience be any cheaper just because the companies have the same owner?",
        "Well, so the way the health care industry works with insurance companies - and what CVS is other than a drugstore chain is what's called a pharmacy benefit manager.",
        "It's just sort of this horrible term for a company that manages your prescription insurance.",
        "So when you get - if you have Aetna Insurance, CVS already manages your prescription drug plan.",
        "And each company takes a little bit off the top to make their profit.",
        "So the theory is that by combining them, there'll be fewer middlemen.",
        "They may have more of an incentive to lower costs because the insurance company and the drug company, the pharmacy benefit company are the same.",
        "But at the same time, there's this whole secondary problem, which is that this will create an enormously powerful company in the health care system that will have a lot of leverage.",
        "And pharmacy benefit managers, historically, haven't been known for really lowering prices according to their competitors in the health care industry.",
        "Yeah, so who is pushing against this deal in the way that you're describing?",
        "Well, right now what I've seen is a lot of consumers questioning it.",
        "If you look on Twitter, there's a lot of people going, how can they possibly let this happen?",
        "And there are experts who are wondering how this can possibly lower prices.",
        "Last year, the Justice Department blocked two huge insurance company mergers.",
        "But because CVS right now isn't a traditional insurance company, it's hard to say whether they'll take that same action.",
        "Well, there you go.",
        "I mean, has the Trump administration said anything that would suggest their attitude about this merger?",
        "They haven't said anything on this particular merger at this point, but they certainly are expected to be friendlier toward mergers in general than the Obama administration was.",
        "And they'll be taking a look, but it's hard to say that they'll see the same problems.",
        "Even though they recently went after this AT&T-Time Warner merger, which among other things, involved CNN, a TV network the president dislikes."

        "But he hasn't said whether he agrees with him.",
