        "You know, I lost a job.",
        "You know, it was a while back, but to get out of the actual addiction itself was very difficult.",
        "You know, it was a very tedious thing.",
        "But it certainly is an addiction.",
        "It should be considered one.",
        "You know, it's very wildly overlooked.",
        "What was your addictive game and how did you get out of it?",

        "But how did I get out of it?",
        "After I lost a job, you know, I realized, well, you know, maybe this is a little too much.",
        "I would sit and play \"\"Metal Gear Solid\"\" for, I don't know, 10 hours sometimes.",
        "And once I was done with that game, you beat the game, and you move on to the next one.",
        "So there was - after a while, there was - nothing was enough?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, it's never enough, you know.",
        "It's - the games are designed to captivate, you know, every - all of your senses essentially.",

        "It's what they do.",
        "It's their job.",

        "There's no actual evidence to that effect.",
        "So I won't believe it until there's some study that's actually done.",

        "But also, it feels the same way about being hesitant to classify this as an addiction at all until there's further study.",
        "But I do agree with her that's in part because they just want to be very cautious.",
        "And there's - in part because the research hasn't been done, there's no evidence to back it up as yet.",
        "So how do we define addiction?",
        "How does it relate to behavior, a behavior like online gaming?",
        "Well, you know, that's a really good question.",
        "And in fact, as part of our story, we went to a number of different experts to ask for their definitions of addiction, and they were all a little bit different.",
        "And it demonstrates to me that defining addiction is a little bit like defining weather Pluto is a planet or not.",
        "In a sense, all of these behaviors certainly have a lot of similarities.",
        "But I remember back in the '70s, people talking about pot, marijuana, and said, well, it's not addictive because - it's only psychologically addicting because you don't undergo withdrawal when you stop, which is true and also meaningless, because the people who are addicted to pot - and the AMA does recognize that as an addiction - are absolutely addicted.",
        "It's really a set of behaviors.",
        "And as your previous guest described, they have to deal with the inability to stop even though these things are affecting your life in a negative way.",
        "It's the compulsive part of it, the inability to control it, is that the key element?",
        "That's the key element in my opinion.",
        "Again, the importance of whether you define something as an addiction or not has a lot to do with whether insurance will cover it.",
        "That's why it's so important."
