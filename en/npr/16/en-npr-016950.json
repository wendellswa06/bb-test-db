        "So that one worries you.",
        "But on the other hand, you say you've been - I hate to use this word - but a real addict and you say this isn't real addiction?",
        "You know, it really lies with the individual user and moderation, I would say.",
        "I'm to the point where I had I have an egg timer with me when I play video games online.",
        "And after 60 minutes, I check in with myself and see if I really need to continue playing.",
        "But it's not something I lose control of.",
        "It's just something that - it's very easy to lose track of the time when you're playing a game online.",
        "Michael Lemonick, you have some experience with addiction yourself.",
        "I do.",
        "And for your article in Time magazine, you described your experience in - by the way, Jonathan, thanks very much for the call.",
        "We appreciate it.",
        "You described your experience going under an FMRI, that's a machine that can scan your brain and tell us what's going on.",
        "What happened?",
        "Well, the addiction you refer to, which I talk about in the article, is and addiction to alcohol that I had when I was in my 20s.",
        "And it was pretty significant.",
        "And there was no question that I was addicted.",
        "And I also was a heavy user of pot.",
        "And I was addicted to that even though it was only psychologically addicting.",
        "And so the question - I stopped doing both of those things in 1981, and haven't indulged in either one at all since.",
        "And so the question I was trying to look at was how my brain, if my brain, and how it has recovered.",
        "You see, one of the things that we're discovering with these scanning machines is that one of the key problems with treating addiction is that addicts, even when they're off the stuff, experience very powerful compulsions, almost irresistible compulsions to resume, and that these are triggered by places or sights or sounds that are associated with the addiction.",
        "So if you're a cocaine addict, for example, you might be off cocaine for three, four weeks, and walk by the corner where your dealer used to hang out, and just seeing that street corner will trigger an almost irresistible compulsion.",
        "So - and they've looked at the brains of addicts and exposed them to some of these triggers to see how long it takes for this compulsions die off.",
        "So I went into this machine, and they piped the smell of beer, literally, into my nostrils.",
        "They've got a - a smell-o-meter, they call it.",
        "And they would actually pipe the scent of beer to my nostrils and see how by brain reacted.",
        "And they were not actually surprised, but I was actually relieved to see that my brain didn't react at all.",
        "My brain has lost that compulsive trigger that is set off by the smell of alcohol or by the sight of it.",
        "Now, that's not so surprising with me, but the real question is, how soon after people get off of alcohol or cocaine, for example, do those responses begin to die out.",
        "And they're finding that it takes months, but the responses do begin to die off.",
        "And I guess another question is when do behaviors exhibit the same kind of changes in your brain and then the same kind of changes when you stop.",
        "Of course, California is earthquake country too, so the disaster has had particular resonance here.",
        "San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee offered support and kinship for losses that people still have ahead."

        "So we stick very much to what the study show, what the data show.",
        "And we will certainly consider everything that's been published in the peer-reviewed literature about video games over the next five years, and maybe even suggest some additional studies that might be done so that we can decide whether or not to develop a category for this condition.",
        "Why five years?",
        "Dr.",
        "O'BRIEN: Well, the classification really began in the 1950's or early '60s.",
        "And when I was a resident, it was DSM-I.",
        "I was part of the committee for DSM-III-Revised, which actually pioneered the current system of substance use disorders with - so in every several years, it's revised depending on what the data show.",
        "We expect the new classification to include much more neurobiology, including a lot of genetics.",
        "Because we've learned, especially in the addiction area that genetics plays a very strong role in who among us will develop this addictions.",
        "Probably the same for the video game compulsion, certainly it's true for alcohol, cocaine, nicotine, heroin, and, you know, all of the addictions that have been studied.",
        "Here's an e-mailed question we have from Ron(ph) in Corvallis, Oregon.",
        "How do you describe the difference between an addiction, a disease, and a habit?",
        "I've heard one opinion that many so-called diseases such as alcoholism, drugs or maybe even gaming could actually be called habits.",
        "Dr.",
        "O'BRIEN: Well, you know, this is a matter of definition, you know.",
        "Normally, we would think of a habit as something that could even be beneficial.",
        "And it's the same part of the brain, though, that is involved in reinforcing certain behaviors.",
        "So some of them are very good, whether it's a tennis stroke or a dance maneuver or playing music and so forth.",
        "You know, you could call these habits, too, if you want, but in fact, we get into the area of disease when the behavior is such that it causes medical problems, you know, such as depression and ill health and the lost of job and family and so forth, then it's clearly in the realm of something that doctors have to be concerned about."

        "But what kinds of things, in common parlance, make a game addictive?",
        "I guess it's just sort of a compulsion to not, you know, walk away from the game.",
        "So, you know, you want someone that, you know - basically, there are several ways people buy this games.",
        "But one way would be, for a child, let's say, or an adult to play a game at a neighbor's house, and they just have to get back in there and, you know, kill some more people or do whatever.",
        "And then they go to store and buy it, and get effects, right?",

        "And we know, for example, that the same things that are good, whether it'd be listening to music, or viewing something that's sexually arousing, or probably playing tennis or skiing, things that we really enjoy doing activate the same reward system.",
