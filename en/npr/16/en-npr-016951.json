        "O'BRIEN: Well, we think so.",

        "So I think that Andrei's testimony that we just heard is important, and this is a sort of thing that we do pay attention to and we try to set up studies whereby you can more objectively look at that, you know, interview a large number of people who are using video games and, you know, try to see how common it is."

        "I'm not sure how much of substance it is.",
