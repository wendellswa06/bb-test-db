        "Well, the Democrats are definitely delaying.",
        "They don't want to describe it as a filibuster, but I think that's just what it is.",
        "Now on the other hand, Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, says--and I think he's exactly right--72 hours after the--he said good will and bipartisanship of the compromise on the judges, here you have the Democrats standing up and saying, `Wait a second.",
        "We're not going to go for any kind of deal that will forestall us from blocking a vote.",
        "And they think that the John Bolton nomination to be UN ambassador is of sufficient merit.",
        "And so they're using this as a lever to press the administration to release documents that they think could, in fact, generate more Republican opposition to Bolton.",
        "I'm a little unclear on the filibuster agreement.",
        "Would it be fair for the Democrats to say, oh, well, that only applies to judges, and other kinds of filibusters are still perfectly OK.",
        "Well, that's true.",
        "Actually, Bill Frist, the Republican majority leader in the Senate, made it very clear early on in the talks that what he was talking about was simply a ban on filibusters with regard to judicial nominations, not with regard to legislation and not with regard to executive appointments, such as Bolton, an executive White House appointment.",
        "But the spirit of the deal is what the White House is now saying has been broken."

        "Senator Frist, who is totally in line with the White House, was pushed out of the deal.",
        "And if you look down the road in terms of Supreme Court appointments, I think that the Republicans' reaction to this was one of alarm because they realize now that without those seven Republican votes, they cannot get anyone but a moderate approved by the Senate and confirmed for a seat on the court.",
