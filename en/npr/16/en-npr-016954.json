        "That's a - Seth, I think that's a good point.",
        "Because the best thing in sports is when you have a team you can love or you can hate.",
        "Whether it's the New York Yankees or the Green Bay Packers or Notre Dame football or UCLA or the Boston Celtics.",
        "And joining us now is Frank Pasquale.",
        "He teaches at Seton Hall Law School in New York, New Jersey and specializes in privacy issues and cyber law.",
        "He's with us from our bureau in New York.",
        "And, Professor Pasquale, nice to have you on the program.",
        "Oh, thank you, Neal.",
        "And the Celtics were a team that were obviously loved by their fans but hated by opposition fans.",
        "A, because they were good, B, because they also seemed to find a way to win, and C, because they had this little guy running the team who when, you know, who when the game was won would light up that cigar.",
        "I grew up a Knicks fan in New York and I hated that cigar, and I told Red that repeatedly.",
        "And his answer was, you know, deal with it, kid.",
        "Seth, thanks very much and good luck to your Sixers.",
        "Thank you…",
        "Except when they play the Knicks.",

        "Stewart's with us from Portland, Oregon.",
        "Well, I'm a former New Englander, still a dyed-in-the-wool Boston fan on all levels of sport.",
        "And I have really a comment sort of bundled with the question about Red's ability to mentor his players.",
        "It seems like a common theme throughout everything I've read over the last 24 hours, and it seems like today's players really aren't open to the level of mentoring that he was able to provide, and I would just like some commentary on…",
        "That's an interesting point, Stewart, and I think there's definitely something to that.",
        "I mean, you now have players who make millions and millions of dollars and have no-cut contracts, and coaches don't have the authority - in all sports - that they once did.",
        "But Red had a way - not just with his players - but with everybody in his life of being able to be very honest with them, tell them what they thought and make them understand that he was saying it and doing it to try to make them better.",
        "Morgan Wootten - the great high-school coach, won more high-school games than anybody in history at DeMatha High School in Hyattsville, Maryland - was a very close friend of Red's and tells a story about in the ‘50s, when he was a young coach, there was a summer league game here in Washington.",
        "And Morgan was coaching, and Red sat on the bench because the place was so packed.",
        "It was DeMatha versus the Inter-High All-Star team.",
        "And the game went three overtimes, great game.",
        "The Inter-high team finally won."

        "He said oh, no, no. It was a summer league game, my kids played great.",
        "It's okay that we lost.",
        "He said no, that's not what I felt badly about.",
        "I felt badly because you lost your team the game.",
        "You did a bad coaching job.",
        "And Morgan was brought up short.",
        "He thought he'd done everything right.",
        "And said what do you mean?",
        "He said every timeout, you were talking about your offense.",

        "Your offense was fine.",
        "Your defense was lousy, and you never once did anything to improve your defense.",
        "You have to feel the game as a coach and feel what your team needs and what you need to give them as a coach during the game.",
        "And Morgan said it was probably the best lesson he ever got as a coach.",
        "And Red was uniquely gifted in terms of telling people very bluntly what they needed to do to be better and getting them to listen.",

        "He only had six plays.",
        "He didn't do anything fancy.",
        "You know, he believed in playing very hard on defense and being in better shape than the other team - all basic things.",
        "It sounds simple, but you know, in today's NBA in particular, getting teams to do any of those things isn't simple.",
        "And yet Red always got his teams to do those things.",
        "And always seemed to have a game.",
        "As you say, these seem simple, but certainly you and I both remember the Knicks could never figure it out.",
        "But he got the teams to press, play defense together, which in those days, 120-point games were not unusual."
