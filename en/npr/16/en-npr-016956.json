        "What - it's interesting if you take snapshots of a moment in time on hundreds or thousands of streets, you're going to find some interesting things going on.",
        "There have been people caught, or maybe let's say photographed, leaving strip clubs, scaling walls in what looks like an attempted burglary.",
        "Things like that, and so it does raise more issues and just having, say, an overhead view of the city.",
        "And this privacy issue, Google is accumulating a massive amount of information in a variety of formats including this one we're talking about - videos, photos, texts from books.",
        "Why is it doing this vast data grab?",
        "Well, yeah, that's a question maybe best post for Google, but I've - let's try to walk through this.",
        "I mean, at some point, Google wants to organize the world's information, and so a lot of what it does at some level has privacy implications.",
        "Its main search tool - its blog search tool, you can search for your name, Orkit the social networking site, Gmail, Street View but so far people seem to think that the benefits of these services outweigh any privacy costs.",
        "Now, the other hand is that they hold on to this information for a long time because that's the way their search engine works best, isn't it?",
        "Yes.",
        "There's - there are some good reasons to hold on to information for a while.",
        "I was interviewing the fellow who runs pbwiki.com - a Wiki Web site creating tool - and he says, oh, we love to hold on to this information because then we can go back and look at trends over time.",
        "Look at what people use, what service - portions of our service and improve it.",
        "And so there are good business justifications for keeping the information.",
        "The problem is, though, that Google until recently has kept it forever.",
        "Now they're saying they're going to start deleting it - I'm sorry, not deleting it - they're going to do some limited anonymization after 18 months.",
        "Other search engines like AOL say they're going to this after just a few months, I think 90 days.",
        "And Google did that, at least, in part from urging from lawsuits in Europe.",
        "Exactly, right.",
        "They probably wouldn't have adopted that kind of time limit in the absence of pressure from regulators because until then their position was you'd never know when this data is going to come in handy.",
        "Now, when I do a Web search with Google, does it remember that I went to Amazon.com six times last month?",
        "Yes and no. One - a big question is whether you log in to Google.",
        "In order words, create an account that you can use for Gmail, for instance, or if you have Google's ads on your blog.",
        "If there's - if you create an account, then Google is going to have your e-mail address, and then it's going to probably know what you've done across multiple sites and correlate that with your e-mail address."

        "There is a - the chance it's probably not.",
        "I mean, this is - there's no hard and fast rule, but the way the Internet has grown up over the last 10 or 15 years has been that cookies are allowed by default and you do every - and you can block them if you want.",
