        "Once you open it, you're supposed to have agreed to the whole contract.",
        "But a lot of people, obviously, are not reading through the whole end user license agreement and that whole contract.",
        "However, the courts have generally held people to be bound by the terms of the agreement that they click on.",
        "And so it's very difficult once you've entered into that essential contract with Google to go after them.",
        "However, there are some other issues that are opened up by people, say, who are using the service but have not particularly signed on for a particular account in the service, like if I just get it up on my computer and put up the Google's search box.",
        "Right.",
        "But if you sign up for the calendar, you automatically have to have an account.",
        "Sure.",

        "Then there are people who don't sign up for anything, but nevertheless, may find pictures of themselves or their house on Google's Web site.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And that raises some very interesting issues that the Europeans and Quebec have sort of - these countries have anticipated some of these issues, and actually have some laws, some regulations against the commercial use of these sorts of photos of individuals without their permission.",
        "In the U.S., in general, that's not an issue.",
        "I mean, if someone does not have a reasonable exploitation of privacy in the front of their house or, you know, one publicized case of their cat looking out the window, someone complained about that being online.",
        "Sure.",
        "There are a few states, though.",
        "Like Texas does have a very odd law that says that if you take a photo of someone for prurient interest, you know, that could raise some issues in Texas.",
        "So it is very interesting to see how some of these individual state laws might come into play here.",
        "And has the U.S.",
        "government gotten involved with Google on privacy issues?",
        "It has, but rather indirectly.",
        "The Federal Trade Commission back in 1999 served - has been a bit of a privacy entrepreneur and started looking into some of the issues involved here.",
        "But it's all being done a bit indirectly.",

        "And the other question is, people fear what Google might do with this information in terms of selling it or making it available to people.",
        "They also worry that this information - all these information about them might be accessed by some outsider whether that's the government with a warrant or whether that's a hacker with a very good program.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And that is an area where Google, to its credit, has been way in front of some other search engines in terms of trying to stop the government subpoena last year when it tried to connect IP addresses to the search records, or when it tried to - excuse me - to get search records in its defense of the Child Online Protection Act.",
        "That's for looking for child pornography.",
        "Yes, exactly.",
        "Well this was actually - this was an act that was involved in trying to shield children from pornography and the government was trying to prove essentially that lots of random searches that would be totally innocent could come up with these types of images and they wanted to look through all of Google's files.",
        "Now, of course, Google said that when it did this, it was trying to protect user's privacy.",
        "And perhaps it had standing to do that.",
        "But I think a larger concern of Google, and I think it's a larger public concern, is that it was protecting its trade secrets.",
        "It's very keen on protecting its trade secrets, how it organizes the data, how it puts it together, all those things.",
        "Which argues that - its argument against the transparency that one of our callers was going into earlier.",
        "Declan McCullagh, every organization says, well, we've made every effort to protect our files; no outsider could possibly get into it until that happens.",
        "It's true.",
        "History has a lot of examples of people saying, that this is unbreakable, or it is invulnerable, and then, of course, the privacy is violated.",
        "But to Google's credit, they have not yet suffered the kind of data breach that we're talking about.",
        "Maybe it's just a matter of time or maybe, you know, that they have done the right thing.",
        "One interesting point though is that we use search engines nowadays as, sort of, our window into the world, or at least, our window onto the Internet.",
        "And so there's - if you look at someone's search history over time, you can gleam quite a bit of information about people.",
        "Google search firms have popped up in a criminal case, a North Carolina murder case, the defendant was found guilty in part because he searched for words like neck, snap, break, and it was his wife that turned up dead.",
        "Another wireless hacking that the Google search firms involved things like wireless interference.",
        "And so, you can - and so there is a privacy threat inherent in any organization - Google, Yahoo, Microsoft or whatnot - collecting that much information and then making it available, because of it (unintelligible) our legal system to prosecutors in a criminal case, or civil litigants, even divorce lawyers in a civil case.",
        "So, what you're suggesting is in fact that we ought to see that we're going into a public space when we do this, whether we have an account or not when we go on Google, and that indeed our activities can, under certain circumstances, be reported.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You talked about transparency, an earlier caller - I'm sure you heard - mentioned this problem, as he sees it, of cookies, cookies that are - last for 30 years.",
        "Are they transparent?",

        "Why does Google only and partially anonymize, not even completely delete after 18 months?",
        "Why not - why wouldn't they follow AOL's lead in this case, for instance?",
        "And…",
        "There's actually - also, there's actually some reasons why they wouldn't.",

        "And I like the way that Declan has brought up the idea market pressure.",
        "I think there's also got to be some sort of cultural movements like the cultural movement that ultimately led to some legislation on things like choice points or the credit reporting agencies and other massive compilers of digital dossiers.",

        "It's more that the back up tape goes missing or someone breaks into the database.",
        "Or even if you call up someone on the phone, that information could still end up being divulged.",
