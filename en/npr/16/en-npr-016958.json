        "So I think that in general, I mean, it is - it's very interesting in terms of the expectation of privacy and there are some programs out there - the Electronic Frontier Foundation and some other - the Electronic Privacy Information Center, EPIC - have done some things in these areas.",
        "There's a program called Tour(ph) that might get people some chance of anonymizing themselves out there.",
        "But in general, it is - your IP address is a real address and it is connected to you, and it's connected to your computer, by and large, if you're using broadband or you're using the main providers of Internet services.",
        "So everyone should be concerned about this in the sense that it's very hard to get out of the system.",
        "Let's bring Nicole Wong into the conversation.",
        "She's deputy general counsel for Google and joins us from the company's headquarters in Mountain View, California.",
        "And Ms. Wong, you've been very patient.",
        "I know you've been listening to this program and I'm sure there have been several points you wanted to jump in.",
        "It's nice to have you available to talk to us now.",
        "Oh, thank you so much for the opportunity to join.",
        "And a lot of people as you've heard are concerned about the information that Google collects about Internet use.",
        "What does Google collect and what does the company do with it?",
        "Is this proprietary?",
        "So for a lot of our regular users, you're probably - well, we have a whole range of different types of products.",
        "The one that we're most well known for is our search engine, but we also, as was mentioned earlier in the program, we have an e-mail service and we have things like Google Earth, and we have a number of other interesting new products.",
        "One of the things that we really tried to do is to design all of our products with transparency and choice built into the product.",
        "And what I mean by that is that when you use one of our products, we try to design it so that you are aware of what types of information is being collected and how it's being used.",
        "An example of that would be what is called our Google Toolbar, it's a toolbar that helps you and attaches to your browser before you can even download it.",
        "A little window will pop-up and it says in big bright red letters, please read this, it's not the usually yada yada.",
        "And it tells you exactly what we're going to do.",
        "That's an example of trying to be transparent with our users and also letting them make a different choice, which is they don't want to download the toolbar.",
        "One of the things we'd also tried to do is have a range of our products that are available without having to sign in or provide us with any personally identifying information.",
        "Certain types of things you can't do that, right?",
        "Sure.",
        "So, one of the resolves for cookies getting on to your computer is - I think Declan was mentioning it - you can set your browser not to accept certain types of cookies, and we do allow for users to use our services without having to have that cookie at all.",
        "We initially set that cookie because, what it means is that a user as they come back to our site again and again, they don't have to reset their preferences all the time.",
        "That cookie is there to sort of set your language preferences.",
        "That if you want it to be in French instead of English that can happen.",
        "It also does things like set what we call our safe search filter, so that you only see things that were - would be appropriate for children not necessarily."

        "Those aren't the only things they do, though?",

        "We're talking about Google privacy, and you, you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And let me just continue with Nicole Wong.",
        "With Street View, can users ask that photographs be taken down if they say, look, I didn't want my cat or whatever it was in this picture.",
        "Yes.",
        "I think that was one of the issues, there's a cat visible in a window.",
        "Yes, we actually - we thought really hard before we launched this product, and we're still looking at - even after post-launch - to take a lot of feedback, both from our users, and from folks like Declan and privacy advocates and regulators.",
        "This product was built with a feature to flag content that you don't want in the system.",
        "And so, we will review all of those flags and remove the ones that are inappropriate.",
        "And is the goal eventually to have every street and byway in America on this service?",
        "Oh well, that would really be useful, these things to all of our users, to have all the streets.",
        "It's a very large project obviously.",
        "Obviously.",
        "Let's see if we can get another caller on the line.",
        "This is Casey(ph), Casey with us from Rapid City in South Dakota.",
        "Hi, I just kind of have a comment that I wanted to point out.",
        "I think it's - so many times we're trying to hold the big companies responsible for making our stuff private, but I think a lot of users might not even realize that the Internet is a public place, and if you are going to google.com or yahoo.com, then you are in a public place where some information is going to be seen.",
        "And seems like so many times that I see people whining about their privacy and that they want this to be private.",
        "Well, most of the time, they really - the fact is, they don't want what they're doing is to be seen in public, which is…",
        "Right."

        "So, they want to keep private and I guess that goes back to - made this rate and survey with Frank Pasquale.",

        "Well, and then…",
        "Now, we get an answer from the Google representative here, excuse me, Casey.",
        "Okay.",
        "Sorry.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Sure.",
        "I think it always depends on what types of service.",
        "Casey's probably thinking about services like MySpace, or where people are uploading things that are for public display.",
        "And I think that for our Google search pages, again, you can use our Google search system without ever providing us any personally identifying information.",
        "We also have a whole privacy center where we do try to be transparent with our users about the type of information collected when you do a search on Google.",
        "And we hope that we've helped them to make meaningful choices by giving them that type of information.",
        "Casey, thanks for the call.",
        "Here's an e-mail from Cathy(ph) in Illinois.",
        "As the owner of a Gmail account, I find it disconcerting to get an e-mail and find ads alongside keyed to the content of the message.",
        "I'm an activist and frequently have messages - I don't really want everyone reading.",
        "What's the process that Gmail uses to key into the content on my e-mails to someone - many ones actually have access to the content of my messages?",
        "Can company access to my e-mails?",
        "I'll take that one as, that - actually it's important to clear of any sort of misunderstanding about how Gmail works.",
        "No person is reading those e-mails in order to match ads to it.",
        "It's completely by computer.",
        "And it works very similarly to the way our search technology works, which is that, that computer will identify a key word in the content of an e-mail, and it will simply look in our system of ads and find the thing most relevant to that key word."

        "So you should go back and talk to the newspaper and say, look, I know you have no legal obligation to do that, but could you, as a favor, just have it removed from Google?",

        "And so if you hire something like ReputationDefender, there are some companies out there, they're very new in their upstarts and they've made a few missteps.",
