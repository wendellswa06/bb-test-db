        "I could get on a plane and go look at it and take a picture and post it on my own Web site.",
        "But now it's just a little bit more convenient for me to do that.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "It's a great question.",
        "And I think the problem here lies on the ease of use of these types of services.",
        "For example, when you just have a lot of digitalization of court records that you might have had a court record that'll be lying in some vault in a small town that could only be accessed by someone actually getting to that record."

        "And for example, a lot of countries are worried about this, Finland has banned the use by employers of Google when they're screening applicants.",
        "Because for precisely this type of worry, you know?",
        "And in terms of the street level view, you know, maybe I don't worry so much about, you know, my house being on it.",
        "But think about it, perhaps, I have not mowed the lawn for two months.",
        "You know, I've been away, and that's the image that's (unintelligible) online.",

        "And everyone that goes on Zillo or wherever to see my house says, wow, what a dump.",
        "And I think that that's why we need to have more accountability by the search engines in terms of giving us some autonomy in how we present this digital person, the second self that's online.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I have another question.",
        "Does Google - is it able to access things that would - somebody would place on a MySpace page?",
        "Declan?",
        "It depends.",
        "If there's - MySpace tends to be a more open environment than, say, Facebook that is more close.",
        "And so MySpace pages tend to appear in Google and Facebook pages tend not to.",
        "So it really depends on how the creator of the social networking sites set it up and the individual privacy preferences that the users decide on."
