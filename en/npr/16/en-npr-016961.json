        "OK, now he's opened up the tank, and we're going to open up our load lines.",
        "Scott pumps the Planet Money oil into his truck - 100 barrels, 4,200 gallons.",
        "Scott starts up the truck and heads on out.",
        "He's on his way to a pipeline that will eventually take our oil to a refinery.",
        "Now, Scott could just drive our oil straight to the refinery, but transporting oil is one of the biggest factors in the price of oil.",
        "And it's a game of saving pennies.",
        "Piping the oil is slightly cheaper than driving it.",
        "It's also safer - less chance of a spill.",

        "We meet Scott and his truck at the pipeline in Shur Station, Kan.",
        "And there are gleaming white pipes everywhere.",
        "One of them will eventually carry our oil to the CHS refinery in McPherson, Kan., to get made into gasoline.",
        "If it passes the test.",
        "Before Scott can put Planet Money's oil into the pipeline to mix with actual professional people's oil, Scott has to do a quality check.",
        "OK.",
        "Now, we're going to get this sample right here.",
        "Scott opens up something that looks like a lobster pot attached to the side of his truck.",
        "It is a centrifuge."

        "Private schools, generally, have smaller classes, more teacher attention, more resources per student, and, of course, if parents are paying all that money, it must be because their kids get a better education.",
