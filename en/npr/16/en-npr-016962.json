        "Now we're hearing possibly September, so that report is long awaited.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Now the study did look also - lumped in with private schools were religious schools: Catholic schools, Lutheran schools, and sort of born-again, fundamentalist Christian schools.",
        "Yes, it did.",
        "And the surprising finding was that the conservative Christian schools actually did no better than the public schools on any measure.",
        "In other words, the eighth-grade reading, which was the one place where the private schools excelled - you know, did better than the public schools - that did not hold true when you actually looked at the conservative Christian schools.",
        "And they, in fact, they just didn't seem to - they didn't really seem to hold their own against public schools very well in that regard.",
        "But I think, you know, in many cases, parents who are sending their children to, you know, particularly religious schools are looking at other things.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "They're looking at character.",
        "They're looking at, you know, religious beliefs, and they're looking to have other things reinforced and not just the academics.",
        "So it's sort of a tossup how much of an impact this kind of a report is going to have on any individual parent.",
        "On their decisions.",
        "There were, we should mention, also, some important caveats...",
        "Yes.",
        "...put out about the study.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes, there were.",
        "And the caveats actually were more lengthy than I've ever seen on any of these kinds of reports.",
        "And I talked to one of the authors yesterday, and he said the caveats were not really any bigger than he had originally written, because this did go through a lengthy review process once it was handed into the government.",
        "It was done by the ETS, the Educational Testing Service.",
        "So he said that it wasn't so much that the caveats were much bigger than they were, it was just they were all moved to one place up front, so they looked like a lot more.",
        "Mm-hmm."

        "But some of those caveats were that the samples are based on the National Assessment of Educational Progress.",
        "That's a test that's given across the nation.",
        "So in that sense, it's very good.",
        "You can compare people in every state, but it's not given to every student in every state.",
        "It's given to a sample of students in public schools and private schools, and so you really can't make individual school comparisons.",
        "That's one caveat.",
        "And the other important caveat is that this doesn't really tell us anything about how students progress which, for most parents, is kind of the important question.",
        "What it's telling us is that, you know, this is where students are in the different settings.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But it's not telling us, for example, a student who comes in really deficient in reading, is he going to do better in a private or a public school?",
        "You know, you could sort of extrapolate, but it's not quite the data you would want to answer that question.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And finally, what's been the reaction to this from the various educational groups?",
        "Well, you know, the thing that always interests me about covering education is actually how little learning goes on, because there's a tendency in education - it's like most of politics these days.",
        "It's very polarized, and people on either side of an issue very seldom look at data and say, gee, I didn't know that before, and that's going to - I'm going to reconsider my position on this or that.",
        "And this sort of falls into that category.",
        "People who are supporting vouchers and who are advocates - or who work for private schools, basically, talk - point to the limitations of the report and say, you know, hey, it's not longitudinal, meaning it's not telling you how individual kids do.",
        "Right.",
        "It's not every school.",
        "It's, you know, it's a lot of kids, you know, 700,000 students at public schools and 25,000 students at private schools, so that's certainly nationally representative.",
        "But, you know, they say, well, that's not big enough and it's not detailed enough and so forth.",
        "And the people who are, you know, working for the teachers' union, like Reg Weaver, the president of the National Education Association - they represent almost three million teachers - and people who are, you know, advocates for strong public schools will say, here, this proves that, you know, we're doing a pretty damn good job, and we should be putting - instead of pouring money into private schools through vouchers or, you know, pushing other forms of schools, we should be really spending all the money to strengthen the public schools because they are in fact doing, in their view, a heroic job given what they have to work with..."

        "We've been able to track poor students who transfer from a public school to a private school, compare them to very similar students who have stayed behind in public schools, and what we find is that the students who transfer to private schools seem to do at least a little bit better; and for African-American students, it's significantly better.",
