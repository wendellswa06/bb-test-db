        "Hey, how are you?",
        "Very well, thank you.",
        "I don't know why the administration would try to soft-pedal this report, because it seems, in some ways, it actually strengthens their hand.",
        "I know especially here in Florida, where Jeb Bush is trying to get the Class Size Amendment reversed.",
        "He's been maintaining it's costing - it's going to cost us billions of dollars and raise our property taxes.",
        "This seems to indicate that class size doesn't really have a tremendous impact.",
        "And school vouchers, for most of the supporters, is really an issue about saving money because they don't pay the full tuition to send these kids to private schools, they just pay some of them.",
        "So every time someone uses a voucher it just saves money for the rest of the kids.",
        "And I know from the teaching angle, it's not really - the teachers aren't really - the ones who are against school choice are mainly against it because it hurts the unions rather than it has any impact on the children whatsoever.",
        "And this report also seems to support that belief.",
        "It just doesn't seem to have a big impact.",
        "So what's wrong with giving the people a choice?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "This actually supports their contingent.",
        "Mike Petrilli.",
        "Well, I think Tom's making an important point.",
        "You know, in most parts of the country private schools actually don't charge very high tuition.",
        "We think of the Sidwell Friends School here in Washington, these other very elite schools that are charging $30,000 a year.",
        "But most parents that send their children to private schools, like Catholic schools, might be spending $4,000 or $5,000, $6,000 in tuition, and in many cases, less money than the public schools spend.",
        "So there is an argument to be made that private schools, if they are getting the same results as public schools, they're doing it for much less money.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Let's bring another voice into the conversation now, Andrew Rotherham.",
        "He's co-director of Education Sector, a nonpartisan national think-tank.",
        "He's on the Virginia Board of Education.",
        "He writes the blog eduwonk.com, and he's formerly special assistant to the president for domestic policy at the White House during the Clinton administration.",
        "He's with us today from the studios of member station WMRA in Harrisburg, Virginia.",
        "Nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION."

        "Thank you, Neal.",
        "It's great to be here.",
        "And I was wondering if you could respond to some of the questions that Tom was raising.",
        "Well, I think you want to be very careful, again, sort of drawing too much out of this study.",
        "I think the most striking thing about this study was how politically charged it became relative to how little it could actually tell us because of the limitations that are in it, some of the things that Diana talked about.",
        "And I don't think they were put up there in any way to sort of tamp it down.",
        "This was actually a very solid piece of research, and I think it was appropriately presented, but this is such a high stakes debate that everybody rushes to draw conclusions.",
        "Two things jumped out at me.",
        "One, I think that Tom said that there was very relevant is, you know, the fundamental questions about school vouchers, you know, that the effectiveness of different schools these categories, public and private, are so broad that I think there's other questions that are more basic in that conversation: what kind of regulations you want to follow with public money, how much choice parents should just have.",
        "Those are sort more fundamental questions.",
        "They have a little less to do with some of these empirical issues around this research report than just how do we want to organize public education in this country, how do we want to pay for it, and how much we want to pay for it.",
        "The one thing that Tom said that I think we should be cautious of is there is this notion that every time a child uses a voucher to go to another school it saves the public schools money.",
        "And there's some truth to that, but at the same time the public schools have a large infrastructure, which, as a public body, we've mandated that they do; they have certain sunk costs and they have certain fixed costs.",
        "And that's not an argument against having more choice per se at all, but it is an argument we have to be realistic about; how we're going to finance these things and how the finance is actually going to work out at the school and school district level.",
        "Tom, thanks very much for the call.",
        "We appreciate it.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And let me ask both of you in fact.",
        "Is the way the study is framed, or at least the way we're framing it, private versus public, is that the right one in your mind?",
        "Andrew Rotherham, why don't you go first.",
        "Well, I think there's two ways to look at it.",
        "For parents, I don't think it's the right one.",
        "Because the question parents want to ask is what school is going to be a good fit for their kids and what school is going to work for their kids.",
        "And that may be a school in the traditional public sector, the public charter school sector, or it may be a private school.",
        "And so for parents, to some extent, some of these labels are a little bit meaningless.",
        "They're looking at a set of schools around where they live, around where they potentially may be living, and they're making decisions there."

        "In terms of policy, it's interesting - and I found the report, as I said, well done and interesting to read - but these categories are so heterogeneous.",
        "There are so many different kinds of private schools, so much diversity in the public school sector, that ultimately sort of asking, you know, how do public schools do or how do private schools do, it's a little like, Neal, like asking, you know, how do people with driver's licenses, how do they drive?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And the fact is you can look on the road and see a lot of variation.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And, Mike Petrilli, let's get your...",
        "Well, I think it matters a lot to especially poor parents who right now don't have very many choices in our public education system.",
        "You know, affluent parents, of course, can go move to a suburb with very good schools or they can send their children to private schools that cost a lot of money.",
        "Poor parents don't have those same choices.",
        "So right now, in most cities in this country, they cannot send their children to private school and use public tax dollars.",
        "Of course, a lot of people think that that's a good idea, that they should be able to do that.",
        "And so it does matter whether or not those private schools would do a better job educating them.",
        "The good studies that we have that look at what happens when students switch schools from public to private in inner cities tends to show that there is a gain for those students.",
        "Why not send those same kids to good performing public school?",
        "Well, absolutely.",
        "But the problem, Neal, is that in most of our big city districts there are not enough good public schools to take those students.",
        "Under the No Child Left Behind Act, in fact, students in failing public schools are given the option of transferring to good public schools within the system.",
        "What we hear from every system in the country is, I'm sorry, we don't have any room in those good schools."

        "I think, Neal, the one thing that gets lost here is - I take Mike's point that sort of if you look at the studies around the private school choice programs, overall, they tend to show a modest impact for students who move from public schools to private schools - but the emphasis there has to be on it's a modest impact.",
        "And I think what we're arguing over, we're dancing over very small effect sizes around these different kinds of schools.",
        "And the cold hard truth is, unfortunately, when you're talking about high poverty kids, the kind of kids Mike is talking about, urban kids, no system, public or private, has shown that it's really able to sort of move their achievement significantly to where we need it to be.",
        "That's one of the reasons we have such substantial achievement gaps between minority students and white students in the country today.",
        "And sort of rather than quibbling about some of these differences, I think we need to have an honest conversation about what's it actually going to take to deliver the kind of education that we want to for these kids, regardless of whether it's going to be in a public or private setting.",

        "You know, basically go to the meetings that are held within my town and say, look, my child is not getting that he or she needs; it needs to stepped up.",
        "Another point I'd like to make is that my mother and father, especially my mother, grew up in the southern part of country, in Georgia.",

        "But, you know, in terms of improving public education versus sending your children to private schools, I don't think it's an either/or.",
        "In fact, I think it's important that our public education system face some competition, which is now happening in the form of charter schools or some of these private schools, to push the public schools to get better as well.",

        "It's great that Essien sends his kids to public schools.",
        "I'm a product of public education.",
        "The problem comes where we can't ask all parents if they're being given options - that the public options in their community aren't working for them - we can't continue to ask them to keep making a sacrifice in the interest of public schools in terms of sacrificing their own kid.",
        "We need to make sure that we providing good public options for them.",
        "And a policy sort of predicated that parents are going to support the public schools no matter what is really, over time, a recipe for disaster for public schools."
