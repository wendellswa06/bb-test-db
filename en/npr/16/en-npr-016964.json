        "I have one child, a 5-year-old.",
        "We're a middle-class family, and I have made the decision to send my child to a private Catholic school, even though the public school district where we live is rated excellent.",

        "I also want God to be a topic, not skirted around in everyday life.",
        "That goes back, I think, the point you were making, Mike.",
        "Sometimes people make their decisions not necessarily on the quality of school, but on other factors.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "You know, I think sometimes those of us in the policy world and researchers, we lose sight of this fact that education is part of raising a child.",
        "And parents are looking for lots of things when they choose a school.",
        "I think Susan, you know, explains that very well.",
        "They're looking for values.",
        "They want a school that reinforces the values that they're teaching at home.",
        "I think there's a lot of parents out there that feel that traditional public schools right now are not doing that.",

        "J.C.: I wanted to ask about the study and what is the difference between the results of the study when it's not controlled for socioeconomic and parental education, so on and so forth.",
        "Do we know?",
        "The raw numbers?",
        "Andrew Rotherham, have you taken a look?",
        "Yeah, that's a great question, J.C.",
        "In fact, that's the whole point of the study.",
        "When you just look at the raw numbers, what you see is a substantial advantage for private schools.",
        "And that is in part what lead to the perception that exists that private schools are consistently better than public schools, and just any time you have a choice between public or private, you'd want to choose private.",
        "The whole point of the demographic controls that were put in is to - when you start to look and make more apples to apples comparisons, when you account for things - poverty, parental education, different things that we know effect student achievement - that the differences, they don't completely go away, but they become minimized.",
        "And I think, in terms of the study as a whole, you'd have to say they become something of a wash.",
        "But again, within these categories, it doesn't mean there are not substantial differences.",
        "There's not terrific private schools, terrific public schools, and lousy schools in both sectors.",
        "What we're talking about here is sort of overall averages, which as I said earlier, you want to be careful about sort of drawing too much from.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Mike Petrilli, how do they factor this out?",
        "Unidentified Man #3: As did Millard Fillmore.",
        "So…",
        "Well, you know, I think there's an assumption for a long time that private schools were better because of the demographics of the children.",
        "Many of us think of private schools as being these privileged, elitist schools, and so the children are wealthier and that's why they're scoring better.",
        "And again, so we factor these things out, we account for race, we account for income - as I said, unfortunately they also account for some school factors.",
        "But, you know, I think we need to challenge that assumption.",
        "I think in many communities - especially in middle class and lower income communities where parents are choosing private schools - it might be because their child is struggling and not succeeding in the public schools, and so they are making the sacrifice to send them to private schools.",
        "And, in fact, those students are not performing as well as their counterparts that stay behind in public schools."

        "Yeah.",
        "The comment I'd like to make is that I have a very close friend who enrolled her son in a private school, and before the year was up she was asked to take her son out because they could not meet his special education needs.",
        "And by law, every public school has to meet the needs of these children, no matter how great they are.",
        "And the private schools, they can just pick whatever children they want.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Andrew Rotherham, yeah.",
        "There's different requirements on different kinds of schools.",
        "There definitely - there are different requirements, and that's one of the big questions about vouchers, that if you're going to finance private schools with public money, do you want them to have to abide by some of the same kind of admissions criteria - or, in fact, absence of admissions criteria as other public schools do?",
        "And that's a real difficult policy question.",
        "Special education is a tough issue.",
        "There are a lot of kids with special needs.",
        "What's interesting is, in fact - and it sort of shows the overlap between the sectors - is that under the federal special education law, there are some students who are so severely disabled that the public schools can't serve them very well, and they get to attend private schools at public expense that can meet their exceptional needs.",
        "And it shows, again, that there's actually more interaction between these sectors right now than is often commonly assumed.",
        "Mm hmm.",

        "Of course.",
        "Actually, I wanted to kind of pursue the line of thinking that two callers ago was talking about, and that is the role of family in education.",
        "And what my experience is as an educator in first private and then public schools and as a parent whose children have gone to both public and private schools -what I have found in my own experience is that the children who are successful are the children whose parents prioritize education, or who have the resources to dedicate time and energy to their child's education - not just the money to send them to private schools, but also who are willing to be involved.",
        "And those - there is a school in my neighborhood that is failing - so-called failing, according to No Child Left Behind - and they were required to offer transfers to any of the students in their district to any other school that the students wanted to go to.",
        "And what we found was that the students who were the most successful in that school and whose parents were involved and interested in their kid's education, or who had the energy or the understanding or whatever it is - a number of them are immigrant children, their parents don't even necessarily speak English.",
        "The children who are already the most successful were the children who left.",
        "And then the children who were left behind were the one who - I don't know, whose parents made other choices or didn't understand what the opportunities were, or I don't know exactly.",
        "They're the parents who didn't show up for Parent/Teacher nights, anyway.",
        "And so my question is, if you have a voucher program, even if it's aimed at the poorest of the poor, who are you going to be helping?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's a great question.",
        "We just a few seconds left to - I'll throw it to you, Mike Petrilli.",
        "Sure.",
        "Well, the research we have from the few cities that have implemented vouchers shows that the parents that apply for these vouchers are just as poor as the parents who do not.",
        "You know, they might be slightly more motivated, but these are still very poor parents who are desperate for a good education for their children.",
        "You know, parents who've already figured out how to make the public schools work for them don't need to consider these options.",
        "Carrie, it's an important question.",
