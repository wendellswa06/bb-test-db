        "Well, there are charges in statements that document whole episodes of my love life.",
        "Like, I found a charge for a trip I took to Club Med in Cancun, which made remember a guy I met there.",
        "You know, we spent the whole week together.",
        "The first day after we get back, he calls me, and then I have a charge, $89 for Victoria's Secret, because, you know, things are moving forward, it looks like.",

        "So--unworn, of course, with the tags still attached.",
        "And of course that reminds you of the whole story of the relationship.",

        "Yeah.",
        "And that's the amazing thing.",
        "The way this whole thing came about is I was cleaning my closet and came across boxes with, you know, 12 years of American Express statements, and I realized it was, you know, a diary of literally how I spent my life.",
        "You know, I'm looking through the charges, and, like, oh, yeah, that's from when that tall guy took me to that French restaurant.",
        "And then, like, wait a second, I paid for that dinner 'cause he was cheap.",

        "Yeah.",

        "So in \"\"Statements\"\" I tell the story of how I became probably the first woman in history to not only throw her underwear at Tom Jones but to actually attempt to get my panties back.",
        "Why?",
        "'Cause I did the math, you know.",
        "I was just obsessed.",
        "I realized, wait a second, women throw conservatively 10 pairs of panties at an average Tom Jones concert.",
        "OK, that, I figured out is roughly, like, 4,000 pairs of panties a year.",
        "In his whole career, it's a lifetime total of, like, a hundred thousand pairs of panties.",
        "And I was dying to know where are those panties now.",
        "So the whole panty retrieval adventure came back to me when I saw the charges on my American Express statements.",

        "I think that one I actually paid for.",
