        "All the data gets uploaded to the Internet every 15 minutes, which allows Rogers to specify exactly how much water the trees need.",
        "Instead of getting soaked once a week with sprinklers, his nearly 15,000 trees get tiny doses of water every day.",

        "Heather Cooley is with the Pacific Institute, an environmental think tank.",

        "In California's Central Valley, fifth-generation farmer Philip Bowles has been installing more drip irrigation every year, and he's happy with the results.",
        "He's cut his farm's total water use by about 25 percent in the last decade while doubling the per-acre yield.",
        "Water's a big expense for us.",

        "Bowles is tired of farmers getting a bad rap these days for using 80 percent of the state's water.",

        "Well, potentially it's very serious.",
