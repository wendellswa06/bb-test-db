        "Unidentified Man #2: Yeah.",
        "We haven't had a great deal of detail, but it clearly seems to have been what they call chatter, intercepted messages between, we believe.",
        "I asked affiliated groups in the Sinai Peninsula.",
        "We don't know precisely what was said.",
        "We don't know precisely the nature of the intelligence.",
        "But I think what's really most interesting is the action which the British in particular took so swiftly.",
        "There was clearly something there that led them to believe that this had indeed most probably been a bomb that brought down the Russian Airbus, and that's why the moved so swiftly to suspend flights between Britain and Sharm el-Sheikh.",
        "Well, yes, and, of course, the plane - this Russian plane was carrying vacationers mostly from Russia from Sharm el-Sheikh, which is a very popular beach resort in Egypt, and very many British tourists end up going there.",
        "So what, how many were stranded, something like 20,000, but they're on their way home now.",
        "Not entirely clear, actually, you're right.",
        "It's a very, very popular holiday destination, not least at this time of the year.",
        "We think there are roughly 20,000 or so British holidaymakers in Sharm el-Sheikh at the moment.",
        "Clearly, some were due to return home.",
        "Others may now wish to cut short their holidays and come home.",
        "The plan had been as of last night to bring flights back from Sharm el-Sheikh.",
        "Today, there were scheduled some 29 flights to bring people home.",
        "There were particular restrictions.",
        "For example, haul baggage, as we understand it, was to be carried on separate aircraft.",
        "The passengers would only be able to have their hand luggage with them.",
        "Just in the past few minutes, though, we've heard a press release from easyJet, which is one of the budget operators, budget airlines, who fly the route.",
        "And they say that the situation in Sharm el-Sheikh has changed this morning and that certainly their flights have been suspended by the Egyptian authorities, they say.",
        "We're still seeking clarification, but it may be actually that none of these flights come back today.",
        "We're still, as I say, trying to find out what exactly is going on.",
        "All right, well, Egyptian authorities did recover both black boxes.",
        "That's the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder.",
        "What is known about their contents at this point?",
        "Very little, obviously, it's the Russian authorities and the Egyptians who are in the lead there in analyzing this material.",
        "The aircraft, I think, was registered in Ireland.",
        "The Irish authorities would have some input as well and also, of course, the manufacturers, the French and the Germans.",
        "It's an Airbus airline, or obviously.",
        "Of course, it's not just the data recorders and the voice recorder, the latter of which we believe we've been told was damaged.",
        "But because this occurred over land and the crash scene was very quickly identified, it's a grim and gloomy process.",
        "But they have the bodies.",
        "They're able to conduct postmortems.",
        "They have the luggage.",
        "They have whatever survives of the structure of the aircraft.",
        "And, of course, that is going to give a huge amount of forensic data that will be used as well to try and drop a picture of what exactly happened.",
        "Well, thank you very much for joining us.",
        "Pleasure.",
        "Jonathan Marcus is defense and diplomatic correspondent for the BBC, speaking to us from London.",
        "We're going to spend some time now on events in Guatemala, where a historic trial began last week.",
        "Two former military officers stand accused of murder, kidnapping and keeping nearly a dozen indigenous women as domestic and sex slaves during that country's long civil war.",
        "This is believed to be the first time any national court has addressed sex slavery as a part of prosecuted war crimes.",
        "To find out more, we reached out to Kelsey Alford-Jones.",
        "She's the director of the Guatemalan Human Rights Commission, which has a representative at the trial.",
        "The Guatemalan war was brutal.",
        "It lasted 36 years and resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths and disappearances.",
        "Most of the genocide and other crimes targeted Mayans.",
        "And I started off by asking Kelsey Alford-Jones to explain that.",
        "As you can imagine, some of the details we're about to discuss are disturbing, so I want to alert listeners to that."

        "Their husbands were working to legalize their land in this area that was principally owned by large landowning families.",
        "The women that were left alone after their husbands had been disappeared were then targeted by the military that had set up a series of military outposts in this region in Guatemala.",
        "And they forced the women to live right outside the military base and to do shifts where they would go cook for the soldiers, clean for the soldiers and, as part of that, they were also repeatedly raped during those shifts.",
        "So for some women, that repeated rape happened over period of days or months, and for some women it happened over a period of years.",

        "We have not seen any kind of defense presented.",
        "So they have not denied the specificity of these allegations.",
        "What they have done is to object to the legitimacy - raise questions about the legitimacy of the proceeding itself.",
