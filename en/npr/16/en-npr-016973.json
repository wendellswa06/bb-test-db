        "And we mentioned strong moves by Russia's Central Bank - they haven't helped.",
        "The latest was last night.",
        "What happened?",
        "Well, the Central Bank raised its key interest rate to 17 percent, and that's a huge step.",
        "It was only about 10.5 percent before.",
        "The idea was that it would make it more attractive for people to keep their rubles in the bank since they'd be earning good interest.",
        "And it also makes it more expensive for currency traders and speculators who bet on the rise and the fall in the currency.",
        "As you say though, it doesn't seem to have helped because the ruble just kept falling.",
        "And there's a risk to raising interest rates that high because ordinary business people won't be able to borrow money to run their operations.",
        "Corey, earlier you said a loss of confidence that's verging on panic, but what are you actually seeing from people on the street?",
        "Well, some people are trying to convert their money into dollars and euros.",
        "But of course, that already amounts to a big loss for them.",
        "There doesn't seem to be anything like a panic yet.",
        "I went to some banks earlier today.",

        "You know, I got caught in the currency speculation just last week.",
        "I had to change about $100, and I got 51 rubles to the dollar.",
        "And I thought that I was really hot stuff, but of course, I've already lost money.",
        "One other thing that we're seeing is that people who can afford it are taking their savings and they're buying cars and appliances.",
        "You know, I was at a big electronic store just the other day, and they were selling things like hotcakes.",
        "They were just going out the door - the theory being that it's better to have a new big screen TV or a refrigerator because it won't lose value as fast as your savings account.",
        "Does this seem to be affecting people's attitudes towards President Putin at all?",
        "I mean, are they blaming him for this crisis?",
        "Not so far.",
        "In fact, there was a piece of news today that underscored that Putin is still tremendously popular.",
        "He was named Russia's Man Of The Year in a nationwide poll.",
        "And that's for the 15th year in a row.",
        "That's NPR's Corey Flintoff in Moscow.",
        "Corey, thank you.",
        "My pleasure, Audie.",
        "NPR's business news starts with trouble at Dell.",
        "You might recall their old slogan - easy as Dell.",
        "Now investors might be wondering - what the Dell?",
        "The company's first quarter profit was much worse than predicted - a 79 percent drop in earnings.",
        "That's what the computer maker reported to investors yesterday.",
        "Analysts say the reason is that it's harder to sell PCs with the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets."

        "budget deficit.",
        "In fact, putting off tax hikes and spending cuts does exactly the opposite, and lawmakers dropped long-term proposals to manage federal debts.",
        "The measure passed the House last night, mainly with Democratic votes.",
        "Two-thirds of House Republicans opposed it.",
        "NPR's David Welna reports.",

        "REP.",
        "NANCY PELOSI: While this bill doesn't accomplish all that we need to do to grow the economy, reduce the deficit and strengthen the middle-class, it is a good way for us to have a happy start to a new year by taking this first step.",
        "It is also a step that, while skirting the fiscal effects of going over the cliff, leaves the national debt to grow by another $4 trillion over the next decade.",

        "And I just want to note, Scott Detrow, how much time each candidate spent trying to put the focus on the other.",
        "It did seem through this election year that Hillary Clinton did better when the focus was on Donald Trump and a little bit worse when the focus was on her.",
        "I think that was the case for both candidates.",
        "When the conversation was about the other person, it was like the other candidate could draft behind them and pick up support in the polls.",

        "It was as important for them to talk about Donald Trump as it was to talk about Clinton, to make this election a referendum on Trump, his temperament, his ability to be commander in chief.",
