        "Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.",
        "Of course, this all came up again in this last week when Comey made it public the FBI was looking at evidence again.",
        "And then just this weekend, he said that that new evidence did not change the bureau's earlier decisions.",
        "Clinton has repeatedly said this was a mistake, but that gave Donald Trump an opening.",

        "It's a massive venue here in New York, and I think one reason Clinton is there is that it has a very prominent glass ceiling.",

        "Hopefully it doesn't fall tonight, but I think Clinton's hoping that metaphorically it does.",

        "Because one of the problems with these folks is they criticize Plan B but they really don't have a Plan C.",
        "I'm sure he's now focused on framing a way to get out of this mess when it comes back from the Senate later this week.",

        "Yes.",
        "There will be enough Republican defections to deny him 218 Republican votes.",
        "When he did this at the end of the last Congress on the fiscal cliff, those folks that voted no on the fiscal cliff deal were praying that it got 218 votes but they could still go home and puff out their chests and say I didn't vote for it.",
