        "This is an interesting meeting because it reflects the fact that the field has matured a little bit and they're not the - you know, in the first years, everything was new and everything was fantastic, and now they're into a more mature stage where the - you know, the big discoveries are coming a little more slowly.",
        "But I think the most interesting paper here was a talk that was given this morning by a doctor named Yamanaka from Kyoto University.",
        "It was very well received.",
        "And basically, what he showed - and this was worked on in mice - but what he showed was it was possible to take a skin cell and add some genes to it and get it to behave as if it were an embryonic stem cell.",
        "Now, the reason that's important is that, right now, the only way to make an embryonic stem cell is to get an embryo and then extract cells from that embryo.",
        "And, of course, with mice it's probably not the same ethical issue, but when we talk about human embryonic stem cells, some people have raised objections - moral objections to using human embryos.",
        "So, if - and, you know, this is what we always say in these things - if the work in mice holds up, and if it can be translated to humans, it would be a fantastic advance because it would get around the whole issue of using human eggs to make embryos and then, you know, getting stem cells from them."

        "Right.",

        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "You know, the Korean thing is, I think, I hope, such an unusual occurrence that it's very hard for scientists to approach any kind of research as if it was completely made up.",
        "They assume, to begin with, that it's true.",
        "At the same time, even after the Koreans made their announcement that they had derived stem cell - you know, cloned human embryos and then derived stem cells from those embryos - even after that, a lot of scientists said, well, you know, the only people in the world who have been able to do it is the Koreans - the South Koreans - and it would be nice - it would be appropriate for other people to replicate the work before we go forward.",

        "Right.",
        "That's right.",
        "It was important.",
        "But they were saying, you know, it almost seems too good to be true and that's always a warning, but they were also very impressed.",
        "So I think this is a kind of a study that's a lot easier to try to replicate, and I think that people will be trying to do that.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Are you getting any impression that we have turned a corner a bit where there might be viable stem cell therapies that they're talking about at the meeting, or are we still into this basic research mode of the papers being presented?",

        "Obviously, there's damage that they can't replace and repair, but they think there may be a way to restore function to some of the remaining neurons.",

        "I should hasten to say that, you know, we tend to say, well, there are no stem cell therapies.",
        "Well, obviously, there are a lot of stem cell therapies, because when you get a bone marrow transfer, what you're really getting is stem cells; they're blood stem cells.",
        "So there are already stem cell therapies.",
        "This would be embryonic therapies based on embryonic stem cells that were cells that were derived from them.",

        "So he said that only stem cells that were created - embryonic stem cells that were created before August 9, I think the date was…"
