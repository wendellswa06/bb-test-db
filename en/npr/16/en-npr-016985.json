        "So, for instance, farm subsidies, both of them target them.",
        "The Medicaid program, both of them would spend less on that, although they'd do it in different ways.",
        "But basically, Mr. Ryan would cut the deficit without raising taxes and raising Defense spending, so that means he would have to spend much less on domestic programs than Mr. Obama thinks is wise."

        "Nothing's going to get resolved before the election, and it's not clear what happens after the election, but there is a ticking time bomb out there on these huge tax increases and spending cuts that are set to take effect if Congress doesn't deal with these issues then.",

        "Private employers added 176,000 new jobs while the government sector shed 11,000.",
        "Another boost came from positive revisions for February and March.",

        "He says the small decline in the number of hours in the average work week in today's report may be a reflection of the government furloughs.",
        "Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics is a big more pessimistic.",
        "He thinks the stock market rally today came because investors expected to be disappointed.",
        "So then, when the number comes in above those beaten down expectations, the market gets excited.",
        "But I got to say, when you got a 165 payroll number in an economy with an unemployment rate that's still far too high, I don't really think that's anything to get excited about.",
        "Shepherdson says he's concerned to see construction losing jobs in April, despite the recovery in housing.",
        "He attributes it to a slowdown in government infrastructure projects and a decline in private non-housing construction.",
        "Other recent data is also consistent with the economy slowing a bit since the middle of the winter, he says.",
        "But very little of it suggests that things have actually rolled over, that things have taken a really serious turn, but the danger is, of course, that we're not finished yet absorbing the fiscal tightening and so things could get worse before they get better.",
        "And Shepherdson says with growth currently running just above 2 percent, there's not a big margin for error.",
