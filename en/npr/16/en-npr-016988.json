        "So this has allowed the disease to even spread farther.",
        "So there really is very much a communications problem going on at the moment, and that is one of the things they're trying to address.",

        "Langevin says going to college always poses challenges for young people, but now there's sometimes the added stress of a parent back home who's lost a job or the family's house has been foreclosed on, and that makes students very aware of how much money they're spending at college."
