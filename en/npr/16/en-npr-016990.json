        "You are a briner.",
        "I go back and forth between wet brining and dry curing.",
        "Brining definitely adds a lot of juiciness, moistness and it protects against overcooking a great deal because it kind of changes the cellular makeup of the meat and superloads it with moisture.",
        "Dry curing can kind of do the same thing, but it's more about intensifying the flavor.",
        "I've always been a fan of brining, except I couldn't figure out how I could get the turkey and the brine into the refrigerator.",

        "It's kind of like a big cylinder, they're usually orange.",
        "And I build my brine in there.",
        "Because my brine usually calls for ice and then I just dump the turkey in there and park it in the garage for a few days.",
        "And I find that it only gains a couple of degrees during that time.",
        "So even outside, not refrigerated, you're not worried about what might happen to that turkey.",
        "No, because most good brines come with at least one ice option.",
        "All of mine do.",
        "I build mine with ice.",
        "And sometimes I'll even brine the turkey frozen.",
        "I'll build the brine, stick a frozen turkey in there, cover it and leave it in there for like a week.",
        "And I've never had it get over 40 degrees.",
        "Well, what do you put in your brine?",
        "Well, it's almost always a balanced equation of sugar and salt dissolved in water with at least a minimum amount of seasoning.",
        "A lot of people put a lot of herbs inside theirs or they might use a little bit of vinegar or some apple juice to add a little sweetness.",
        "But technically, all you really have to have is salt and water.",
        "Okay.",
        "Well, here's a place where you and I part ways, Alton, and that's that you say that stuffing in a bird is evil.",
        "Why?",
        "Yeah, stuffing's evil.",
        "Stuffing's evil because - here's the thing.",
        "If you're going to cook stuffing inside a turkey, you're basically making an edible envelope for that stuffing.",
