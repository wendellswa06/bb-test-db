        "I mean, the - as a first cut, the index actually just kind of goes through and electronically - they use a system that pulls all sorts of reports and media reports, even things like corporate filings, and looks for certain key words and then puts those together and you get a raw score.",
        "And then those are, as you say, looked over by some experts to import their own judgments, to some extent.",
        "And this is the second year you've been doing this, and presumably - at Foreign Policy magazine, presumably, this index will gather some credibility over time, but also self-correction."
