        "Of course I have been.",
        "Chris is one of the better senators here, and I know that Ted felt that this would be in good hands with him.",
        "But I think the biggest problem is - it will be a partisan bill.",
        "Now, maybe in the end we can get a number of us together to do a bipartisan bill out of these two bills, that's one in the Health Committee and of course the other one in the Finance Committee.",

        "And of course on countless occasions Orrin Hatch and Ted Kennedy have worked together on - if we spent the next 15 minutes, I couldn't recite all the bills they've worked on together - so there are those of us here who, despite whatever philosophical differences have, realize we've got a job to do.",
