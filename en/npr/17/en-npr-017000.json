        "So let's talk about these guys.",
        "First of all, you call them gentlemen smugglers.",
        "Why?",
        "They were atypical drug smugglers.",
        "Nowadays, we take for granted that violence accompanies all types of drug trafficking.",
        "And certainly in Mexico, there are many, many horrible acts of gruesome violence and murders.",
        "But back in the '70s, these smugglers were college-educated, and they were also averse to violence.",
        "They reason that if there was plenty of money to go around - and it was as much about the fun as it was the money - so there's no reason to carry a gun.",
        "So for them, this was just a good time and a way to make some quick, easy cash.",
        "Right.",
        "It started out a lot of fun.",
        "Slowly, I think, greed creeped into the picture.",
        "But when you think about the places they sail, they often took sailboats down to Jamaica, to Colombia, South America.",
        "So it was nice, adventurous sailing, tons of pot and liquor on board to get you through the trip, even if it got a little boring.",
        "And when you came home, you had a nice landscape and friends waiting for you.",
        "And one of those friends you talk about is part of the backdrop, the community of these folks, especially in Florida, down in the Keys, was Jimmy Buffett.",
        "Can you paint us a picture of how he fit into this, and what that culture was like down there.",
        "Sure.",
        "As Jimmy Buffett was making his name and starting to become a music superstar, his friends included some of the gentlemen marijuana smugglers.",
        "Mr. Buffett owned up to tossing a few bales of pot himself, in a Rolling Stone article back in the '70s.",
        "It's tough to say if Buffett inspired the smugglers, or the smugglers inspired Buffett songs.",
        "But I think it was probably a little bit of both.",
        "You end up portraying these gentlemen smugglers almost like folk heroes.",
        "I'm thinking, especially, about Les Riley.",
        "Can you tell me a little bit about this particular smuggler?",
        "We'll talk with leaders of the Army Corps Report and the Berkeley Report this hour.",
        "Later in the program, same-sex marriage is on the TALK OF THE NATION Opinion Page this week as the Senate open debate on a constitutional marriage amendment.",
        "And so, for example, you see Pakistan comes out as the ninth most vulnerable state, and the Pakistani government was quite livid when they found that out.",
        "But that I think, in part, reflects the fact that there was the horrific earthquake there, which really strained all of the state institutions, put an enormous burden on the state, and made it, I think, more vulnerable in the same way that a severe sickness would make a, you know, a person more vulnerable.",
        "And so, you know, this is snapshot.",
        "But year to year, I think you can get a sense of what's changing in a state, and there have been some very interesting changes.",
        "China, for example, you know, seen in the popular media as an economic powerhouse, slipped significantly in the ratings, which I think may reflect kind of hidden tensions in that country, even as the economy booms."

        "All the protests against seizures of land, that sort of thing?",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "I think, last year there were, by an official estimate, 87,000 protests in the country, and a lot of it had to do with the fact that there is a China that's been left behind the booming coastal economy, and people are very uncomfortable with the way that developers have come in and snatched up land; and you have a peasant economy that is essentially crumbling as the coastal economy leaps forward.",
        "And so this index helps to diagnose that kind of latent tension in a society.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "What about the states, though, at the top of the list.",
        "I mean, these - Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Iraq, Zimbabwe.",
        "Are they better or worse?",
        "Well, Sudan has fallen significantly.",
        "Last year, Ivory Coast was the most vulnerable state, and so there's some shifting that's gone around in there.",
        "But when we look at the very top, with the exception of Pakistan, which jumped up into the top 10, you see a lot of the same countries.",
        "And I think that reflects the fact that it's just very hard often to break this cycle of state failure, because you have, you know, militias that emerge and then they fight with other militias, and it becomes very difficult for a central government to maintain control.",
        "And so you often have - you know, year after year, you have failure that continues, and it's just a very difficult cycle for countries to break.",
        "We're talking about failed states, what defines that and what to do about it.",

        "Yeah, and I think there certainly is a view out there that when you look at particular - in particular, when you look to Africa, and I think six of the top 10 and 11 of the top 20 vulnerable states in the world are from Africa, there is this view that what we're dealing with are countries that have been looted by the West, essentially.",
        "I think, there's obviously some truth to that, but I think we - what we focus on as we analyze the results of the index, are that's it really leadership more than location that makes a difference.",
        "Because you see countries that have been under colonialism that have emerged and done relatively well.",
        "You see others that have acquired very bad leadership and are in freefalls.",
        "Zimbabwe is a good example of that.",
        "I don't think anyone would say that Zimbabwe's current crisis is a direct result of colonialism.",
        "I would say it's a direct result of the very poor leadership there by Robert Mugabe.",
        "And so I think colonialism and that legacy is definitely part of the equation.",
        "I -personally, I find it very difficult to attribute, you know, decades on - to attribute all of the success or failure in Africa to colonialism.",
        "Sam?",
        "Yeah, I'm not so concerned about the colonial aspect; I mean, I understand that.",
        "My concern is more that we are wanting the physical resources, the natural resources, and we create conflict in places like eastern Congo because we want those resources.",
        "Well, I guess what - Sam, what I would say is that there are plenty of places in the world where people want resources.",
        "People want resources that come from all over the world.",
        "In many cases - I mean, you know, copper or something comes from Chile, and plenty of other examples of commodities trade, but that doesn't always lead to conflict.",
        "What leads to conflict is poor governance, corruption, that kind of thing.",
        "And so I think it's incorrect to say that it's just a result of the hunger for resources.",
        "Because, you know, resource hunger can lead to a booming economy, or it can lead to situations like we see in eastern Congo.",
        "And so, I think it goes significantly beyond the need for resources.",
        "Yeah, okay, I appreciate that.",
