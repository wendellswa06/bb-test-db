        "We're talking today about failed states, how they're defined, the danger they represent to their people, to their neighbors, to the world, and what can be done usefully.",
        "Our guest is David Bosco, a Senior Editor of Foreign Policy magazine.",
        "Of course, you're invited to join us, 800-989-8255 is the phone number, 800-989-TALK.",
        "Our e-mail address is talk@npr.org.",
        "And joining us now is Professor Robert Rotberg, who's director of the program on intra-state conflict and conflict resolution at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, the author of Why States Fail: Causes and Consequences.",
        "He joins us by phone today from Montreal.",
        "And, professor, very good of you to be with us.",
        "Delighted to be with you, Neal.",
        "And why should we care about failing states, other than, of course, the plight of the people there?",
        "Well, we should care about failing states because they're the center of conflict in the world, and the center of putting people down in the world.",
        "More conflict - the 15 million lives lost in the last 15 years have been mostly in failed states.",
        "So when a state goes down the tubes, its people suffer enormously.",
        "Is there concern that sometimes to describe something as a failed state is another definition of state we don't like?",
        "No, certainly not.",
        "Particularly my method is calibrated on even a quantitative measurement.",
        "States fail, not when we don't like them, but they fail when they stop serving their people with the performance of good governance.",
        "Do failing states present a global security threat?",
        "Of course they do; they represent a growing global security threat.",
        "We - Afghanistan was a failed state.",
        "Now it's on its way back, we hope.",
        "Lebanon was once a failed state and now is a strong state.",
        "There are - Sudan, Congo, Liberia, Sierra Leone were all failed states.",
        "Sudan and Congo still are."

        "And so we have to worry about those states that are slipping into failure too, particularly Haiti, Nepal.",
        "Papua New Guinea is next.",
        "The Solomon Islands are there back and forth.",
        "But Nepal and Haiti and Cote d'Ivoire are good examples of states which were once reasonably secure.",
        "And if we had watched them more closely we might have helped them stop sliding into failure.",
        "So the point of talking about failed states is that so that we can prevent failure and therefore prevent conflict.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)",
        "What I wanted to say basically had to do more with how you handle failed states.",
        "Number one, I think that if we're going to allow self-determination for countries, then we ought to view a failed state as an acceptable consequence, because some people are better in running countries than other people.",
        "So knowing that it's something that could happen, just like you know that a hurricane is something that could happen, I believe that world government organizations ought to develop a suite of tools and services where, if a state is failing, but they still have legitimate central government, that a world governing body can offer - like FEMA comes in after a hurricane - a world government body can offer a suite of tools and services that might help strengthen a central government.",
        "If it's determined that there is no legitimate central government, then maybe the world government structure could create a set of tools to isolate that country, arms embargos, economic embargos, carefully checking the visas and passports of being issued from that country to kind of cut down on terrorism and what have you not.",
        "But I really think that it ought to not be forced on a country to take these suite of tools and services, but they ought to exist so that if a country wants to take advantage of it it's something that they can use.",
        "Robert Rotberg, what do you think?",
        "Yeah, I mean it's important, just as the questioner says, that it's important to have these tools, but mostly to prevent conflict.",
        "And then if - and to prevent state failure - and then if the states fails, some of those tools are very useful to strengthen the state back where it can perform services for its people."

        "But, as I said before, the most important thing is to prevent these weak states from becoming failed states.",

        "David Bosco, is failure an option?",
        "Well, unfortunately, it is...",
        "Excuse me, we'll get your mic on in just a moment, thank you.",
        "Unfortunately, it is an option, and it's an option that some countries have taken, willingly or not.",
        "But it - just to go to kind of what I thought was a very important point about the suite of tools available.",
        "It -there is kind of an embryonic international system for dealing with failed states.",
        "I mean, we're talking about U.N.",
        "peacekeeping forces, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank.",
        "All of these institutions, you know, in varying ways and with varying degrees of effectiveness, try to go in and prevent failure.",
        "And so I think it's important to strengthen those tools, because often people unfortunately think about it as military intervention or nothing.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And there - that really is a shortsighted way of looking at it, because I think, as Professor Rotberg indicated, military intervention is a sign that things have really gotten to the point of no return.",
        "There are many, many tools, including just good, standard diplomacy, that need to be used before we get to that stage of intervention.",

        "I'll take my answer off the phone.",
        "Hard to define Pakistan, necessarily, as a small country, but we'll take his point.",
        "Professor Rotberg?",

        "That is to provide the security glue, without which you can't build back rule of law, economic opportunity, or provide state functioning, once again.",
        "So there is a surgical role for intervention, even if not a long-term role.",
        "All right, go ahead.",
        "Neal, if I could, I just wanted to - I think the caller pointed to something important, though, which is that major powers often have - I mean, if we look at the last century - have often intervened in countries, propped up military governments, or, you know, inserted puppet leaders to pursue their short-term national interests.",
        "And that has often had a very deleterious impact on the long-term stability of that state.",
        "And so I think it is important to recognize that states, great powers, in the way they intervene can often, you know, achieve some of their short-term goals, but have a very harmful, long-term impact on a country's stability.",
        "And Robert Rotberg, let me ask you about some of the tools that we've been talking about, in terms of the, you know, IMF and the World Bank.",
        "And people say that those are, in fact - some people in the world say those are, in fact, instruments that are used by great powers that run them, in fact, are not in the interests of the country's that they're being imposed upon, that this is, you know, contrary to their sovereignty."

        "If those don't work to straighten out the state, the one thing - the one instrument, which is too infrequently used is simply naming and shaming.",
