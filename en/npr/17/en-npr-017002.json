        "And your conclusion?",
        "Are they a threat to the United States?",
        "Well, the answer is that sometimes they are, but oftentimes they're not.",
        "And the example that's most often cited is Afghanistan.",
        "Afghanistan was clearly a failed state, there's no question about that.",
        "But, in fact, the instances in which a failed state poses a threat to the United States by actively and knowingly supporting terrorists, for example, are actually quite rare.",
        "And I'm struck by the discussion we've had, even today, talking about the Solomon Islands or Ivory Coast or Papau New Guinea.",
        "There, no doubt, are a number of horrible things happening there, but it's not true and not transparently clear to me and to my co-author Justin Logan that those kinds of things pose a threat to the United States.",
        "And if they therefore don't represent a threat to the United States, the United States interested in doing something about them?",
        "Well, first of all, I mean, U.S.",
        "Foreign Policy should be dedicated first and foremost to preserving our life and liberty here in the United States and our interests abroad, and that should be the primary object.",
        "And what is most troubling to us is the argument that fixing failed states should be at the centerpiece of U.S.",
        "foreign policy, and that's pretty much what the Bush administration said, as well as many others.",
        "It's gotten a certain kind of cache after 9/11, again, because of Afghanistan, but these ideas were circulating in the 1990s as well, going back to interventions in Somalia and Haiti and then later in the Balkans.",
        "The idea of nation building, which President Bush was initially not so enthusiastic about.",
        "Not only not so enthusiastic about it, he was explicitly quite disdainful of it and, of course, famously, Secretary Rice - who was then Condoleezza Rice as advisor - famously said that we should not have the 82nd Airborne escorting kids to kindergarten, which is a fairly straight forward argument.",
        "But I think most Americans are sympathetic to the notion that the U.S.",
        "military should be dedicated first and foremost to defending us and our security and liberty and leaving the fixing of failed states, even to the extent that it can be done, to other organizations, humanitarian institutions, NGO's, things like that.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "David Bosco, let's bring you back into the conversation.",
        "In terms of - clearly the Solomon Islands represents no threat to the United States, but what about this idea of nation building?",
        "You've been to Afghanistan, you've been to Bosnia, two examples.",
        "Yeah, well, I think nation building is a phenomenally difficult task, and in Bosnia, for example, you see that a decade on there still are international forces there.",
        "But it's something that can work and I think that kind of trying to turn nation building into a dirty word or dirty phrase is not something that's helpful."

        "And I think it's interesting that the Bush administration, I think, would've done better in Iraq and Afghanistan had they learned some of the lessons from the nation building experiences in Bosnia and Kosovo that I think Mr. Preble might have opposed.",
        "But in important ways those are quite successful operations and the idea - just because there're international forces still there doesn't mean that those have failed.",
        "That part of Europe was headed, for example, toward economic collapse, you know, there were refugees spilling out all over Europe, political radicalization.",
        "That has been stemmed because of effective intervention and effective nation building.",
        "Nation building through intervention is the last recourse, but it can be an important one, and I think the Bush administration should - instead of looking back disdainfully on that, should try to learn some lessons from those missions.",
        "Well, I mean, first of all, the explanation that the Balkans were slipping into chaos, there's no question about that.",
        "And the Europeans had a vested interest in doing something about it, just as the Aussies had a vested interest in doing something in the Solomon Islands and Papau New Guinea, just as the French, with a long history of involvement in the Ivory Coast, intervened there.",
        "So, again, this is about U.S.",
        "foreign policy and where U.S.",
        "foreign policy should be focused.",
        "But the Europeans - sorry - may have had a vested interest in intervening in the Balkans, but they weren't.",
        "And...",
        "Because we were actively discouraging them from doing so for a long time.",
        "Look, I mean, the notion that - it's brought up and we raise it in our paper - the notion that more effective nation building or attention to nation building would've helped things in Iraq - I think this is an important point, and that is, you must have security, first and foremost, in order to accomplish nation building.",
        "It is exceptionally difficult, even under the best of circumstances.",
        "And the kinds of security that you need and the size of forces that you need to stabilize a country the size of Iraq is truly massive.",

        "I was there in 1990, up to 1996.",
        "So I witnessed both the coming and the going of the UN and the American soldiers.",
        "And today, the Islamists took over an (unintelligible) 90 percent and defeated the alleged American-allied warlords.",

        "should respond to that?"

        "Okay, Somalia, clearly a case of a failed state by, I guess, anybody's definition.",
        "And I wonder if we'll have time for comments from both of you.",
        "David Bosco, why don't you go first.",
        "Yeah, I think Somalia's a - it's interesting to compare what's happening there right now with what happened in Afghanistan when the Taliban took power; because one of the kind of wrinkles in looking at this issue is that it's not just the state failure.",
        "It's often what follows on the state failure.",
        "The Taliban came to power because they could promise to the Afghan people that they were going to restore the country from chaos.",
        "And they were able to get a lot of support because they could say, look, you know, they are rapes and murders and total chaos.",
        "And so similarly, I suspect this group that's taken control of Mogadishu is promising much the same.",
        "And so it's not just the failure, it's what comes after.",
        "And when people have been radicalized and beaten down by state failure, they're often willing to accept government's that are repulsive and repugnant in many ways and could be quite contrary to U.S.",
        "national interest.",
        "Yet Christopher Preble, we all have unfortunate memories of intervention in Somalia.",
        "Indeed we do, and I think it does - it raises the point that you have to focus on what exactly is the nature of the threat posed to the United States; is it different from the threat that's posed by the neighboring states.",
        "And I don't disagree at all.",
        "The Taliban was, again, tragically - and it was seen by some as an improvement over what went before in Afghanistan, which says just how bad things were in Afghanistan.",
        "But it's not just a function of state failure, it's what are the intentions of the leaders and what are their aims.",
        "So, just leave it fester?",
        "No, absolutely not.",
        "I think that there are opportunities and there are initiatives that do not depend upon the United States first and foremost to intervene.",
        "I think the great mistake we made in Somalia, as well as other places, is again assuming that if the United States doesn't do it no one will.",
        "And that's, again, just simply not true.",
        "And we've cited - Professor Rotberg when he was on line, cited those cases himself.",
        "All right.",
        "We're going to have to leave it there, but thank you both very much for being with us.",

        "The good news is that many of its findings are already in the ground, incorporated into the repairs of the flood defense system.",
        "The bad news is that repaired sections are now the strongest part of the system, and that the New Orleans metropolitan area is still vulnerable to another storm.",
