        "Some say that's a pretty big leap.",
        "I think if you look at the definitions of those terms, it's pretty clear that the system was pretty much designed - built the way it was designed.",
        "There were some mistakes made…",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "…along the way.",
        "And looking backwards now, it's very easy to see those mistakes.",
        "But we found no evidence of any deliberate fraud or waste or abuse on the part of any contractors, or on the part of any government activity.",
        "What we did find was that the system was not designed conservatively enough to deal with a storm the size of Katrina.",
        "And I think everyone needs to understand that Katrina was - created the largest surge that ever hit the North American continent, and the largest waves measured by a NOAH buoy.",
        "So it was not a trivial storm.",
        "I know that's not an excuse for this performing the way it did, but there were 50 breaches that occurred.",
        "And all but four of those were due to overtopping and erosion that occurred from that overtopping.",
        "Now, the breaching was exacerbated by the presence of some materials in the levees that were not resistant to erosions.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "So that did dramatically increase breaching.",
        "There were four foundation failures that occurred prior to water reaching the design level, or the level at which the designers expected the eye walls to hold.",

        "Yes.",
        "The New Orleans area is particularly complex in that regard.",
        "There's very rapid and differential subsidence occurring there.",
        "What we were able to do in the task force was accelerate work that the National Geodetic Survey and the Corps of Engineers were already starting.",
        "And we were able to create a new reference and accurately measure the elevations of all of the structures.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "We did find very significant subsidence, sometimes up to three feet.",
        "We found that back in the early days of the system, there were some assumptions made concerning mean sea level and the local geodetic datum that were inaccurate.",
        "And that did result in some of the structures being lower than what was expected.",
        "Another set of assumptions involved the kind of storm that might hit.",
        "And there was a 1959 definition called an SPH, for Standard Project Hurricane.",
        "And in 1979, the report concludes the Corps chose to continue to use the 1965 and 1966 original definitions, even when they knew that they were inaccurate.",

        "The Standard Project Hurricane in 1965 was defined to be a 200 or 300-year storm.",
        "Today, it wouldn't even be a hundred year storm.",
        "And I think that demonstrates how volatile that kind of a measure can be.",
        "When the Standard Project Hurricane was upgraded by the National Weather Service in 1979, I think the Corps had the option of redefining the hazard, and going back into Congress and attempting to redefine the entire system.",
        "Or perhaps to put in place the protection levels that were already authorized.",
        "And then try to deal with the change in the definition of the hazard later.",
        "But I really would prefer that you - I think those were the two options.",

        "And this system was - this hurricane protection system, and there are actually four separate projects in the New Orleans area.",
        "But they were originally authorized in 1965, and not scheduled, really, to be completed until 2015.",
        "So this is an enormous span of time.",
        "The word review is used in the law.",

        "Lori Kehoe with the National Right to Life Committee says the law has been misunderstood.",
        "And a hurricane protection system is a series system, which means that it's only as strong as the weakest part of the system.",
        "And if parts of the system are incomplete, not constructed, if parts are lower than other parts, then they become the weakest part of the system.",
        "And the overall performance of the system is only as good as that weakest part.",

        "And why is that?",

        "Traveling these past nine months doing the New Orleans studies, I would routinely end up on an airplane next to someone from Kansas or other exotic locations.",
        "And they would ask why we're spending so much trouble trying to keep people in New Orleans safe.",
        "And the answer is because this is not a New Orleans issue.",

        "Mm hmm.",
        "Raymond Seed - thank you, Nicholas, for the call - Raymond Seed, let me ask you, although we just have a few seconds left in this segment, but does your report go on to address some of these questions as to why some of these mistakes were made?",
        "As Ed Link was telling us earlier, well, you have to ask the Corps.",
        "It does exactly that.",
        "There's two key differences between our reports and the recent IPET reports.",
        "One is we disagree on the few of the mechanisms at some of the key sights.",
        "And some of the differences are technical nuances, almost differences of opinion between experts.",
