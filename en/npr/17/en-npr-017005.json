        "Exactly.",
        "And this is not a condemnation of the folks that did the original design, because they didn't have a risk-based process to use.",
        "In fact, part of our study is developing a prototype risk and reliability analysis for hurricane protection systems.",

        "And is that - looking down the road - do you think that's a good idea?",

        "Mm hmm.",

        "Let me bring it up before our caller does: another part of the system which was vital to it and which also failed - not the Army Corps of Engineers' fault, necessarily - but the pumps inside of New Orleans, which the report repeatedly says were not designed to operate in a heavy storm."

        "Dams decay.",
        "Levees settle and they sag and they crack, and they constantly need attention.",
        "In addition, we do tend to keep updating the weather forecast.",
