        "So we have a need to be able to update these things, and right now, the Corps of Engineers doesn't have the wherewithal to do that.",
        "So the biggest thing we need to fix right now is the process.",
        "And I think the heart of that is fixing the Corps of Engineers and giving them back the ability to do this work properly.",
        "Ed Link, your report does address that point that the Corps of Engineers needs to do work to stay at the cutting edge of technology.",
        "Yes, it's hard to remain technically competent if you're not doing technical work.",
        "The Corps, as all federal agencies, has been challenged by that over the last couple of decades.",
        "It has become more and more difficult to do that.",
        "There has been a trend towards outsourcing work of - some of the results of that are very positive.",
        "And the government is served very well by the contractors that do a lot of this work.",
        "But there has to be a critical mass of that effort that goes on inside the federal agencies, if we expect them to remain smart buyers and competent at the technologies that they're expecting the contractors to use.",

        "I mean, they are there and they should oversee it.",

        "Yes, I do.",

        "Here in California, it works very differently.",
        "The California Department of Water Resources is a similarly massive agency with good capability, and they tend to bring their own consulting panels to the table.",
        "And so, the Corps in California operate on a very even basis out here.",
        "I think Louisiana needs to invest in some kind of similar system for their own behalf.",
        "Ed Link, at one point in your report, you do say that, you know, raising the levees higher was an option at various points.",
        "It was considered at various points, but objections were raised.",
        "Part of the problem with the business model that I referred to earlier is that it's very much economics-based.",
        "And we, in our report, we talk about the benefits of resilience, the ability of a levee or a flood wall, for example, not to catastrophically fail if it's overtopped.",
        "But resilience costs money, and local sponsors are responsible for paying 30 percent of the bill.",
        "And the federal government pays 70 percent of the bill.",
        "But the resulting design and construction ends up being a compromise of what people can afford.",
        "So when you want to add armoring or harden the structure so that if it's overtopped that it will not fail, it adds up to dollars.",
        "And sometimes that doesn't make it through the process, the decision process, because of those extra dollars.",
        "And that's a real barrier to creating system - hurricane protection systems that will, in fact, be resilient to the storms that we can't predict yet.",

        "My uncle works for the Army Corps of Engineers on the Mississippi - one of the Mississippi River projects back in the ‘70s, and I remember visiting him.",
        "And he had these huge maps on the wall, and explained to me about how the erosion of the wetlands, you know, was becoming a problem then because of the, you know, gasoline canals and natural gas canals and all that.",
        "I'm interested, I appreciate what the Army Corps is doing, you know, accepting responsibility for the failures of the levees, but, you know, I'm wondering if they're going to have any input into protecting the wetlands, you know, the wasting away of the barrier islands and whatnot.",
        "And, you know, everything that would normally protect from the storm surge is the reason the water got there.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "And I'm curious if they - you know, protecting the levees is one thing, but, you know, all that scoured land is, you know, if there's no project there, you know, that water's going to be continuing - you know, continue to come.",

        "That's all on the drawing tables right now.",
        "They're a number of studies moving forward, several by the Corps and several by Louisiana interests, which is a good mix.",
        "It's nice to have multiple opinions.",
        "But all those things are very much on the drawing table.",
        "We saw very clearly, in Katrina, the value of the wetlands - the open-exposed frontages that caused a lot of the damage in St. Bernard Parish and also in New Orleans East, came across open ground with no outpour of swamp protection, and the wave of attack was just ferocious.",
        "So the value of having the wetlands reestablished is pretty clear at this stage.",
        "And I think that's part of most people's long-term plans for overall improvement.",

        "Obviously, these reports, both of them, address the situation in New Orleans and Louisiana where the Army Corps of Engineers designed and built this levee system.",
        "There was also massive damage along the Mississippi Gulf Coast.",
        "There were no systems designed for that.",
        "Raymond Seed, is that something we should be thinking about, too?",
        "It is.",
        "We have a need to take a national inventory of risk and begin to address it in a more systematic basis.",
        "We're out of balance right now.",
        "There's a tremendous political disincentive to what I call prudent investment and prevention.",
        "It pervades our medical systems.",
        "We spend, I think, it's 17 percent of our GNP on medical costs, and if we would double the half percent we spend on prevention, we could decrease the overall cost by nearly half.",
        "It's a national issue.",
        "This law simply says a team must review it with her, if she refuses to have it reviewed, certainly, we accept that.",
        "But we don't believe there's anything in that law that forces a woman to listen or view it.",
        "We have all kinds of flavors of risk, and right now, we're particularly good at spending money to prevent terrorism.",
        "But terrorism hasn't historically been the principal cause of damage or loss of life in North America.",
        "And perhaps we need to have a look at the full inventory of risk and begin to allocate our resources more carefully.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "I'm not sure we - there have been a couple of callers and we're not going to have time to put them on the air, but Raymond Seed, let me ask you a final question.",
        "People saying, you know, I live in Napa, I don't trust the Corps now.",
        "Or is there reason for people who live near other big projects designed by the Army Corps of Engineers to worry now?"
