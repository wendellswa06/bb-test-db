        "Officials in New Orleans are about to start tearing down many homes, and it's the same story just down river in St. Bernard Parish.",

        "Surprising, certainly, for the UN.",
        "We've met the money target.",
        "We wanted at least $7 to $10 billion available per year by 2005 and we're right at about $8.3 billion.",

        "Most countries now screen blood for HIV infection, so the blood supply is reasonably safe throughout the world.",
        "Other signs that both prevention and treatment are increasing are all hopeful, and we're starting to see an impact on behaviors and on overall prevalence.",
        "In fact, in Africa there are six countries where we are able to measure declines over the last six years.",
        "So all this is good news.",

        "The elements of both prevention and treatment are in place.",
        "But we're not seeing the synthesis of a program.",
        "Some countries are doing extremely well in prevention and not well at all with treatment and vice versa.",
        "And it's that inability to have a comprehensive response that's effective that, I think, is very, very frustrating.",
        "There were a couple of alarming things that came out of this report that UNAIDS released.",
        "One was that the knowledge about how to protect yourself from AIDS was abysmal.",
        "There's a general assumption that if you live in a country that's been hard hit by AIDS like Botswana or Zimbabwe that most people know about it.",
        "They know how to protect themselves.",
        "They know about the sexual risk, and the infection can be passed from mother to child at time of delivery.",
        "What we've found is that no country in Sub-Saharan Africa did more than 50 percent of youth were able to answer very basic questions about how one could protect themselves from AIDS.",
        "That was extremely discouraging.",
        "And it shows that while the programs are there, they're just not doing a good enough job."

        "I mean, that's the frustrating answer.",
        "The money has increased dramatically.",
        "And when this declaration was signed back in 2001, the world was spending about $1.5 billion for AIDS in the developing world.",
        "We're not - We don't - We're not examining the higher income countries.",
        "We're now spending about $8 billion.",
        "So the money is getting out there, but the strategies just are not being put into place.",
        "Some of that has to do with just a lack of political commitment.",
        "We know what to do.",
        "We've got good evidence, as far as the types of interventions that actually are effective to delay sexual debut.",
        "We're able to monitor, for instance, how much of the population has sex before the age of 15.",
        "And we're seeing throughout Africa that there are some impact, and we are seeing delayed sexual debut because of programs.",
        "But it doesn't seem to be sustained, and the problem with AIDS is you have to do the same programs generation after generation after generation, as each group of young people move into sexual maturity.",
        "And there's this complacency that seems to erode AIDS programs.",
        "And it's happening in high-income countries like the United States and throughout Europe, too, where, if you let up, if you let down your guard and you don't pay as much attention to this epidemic, within two or three years, the infections start to creep up.",
        "One more thing that we're seeing that is disturbing and we don't completely understand is, we now, in fact for the last 12 years, have had a very cheap and simple way to protect a newborn infant from becoming infected.",
        "It costs about $1.",
        "It's essentially a dose of medicine for the mother when she delivers her baby and a dose of the medicine for the baby within 48 hours of being born.",
        "When this was -these studies were released, and this knowledge became well known, we naturally assumed that this would be a service that we could provide all over the world far more easily than providing treatment.",
        "And that has not been the case.",
        "In fact, many countries have done better offering treatment than they have offering this very simple mother-to-child intervention.",
        "And there's a lot of different theories about this.",
        "The biggest stigma - stigma is still a huge part of why we're not doing very well with this epidemic.",
        "And people don't want to be tested.",
        "Pregnant women don't want to be tested.",
        "They don't want to know if they are infected.",
        "They definitely don't want their family, their husbands to know.",
        "And because that -because the testing doesn't take place, then the infant doesn't get the drug and we have another infant with HIV infection.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So quoting Peter Piot, who said this week that 2005 was the least bad year in the history of the AIDS epidemic.",
        "You would say that that's mixed news then.",
        "I mean, the least bad year, but we still have a long way to go.",
        "Right.",
        "But we have - we have the elements in place.",
        "As I've said, we know what to do.",
        "The meeting that I'm attending that's happening right down stairs at the General Assembly, is reviewing this data and making a series of commitments for the next five years.",
        "In fact, for the next three years, setting targets for the year 2008 and 2011.",
        "So there is a momentum.",
        "And I think the fact that we're starting to see these positive glimmers will increase that momentum.",
        "And, again, this is - we need to change the way we're dealing with the epidemic.",
        "It's always been seen as an urgent, very crisis-oriented, we're waging a war, we don't have time to stop and maybe do it more with more quality or more intensively.",
        "We're making a transition from that.",
        "The train from this airport and the main East West S-Bahn lines are not running.",
