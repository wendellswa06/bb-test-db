        "I mean, there was an attitude in the United States at that time that the war was very distant, that just two decades earlier, the United States had gone into the First World War to help Europe clean up its mess, and this time there was a kind of nonchalance about what was going on across the ocean, a feeling on the part of a lot of people that it would be very possible for the United States just to ignore what was going on, to ignore Hitler.",
