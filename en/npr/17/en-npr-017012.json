        "Well that's right.",
        "He, Murrow understood, as few people had before him and maybe not that many after him, understood the impact of radio and later of course, television.",
        "When news came into people's living rooms, live and accompanied, not just by the - accompanied by sound and later by pictures, Murrow understood that when he could deliver stories about, say, an air raid on London and accompany those stories with the sounds of the sirens, the anti-aircraft fire, the bombs exploding, those stories would have much greater impact than just a newspaper story or a radio correspondent doing the equivalent of reading a newspaper story on the air.",
        "Yeah, and yes, he was later taken off the air, and later joined the Kennedy Administration as the head of Voice of America.",
        "Guy...",
        "That's right.",
        "And he died in 1965 at age 57.",
        "He was a four-pack-a-day cigarette smoker, and that's pretty much what did him in.",
        "And I think it was Senator McCarthy who accused Murrow of being Wobbly.",
        "So consider the source, if you would, Guy.",
        "Okay.",
        "Thanks for the call.",
        "An what would he have to say about what's going on nowadays?",
        "I mean, it doesn't seem like we have anybody that's in opposition to what's been going on.",
        "And I feel like this country's being run by the Nazis.",
        "And I'll take my comments off the air, thank you.",
        "All right, Guy.",
        "And I think, Philip Seib, it's impossible to know what Edward R.",
        "Murrow would think about what's going on.",
        "But the broader point about Guy is, I think, one of the points you're trying to make in this book.",
        "Well, I think that was part of it.",
        "For example, on the first day of the Blitz, he talked about the fires up the river had turned the moon blood red, the smoke had drifted down until it formed a canopy over the Thames, the guns were working all around us, the bursts looking like fireflies in a Southern summer night.",
        "Well, I think that, as you say, it's impossible to know what he'd say about a specific issue, but Murrow's tradition does live on.",
        "I guess one example that comes to mind is Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times, who has been writing very pointed opinion pieces for several years now about the crisis in Darfur.",
        "He's made it clear that he thinks the United States and the United Nations should become more involved."

        "Mm hmm.",
        "And I think that's very clearly in the tradition of what Murrow was doing.",
        "So although Murrow has been dead for more than 40 years, some of the principles that he stood for certainly are being carried on by other journalists.",
        "It should be pointed out, Nicholas Kristof, of course, on the editorial or opposite the editorial page.",
        "It's an opinion column and it's labeled as such.",
        "Right, right, that's right.",

        "But on the other hand, I'm here, I see certain things, and I want you to - I want to let you know just how things really are.",
        "And there's no doubt that his broadcasts were very pro-British.",
        "Here's an example.",

        "Plus, you combine that with the fact that he was always in the midst of the action, so it was exciting to listen to him as well.",
        "So I think that the combination of good language and just good aggressive reporting is what made Murrow such a prominent journalist at the time.",

        "Well, I don't think you want it in every story.",
        "But I - and I don't think Murrow used it in every story, but there are times when the story is so important that you want to use the full power of the language to convey the importance of that story.",
        "Just as Churchill was said to have marshaled and mobilized the English language to describe the war and Britain's war effort, I think Murrow was doing the same sort of thing.",
        "He was trying to give his reporting more power, and to increase its influence amongst his listeners.",
        "And I think he did that quite purposely.",

        "Well, they certainly did.",
        "It was still a fairly new medium.",
        "Just 20 years earlier, there were only 30 radio stations in all of the United States.",
        "And so the growth of radio was tremendously quick.",
        "And as that happened during the 1920s and 1930s, people really hadn't stopped to figure out exactly what its political powers would be.",
        "Now, there were some people who were very hot radio personalities.",
        "The politician Huey Long, for example, used the radio with some success.",
        "But people like Roosevelt, for example, in his Fireside Chats, realized that he was coming - he the politician, was coming into the living rooms of millions of his constituents.",
        "And he understood that when you get into somebody's living room, you don't shout at them, you talk with them.",
        "And that is something that Roosevelt and Murrow and to some extent Churchill all appreciated."
