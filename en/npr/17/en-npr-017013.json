        "Well, they both had the same ultimate goal, I think.",
        "And I think Roosevelt, early on, realized that at some point America was going to have to defend itself against Germany, and that it would be wiser to do so in alliance with Britain, rather than doing so after Britain had fallen.",
        "But he faced certain political exigencies during the 1940 campaign that he could not be too overt about that support.",
        "Murrow, on his part, was moving down the same path, realized the same things, but didn't' have the same kind of political pressures on him as Roosevelt did.",

        "You must have been just a kid at the time.",
        "Well, no. But I mean even when I got married, even in my 20s, when he was still doing stuff from the television, the beginning of television, you know?",

        "Eleanor didn't cook.",
        "The only thing she made for dinner ever was scrambled eggs, pudding, and milk, and so that's what the White House official dinner was that night for Eleanor Roosevelt and the Murrows.",
        "the president was in his study working through all this time, and when the Murrow's got ready to leave, Eleanor said to Ed that the president wanted to see him.",
        "So Ed waited in the hallway for awhile, finally got into see the president, was the only journalist to speak with the president that evening, and he went in to see Roosevelt and he said it was no question in his mind that the president had not known that the attack was coming.",
        "And the president also told Murrow that things were much worse in Pearl Harbor than the public had been led to believe.",
        "The president was particularly incensed about the fact that many of the American planes had been destroyed.",
        "They'd never even gotten off the ground.",

        "And Sevareid asked him, what did you find out?",
        "Right, and Murrow basically said it's real bad and kept on walking.",
        "And he never revealed that conversation until - the conversation with Roosevelt - until the war was over and Roosevelt was dead.",
        "Roosevelt had never said let's keep this off the record, but Murrow treated that conversation as a conversation with a friend and he also had a sense that, you know, great issues were at stake here, and he didn't just want to be running out and reporting what the president had said.",
        "He wanted to give the president more control over how the news was released to the public about this.",
        "And he was then offered a job in the Roosevelt administration and turned it down.",
        "That's right.",
        "He was offered a job working for the U.S.",
        "war effort, basically in propaganda, and interestingly - this is little known - the British had also offered him the opportunity to come and run BBC News.",
        "And he thought about that for a little bit as well, but then he ultimately decided that his best service to all concerned was to go back to London and continue his work as a reporter."

        "Let's say he had been persuaded by the Charles Lindbergs of the world that America first was the way to go, that involvement in the war was not the way to go.",
        "He was in a position of extraordinary power.",
        "He used it, and we now know - as you say in your introduction - that he was using it on the side of the angels.",
        "But he had extraordinary power, his to use.",
        "And it could have gone either way.",
        "Well, that's an interesting idea, and certainly, if Murrow had urged on the isolationists as opposed to supporting intervention, I think that would have had significant political effect in the United States, because there was tremendous debate going on.",
        "It would have put even more pressure on Roosevelt, and who knows how Roosevelt would have responded if the isolationist sentiment had been even stronger than it turned out to be.",
        "So, I think that underscores, again, the point of how powerful a journalist can be.",
        "I guess if you come a few years forward, there have been people who said that well, Walter Cronkite, during the Vietnam era particularly, had that kind of influence.",
        "Well, maybe so, but I think it's something that journalists should take to heart, that their words don't just disappear out into the ether.",
        "People do take them seriously, and they can have a profound effect on public opinion, and thus on politics."
