        "Unidentified Female #1: Okay, those who do not have ear pieces...",
        "Last weekend the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, or MOCA, ran out of amplifying devices for a tour of its show WACK!",
        "Art and the Feminist Revolution.",
        "The show documents work between 1965 and 1980 and includes well over 100 artists, several of whom were there for the tour.",
        "Many told stories of how their art was poorly received.",
        "Mary Kelly's piece, called \"\"Post Partum Document,\"\" which was displayed in London in 1976, is a detailed account of the first five years of caring for her son.",
        "And when I kept the dirty nappies, as they say in England - the dirty diapers here - it caused a huge outrage.",
        "Kelly says \"\"Post Partum Document\"\" and her other works on display, which use text and film, comment on the invisibility of women's labor.",
        "That try to understand what women's lives were like at that time and what it meant to look after children and the whole - all of the problems about domestic labor, for instance.",
        "Many pieces in the show explore the female body.",
        "While some of the work is no longer controversial, other pieces probe expressions of female sexuality so explicitly that they continue to provoke.",
        "Tracy Wolverton(ph), who worked with the Lesbian Arts Project in the 1970s, told the large group of people on the tour how they were very consciously using art to break down all kinds of barriers for women.",
        "One of the things that's so important to know about feminist art is that art and life were no longer these separate things.",
        "We were changing our lives as we were making the art.",
        "The MOCA exhibition has the sense of a sprawling romp through 15 years of exploration and inquiry into self - history, gender roles, sexuality, community, identity.",
        "That same exploration was brought to the materials and forums used to make art.",
        "There are collages, film and video documentation of performances, pieces that use latex, hair, rubber, mattresses, string, and there are traditional paintings and drawings that challenge the male point of view.",
        "Sylvia Sleigh, now in her 90s, remained a figurative painter throughout.",
        "But her piece \"\"The Turkish Bath\"\" stirred up controversy anyway.",
        "It's a satirical painting of male artists and critics in a bath depicted in the traditional way that women had been, as objects of desire.",
        "(Unintelligible) desire part is the object, which is not really nice, and I wanted to paint men in a way that I appreciated them and they were dignified and intelligent and nice people."

        "So it's a very vicious circle.",

        "They surrounded this Panjwai area.",
        "There was very heavy fighting for 10-15 days.",
        "There was literally hand-to-hand fighting.",
