        "There is an article in the journal Nature today that studies the speed at which irregular English verbs tend to become regular English verbs.",

        "Welcome to the program.",
        "Hello, Robert.",
        "And first, let's take the article on \"\"The Future of the Past Tense.\"\" The authors - Erez Lieberman, Jean-Baptiste Michel, Joe Jackson, Tina Tang and Martin Nowak - they come up with a formula about irregular verbs, how they tend to become regular and which verbs are more likely to change faster than the others.",
        "What is it?",
        "Well, the regularization depends on the frequency of word usage in the following specific way: The half-life of an irregular verb scales as the square root of its usage frequency.",
        "And I know that might sound a little confusing.",
        "Yeah.",
        "A little confusing.",
        "What it really means is the more rare a word is, the more likely it is that it will become regularized.",
        "And by regularized, in this case, we mean instead of it being - present tense, I know, past tense, I knew it - some people next to this one will say I knowed, and it hasn't happened to that verb yet.",
        "But they would say the reason it hasn't is because we say I know so often and I knew so often.",
        "That's right.",
        "And to take another example, the past tense of help was once holp.",
        "And now, of course, we all say help, helped.",
        "So that's a great example of a relatively common verb that actually has become regularized in the recent history of the English language.",

        "Yeah.",
        "We have a corpus of Old English, which is relatively small, a much more significant body of written work from Middle English and of course, a huge amount, an ever growing amount in Modern English.",
        "They looked at actually 177 different verbs across those different time periods in order to come up with this relationship.",
        "And help-holp, notwithstanding, the most common verbs in the English language - to be, to have, to go, to say - are irregular.",
        "They don't go past tense as with adding an -ed.",
        "So we use them so often, the old usage survives.",

        "I think anyone who's learned a foreign language will recognize that's the same in most languages, that we find the same thing in German or Italian or French.",
        "That verbs like to be, to have, to take, to go tend to be irregular - typically irregular in all those different languages.",
        "Now, the other article in Nature by Mark Pagel, Quentin Atkinson and Andrew Meade addresses a similar point.",
        "It's why is it that in languages that descended from Indo-European - words for some things like water or the number two are remarkably similar from one language to the next, while words for other things, like in animals tail, say, are quite different.",
        "And again, it's about which words are more common?",
        "Yes.",
        "So again, common words are resistant to change or resistant to replacement whereas uncommon words seemed to be rather easily substituted by new forms.",
        "Why does language change at all, that is, why are we not saying I holp or I used to holp, or why are we not all saying whatever the Indo-European word for a tail was?",
        "Well, I think that's really one of the fascinating, deep questions that both of these papers raise, but don't actually answer.",
        "The most traditional reason for language change is essentially an accumulation of error similar to what you might find in random evolution - in biological evolution.",
        "And now officials across the region are saying time's up.",
