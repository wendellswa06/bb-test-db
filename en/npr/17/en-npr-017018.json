        "The uncertain part is that the decrease in breast cancer incidence in women is also partly due to a leveling off and decrease in mammography.",
        "Women are getting fewer mammograms, and that means fewer breast tumors diagnosed.",
        "But presumably those cancers, or many of them, will eventually emerge.",

        "The new report, which is in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, has some other important numbers about lung cancer, says Dr. Tim Byers of the University of Colorado.",
        "The most striking thing about lung cancer in this report is the enormous variation between states in risk of getting lung cancer and dying from it.",
        "For instance, California has the nation's most aggressive program of tobacco control, and lung cancer death rates have recently dropped by nearly three percent a year there.",

        "I would not have imagined that we'd see a decline in cancer rates back in 1979 because the rate at which people were smoking was increasing, and all the things that people imagined would cause more cancer were going up.",
