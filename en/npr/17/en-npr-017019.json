        "The study found that for the entire group of participants, cuter creatures were associated with greater activity in brain areas involved in emotion.",
        "But people who felt more cute aggression also had more activity in the brain's reward system.",
        "So Stavropoulos says people who think about squishing cute little puppies appear to be driven by two powerful forces in the brain.",
        "It's not just reward, and it's not just emotion.",
        "It seems to be both.",
        "So both systems in the brain are involved in this kind of experience of cute aggression.",
        "The combination can be overwhelming, and scientists say that may be why the brain starts producing aggressive thoughts.",
        "The idea is that these negative emotions help people get control of the positive ones running amok.",
