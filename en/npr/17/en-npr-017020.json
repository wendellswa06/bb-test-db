        "Well, back to what the situation is now, we heard you say in your Senate testimony that, as you see it, the Pentagon has a strong incentive to rate people under 30 percent disabled because that way they limit their obligation to them to severance pay, rather than very expensive medical costs.",
        "Do you believe that that incentive was actually articulated to people who are doing the ratings?",
        "Did somebody say let's keep them low because we can't afford too many disabled vets qualifying for life-long DOD medical care, or did people just understand what the incentive was?"

        "But on the other hand, if you are above the 30 percent threshold in disability as determined by the DOD, the family is eligible for essentially health care.",
        "Now, that's a - there are co-pays, there are - you know, this is not - we're not talking free here.",
        "Right.",
        "So it just happens that the issue of disability coming out of the armed services collides with a broader question we're facing in American society, which is health insurance and who has it and who doesn't have it.",
