        "There were no negative consequences for the psychologist in this case.",
        "But there could have been, because in some states, there have been a few examples of cases in which psychologists, psychiatrists, other mental health professionals have faced similar situations and have made a judgment call to report, and someone decided that it wasn't serious.",
        "It wasn't imminent, and you violated the confidence of your patient.",
        "See, how do you know?",
        "That was my - of course, that was my next question, was: How do you know when it is an imminent threat?",
        "I mean, how do you make that decision?",
        "Do you have any guidelines that you would suggest someone follows?",
        "Well, I can say this: I've been in this field for 30 years, and most of my career has been spent as a forensic psychologist.",
        "And in my training and my experience, I'm constantly making decisions about whether someone poses a danger to self or others.",
        "But most mental health professionals, most psychologists, psychiatrists, psychotherapists have little-to-no training and little-to-no ability to make those kinds of judgments.",
        "That's part of the problem with these laws, is that we're imposing a duty where we really believe people can do what they can't do, and that is predict the future.",
        "I'm the person being threatened.",
        "OK.",
        "So the therapist called you to say that you were being threatened.",
        "No.",
        "About 22 states have laws on the book that are mandatory.",
        "Another dozen or so states have permissive laws.",

        "And they're generally the laws - whether they're written by the legislatures or contained in case law - they're fairly strict.",
        "They don't require someone to make a report unless there is a serious threat, an imminent threat, and a threat toward a specific person or persons.",

        "Right now we're talking about warning signs in cases of mass shootings, a therapist or a pastor who identified a potential threat and faced an often difficult judgment call, whether or not to violate the confidence in the name of public safety."

        "He wanted to be hospitalized, and the referring psychiatrist did not want to admit him.",
        "And I could see that this - and I knew the patient well enough that I knew he was going to do whatever it took to get admitted to the hospital.",
        "So it was just a matter of - you know, he sat down, we had a very brief conversation.",
        "He started getting loud, and I reached for the panic button under my desk, and he thought I was reaching for the telephone, and he grabbed the telephone and threw it at me and missed.",

        "I think that's frequently the case.",
        "The key, though, is - and he mentioned it - is notifying the patient up front before the relationship begins that there are limits to confidentiality.",
        "This isn't the only limit.",
        "He mentioned mandated reporters.",
        "For example, all professional licensed psychotherapists in every state are required to report reasonable suspicions of child abuse.",
        "So if a patient tells you about information that leads you to believe that a child's being abused or has been abused, all bets are off in terms of confidentiality.",
        "What I found in my practice when I was involved in that kind of practice was that's the best way to handle it, is to give the patient a laundry list right from the start, saying these are the instances in which there will be no confidentiality.",
        "And interestingly, like Roger, I found in my own practice that it really didn't make any difference in terms of what people revealed to me.",
        "I could tell someone if you talk to me about child abuse, I will have to report it, and people would continue to talk to me about child abuse.",
        "Or if you make a threat, I'll have to take some action to prevent it; they would still make threats."

        "It was - my father's client was the wife, and the estranged spouse was threatening to kill the wife's family, and my father was warned by the police, by the therapist.",

        "It is.",
        "Shortly after the tragedy at Virginia Tech, our firm won an award from the Department of Justice, the Office of Community-Oriented Policing Services, to develop a national model for threat assessment and then to teach that program to institutions around the country.",

        "What is involved in it?",
        "I mean, what is involved in making the assessment?",
        "Sure.",
        "So it's really about a process.",
        "It's a dynamic process that at the core, there's a well-functioning, well-trained threat assessment team that is responsible for receiving information about a member of the campus community that may represent a concern and obviously having the appropriate policies and procedures to then evaluate and assess whether an individual actually represents a threat to - either to him or herself or to the rest of the campus community.",
        "So it is a dynamic...",
        "Like what are the criteria?",
        "What are the criteria that would be used?",
        "Well, what we teach in the program is to focus on behavior.",
        "So if there is - if there is an individual who is exhibiting some behavior that you would - that any person would determine is abnormal, or concerning in any way, then we want that individual to bring that behavior to the attention of the team so that those trained professionals can assess whether in fact an individual represents a threat.",
        "And so let me give you a typical example.",
        "If you have a student that becomes increasingly aggressive following a bad mark on a paper and is continually coming back to the professor and, I guess, for a lack of another term, arguing about the particular grade and while not making a direct threat makes veiled a threat - veil threats toward that particular professor, saying things like, well, if you don't change the grade, then I'm going to have to do something else.",
        "Those are the types of behaviors that we would want to come to the team, so that they can then assess, number one, as Charles mentioned, is there an imminent-threat situation?",
        "Obviously, if there's an imminent-threat situation, all bets are off.",
        "We either affect an arrest if a crime has been committed or try to get that individual committed for psychiatric evaluation.",
        "In most cases of threat situations or concerning behavior, the individual doesn't make an outright threat.",
        "It's much more complex.",
        "So it's about the behavior that someone may be exhibiting over a period of time, or it may be about one particular situation that raised the ear or raised the concern of the individuals who witnessed this.",
        "And I guess, I'm wondering what kind of authority or power these teams have to really do anything because as I understand it in the Aurora case, you know, James Holmes' psychiatrist contacted the University of Colorado's threat assessment team, and then nothing was done because he dropped out of the school.",
        "I mean, where is the, you know, where is the power to do something once somebody approaches one of these evaluation and threat assessment teams?",
        "Sure.",
        "Well, I can't speak directly obviously to the case in Aurora.",
        "However, I will tell you that institutions wield considerable authority over individuals who are part of their community.",
        "So if it's a student, if it's an employee, there are steps that the team can take to, again, gather information - assuming that it's not an imminent-threat situation - but gather information about the individual, figure out what's going on, what's the situation in this individual's life that's causing them to come on the radar.",
        "So what is the concerning behavior?",
        "And in many cases, we're able to resolve the situation by either entering into a behavioral contract with the individual, getting that individual mental health counseling, all the way up to expelling the individual from the institution as an extreme example.",
        "Obviously, that's not the first option.",
        "What we want to try to do is get help for the individual so we can move them off of this path of concerning behavior and back into a path of becoming a valuable, contributing member of the university community.",
        "Steven Healy is managing partner at Margolis Healy & Associates, and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "We're going to take a call now from Kate, and she's calling from Columbus, Ohio.",

        "I went to the local authorities.",
        "They're, like, we can't do anything just based on a threat, and so I really felt pretty powerless.",
