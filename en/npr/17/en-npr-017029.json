        "There are a number of tools and resources at our disposal.",
        "One of the first that we work with individuals who may be the recipient of a threat is safety planning.",
        "So what safety planning can we put in place to, you know, set up a situation where the individual is not at risk, so the individual who's being threatened is not at risk.",
        "Again, if there's an actual threat and there's a Tarasoff warning being issued from a mental health professional, I believe that there are other options, and I think Charles can speak to that as well.",
        "But if there's an actual threat toward an individual, there are obviously criminal laws possibly that are being broken as well.",

        "You're in a situation where you've tried to get some help, and you haven't been able to at all?",
        "The good news is this individual has moved away, but during the time when this threat was imminent and there were two separate threats made that came to me as a Tarasoff warning from the therapist, I went to my local law enforcement and literally got no help at all.",
        "And so I actually got in touch with some retired law enforcement who talked to me about changing my daily driving habits, taking a different route to work every day, working with my boss to change my work schedule so it was much less predictable.",
        "I never drove straight to my home.",
        "I always drove a different way to, you know, go to other places immediately following work so that I was less predictable, but I got zero help.",
        "So you went and you found somebody who could help you, though?",
        "You had to be very proactive, you're saying?",
        "It wasn't...",
        "That's correct because I was scared to death.",
        "Yeah.",

        "And, Lynn, that's the type of safety planning that we would encourage, and I think that is in fact being adopted as law enforcement agencies become more sophisticated about threat assessment and steps that one can take to in fact protect themselves and to triage the offender or the individual who is of concern.",
        "And, Charles Ewing, just as we're drawing to a close, it just - one thing I'm coming away from this - with this, this is like a big gray area.",

        "Anyway, I guess the only other thing I would say is that with regard to callers, that it's not these laws are not duty-to-warn laws.",
        "That's sort of a misnomer.",
        "These laws require us in the mental health professions to take reasonable steps to prevent the harm from occurring.",
        "I can't think of an instance in which I or one of my colleagues has contacted the individual who's threatened directly.",

        "Those controls are the most ambitious measures thus far, aimed at shutting down Chinese hackers and companies stealing technology to get ahead.",
        "That theft is a key sticking point in ongoing trade talks between Beijing and Washington to resolve a nearly one-year trade war.",
