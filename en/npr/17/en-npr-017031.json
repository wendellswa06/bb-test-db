        "Jim Pasco, with the National Fraternal Order of Police says, there's no reason to frame that low percentage as a bad thing.",
        "He can't discard the possibility, however much it may disappoint him, that the reason there are only 18 prosecutions is that there were only grounds for prosecution of 18 cases.",
        "That said, Pasco agrees that post-Ferguson activism has not led to a big increase in prosecutions of police.",
        "The scrutiny by media and the ubiquity of social media certainly have added to the drumbeat of criticism of police officers.",
        "But generally speaking, I don't believe that's translated into a higher number of prosecutions because at the end of the day, prosecutors need provable cases."

        "So big cheeks, big eyes, small noses - all these features that we associate with cuteness.",
        "The study found that for the entire group of participants, cuter creatures were associated with greater activity in brain areas involved in emotion.",
        "But people who felt more cute aggression also had more activity in the brain's reward system.",
        "So Stavropoulos says people who think about squishing cute little puppies appear to be driven by two powerful forces in the brain."
