        "And we actually started meeting up outside of the gym, just having chats over lunch.",

        "And the sincerity of people who visit this place, the dedication would be similar to somebody who would be a Muslim and have the sincerity toward their own worship or place of worship.",
        "At the end of the day, what matters is the sincerity towards your faith and other human beings.",
        "And it's common across the faiths I think - across all faiths.",

        "I think it's good.",
        "I mean, especially in Australia where religion is not a common thing, I think Ali and I can probably both relate to each other 'cause we're not odd necessarily because of our faiths but just because we espouse any faith.",
        "And I think, you know, the attraction that it's gained is just a demonstration about how we've got two different religions and two different cultures coming together, which may have surprised people.",
        "But for us, it was really natural because we were able to draw on so many similarities and parallels between our lives.",
        "Obviously, this photo, this moment is coming at a sensitive time, definitely in the U.S.",
        "But around the world there has been a whole lot of scrutiny on Islam after the Paris attacks.",
        "Is that one of the reasons that you decided that this kind of exchange needed to happen?",
        "I think, look, not just before - not just because of the Paris attack, because of whatever is happening across the world after the war in Syria and so on, so forth - I actually got into the community work because of that purpose, because there has been a lot of fear about Islam.",
        "And there is a lot of misunderstandings about Islam because unfortunately, Islam's being represented by a few bunch of lunatics who are doing ridiculous stuff against other human beings.",
        "And I think majority of the Muslims who are - who are like everybody else and peace-loving and law-abiding didn't get a platform or didn't come out and get as much I guess media attention or publicity as the lunatics get.",
        "So that's why I decided to join the public life.",
        "And this is part of it, you know, to go and meet people and show them what Islam is all about or Muslims are all about.",
        "Ali Kadri and Michael Bennallack from Brisbane, Australia.",
        "Thanks so much for talking with us and sharing your story."
