        "And everyone's clowning.",
        "Everyone's joking.",

        "And I was just like, yeah, yeah, yeah; I saw my platoon sergeant get shot right in front of me.",
        "And I went, you know, into detail what seeing my father figure getting tore up by rifle bullets - what that did to me emotionally because the youth that asked me that question, right from my answer, goes into describe how his - he had to watch his two cousins get gunned down right in front of him.",
        "And that was something I had never felt before, to have such a young man so effortlessly describe the execution of his family members.",
        "It's interesting you say that because it's very much, like, inappropriate to ask someone who's been to combat - right?",
        "- like, that's - it's kind of insulting question in any other part of your life.",
        "Is it different - right?",
        "- because - I don't know - there's some recognition, I guess?",
        "I feel the question came from absolutely a place of innocence, really just wanting to know, have you seen someone get shot because these kids, before they're 16, have, in essence, really been to combat.",
        "I see the same levels of self-awareness with these kids when we're outside, just seeing how they're looking around.",
        "It peaks up right in me remembering - just having to check, like, my sectors, always feeling like I had to check my back when I came home from the war.",

        "He says he thinks the same thing almost happened to him.",
        "Me and my friend were walking.",
        "And I look back, and I see this one group of kids behind me, which was, like, two or three kids.",
        "And then I look across the street, and there's another group of kids.",
        "And I see the other kids across the street walking faster, so I'm like, I think they're so they can, like, get in front of us.",
        "So I told my friend - I was like, start running.",
        "So we started running, and they start chasing us.",

        "No one ever summed up the French Enlightenment by saying, I disapprove of what you order at the cafe, but I will defend to the death your right to order it.",
        "But what happened here shows there is a real connection between big ideas about freedom and small, casual acts of friendship and recreation.",
        "One person publishing a biting satire and another reacting to it over a bite at the bistro are two sides of the same coin.",
