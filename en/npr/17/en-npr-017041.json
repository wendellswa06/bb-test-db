        "New Bedford is the biggest commercial fishing port in America, and so we know what we're doing out on the water.",

        "Tony Alvernaz is a fisherman in New Bedford.",
        "New Bedford's been a seafaring city for how many years?",
        "How many centuries?",
        "And, so let's do away with that, let's bring on the wind farm.",
        "Is that the answer?",
        "I don't think so.",
        "Fishermen have been struggling to find enough work in recent years - as the government declared certain waters off limits.",
        "Alvernaz fears offshore wind will only put more fishermen out of a job.",
        "He wonders how they'll navigate around giant wind turbines to find healthy fish.",
        "Alvernaz says fishermen are already a dying breed, and he's skeptical offshore wind is their promised land.",
        "The older fishermen are basically retiring or whatever and they're - 50-60-year-old, they're not going not going to get into that industry.",
        "But, to be fair, city officials are already teaming up with local community colleges to find grant money that will specifically target displaced workers and help them find new jobs in the clean energy sector.",
        "And, just this month, New Bedford's Economic Development Council received funding to train low-income workers for jobs in the green market.",
        "All right.",
        "Will, what do you have for Laurie?",
        "Let's play.",
        "It would be because the main sort of design feature of the facility is that it should be possible to operate in silence; that is, no human surveillance, no power supply, no nothing.",
        "So within the very design, there is an expectancy that the Western civilization, or civilization as we know it today, will cease to exist within 100,000 years.",
        "Something else will come.",
        "So there will be oblivion.",
        "There will be no knowledge about nuclear power, no knowledge about radioactivity.",
        "So if somebody opens this facility, they won't know what it is, and of course the problem about radioactivity is that - cancer and so on, but you may only get that years after exposure.",
        "So it would be very, very difficult for future generations to determine what caused this at all."

        "Why did they decide to seal it up, as opposed to keeping it open and creating a society like we've talked about in this country, of caretakers who would always take care of it?",
        "This concept is called atomic priesthood, and it holds, of course, the problem that you would then need to maintain a kind of society of experts for 100,000 years, and these experts, of course, they would also have to have the knowledge about nuclear power even after the time of nuclear energy has ceased to be a technology, because we will have perhaps uranium for the next 200 years, and after that there'll be no more nuclear power.",
        "And this is expert knowledge.",
        "And of course if you have a special group of persons who can protect the rest of the society by their knowledge, there is the risk of corruption.",
        "We can protect you if - that's the big problem.",
        "Right.",
        "The movie is very eerie.",
        "It has elements, I think, of \"\"The Blair Witch Project,\"\" with you with a match in these tunnels, these really spooky tunnels.",
        "We know there's a danger around us, and we're not quite sure what it is.",
        "But also of \"\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\"\" We have wonderful classical music coming through the film.",
        "How did you get access?",
        "I can't imagine that these people wanted to let you access to their construction site.",
        "Oh, it was very difficult, and it took nine months of very tough negotiation with lawyers and so on just to get in there.",
        "This, of course, only happened after the company realized that we were actually going to make the film, to fund the film, because in the beginning they were quite open.",
        "Finland would prefer this building just to go on without any noticing because then it's much easier for them just to build.",
        "So it was...",
        "They want to set it and forget it.",
        "That's what they want to do, yes, and of course, that - if you really mean that, you have to be very, very certain that it works, it's foolproof for 100,000 years.",
        "But do they really mean it?",
        "Are they serious about this, or is this sort of a test to their own society?",
        "Because this hasn't been certified yet, has it?"

        "No.",
        "I think that a lot of the communication concerning such a facility is actually about the present.",
        "It's to convince the politicians that this, a facility like this will be safe.",
        "And the concerns about how to warn the future, I've never really gotten the actual company to say much about that, and this is why there are other people from other companies and other nuclear authorities in the film.",
        "But it's only people working directly with this facility who are in the film.",
        "And the lack of interest in warning the future can, of course, also signify an expectancy from the Finnish company that this waste will never go down there for that long, and it's also, I think, very significant to know that nuclear waste is not termed that way within the industry.",
        "It's called spent nuclear fuel.",
        "And there are still 97 percent of energy left in the waste, but if you start to re-process it, take more energy out of it, that's when you can also create bombs.",
        "But at a time in the future with scarce energy supply, it is perhaps a tempting thought to dig energy up in your own...",
        "Drill it down, open it up...",
        "Open it up, take it back.",
        "How do know that it's not all just going to turn into a puddle encased in concrete?",
        "Because you're talking thousands of years for the materials in there.",
        "There's a very interesting difference between the United States and Finland, because in Finland they're talking about 100,000 years; in the States it's one million years for the same type of waste.",
        "I don't know why there is this difference, but this difference shows, of course, that the scientist does not agree upon what is the timescale of the danger of this.",
        "But perhaps this was - in addition, another surprise for me in the beginning when I started to research on this - it's only scientists working with this.",
        "There are no other sort of cross-interdisciplinary discussions concerning this facility, and perhaps this is much more a moral question than a scientific question.",
        "Has the film been shown in Finland?",
        "Yes, it has, and it's going to..."

        "And the reaction to it?",
        "Well, the reaction has been a little bit like yours, that people, they get scared.",
        "And a person came to me and said I'm ashamed of my country that we are doing things like this without a proper public debate.",
        "But on May the 4th it'll be screened inside the Finnish parliament for the politicians.",

        "I mean, at the very least, the people who decide upon the use of nuclear power, especially under the argument of it being carbon-free and so on, they should be aware that the waste problem is not solved.",
        "No, no, and I think that it's very, very important to realize that the waste emanating from nuclear power, this time span of consequence is something new to mankind, and it was as such, as this phenomenon, something new for us, all of us, that was my initial interest.",
        "Do you think that scientists will find a way?",
        "Well, the scientists in the film, they say themselves that there are no solutions to nuclear waste.",

        "And that gets you worried even more as you watch the film.",
        "The way that you filmed it, did you want to scare people?",
        "I didn't want to scare people, but it was very important for me to say, to create a sensation that you were perhaps in the future watching back into the past when we were doing things like this.",
        "We have to imagine that if the main strategy is to let everything be forgotten, we could in principle one day dig a hole in the ground in New York City and find something, realize its extreme danger and have to evacuate the whole of the state - because nobody told you.",
        "And as you say, one of the big problems is, how do you make -how do you put markers around that will last for 100,000 years?",
        "That's a problem, and it's interesting to know that some of the same American scientists who worked on these - the Voyager space shuttles with these - this golden plate on the side, they are -some of these people are also working on some American studies on how to communicate the dangers around this facility.",
        "But in 1995, the Academy of Science was asked whether it is possible to, on a scientific ground, to say that it is possible to communicate to the future and it is possible to deter inadvertent human intrusion.",
        "And the question - the answer on that was, in both cases, no. It's not possible to, on a scientific ground, to guarantee this.",
