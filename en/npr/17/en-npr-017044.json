        "It didn't seem with all the clouds at the White House right now this would have been the best trip for him.",
        "Based on what we see, and certainly Hugo Chavez did not make it an easy trip for this president, is this just the nature of America today?",
        "We have always been seen, quite frankly, as the world's police, but it seems as though there are those more willing to stand up and push, as they see, the bully about.",
        "Well, Ed, I think you're right.",
        "The problem is that we are sort of blind to the fact that worldwide, there's a lot of resentment to America's global politics or domination militarily and the lack of concern for the Third World.",
        "And it is exploding all over South America.",
        "It's not just Venezuela but in Argentina, in Brazil, in Peru.",
        "We see the violence in France now among people of African descent.",
        "So I think it's a wake-up call that when people have a chance to express themselves, there's a lot of hostility toward this country for not being more accommodating, understanding different cultures and nations and in being a bully.",
        "And I think President Bush saw that with Chavez's incredibly energized speech at the stadium this weekend, and people are aware that America is not well-regarded around the world."

        "How do you sit down at the table to have serious discussions about a serious issue like trade when you really are distrustful over the person representing the heaviest weight in the hemisphere?",

        "And it's not just these countries, Ed.",
        "If you think back just a few years, the same effort by leaders of these African and very diverse countries blew up during President Clinton's era--that is, the whole Caribbean region was concerned about tariffs, the banana trade, for example, that people were saying, `If you want to talk about security in our region, the only way we can make a living is to help us to get our products out.",

        "There will be some who will say that this administration and political players in general in the United States have been so used to not having to look other places and to almost by divine intervention in their minds put down what they suggest is best for the world, i.e., best for America.",

        "Absolutely.",

        "In fact, he's come away empty-handed and now the White House is trying to play that down.",
        "But the bottom line is small though these countries may be, they are flexing their muscle and understanding that they do have something to offer and President Bush has got to pay attention to that.",
        "And let's not forget that they still have the backing of the World Trade Organization, WTO, who basically agree that we have a lot of limits on what people can export here to this country, particularly oranges and sugar and cotton, and they want some more balance."
