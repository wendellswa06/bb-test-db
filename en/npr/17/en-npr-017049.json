        "Another survey by the Consumer Federation of America found a similar story with sub-prime refinancing, as you mentioned.",
        "We spoke this morning to a senior researcher for the group, Patrick Woodall.",
        "Their survey was based on nearly 5 million refinanced mortgages made by 30 lenders across the country.",
        "In general, nationally, about half of African-American borrowers are receiving sub-prime refinance lending, 49 percent, compared to 23 percent of white borrowers.",
        "So African-Americans are twice as likely to receive sub-prime refinance mortgages as white borrowers are.",
        "And Latinos, a third of Latinos are receiving sub-prime refinance mortgages, which is a rate 41-percent higher than for white borrowers.",
        "These disparities are significant, and I think it's unlikely that they can be entirely explained away by risk-based factors.",
        "Woodall told us he thinks it's unlikely the lending industry would be so brazen as to view being African-American or Latino, in and of itself, as a risk, but he does say it certainly warrants a closer look at why and how this is happening.",
        "Well, how would you explain such a big jump since last year?",
        "Well, actually these studies don't make any conclusions about that, but the question does beg for an answer.",
        "There's something of a caveat emptor here, let the buyer beware.",
        "Mr. Woodall of the Consumer Federation did tell me that it seems some people are just getting caught up in what I guess you could characterize as the hard sell.",
        "Many borrowers are receiving sub-prime mortgages, perhaps more than necessary.",
        "Freddy Mac(ph) has found that one in five borrowers with a sub-prime mortgage could have received a prime mortgage, and that means that, you know, you have a fifth of borrowers getting high-priced credit that could be receiving low-priced credit.",
        "In other words, when you're looking for a mortgage, it pays to shop around, and don't just take it for granted that you're going to get the kind of rate that you're entitled to.",
