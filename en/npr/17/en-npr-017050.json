        "Where do things stand with that?",
        "If the president is recalled in the first four years of a six-year term then you have a new election, and you can have an actual regime change or an actual administrative change.",
        "If it's in the last two years then it goes to an appointed vice president.",

        "So this is something that creates a situation in which the government needs only to play for time and avoid those catalysts, because if they can make it to January 10, 2017, then Maduro could step down.",
        "But, prior to that date, Maduro stepping down means a change in ruling party.",

        "And it's interesting to point out that the moment that this happens - Francisco, a dual citizen with the United States, and Gabriel, a dual citizen with Spain - are moments in which conversations with the United States by Venezuela are picking up again.",
        "Thomas Shannon, the State Department representative, was there last week.",
        "And former President Zapatero from Spain is also very active in the Organization of American States analysis of Venezuela.",
