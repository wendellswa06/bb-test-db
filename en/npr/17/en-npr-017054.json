        "Is there anything that you found in your investigation that the NFL continues to deny?",
        "The Commissioner of the NFL Roger Goodell, when he's been asked about this, has continued to essentially downplay the connection between football and brain damage.",
        "He - when he's asked about it, he says, we want to let the medical experts decide.",
        "I think that the issue is that peoples are aware of it now.",
        "I don't really expect we're still going to see players dropping out of the NFL or even players necessarily choosing to give up football, although I do think that that is happening a lot at the youth level.",
        "My brother and I wrote a story several months ago for ESPN that showed that participation in Pop Warner at the youth level has dropped something like 10 percent over the last three years.",
        "But at the NFL level, I think that what it really means is we're going to see the NFL continuing to try to bring more safety to the game, while, at the same time, continuing to market a game that is inherently violent and brutal.",
        "They've been trying to walk that line, now, for a period of years.",
        "And it's an obviously difficult one because they're inherently contradictory.",

        "The news came as Fed policymakers were wrapping up a two-day meeting in Washington.",
        "But as NPR's John Ydstie reports that better number didn't prompt any significant change in Fed policy.",
        "There's no doubt Fed policymakers welcomed the news of faster growth.",
        "In the statement they released after their meeting they said the economy has the underlying strength to support continued job growth.",
        "The economy is pretty healthy out there.",
        "That's Blu Putnam, managing director and chief economist for the CME group.",
        "He says the 4 percent growth rate for the second quarter is confirmation that the U.S.",
        "economy is back on track.",
        "And despite the Fed's generally stand pat statement today, Putnam believes there's consensus forming at the Fed that it's time to normalize policy.",
        "I'm just suggesting that there's a core group in the Fed that I think is getting larger that just wants to exit anything that you might think of as an emergency policy.",

        "Right now the markets and most analysts expect the first rate hike to come sometime around the middle of next year.",
        "I'm more in the camp that they start to push rates higher early next year.",
        "And, says Putnam, the recent stronger job growth provides the Fed with a justification for raising rates sooner.",
        "But at the end of the day, if we're creating 200,000 plus jobs a month the economy's getting healthier every month.",
        "But while Fed officials acknowledge the improving labor market in their statement, they also introduce this new language, quote, \"\"a range of labor market indicators suggest there remains significant underutilization of labor resources.\"\" There's little doubt Fed chair Janet Yellen was instrumental in inserting that cautionary line into the statement.",
        "Yellen has been clear, says John Canally of LPL Financial, that she is looking beyond overall job growth and the unemployment rate to measure the health of the labor market.",
        "She looks at things like the amount of full-time workers to part-time workers - still way more part-time workers than average for this time in the business cycle.",
        "She looks at things like the median duration of unemployment - still way higher than it was before the downturn.",
        "These indicators lead Canally to believe the Federal Open Market Committee won't move faster to raise short-term rates.",
        "The majority of the members of the FOMC are probably in the same mode that Janet Yellen's in which is probably lower for longer.",
        "And the statement from policymakers today said again that they will likely keep their target interest rate at its current level, essentially zero, for a considerable time.",

        "That leaves Brazilians wondering if the end of Neymar's brilliant run in the tournament also means the end of the host country's World Cup dreams.",
