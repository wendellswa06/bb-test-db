        "All these things.",
        "And it just seemed like they didn't really - they seemed to be personally attacked by my decision.",
        "I was just wondering if your guest was - experienced any of that, and I can take my answer off the air.",
        "OK, thanks very much.",
        "Mr. Beavan?",
        "I think - first of all, I would like to talk a little bit about - like Jason, he was concerned about things so he decided to change his life.",
        "And when I took on this project, the reason why I did it is I know I'm political by nature.",
        "I have a lot of political opinions.",
        "And what I've done up until now in my life is pointed my fingers at other people.",
        "We should have laws that tell other people what they should do.",
        "There should be laws that say you shouldn't drive an SUV.",
        "And I finally realized that I should look at the log in my own eye before the speck in other people's eyes.",
        "Not that I'm very religious, but I'll take wisdom from where I find it.",
        "And that's the basis of this project.",
        "The idea is that instead of me figuring out what everybody else is doing wrong about the environment, I want to look at my life and say how am I contributing?",
        "So first of all, I think it's really neat that Jason did that.",
        "And second of all, Jason, I'm sure there's a lot of people out there that support what you did, too, because a lot of people support No Impact Man.",
        "Another practical question occurs to me, Mr. Beavan.",
        "Now you will only eat stuff that's generated from, what, 250 miles from where you live, right?",
        "That's correct."

        "Now I'm indebted to this line of inquiry to Michael Collins - Michael, forgive me, Pollan's latest book, \"\"Omnivore's Delight\"\" where - and I'm paraphrasing now - but I believe he makes the argument that, for example, let's say a good New York State apple that comes to you in Manhattan from 120 miles away might actually produce more carbon emissions because of the trucks that are necessary to get it into Manhattan than does an apple that comes to you all the way from Chile, because the one in Chile, of course, is shipped in great volume.",
        "There's more than one argument than the production of carbon for eating locally.",
        "For example, there's the whole question of being able to talk to the farmers directly and ask them how they produce their vegetables and to say, you know, do you use herbicides?",
        "Do you use pesticides?",
        "There's also the issue of keeping good, open farmland around our cities.",
        "So it's important to -for me to support these farmers so that they can make a living and don't have their land overrun by housing estates and one thing or another.",
        "So the whole eating - the issue of eating local is not just about the carbon impact, but a whole bunch of environmental issues taken together.",
        "I want to take a call, and maybe hold it over if we can.",
        "Jason, in Fairbanks, Alaska?",
        "Yes, hello.",
        "Hi, there.",
        "I gather you have some experience to contribute.",
        "Yeah, there - yeah, I really want to commend your guest.",
        "I think it's very critical that we think about our impact.",
        "Now, but what I've read on a little slip that's been provided to me about you, Jason, is that you've tried to have a subsistence life yourself there in Fairbanks.",
        "Yeah, I live a little ways out of Fairbanks in a little tiny cabin and get around with a dog team in the wintertime.",
        "And I moved up here from the lower 48 and basically chose a different lifestyle, and there's quite a number of people who live up here that live this way.",
        "Hmm, Jason...",
        "The old fashion way."
