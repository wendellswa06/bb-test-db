        "Well, as the study goes, my understanding is that there was a study done in the '80s, and it wasn't just about the cleaning.",
        "You know, it was about - it had to do with the production of the diapers and, you know, it was called the lifecycle analysis, which is supposed to analyze the, you know, from the beginning to the end.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But the thing about it is is my understanding about that study is that these lifecycle analyses are very sensitive to variables.",
        "So, for example, you'll notice on disposable diapers that they generally have an instruction in small print that says that the human waste is supposed to be disposed of in the toilet, and then the diaper itself should be sent into the trash.",
        "And when this study was done that showed for - that suggests that plastic diapers were no worse than cloth diapers, they - in the study, they did put the human waste in the toilet.",
        "But the fact of the matter is most people, when they use disposable diapers, don't do that.",
        "Another thing that happens is cloth diapers, for example, can be used for more than one child.",
        "They're very durable.",
        "You use it with one child, and then you use it with the next child.",
        "Another variable that was in that experiment was the use of diaper cleaning services, which assumed diesel trucks were driving the diapers all around, but if you wash the diapers at home, it's different.",
        "So my feeling is that as long as you are sensible about how you do things, that the cloth diapers win hands down.",
        "But do cloth diapers take a lot more time, a lot more care?",
        "And not everybody in their life - practically speaking, we have so many people living, including yourself, two-income households - has that kind of time.",
        "It's true that it takes a little bit more time, especially at the beginning.",
        "But let me tell you a story about Isabella, my little girl.",
        "When we were switching at the beginning of the experiment from disposable to cloth diapers, we still had some disposables around, and we weren't so good at the pinning and all that.",
        "We're much better now, and…",
        "Oh, God, all it takes is one mistake to have a real drama on your hands.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",

        "Anyway, when we were first - so occasionally, because we had disposable diapers left, we'd put one of them back on her, and Isabella would cry, no, I want real diapers, I want Bella's new diapers, new diapers, because - I guess because she was so much more comfortable in the cloth diapers.",
