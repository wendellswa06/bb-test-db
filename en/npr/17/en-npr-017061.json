        "This is an important paper because it gives us one of the first insights about how bacteria play a role in affecting disease states in people.",
        "And, Braun, says it could open the door to learning how microbes play a role in other diseases.",
        "Other diseases are thought to be driven at least in part by bacteria - other inflammatory diseases, certain autoimmune diseases, and even traits like obesity.",
        "So this gives us, really, a different perspective about these bacteria and how we should come to understand them better and live with them, when they're helping us, or get them to serve us better when they are causing harm.",
        "The next step will be to try to figure out exactly how to manipulate our microbes, to better diagnose and treat Crohn's disease and other health problems.",
        "Rob Stein, NPR News.",
        "The messy rollout of the online exchanges has given fodder to Republicans who are determined to make the health care law an issue in the 2014 elections.",
        "And that worries many Democratic lawmakers, including a handful of incumbent senators in battleground states.",
        "As NPR's Ailsa Chang reports, these Democrats are now calling for a extension of the law's open enrollment period.",
        "It might be hard to find a senator more obsessed with how well healthcare.gov is running than Democrat Mark Begich of Alaska.",
        "He says he goes on to the site once or twice every day.",
        "He'll even poke around while flying from Alaska to D.C.",
        "using in-flight Internet.",
        "Begich has already enrolled his brother in Nevada and he's almost done enrolling himself, and he says he likes to call the White House a lot when he notices annoying things about the website.",
        "I joke with the White House all the time that I'm their beta tester senator.",
        "I'm constantly sending them notes, ideas on how to improve the website.",
        "So Begich says it was a no-brainer for him to ask the White House to extend the open enrollment period for every week the exchanges haven't been working.",
        "The consumer did not cause the problem with the website.",
        "Why should they get penalized?",
        "Why should they have a shorter time to enroll when they did not cause this problem?"

        "But while Begich says his request was motivated by a sense of fairness, others say politics are at play.",
        "He happens to be one of five Senate Democrats up for re-election in 2014 who called for delaying the enrollment deadline in a letter to the secretary of Health and Human Services.",
        "These Democrats are in Republican-heavy states: Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who wrote the letter.",
        "She told CBS delaying the deadline is a way to support the healthcare law.",
        "My goal is to fix the Affordable Care Act, to make sure people can get that access to health care.",
        "Unlike a lot of the proposals that we've seen from people whose goal is to repeal it, to make sure it doesn't work, I want it to work.",
        "But the move may also be a way for Democrats in more conservative states to earn easy political points, especially at a time when Republicans are highlighting the technical mess by running ads against vulnerable Democrats right now, like this one from the National Republican Congressional Committee.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I was so incredibly moved by this piece.",
        "I've - for a long time, we've covered tremendously, in The Daily Beast, the whole plight of Afghan women.",
        "And it's a terribly sad story about how in western Afghanistan, the desperation and misery of women is such that they have taken, in greater and greater numbers, to setting fire to themselves.",
        "What is happening in Afghanistan that would cause more women to be this desperate?",
        "Well, it's a very interesting question as to why.",
        "They have become something of a kind of rounding error, frankly, in the talks about what to do about Afghanistan.",
        "The president really never mentions women.",
        "Secretary Clinton has campaigned very fiercely for the greater empowerment of women, their education.",
        "Goldman Sachs actually has launched this incredible program, Ten Thousand�Women, in fact.",
        "And I actually hosted something with them the other day for two amazing young Afghan entrepreneurs who, in the face of all these things that they have to confront, have nonetheless become entrepreneurs.",
        "We had a 25-year-old woman who was running a construction company with 75 people working for her.",
        "And her whole city is reigned by the Taliban.",
        "And she just somehow manages to run this business.",
        "So the place is full of these kind of women who are fighting against all odds to get their independence, to try and make a life.",
        "And I think the desperation of some of these women in these rural places, who feel no exit, they see nothing for themselves except to make this protest, which is the only independent thing they can do, set fire to themselves, which is an incredibly sad thing."

        "You know, she's, in ways, been written off slightly as a kind of luxurious creature who played a siren to all these powerful Caesars.",
        "But, of course, her use of luxury and her use of splendor was very much about power politics.",
        "And she understood that when she appeared in Tarsus - her first meeting with Mark Antony - she arrived on this incredible barge with purple sails and nymphs fanning her.",

        "She said it was a mood-altering city of extreme sensuality and high intellectualism, the Paris of the ancient world, superior in its ways, splendid in its luxuries, the place to go to spend your fortune, write your poetry, find or forget a romance, restore your health, reinvent yourself or regroup after having conquered far swaths of Italy, Spain and Greece over the course of a Herculean decade.",
