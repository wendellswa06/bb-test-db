        "So far, it's not making money, but its popularity has surged.",
        "In just nine months, one and a half million students from 196 countries have enrolled in its courses.",
        "Daphne Koller believes that in five or 10 years from now, people are going to look back and wonder why universities ever crammed 500 students into an auditorium to listen to a lecture for an hour and a half when they could just watch it online.",
        "But I think it's important to also remember that the role of physical institutions will still be important because there's still certain aspects of that experience that we can't currently replicate in an online format - that serendipity, that miraculous discovery that happens when people randomly get together and talk creatively about new ideas.",
        "All right.",

        "So our students are not getting degrees from our partner universities.",
        "They're getting education, which, I think, is a really important and valuable thing to get.",
        "And I think while degrees have a really important place in one's educational trajectory, we need to remember that one's progress towards a degree lasts maybe the first four or six years of your adult life and then you go off into the world and work on your job.",
        "And the world around us is changing so quickly that one's education can't stop when you finish getting your degree.",
        "But if it is going to be seen as an anachronism to shove 400 kids into a lecture hall, then why wouldn't Coursera be a place for people to earn a degree?",
        "So I think there is going to be perhaps more and more of the degree that is taken in an online format, but I think there is still a tremendous value to a university education.",
        "What do you mean by more and more of the degree?",
        "So one of the big motivations for the universities that are working with us and engaging with us is the fact that they want to open up more time in the curriculum for meaningful interaction between faculty and students and between students and their peers.",
        "And so if you can take the lecturing part and move it out of the classroom, all of a sudden, you've opened up room for a much more interactive engagement that can happen in the classroom - what's going to be called the flipped classroom model.",
        "In other words, the students would watch lectures online and then you would just go to class to interact with the professor and have a discussion.",
        "That's right.",
        "You could work together in small teams on active problem solving.",
        "And there's multiple educational studies that show that this is a much better learning experience than just sitting there passively listening to a lecture.",
        "Let's talk about money, because this is a business plan, essentially.",
        "And you've got millions of dollars of venture capital behind Coursera.",
        "So presumably, there are people who want to see a return on that investment, how will you make money eventually?",
        "So one idea that we've explored is to charge for certification.",
        "You can charge a modest amount for, say, a certificate, but then you can go and present to an employer or perhaps to an educational institution to get some kind of transfer credits.",
        "A second is by working with employers who are looking to close a skills gap.",
        "Because even though there is rampant unemployment in many parts of the world, there are still large numbers of jobs that are going unfilled because employers are having a hard time identifying people with the right set of skills.",
        "And so by matchmaking between students who perform well in certain courses - with their consent only, of course - and with employers looking to hire such people, you can potentially make a win-win situation for everyone and then employers would basically help support this effort."
