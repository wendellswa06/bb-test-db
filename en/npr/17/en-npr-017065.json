        "What's with all the secrecy?",
        "Car washes, Laundromats, supermarkets, big box stores, TV stores.",
        "And because of that summertime residency, all those numbers are off.",

        "National Office for Harmful Algal Blooms agrees.",
        "We very conservatively say this is about $100 million a year impact to the U.S., and that's just the marine side of the picture.",
        "The freshwater estimates are in the billions, and a lot of that comes from the decrease in property value from water that looks just noxious and green and slimy.",
        "But you can also have toxins produced by these algae.",
        "And those toxins can kill fish and sea birds and whales and make humans very sick, and even can kill humans.",
        "For people who don't have waterfront property, though, or care much about going to the beach, should they care about algae blooms?",
        "That's one of our dilemmas is that for some part of the country, they don't see the impacts that others are feeling, even though they may actually be partly responsible.",
        "But at the same time, I think most people do appreciate that we have a country with these marine and freshwater resources that we need to protect.",
        "And some farmers are reducing their impact.",
        "To see how they do that at the source, we went out to a model farm owned by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, which educates farmers in the watershed about their impact on the bay.",
        "Farmer Michael Heller knows about the dangers of fertilizer runoff, and he showed us some of his efforts to reduce nutrients from going into the bay.",
        "We're just - we're about 18 miles from the White House, which is quite remarkable when you sit out here, and it's nothing but peace and quiet.",
        "And we're about 15 miles from the Chesapeake Bay.",
        "Michael Heller manages the Clagett Farm in Maryland.",
        "We hopped in his dusty pickup truck and started up a gravel road.",
        "We are driving through the heart of the farm.",

        "At the edge of a rolling green field, about 20 cows were lolling about in the August heat in the shade of some old trees.",
        "We headed over there.",
        "Heller explained that this is where any solution to water quality issues must begin.",
        "And I think this is the most important point we can make is every part of the farm is important for runoff.",
        "Too often, the focus is right at the streams, but it's what's happening up in the fields that is most critical.",
        "Heller says that at poorly managed farms, livestock often endanger watersheds.",
        "Herds of cows erode the ground, and that leads to soil runoff.",
        "The runoff then gets mixed in with nutrient-dense manure and fertilizer, and that stuff eventually makes its way to the Chesapeake Bay.",
        "But at the Clagett Farm, nitrogen-absorbing legumes are bound and cows are moved around from pasture to pasture to maintain fresh fields.",
        "And fencing always keeps the animals away from the streams.",
        "Down at the bottom of the hill, Heller showed us how all the layers of filtering fit together.",
        "So here, you can see we've got two strands of electric fence on our left and a beautiful pasture field with nice lush grass.",
        "And on our right - well, just below the fence, we have a farm road, so this would be a grass buffer.",
        "But just off the road to the right, we have another 30-plus feet - about 30 to 40 feet, it varies - that is woods.",
        "And that's where we're headed, into the woods.",
        "We'll see how intrepid you really are.",
        "Let's see if we can cut right through here in these trees.",
        "The forest is dense, and Heller puts his hand right down into the ground.",
        "Look how rich that is.",
        "It's a sponge that's not going to allow any nutrients or water to run off.",
        "So by the time that droplet hits the stream, it has little or no sediment in it and very minimal or no nutrients, so that what we're sending down to the Bay is a positive thing for the oysters and the crabs.",
        "And, of course, that means it's a good thing for the watermen.",
        "Heller says that the key to clean water health is a holistic approach."
