        "What about the other option, working around Karzai?",
        "We have not taken seriously the idea that Afghanistan is one of the most highly decentralized countries in the world, and there's a lot more that we can do to channel assistance as well as funds into local government structures and indeed in traditional structures that are closest to the problem and therefore often know best how to most effectively spend the money that comes their way.",
        "Sounds promising, but if you work around the central government, don't you undermine the central government that you intended to support?",
        "Well, in fact, I think that working around the government is ultimately going to be one of the strongest ways to support that government.",
        "The legitimacy of that central government does not depend on its ability to control everything, because it can't.",
        "The legitimacy of that government depends on the people getting basic services, and when the Afghan people have greater security, have greater justice and great access to resources, they will be much more comfortable with the role that the central government plays.",
        "And so I think we need to do more to figure out how to put the Afghans in a real leadership position in the next two years so that the decisions that they start to make about their own country are truly their own and that the risks that they take are also their own.",

        "And a fascinating statistic is that we hear all about the Taliban burning down schools.",
        "The National Solidarity Program has built hundreds of schools with local labor and local decision making.",
        "And of all of those schools, in some of the most difficult areas of the country, only two have been attacked.",

        "Exactly.",
        "Local ownership equals local protection.",
        "And so I do think that this idea of really giving the Afghans a greater stake in what's happening right now actually ends up with them really owning the problem much more, which is ultimately what we need to see happen.",
