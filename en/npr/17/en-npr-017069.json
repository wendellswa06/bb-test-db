        "For the first time in Nepal's history, the constitution for this country will not be handed down by the king or written by some wise men, but it'll be written by men and women of this country who have, so far in the history, never been counted.",
        "But this moment's also about something else, about a trend that was once unthinkable but was evident among those crowds two years ago.",

        "Same type.",
        "We're a go.",
        "Now, under pressure from the Maoists, the interim government's decided that the first order of business for the new assembly - the one about to be elected - will be to get rid of Nepal's monarchy.",
        "There have already been official moves to airbrush out Gyanendra.",
        "For example, the word royal has been cut from the name of the national airline, and the new national anthem includes no reference of allegiance to the monarch.",
        "The monarchy is actually responsible for not allowing industrial development to take place, not allowing any organization to take place.",
        "That's Hisila Yami.",

        "Supporters of the king argue that the future of the monarchy is such an important issue that it should be decided by a public referendum.",
        "They also believe that abolishing the monarchy is only the first step in a Maoist plan - a plan to turn Nepal step-by-step into a communist state run along the lines of North Korea.",

        "There are families with babies, old women with walkers, and lots of middle-aged men in torn clothing and dirty blankets.",
        "I don't know if it captured the imagination of the Victorians, but that certainly captured mine, that notion of cultural transvestitism.",
        "And this book that he publishes, the sort of diary of his exploits, make the rounds, and by 1848, he is approached by a representative from the East India Company, at the time, one of the most important, if not the most important, multinational corporation in the world.",
        "The East India Company says to him: We need you to go back to China and hunt up some tea for us.",
        "They wanted really good tea stock from the very best gardens in China, and they also needed experts.",
        "They needed the Chinese to go to India to teach the British planters, as well as the Indian gardeners.",
