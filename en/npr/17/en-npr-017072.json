        "Elmendorf left the Hill.",
        "He went downtown to be a lobbyist and strategist.",
        "Now he's fielding calls from lobby shops, corporations and law firms, all of them eager to hire Democratic Hill staffers with experience and connections.",
        "There's not enough supply for the demand out there right now.",
        "But as some top Democratic aides on Capitol Hill pack their Rolodexes and relocate to K Street, there's one big thing they have to keep in mind - the revolving door law says they have to wait one year before they can lobby their old colleagues.",
        "The law has some bite.",
        "In fact, it's one of the laws that's sending Ohio Congressman Bob Ney to prison in the Jack Abramoff scandal.",
        "But it's difficult to impose a waiting period on everything.",
        "Waiting periods almost never come up in our work.",
        "Beth Solomon is with the executive search firm Christian and Timbers.",
        "Firms in the private sector want to attract very high-level people, and they're not going to wait around for a year.",
        "So they hire them.",
        "And, oh yes, there's a waiting period, but I think there's also an understanding and an expectation that activity is going to take place that is within the limits of the law."

        "At the same time, we don't want them to be in a position where they're saying, you know what, I can really feather my bed and make a lot of money by having this job for a couple years and then trading it to some firm that will pay me double what I'm making now.",

        "Well, the most pessimistic kind of price increases would be on the order of about a four to $5 per barrel price increase as a result of this disruption.",
        "That's, you know, sort of in the range of gasoline price increases we've been seeing lately.",
        "That's not going to translate into, you know, too large of a price increase.",

        "Well, fortunately, this is roughly about a half a percent of world oil production.",
        "And there certainly is sufficient - if you like - excess capacity in terms of the production, particularly in a number of the Middle East countries that could, you know, make up that slack.",
        "There's also the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which contains roughly 700 million barrels.",
        "And so if the United States decided to tap into that, that could certainly, you know, mitigate any of these kinds of price increases.",

        "What effect would that have?",
        "And now, really - not just to California, but nationally?",
        "It would certainly work against any sort of price increase by simply increasing the amount of oil that's available.",
        "And it makes a lot of sense to tap on the reserve at the moment, because certainly this is probably the highest prices will be.",
        "But if, you know, the thought is that further disruptions are likely, then it may not be the best time to tap.",
        "Does the fact that the government is considering opening the Strategic Petroleum Reserve show that this is pretty serious?",
        "I think it's more of the appropriate response to manage - if you like - market expectations.",
        "It's that it would probably be not the best for prices if the government says nope, we're not going to even consider tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.",
        "You might trigger some sort of further response in terms of storage of oil and the like to further raise prices.",
        "So just simply the talking down the price is just saying that you'll consider it, and hopefully that's going to calm the nerves of the oil traders to prevent the price from rising further.",
