        "That's not true.",
        "The first case that went national, that I was involved in, was the killing of Michael Griffith in Howard Beach in 1986.",
        "And that was young white men who killed him with a baseball bat when he was biking.",
        "Right.",

        "Right.",
        "Ran him in front of a car, I'm sorry.",

        "He was run over.",
        "And when his family got in touch with me, we began a series of demonstrations and we were successful in getting a special prosecutor who in turn did convict people for that death."

        "People come to civil rights organizations because they are seeking help, one, to expose their problem, and B, to stand up and put pressure on the system for them.",
        "I'm sure that the reason - Howard Beach 20 years later, we just had the case of Glenn Moore, who was beaten up in Howard Beach and there was just a conviction in New York on that about a month ago with Fat Nick.",
        "The reason his parents came to me, probably, is because if you look at Howard Beach, one, or Bensonhurst, or Abner Louima, or any number of cases that we got involved, we successfully put pressure on the system and got some measure of justice.",
        "So I guess people go to people that they, one, see have a track record, and two, fill the needs of what they are looking for at the time.",
        "Now, part of your track record, and you know it better, I would say, than anyone else, is that you've been charged with being everything from an ambulance chaser in terms of cases like this, to Reverend Soundbite.",
        "Why do you think that you get that sort of reaction from some people, including people in the black community, when earlier civil rights activists never seemed to get tagged with those sorts of criticisms?",
