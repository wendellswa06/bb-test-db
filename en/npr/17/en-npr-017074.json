        "He is appealing to people to please take this disease seriously, saying it is very dangerous, and he's also telling people not to kill the birds themselves but to wait, to box them up in their pens, give them food and water and wait for the government workers to come and dispose of them.",
        "And $300 a month in that part of the country, I would imagine, is the difference between prosperity and poverty for a lot of people.",

        "And I was in one house where a girl had a very sad look on her face as her chicken was being taken.",
        "She had named some of the chickens, and the World Health Organization says that's why it's being transmitted to kids.",
        "They play with these birds, they pet them, and that makes them much more vulnerable to this disease."

        "The differences show up in what are called markers.",
        "These are places along the chromosomes that vary among the individuals - think of flags along the railroad track.",
        "Finding a marker associated with a disease indicates you may be near a gene that's involved in that disease.",
        "Since we inherit one chromosome from each of our parents, each marker comes in two copies.",
        "Chris Amos led one of the three association studies being published in the journals Nature and Nature Genetics.",
        "He's at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.",
        "Amos says his group found a marker on chromosome 15 that was clearly associated with lung cancer.",
        "If you inherited one particular copy of this marker, your risk of lung cancer went up 28 percent.",
        "And if you have two copies of the markers, then you're at about 80 percent increased risk over someone that have no copies of these variants.",
        "Amos says the two other studies - one from France and the other from Iceland - found nearly the exact same thing.",
        "Now, this region of chromosome 15 where the marker sits is home to several genes that control the way the body responds to nicotine.",
        "So the presumption now is that nicotine itself or metabolite of nicotine is increasing one's risk for having lung cancer."
