        "In an unusual display of warmth, reporters applauded Snow as he stepped into the briefing room.",
        "(Soundbite of applause)",
        "And the man who usually spars with journalists at those daily briefings returned the gesture with praise for the reporters."

        "Tony Snow will stay on the job through Friday, but he's handed over the daily press briefing to his successor, Dana Perino.",
        "Snow is resigning, as he says, to make some much-needed money on the lecture circuit, and possibly write a memoir.",
        "He's also battling a recurrence of colon cancer.",
        "Snow spoke with us this afternoon, and since he's still technically the press secretary, I asked him if the president's speech tomorrow night is meant to brace the U.S.",
        "for a long-term presence in Iraq despite the plan to withdraw up to 30,000 by next summer.",
        "I hate to, sort of, play cat and mouse with you, but it's what I've been doing with the rest of the press.",

        "Nobody is talking about 160,000 frontline combat troops for the next 10 years.",
        "But having said that, I think he sees diminishing numbers as you get increased capability among Iraqi fighting forces.",
        "But, again, that's what General Petraeus was laying out for Congress.",
        "We're going to have to let the president announce what his policies are going to be, and he will do that tomorrow night.",
        "Now, anyone who watches the presidential briefings knows that the job of the White House spokesman is - or spokeswoman is always very difficult, but you had a particular tough run, defending an increasingly unpopular president and an unpopular war.",
        "Has the president and have you, to some degree, lost an important commodity - the public's trust.",
        "The idea that you're telling true…",
        "No, I don't think - no, I don't think so.",
        "I mean, I hate to day it but the public trust in journalists is far lower than it is in presidents.",
        "I think you looked at it this way.",
        "This actually isn't a hard job; it's a wonderful job.",
        "And I came here because I believed in what the president is doing.",
        "And knowing that a war is unpopular in a time like this, I think there is a general suspicion about the nature of politics.",
        "It's certainly been visited on, Democrats and Republicans alike, in unhistoric low ratings of congressional approval.",
        "And, you know, I think what you do in a time like this is you continue to do your best to address the problems honestly and as best you can.",

        "You know, I love it.",
        "I love the briefings.",
        "It is so much fun.",
        "So I go into a room of very good reporters and I have the responsibility for talking about the president's policies and what's going on, and doing as much as I can to answer questions.",
        "But, for instance, a lot of people want to know about tomorrow night's speech, I'm not going to tell them anything about tomorrow night's speech.",
        "It is of necessity, kind of a cat and mouse game that we're going to play for the day and a half.",
        "They understand that."
