        "It's invigorating, it's interesting, it's exciting.",
        "And at the same time, it's also a chance to really engage with people I've known for a very long time, and people who are going to be my friends, who aren't my friends before I came here, they're my friends now, they're going to be my friends for a very many years afterward.",
