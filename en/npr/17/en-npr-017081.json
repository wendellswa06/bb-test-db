        "The analysts think recent economic data - like a drop in the unemployment rate to 7 percent, and a budget deal in Washington - have brightened the outlook for the economy enough that the Fed can pull back.",

        "You can think of these as the deposits that banks hold at the Federal Reserve, which is a bank for them.",
        "But unless the banks lend those deposits or invest them, they don't get into the economy, they don't enter the money supply, and they don't contribute to inflation.",
        "But if banks aren't lending, there's no boost the economy, either - which after all, is the Fed's main goal.",
