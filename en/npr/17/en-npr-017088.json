        "Am I right?",
        "Isn't the story of Rwanda since then something incredibly positive?",
        "I mean, it's a peaceful country, it's been stable, grappling with this history.",
        "And there are even reports of victims or the families of victims living next door to people carried out some of the attacks.",
        "I mean, that's extraordinary.",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "I've talked to many people with human rights groups and people who study Rwanda, particularly after the genocide.",
        "And they say, one of the reasons that there has been this relative stability for so long is because the Rwandan government has tried to deliver accountability.",
        "They've gone after people responsible for the atrocities, even those who played an insignificant role.",
        "And yeah, there are a number of accounts of people who have done their time, asked for forgiveness, and gone back to live into their communities.",
        "I find this remarkable, you know?",
        "I talked to one man after the genocide.",

        "No, nothing to do with daylight savings time.",
        "They should be getting longer.",
        "Well, that Japanese - the giant 9.0 Japanese earthquake shook up the entire planet, and it shifted the Earth's axis, yeah, shortening the day just a teeny-weeny little bit.",
        "According to the U.S.",
        "Geological Survey, the earthquake shifted some global positioning stations, you know, GPS stations in the country, and one near the epicenter.",
        "The one near the epicenter moved 13 feet.",
        "Wow.",
        "To put it in another way, Japan is wider now than it was before, said one USGS scientist."

        "And you could tell from the GPS, things around the countryside that you have placed around there?",
        "Yeah.",
        "There's a worldwide network GPS receivers that we use that continually monitor how the Earth is rotating.",

        "That's 1.8 millionths of a second.",
        "One-point-eight millionths of a second - not something we really going to notice, but I would imagine to scientists, that's an important number."

        "Yes.",
        "The Earth's rotation changes all the time.",
        "The length of the day changes mostly in response to changes in the atmospheric winds.",
        "And these winds - the effect of the winds can be 500 times larger than this effect of the earthquake.",
        "And we need to account for these changes in the length of a day at JPL because it affects how we navigate spacecraft to planets like Mars.",
        "Huh.",
        "And what other things affect it?",
        "You know, I know we have melting glaciers and water sloshing and things like that.",
        "Would that also affect the rotation?",
        "Yeah, it certainly does.",
        "Anything that moves mass around will, in principle, affect the Earth's rotation.",
        "But in order for it to have a measurable effect, it has to be a lot of mass.",
        "So changes in the atmosphere, changes in the oceans, melting ice off Greenland, all of these can affect the Earth's rotation.",
        "And what about the axis?",
        "Was the axis tilted any?",
        "Yeah.",
        "So, the Earth rotates about its rotation axis, but the mass of the Earth is not balanced about that axis.",
        "If the mass of the Earth were balanced about that axis, it would spin very smoothly, just like a well-balanced tire on your car spins smoothly.",
        "But the Earth - the mass of the Earth is not balance about its rotation axis, and so it wobbles as it rotates, just like an out-of-balance tire on your car vibrates as it rotates.",
        "And it's that axis about which the mass is balanced is what shifted during this earthquake.",
        "The earthquake rearranges the mass of the Earth, and therefore the figure axis moved by about six-and-a-half inches.",
        "So it's like somebody moved one of those little weights on your tire when they bang it in with the hammer?",
        "Exactly.",
        "And it's the global displacement of the mass of the Earth that was important for the Earth's rotation to change.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And what kind of instrument - you mentioned the space probes that NASA might send.",
        "Tell me about what kind of - what's out there now and what kinds of things might be affected.",
        "Are these things that are far away, near, you know, circulating Saturn, or are they stuff that's right near the Earth, here?",
        "Well, every satellite that is launched to the planets like Mars or Saturn or asteroids, when we navigate those planets, those spacecraft, to make sure that we target - you know, accurately approach the target body, we have to account for these kinds of changes in the Earth's rotation."
