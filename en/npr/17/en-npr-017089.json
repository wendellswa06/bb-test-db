        "And why do you favor merit-based admittance?",
        "Well, there's no question that our current immigration system is out of whack with our national interest.",
        "The National Academy of Sciences recently found that our current system is a fiscal drain for taxpayers to the tune of tens of billions of dollars every year and also displaces Americans who have less schooling from the job market.",
        "So - meanwhile, immigrants who do have education and skills and who are sponsored by employers are not a fiscal drain in the same way.",
        "So you know, when you look at our system, we're getting - two-thirds of our legal immigrants are coming because they were sponsored by family members and only 15 percent who are sponsored by employers.",
        "It's clear that if we were to change that mix by reducing the number of family-based immigrants, as has been proposed in recent legislation and - possibly that gives us the opportunity to increase the number of skill-based visas within the overall limits that we have now.",
        "That would be much more helpful.",
        "In the interest of time, let me follow up with a couple of points in which you raised.",
        "Firstly, of course as you know, there are other studies that show the economic strength that immigrants provide the United States.",
        "And the other I'd ask - isn't it only humane - isn't it one of the features that makes America great to let families be united?",
        "Don't we have an investment in that, too?",
        "Well, we do have a very large family-based immigration program.",
        "Certainly, nobody is proposing that we, you know, not let people sponsor their spouses.",
        "But that's a lot of people.",
        "What we're talking about is perhaps getting rid of categories like the one for siblings of U.S.",
        "citizens, which is a more extended family reunification program.",
        "Not many other countries have that, and that's the one that's most backed up now.",
        "But that's not...",
        "We also have a visa lottery which...",
        "That's not one of the features that makes America what it is?",
        "You know, when you look at the numbers, what the National Academy of Science has found is that there are too many immigrants that we're admitting who are not self-sufficient.",
        "And we don't strongly enforce the part of the law that says you need to be to be an immigrant.",
        "So there are a number of ways where we could make our immigration policy less of a fiscal drain and serve our national interest better.",
        "And I think by cutting the numbers and rebalancing it so more come in because of their skills, that would be something that would strengthen our immigration program and people would be more supportive of it.",
        "I - you've made that point.",
        "Let me get to one last question, if I could.",
        "President Trump cited Canada as a model of merit-based system, but several news organizations and the Canadian Council of disabilities have pointed out that Stephen Hawking wouldn't be permitted to immigrate in Canada under their system because it does not admit handicapped and disabled people.",
        "Do you want that for the United States too?",
        "Well, a merit-based system needs to focus on education and skills, but there is also room for immediate family members to come as well.",
        "Canada's point system really contributes only about 15 percent of Canada's annual immigration now.",
        "It used to be much higher.",
        "It's all in, you know, how you set it up.",
        "And we need to be more nimble in our immigration system and look at the outcomes of our immigration policy the way Australia does and be ready to change it if it's not meeting our needs, particularly our economic needs."

        "She says it's easy to measure a day from space.",
        "You can, you know, identify a mountain or a stone or whatever it is and just check how long it takes it to come back and that will be, you know, one day.",
        "For these really great earthquakes, stations close to the source of the earthquake can move many feet like that, many meters.",
        "Of course, the motion gets much smaller as you move farther away from the source of the earthquake.",
        "But even a few thousand kilometers away, you can still have displacements of a millimeter or so.",
        "Well, you know, that's how mountains get pushed up, right?",
        "We have these earthquakes, these tectonic events - a little 13 feet here, a little 10 feet there, soon you got the Himalayas.",
        "That's right.",
        "Over time, all of the small displacements caused by earthquakes build up, and that's how mountains form.",

        "It's just amazing to think about how many it must have taken to throw up these giant mountains, how long of a period of time, and how many different earthquakes must have happened.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, the tectonic plates that make up the crust of the Earth have been moving for, you know, millions, even hundreds of millions of years, causing these mountains to grow.",
        "Now you've done a computer model on this.",
        "How can you verify that it's correct, your calculation?",
        "Is there any way to do that?",
        "Yes.",
        "We can look at the GPS measurements we have of the change in the Earth's rotation and try to see if we can detect what I calculated the earthquake should have caused.",
        "And this will be a bit challenging because it's a small signal, and there are these other mechanisms like the atmosphere and oceans that cause much bigger changes in the Earth's rotation.",
        "So we'll take the observations and we'll remove these larger effects due to the atmosphere and oceans.",
        "And with any luck, we'll see this smaller signal caused by the earthquake.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "This is NPR: SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "I'm Ira Flatow.",
        "And we're talking about the earthquake and what it did to the rotation of the Earth.",
        "Have there been bigger ones than this that have shifted the wobble and the axis and stuff on the Earth?",
        "There have certainly been bigger earthquakes on the Earth.",
        "In fact, the largest earthquake that's been recorded was in 1960 in Chile.",
        "And I did a similar calculation for that earthquake, and according to my calculation, it should've changed the length of the day by about eight microseconds.",
        "Is it?",
        "Wow.",
        "Is there any way you can run your computer model backwards to see, you know, past histories of where the earthquakes might have happened or the wobble may have changed eons ago?",
        "Well, I use seismic information for how the faults looked during the earthquake."

        "Right.",
        "So there's - so I need that information to do my model.",
        "And so I can only run my model on the earthquakes that I have that information, which only spans about the last 30 years or so.",
        "And so your model doesn't have any predictive value about predicting when we might have another earthquake?",
        "Oh, no, of course not.",
        "This is - this model just computes consequence of the earthquake on the Earth's rotation.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "There must be an awful lot of data that scientists have been collecting on this earthquake.",
        "Yes, that's right.",
        "Japan is one of the best-instrumented countries in the world as far as seismometers and GPS receivers go.",
        "And so this is one of the best-recorded earthquakes.",
        "And hopefully, by analyzing all of this data in the future, we'll have a better understanding of how really great earthquakes like this occur.",
        "And maybe we - somebody, some place puts this data together and might see a precursor that might have hinted - tell us when to expect another one.",
        "That is one of the things that the scientists are certainly looking at.",
        "With having such a wealth of data from this earthquake - not only during the earthquake, but before and after - they'll certainly be looking for those precursors.",
        "And a quake like this, even though you talked about it moving, you know, Japan's just a little bit wider, does it move to the other -does the crust up on the other side of the earth change, also?",
        "In principle, it will, but by such a small amount that there's no hope of measuring it.",
        "You can measure the changes up to maybe a few thousand kilometers away, but that's about as far as you'll be to see the displacements."
