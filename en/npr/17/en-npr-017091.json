        "If you want to understand, you know, giant planet formation and the origin of the solar system, these 10 minutes or six minutes are actually quite crucial.",
        "So Helled and her colleagues set out to make a better estimate of Saturn's day.",
        "They measured the planet's gravitational pull, combined that with estimates of the core's density and did some very tricky statistical analysis."
