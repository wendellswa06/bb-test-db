        "Well, I've thought about this: You know, what would it be like to be on an Eocene beach and see one of these guys come ashore?",
        "And they're pretty distinctive.",
        "These giant penguins have quite elongate, prominent beaks.",
        "And, of course, their size is striking.",
        "Would you immediately recognize something that's twice the size of a living penguin and had a different beak morphology and was differently colored as a giant penguin on first seeing it?",
        "I think - I'm not sure we would've.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "What color - it was five feet tall, right?",
        "And what kind of coloring did it have?",
        "Well, the coloration - we've been able to map color for parts of the flipper and some of the body feathers.",
        "So what we've been able to determine is that a reddish-brown coloration is supported for the underside of the wing, and a gray tone on the leading edge of the wing, and that some of the body feathers that we have also yield support for a reddish-brown coloration.",
        "The thing we don't know is exactly where on the body these body feathers would have been from.",
        "So was the animal dominantly reddish-brown, or did it have -was the gray on the wing carried up onto the body to make it sort of half and half?",
        "You know, those are questions we still don't know the answers to.",
        "And where did this penguin live?",
        "The penguin is from Peru.",
        "Our fossil site is in what is today the hyper-arid sort of northern extent of the Atacama Desert, about four hours south of Lima.",
        "And it was discovered in sediments that are around 36 million years old.",
        "So obviously, it was not desert at that time, when the penguin was around.",
        "Well, there's some debates.",
        "Some data supports longevity, you know, some kind of desert in that region for a very, very long time, just due to patterns in circulation, essentially, that would've been relatively stable over most of earth's - you know, recent earth history."
