        "So this is our first sort of glimpse of early penguin feathering.",
        "We've had no other fossils to tell us how the distinctive shape of penguin feathers, how the feathered flipper of living penguins evolved.",
        "And this was our first chance to look at that with new fossil data.",
        "You must have renamed this penguin by now into something a little more easy.",
        "Oh, you mean, do we walk around in the lab and saying how is Inkayacu paracasensis today?",
        "Is that...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah.",
        "You must call it something else, right?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, for most of indeed, for most of this penguin's -you know, since its discovery to the latter stages of its description and, you know, for publication, it was called Pedro.",
        "My Peruvian colleagues and expedition co-leader, Rodolfo Salas, named it after a Colombian telenovela, which is like \"\"Pedro El Escamoso,\"\" \"\"Sleazy Pedro.\"\" So it was named because one of my Peruvian colleagues, a student, Aliat Morano(ph), found the penguin by first seeing that it had soft tissues on the foot, like scaly patterns.",
        "And so he very, very early on got the name Pedro, and that stuck around.",
        "Do we think that Pedro evolved into the modern penguin we have today?",
        "Well, what paleontologists are fundamentally looking at when we have glimpses of these extinct animals is branches from the penguin tree of life.",
        "So we're never really - we don't we think it's pretty uncommon we would discover, you know, a direct ancestor.",
        "So all of these guys are twiglets off this penguin tree of life, and they're telling us what the pattern, the sequence of evolutionary changes was in the evolution of penguins."

        "Like, did penguin flippers evolve early and penguin coloration later, you know, as we found new fossils.",
        "So...",
        "Yeah.",
        "So we don't know if this is one that decided to put that black-and-white tuxedo on.",
        "It could've been a different branch of that tree.",
        "Well, it's quite possible that the, you know, there was quite a diversity of penguins in the Eocene, you know, early on in penguin evolution.",
        "There's a lot of species diversity.",
        "We have our first look at one of those.",
        "So it is impossible that tuxedo-like coloration would have been present in other early penguins?",
        "We can't rule that out.",
        "But what the data we have now suggests that, you know, at least there was a range of colorations in these early penguins outside of the range we see in any living penguins alive today.",
        "So...",
        "Anyplace we can see this on exhibit?",
        "Is it available to see anywhere?",
        "Or...",
        "Well, if you go to Peru, there's going to be an exhibit at the Reserva Nacional Paracas, and there will be a life-size model of Inkayacu there in the exhibit, so - organized by my Peruvian collaborator, Rodolfo Salas.",
        "So that's if you head to Peru.",
