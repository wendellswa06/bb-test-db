        "I'm sure the folks out there that sell those things are going to disagree with me but, you know, everyone has their own opinion.",
        "With that being said, if this is a wake up call to the coaches who deny their players' water as a punishment, if they feel they're going to get more motivation out of the kids because they're going to hold that from them, that's just a bygone era.",
        "We try and make water available to our kids.",
        "In fact, we build it into the practice schedule, five minute intervals and between each station or in between each individual drill, water is in there.",
        "We also have water bottles there during practice so that if a kid is not taking wraps, if we're running the second team or the third team, the first and the second can be getting water.",
        "I just - I hope this doesn't open the door because even though we've taken these steps and these precautions at our practice, we, too, have seen kids succumb to heat exhaustion.",
        "We actually had one instance of heat stroke where we had to rush the young man into the shower, strip him down to his shorts, immediately get as much water on him as we possibly can while running the cold shower on him to lower his core temperature.",
        "And did that - did that revive him?",
        "Did that…",
        "Thankfully, thankfully, this young man, you know, was fine the next day.",
        "We held him out of practice because we wanted to make sure.",
        "But if there are any high school students that are listening, if there are any high school coaches that are listening who have not yet received the message and have not internalized it, water during practice is maybe 15 percent of the intake that they need.",
        "The kids need to know that after practice, before practice that night, even when they're not thirsty, they've got to prepare their bodies for the rigors of the next day by getting as much water in them as possible."
