        "Tom, let me ask you something, and I wanted to ask somebody close to this and that is, how did this become - I gather that this has been part of, I guess, what you might call football culture to withhold water either as punishment or motivation or - that's been there for a while.",
        "But you said it's now a thing of the past now but...",
        "I certainly hope it's a thing of the past.",

        "I'm thankful I went to a school that's, you know, the coaches made sure that, you know, that was never a punishment.",
        "You know, making practice start a half hour earlier in the day if kids are late, that's an appropriate punishment.",
        "Making it so if someone cuts in line during lunch time, they go to the end of the line, that's an appropriate punishment.",
        "Conditioning is an integral part of the training to prepare these young men for the game field.",

        "I have not heard of a story like this and I know there's a lot of speculation at this point, but witnesses have come forth.",
        "They've spoken to the Courier-Journal and it seems clear on the surface at least, this is sort of part of the bad old machoism of football and you should never ever deny water to your players, and on the surface, this is an incredibly disturbing story.",
        "Water is being denied, the 911 call may have taken as long as 25 minutes after the player collapsed.",
        "Under these conditions, it sounds like the coach was pissed off.",
        "He was pissed off at his players and under these conditions, I think the indictment is appropriate.",
        "This harkens back to the days of 1930s and 1940s when Bear Bryant, when he was the coach of Texas A&M, took 50 players down to Junction, Texas and only 17 survived.",
        "And at that point in time, you were never given water.",
        "You know, it was all part of the machoism of the sport but it is now a given.",
        "And to me, it all goes to the absolute access and out of control nature of sports and high school sports in this country.",
        "You know, I have often wondered even before this, you know, sometimes on a hot summer day, at the end of the summer, your driving past the high school, you see these kids out there in the terrible heat.",
        "And I've always wondered why, why do they have to do that at this point on a day like this?",
        "Why do they have to be practicing on a day like that?",

        "When I wrote the book, \"\"Friday Night Lights\"\" about Permian High School, I mean, on a Friday night, it might be 75 or 80 degrees temperature.",
        "So they are trying to toughen up, but even at Permian which had enormous accesses, I mean, they have players who were given injections of pain killers during half time, had players who had broken bones, purposely never x-rayed because if they were x-rayed by a doctor and there was a broken chip or broken bone, they won't be allowed to play.",
        "But even Permian would not deny water to its players.",
        "I mean, you do have to be tough, you do have to be conditioned but this is the worse case scenario of what can happen and I know there's a lot of speculation and a lot will come out of trial.",
        "But it's very, very disturbing.",
        "You know, I know you're saying this is a sort of harkening back to football's past, but I have to say, just today, I read a column as I was reading into this story in preparation for the show, of a guy that said, this is a tragedy, but then went on to say, it was not a crime and part of his argument was that this kind of tough football coaching weeds those players out who were just aren't strong enough.",
        "And indeed, even said, maybe this kid just wasn't strong enough and his parents have to face that.",
        "So, that kind of macho attitude seems to me is still prevalent.",
        "Well, there's always going to be a certain amount of machoism in football.",
        "It's a very violent, you know, brutal game.",
        "There are 14 kids in the State of Texas alone in the past six years who have suffered catastrophic spinal cord injuries.",
        "There was an incident in Texas in 2005 where a disgruntled parent shot a coach in the stomach.",
        "It's a macho game.",
        "It's a tough game, but that column is ridiculous.",
        "If the price of machoism, if the price of toughening up kids and weeding out the strong from the weak is a kid dying, then it's a ridiculous and pathetic statement on the part of the person who wrote that column."

        "Will it bring some changes do you think in the way high school football is conducted in the future?",
