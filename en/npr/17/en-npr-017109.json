        "You know, at that point, once the training is done, President Obama and senior military officials have to certify to Congress that having gays serve openly will not harm the military - not harm readiness, not harm recruiting and retention.",

        "There will be some detailed training.",
        "And first of all, they'll explain to the troops that now, gays can serve in the military.",
        "We expect them to say that there will not be any sort of separate berthing or separate facilities for gay and lesbian troops.",
        "And they'll also tell them that, listen, you can't refuse to live or work with someone who is gay.",
