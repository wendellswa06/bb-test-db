        "But we, you know, we did a lot to get the laws changed, and certainly that, but not the mentality and the hearts of people.",
        "The only way that's going to be changed is through a dialogue, through actually - you know, actually, when some light has happened to make a discussion out of it so that the generations that come up - now, I'm 54 years old, so to me, I could ignore something like that.",
