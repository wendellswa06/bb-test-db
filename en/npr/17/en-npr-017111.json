        "And at that point, should these nooses still be ignored?",
        "You know, very often, I pass the plaza here where the Nazis burned the books from the Humboldt University, and there's a plaque there that says, you know, when a nation burns its books, next it burns its people.",
        "And so therefore, I see the noose as, yes, it's a terrorist threat, a terroristic threat.",
        "And also, it's a real escalation.",
        "And I'd like to know how your speaker would react to - if this does go a step further, do we then still ignore these symbols?",
        "John McWhorter, I think that's to you.",
        "Well, I can say that when you're looking at things like this, you have to be open to contradictions to the way you look at things.",
        "And I'm quite sure that if we saw a black man hanging from a tree next week, then I would change my tune on this.",
        "You have to be open to doing it.",
        "I do it all the time.",
        "However, I think that the current situation in the United States is such that that is vanishingly unlikely and I would put myself on the line and say that here in this national forum.",
        "And so I'm responding to it in a different interpretation of the nooses, which is equally plausible to the one that supposes that we're in for a new spade of lynchings, which is that people are making a really nasty gesture because they see that it gets a response.",
        "The Diversity Web site with the map is very interesting and very useful in its way, but each new noose that you see in each new state says to me that once again, this has become something which has proliferated so much that what we need to do is take this sting away from the power of it to intimidate by not being frightened because that's one way of making these things stop.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Why do you think the map is interesting, John McWhorter?",
        "Well, because this is an important point.",
        "Often people, especially people in my position, say, well, racism still exists, and then they move on.",
        "And I think it is important to chart the fact that racism really does still exist.",
        "There are white people out there, and not just a few, who have severe biases against black people.",
        "The playing field is not level.",
        "And I think there need to be graphic indications if that's true so that we can know what obstacles people do face, what the Americans psychology still is.",
        "That's not useless.",
        "However, I maintain that when it comes to these nooses, and the media response to them or the legal response, I think the solution to getting rid of that symbol or at least, lessening it is not to make it big deal every time one of them comes up.",
        "It seems counterproductive to me.",

        "Well, I think that we have to look at the reality in our country that most white people think that the problem has pretty much gone away, yet, black households have one-tenth the wealth of white households.",
        "And if you look at schools that underserve their students, the majority of them are in black towns like we're in, in Newark, where my office is.",
        "And I think that the noose is a symbol.",
        "Noose is a sign that things aren't as good as a lot - as the majority seemed to think they are.",
        "And by illustrating them and making them nationally known instead of just a local sign of terror, I think you do justice to the, you know, the fact or awareness that things are not as good as we all seem to think they are.",
        "And it is disturbing for all people to understand that they aren't as good as people seem to think they are.",
        "And, Luke Visconti, when you say terror, well, terrorism is a crime.",
        "Should these nooses be criminalized as the New York State Legislature is considering doing?",
        "Yes.",
        "I think they should be just as spray painting a swastika on a Jewish person's home is a crime.",

        "Is the act malicious or just ignorant?",
        "If malicious, what's the potential danger I want to confront by responding?",
        "If ignorant, what's the likelihood that an ignorant person is prepared to learn the error of his or her ways?",
        "Understand that a person of color in America expend a tremendous amount of mental capacity on this calculus every day.",
        "John McWhorter, would you agree with that?",
        "Well, I don't know if it's an everyday occurrence and I'm viscerally uncomfortable with the idea that to be black is to be eternally torn and agonized in 2007, maybe that's just me, I suspect it isn't.",
        "But, yes, these are things which often have a case by case aspect to them, which is what I would have said about the nooses, when at least in terms of public awareness.",
        "It wasn't something that was so common.",
        "However, when it gets to the point that it's something that pops up on the Web every three days, I think that we might have to change our tactics.",
        "And to make that kind of careful evaluation about everyone of these cases is, once again, to give power to these extremely minor and small-minded people, instead of being a self-satisfied, strong human being who has a life."

        "I'm a white woman in Northern California and I think it's entirely possible that our responses to these should be different if we're black or if we're white.",
        "Because the studies are showing, psychologically, that when you remind people who are a minority, whether they're young women or African-Americans or whatever, before taking a test that they are a minority, they score less.",
        "And so reinforcing this idea of difference doesn't necessarily work to our common goal of overcoming racism.",
        "But on the other hand, as a white person who grew up in Oregon and much later in life learned that my sheriff had been telling black people to leave town before sunrise, I would had no idea that that was going on if I hadn't learned that.",
        "And there is something I think is very effective about white people knowing that these numbers of nooses are showing up places.",

        "So I'm interested in trying to help people and trying to support legislation that would do that.",
