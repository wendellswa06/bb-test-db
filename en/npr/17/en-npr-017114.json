        "Thank you.",
        "Laura, let's begin with you.",
        "What's number one on your list to read this summer?",
        "Well, in terms of the - the sort of page turner that is not so stupid with such flimsy characters that you're just depressed after you're done reading it even though you can't help reading it to the end - a great substitution for that is \"\"The Book of Air and Shadows\"\" by Michael Gruber.",
        "I'm not a big fan of \"\"The Da Vinci Code,\"\" but one of the good things about the success of that book is it has spawned all of these really smart, historical, literary thrillers that actually are literary.",
        "And this is a book about a bunch of contemporary people who get on the trail of an encoded 17th century manuscript that might point to a previously unknown Shakespeare play.",
        "And it's just great - great characters, great writing, really fun.",
        "And you'd describe it as a real page turner?",
        "Yes, absolutely.",
        "It's that - it hits that sweet spot of being really well written but yet something that you don't really want to put down.",
        "And would you say that that's sort of a crucial quality for a summer read, that page-turning quality?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "When I put together our summer reading list, I make that the first qualification.",
        "But it also has to not be stupid, which is really difficult to come by these days when it comes to page turners.",
        "All right, Maud, what about you?",
        "What is your top pick?",
        "Well, last weekend, I had the experience of reading four books by the same author…"

        "Oh, good on you.",

        "Four books in a weekend.",
        "That's good.",
        "As though anyone has that kind of time, right?",
        "I read Kate Christensen's first three novels.",
        "And then the fourth one that comes out in August, I believe, and they're all incredibly suspenseful, even though really they're just about sort of misanthropic people who are having various problems in their lives.",
        "The first one is \"\"In the Drink,\"\" about a girl, a 29-year-old girl named Claudia Steiner who spends her nights boozing it up and her days doing secretarial work and ghost writing for an unseen socialite.",
        "And it doesn't sound like the stuff that suspense is made of, but somehow it really is.",
        "And unfortunately, Christensen has been miscast as a chick lit author.",
        "Her work is much darker than that, I think.",
        "Do you think when you call it chick lit that that sort of sends out a signal that it's just for women?",
        "And do you think, to the contrary, that this might be a book that men might enjoy as well or what?",
        "Well, I do think that it's a book that anyone can enjoy.",
        "And I haven't read enough chick lit to sort of dismiss the whole genre of it, but the little bit I have read does tend to have sort of a triumphant ending, a sort of not very complex ending in my opinion, and her work is far more complex than that.",
        "In fact, Claudia - you kind of feel like the book ends on an up note for her, but you don't really feel that all of the woes of her life have gone away by any stretch.",
        "And her next two books \"\"Jeremy Thrane\"\" and the \"\"The Epicure's Lament\"\" actually they're also first-person narrative and they are about men.",
        "The first, \"\"Jeremy Thrane,\"\" is about the kept boy of a married male actor basically, and it's just a fascinating book.",
        "And then \"\"The Epicure's Lament\"\" - which I did enjoy but I enjoyed somewhat less - I just didn't buy the narrator quite as much or perhaps I had just overdosed finally on her - on her incredible writing.",
        "But the narrator of the \"\"The Epicure's Lament\"\" sequesters himself from society and everyone with the aim of smoking himself to death.",
        "So - and he will die, in fact, is the premise of the book, due to a rare illness, and he'll die soon if he doesn't stop smoking.",
        "Well, that's a truism, I would say.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)"

        "You know, there are some real heavyweight authors with books coming out this summer, too, as there usually are.",
        "Don DeLillo for one, has a book that's getting a lot of attention.",
        "What are some of the most anticipated books this summer?",
        "And are these the kinds of books that are worth buying now in hardback, or should you wait for next summer until - when they're going to be in paperback?",
        "Well, there are a lot of late spring books like the DeLillo or the Michael Chabon book, \"\"The Yiddish Policemen's Union.\"\" And, you know, it really kind of depends on how big of a fan you are and how much patience you have with waiting for the paperback to come out, because you could always read them next summer.",
        "I wouldn't really call the DeLillo book - which is pretty good - I wouldn't call it summer reading, but I think that the Michael Chabon novel does also sort of hit that sweet spot.",
        "It's kind of a hard-boiled novel, but it's set in an imaginary province where Jews, Europe's Jews, were settled after World War II.",
        "It was a plan that had been floated by (unintelligible), and he - Chabon just imagines what would happen if this part of Alaska had been given over to Europe's Jews.",
        "And it's - it's really a lot of fun to read, although it deals with a lot of serious issues as well.",
        "So, that's a - that one is one I would say hey, go ahead, spring for the hardcover if you're a Chabon fan.",
        "and I know a lot of people are.",
        "And why not the Don DeLillo book?",
        "Why do you say that's not summer reading?",
        "What makes it…",
        "Well, it's a little kind of serious and somber and a little static maybe.",
        "And it's a 9/11 novel, and some people may not just want to think about that when they're on an airplane or at the beach.",
        "What about you Maud?",
        "Are there any books coming out that have a sort of heavier kind of feel to them that you're thinking about maybe bringing to the beach with you?",
        "Or you're (unintelligible) waiting for January for those books?",
        "Well, you know, I actually think memoirs are really good summer reading, myself.",
        "You know, a good memoir is - can read as well as a novel.",
        "Do you find, ZZ, that you read differently in the summer?",
        "Unidentified Man #1: (Dutch spoken)",
        "I am really interested in reading though I haven't read them yet -Min Jin Lee's \"\"Free Food for Millionaires.\"\" It's about the child of immigrant Korean parents, and it's just supposed to be - I saw the author speak the other night, and she was incredibly articulate.",
        "And her influence are - influences are everyone from George Elliot to Dante, so I - and \"\"Fantasy Island,\"\" she says.",
        "So I was really - I'm really looking forward to reading that.",
        "And I also want to read Nathan Englander's \"\"The Ministry of Special Cases,\"\" which is about Argentina's dirty war."

        "But a book that's kind of surprisingly serious yet riotous and crazy is Roberto Bolano's \"\"The Savage Detective.\"\" I really enjoyed that book, and as James Woods(ph) said, in the Times Book Review, a novel about poets and poetry could very, very easily go wrong and be just the most pretentious thing in the world, but Bolano made it very funny and very insightful.",

        "The film of the first one, \"\"The Golden Compass,\"\" will be coming out in December, and it would be hard to imagine that the film could be as good as the books, so that's definitely one to read.",

        "Yes."
