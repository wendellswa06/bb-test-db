        "One thing she's really been enjoying, sort of, as she waits for the new \"\"Harry Potter\"\" book - which inevitably she's crazy anticipating - she's been enjoying the \"\"Magic or Madness\"\" series of books…",

        "My name is Naima and I'm a graduate student who will be spending the summer in Yemen studying Arabic.",
        "I'm bringing along Jane Austen's \"\"Mansfield Park\"\" as I have never read it.",
        "I've intended to for a long time.",
        "I anticipate a strange sense of displacement reading Austen in Yemen, but in many ways that is exactly what I am hoping to induce.",
        "I love this email because it brings up two subjects for me, Laura and Maud.",
        "One is, is summer a good time to read one of those books that you should have read back in college and never did, and you've had it on your mind ever since?",
        "And also that sense of reading something like Austen in Yemen that just seems completely out of place.",

        "It's chick lit.",

        "That's right.",
        "I have not either.",
        "So does the air conditioner get credit - or maybe the blame - for the advent of summer blockbusters?",
        "Well, I think that it's a great idea to take the extra time to catch up on something you've always wanted to read, but it might be a bad idea if you take it as a kind of a chore or a self-improvement project.",
        "So I think it would be - I did that a couple of years ago with \"\"War and Peace,\"\" and the thing that inspired me to do it was a friend of mine saying, you know, really, it's a really fun book.",
        "It's not a chore at all the way that, you know, maybe something else would be that has an equally lofty reputation.",
        "And so that made it seem like a good summer book to me.",
        "But you, kind of have to go into it with the right attitude that this is going to be enjoyable, not that this is something you have to check off a list, because summer is really not about that sort of thing.",
        "What's your take on that, Maud?",
        "I agree.",
        "I, in general, in the world, believe that there are too many books to read more than a hundred pages of something that feels completely like a chore.",
        "I mean, obviously, if something is just complex, that's one thing.",
        "But yes, I have been actually voraciously reading \"\"Somerset Mom\"\" recently.",
        "I reread \"\"The Moon & Sixpence,\"\" a book about Gauguin, basically it's sort of based on Gauguin.",
        "And in the book, a middle-aged English stockbroker abandons his family and runs off to Paris and finally Tahiti to paint, and it's just an amazing book.",
        "It's very precisely observed.",
        "It's somewhat cold, though, and so that's not going to work for everyone, and so I would also recommend \"\"Cakes and Ale,\"\" which is a hilarious novel satirizing 1920s London literary culture."

        "The only trick is that the first few pages tend to put you to sleep because they're all about falling asleep, and so you shouldn't assume that if you have difficulty getting through the first few pages that the rest of the book is going to make you fall asleep.",
        "It's just that he's just a good writer that when he's writing about falling asleep, you tend to fall asleep.",

        "So what are you looking forward to reading this summer?",
        "Well, I'm glad that Laura Miller mentioned \"\"The Yiddish Policemen's Union,\"\" because that is what I'm reading and I'd completely agree with what she said about it being at once incredibly serious but also just a fun read.",
        "And, you know, it is sort of strange because there is a sort of hodgepodge of these Jews who speak Yiddish and, you know, occasionally will say curse words than Americans as it's written.",
        "And it's kind of like the wire in some ways with a set of blank whiteboard and, you know, trying to track down the killer of this chess player and yet, you know, you have Yiddish gangs and they're literally the black hats, you know.",
        "And then you have allusions to them being, sort of, riot with the Jewish settlers and the native Alaskans and the kids were this sort ironic, retro pajamas with snowflakes and igloos on them.",
        "So it's just this wild - completely wild ride, and it's a little intimidating because if you put all the elements together, you would think they would never ever work, and yet they somehow do.",
        "So that's the, you know, the top one on my list.",
        "And then the next one is a memoir, but it kind of reads like a novel, and that's \"\"The Mistress's Daughter\"\" by A.M. Homes, which I would qualify as summer reading because it's a very, very quick read.",
        "You know, A.M. Homes is a fiction writer, and she also writes nonfiction, but I think of her and love her primarily as a fiction writer.",
        "And she was adopted and discovered one day, basically, that her - her biological parents wanted to meet her, and so she ends up, you know, meeting her mother who is basically a pathological liar.",
        "And her father - her biological father -she meets in these sort of seedy hotel rooms, and, you know - and he's kind of this aging athlete corporate type.",
        "And, you know, this is a very - it's just sort of incredible, and it's kind of like watching a sort of highbrow version of - I don't know - Jerry Springer.",
        "Something…",
        "I do.",
        "I think just because - I was hearing later about - earlier about reading the classic.",
        "I do because I, kind of, think, well, you know, everything I read now is sort of optional and this is going to be for me.",
        "And that's why I actually do things as a (unintelligible) to read classics because you don't - if you don't set up any expectations, you can just, sort of, say I'm going to put this down on page 50, and it's perfectly fine.",
        "I don't feel guilty about it.",
        "I don't feel as though, I've, you know, somehow, you know, not, sort of, gotten my way through the quote/unquote, \"\"canon\"\" or anything like that.",
