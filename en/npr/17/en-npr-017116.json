        "I usually don't - I just don't admit it until someone else because they (unintelligible), reading and that's - and I would like…",
        "Can you give an example or do you not there?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I, kind of - think of something that fits that because all the ones I've been reading so far have, you know, like \"\"The Yiddish Policemen,\"\" you know, I think anyone would be ashamed to read that or \"\"The Mistress's Daughter.\"\" But, let me see, what is this something that I've been…",
        "Well, you think about that and we'll put that on our list when the time comes.",
        "Sure.",
        "And just one other thing, do you trade books with other writers, or do you read in the summer - might you be reading somebody else's manuscripts that's in progress, ZZ?",
        "I'm always reading manuscripts and that is, you know - on the one hand, it's sort of a labor of love.",
        "And it's also fun because you get to discover what, you know, your colleagues have been up to for all this time.",
        "So that's fine, but I will also say that I end up - we do end up, sort of, you know, someone will have a book - for instance, when I read \"\"The True History of the Kelly Gang\"\" that was - I don't know - one summer, and I told one of my friends about it and she it end up reading it and another friend ended up reading it, and, you know, we're kind of late to the game reading it, because I think it won a Booker - I don't how long ago - but we all just - it just became the sort of thing that just got passed around.",
        "But I will say the other thing that I want to read - I'm glad that Maud Newton mentioned \"\"The Ministry of Special Cases,\"\" because I have this right here.",
        "I haven't started it yet, but I'm planning on it.",
        "And the other one that's sort of really juicy is this memoir called \"\"The Space Between the Stars,\"\" which, since it's the 40th anniversary of \"\"The Summer of Love,\"\" I suppose - you know, it's by Deborah Santana - and she sort of chronicles that whole era and, you know, relationship with Sly Stone and Carlos Santana and then just - sort of everything in between, which is kind of, you know - that's kind of racy and completely interesting but in this very Zen kind of way.",

        "And you were talking about children's books, and actually, now that I have two children - this has been something that's been on mine - you know, pretty recently.",
        "And so one is called \"\"Henry's Freedom Box,\"\" which on the one hand, you know, it's always difficult when you have a children's book that deals with something that's a sort of major, weighty historical concern, and it concerns slavery and about this, you know, actual man who boxed himself up and sent himself to Philadelphia to these abolitionists.",
        "And, you know, it's not something that my son, you know, who's less - who's not quite two years old - is going to understand.",
        "I mean, basically, he just puts himself in a box.",
        "And when I mention box and, you know - doesn't get the point.",
        "But it - I think it is something that's nice to have around knowing that, you know, children can be affected by the - you know, what you read to them and what they end up reading and it teaches this, you know, obviously important lesson about slavery and what the nature of freedom is, and that sort of thing.",
        "Great.",
        "Well, thank you for joining us, ZZ.",
        "Thanks for having me.",

        "So you will be able to go online and read those lists.",
        "And in the meantime, I'm going to ask you to repeat the name of the first book you mentioned, Laura, about the Shakespeare manuscript.",
        "Yes.",
        "That's \"\"The Book of Air and Shadows,\"\" and if that appeals to people, they also might want look for \"\"The Grave Tattoo\"\" by Val McDermid, who usually writes these gritty Scottish crime novels, but this is a similar book based on the true facts that the great poet William Wordsworth and the famous mutineer Fletcher Christian, who was the leader of the mutineers of the bounty.",
        "Went to the same school and were connected by the family, and she sort of imagines a scholar who finds out that they actually met and that Wordsworth wrote a lost poem about Fletcher Christian."
