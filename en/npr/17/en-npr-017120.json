        "Good morning, Steve.",
        "So I was just looking back at the biography of - of John McCain.",
        "He's a Naval Academy graduate in 1958, meaning he's been in public service almost constantly for about 60 years.",
        "Prisoner of war, a member of Congress, senator - not universally loved, I - I guess, but just an outpouring overnight to this news.",
        "What is his place in the Senate?",
        "You know, McCain has been a Washington institution, coming to the Senate in 1987.",
        "First started as a representative in 1982, just nine years after he was released from a prison in Vietnam - is probably the country's most famous prisoner of war, spending five years in that prison in Vietnam when his bomber was shot down.",
        "He was beaten and tortured - a cause that he later spoke out against during the Iraq War during the Bush years.",
        "And everyone who has ever come in contact with John McCain, regardless of whether they agreed with him on policy, knows this is one tough guy.",
        "Yeah, one tough guy and someone who has spoken out again and again on issue after issue, including from time to time, the president of the United States, who, as we await more news of McCain's condition, is speaking out himself.",
        "He gave an interview to The New York Times I want to ask you about.",
        "The Times uses the word grievance to describe the president's tone.",
        "What's the president unhappy about?",
        "Everything."

        "OK.",
        "(Laughter) And pretty much everything involving, in particular, those who touch that Russia investigation.",
        "You know, he's talked out about Jeff Sessions - his own attorney general - still upset because he recused himself from the investigation.",
        "He said he would never have picked him if he knew that he would have recused himself.",
        "He said it - it's extremely unfair and, quote, \"\"that's a mild word to the president.\"\" Who knows what other word he was actually thinking of there?",
        "Let's look at another part of the government because the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement says deportations are up.",
        "Yeah, he says deportations are up.",
        "And acting director Thomas Homan says he wants to deploy more border agents.",
        "And we can't know his broader motivation, but let's look at the facts.",
        "Sessions oversees the Justice Department.",
        "He serves at the pleasure of the president.",
        "He recuses himself.",
        "The deputy in charge appoints a special counselor with broad authority.",
        "And, you know, that removes that individual from the direct chain of command from the president.",
        "Certainly, Sessions recusing himself made it a lot harder for the president to control the Russia investigation, if he so wanted to.",
        "And the president also concerned that the Russian investigation is going to get more deeply into his finances.",
        "This according to the Times interview, in which they also discussed that undisclosed meeting at the G-20 summit that President Trump had with Russian president Vladimir Putin.",
        "He - he described the meeting a little bit.",

        "OK, pleasantries, but he says they also talked about adoption.",
        "What's the significance there?",
        "Yeah, he just sort of threw that in there at the end.",
        "You know, let's be blunt, Steve, they talked about sanctions.",
        "He said adoptions came up.",
        "And that is sanctions.",
        "Putin cut off American adoptions in retaliation for a law in the United States that punished what it sees as human rights abusers.",
        "Trump also said he found that interesting because that was the topic of discussion at Donald Trump Jr's meeting with a handful of Russians in June of 2016.",

        "And those bills go out to state houses all over the country.",
        "Oh, and this just drives progressives crazy - right?",
        "- because what they see is businesses writing legislation and handing the very language to lawmakers.",
        "And, very often, this stuff gets passed word-for-word or something close to it."

        "Absolutely, yes.",
        "So what is Betsy DeVos's connection to ALEC?",
        "Well, they're fellow travelers, in a sense.",
        "DeVos's organization that she chaired until she became secretary, The American Federation for Children, has been a longtime supporter of ALEC.",
        "ALEC gave her father-in-law an award many, many years ago.",
        "And DeVos and her husband have disclosed that they're financial supporters - sorry - DeVos and her husband have disclosed that they are stockholders in K12 Inc., which is one of these corporate sponsors of for-profit virtual schools company.",
        "And this is so interesting because this is an organization that is seen as a little bit below the radar, doing things that are seen as a little secretive.",
        "But here we are, out in the open, and Betsy DeVos actually speaking to the group.",
        "And, I guess, protesters will be outside or around the meeting somewhere.",
        "What do they want to say?",
        "Well, basically, you know, there - there's very little daylight, as you say, between DeVos's education agenda and the one that ALEC promotes, which is really vouchers, vouchers, vouchers, school choice, as well as technology in schools.",
        "And, you know, so there's teachers unions out there in the protesters, but also people who feel that, you know, this is basically an undemocratic process of policymaking, where lawmakers feel that they have access to donors.",
        "And they are very influenced to adopt the exact policies that are being set forth by these corporations and these free-market conservatives.",
        "I guess the biggest message that DeVos is sending is just by showing up to such a group.",
        "What does she plan to say?"
