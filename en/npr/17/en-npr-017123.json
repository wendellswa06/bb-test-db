        "And is that analysis, do you think, correct - that six seats are going to be hard for the Democrats to find?",
        "I think six seats are harder than certainly the four or five we think that they will pick up today.",
        "It's not impossible.",
        "If there is a Democratic wave out there, you certainly could see that sixth come into play.",
        "I mean, the one thing we know about Senate races is that on election night, one party tends to win the lion's share of them.",
        "Hmm.",
        "So it goes in waves, as you think.",
        "Would you agree with Ken, that -do the president's ratings track to election results for the parties?",
        "It is entirely possible.",

        "Some of them don't even talk about their party identification in ads.",
        "So if voters see particular candidates as independent, that might do them some good.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "You mentioned that some of the candidates aren't even mentioning their political affiliation.",
        "We have a clip of tape.",
        "This is an excerpt - this is not an excerpt - this is, in fact, an ad that's being run by Maryland's Lieutenant Governor Michael Steele, who is the - well, you wouldn't know it to hear the ad - but he's the Republican nominee for the United States Senate.",
        "(Soundbite of a political ad)",
        "Hey, it's me again Michael Steele.",
        "Soon your TV will be jammed with negative ads from the Washington crowd - grainy pictures and spooky music saying Steele hates puppies, and worse.",
        "For the record, I love puppies.",
        "An ad that's getting a lot of buzz.",
        "But apparently, even on his Web site, he neglects to mention that he used to be the chairman of the Republican Party in the state of Maryland.",
        "That's right.",
        "First, you know, Steele has to get some credit for running some of the better ads I have seen this cycle; and I've watched hundreds.",
        "You know, Maryland is a very, very blue state.",
        "Until they elected a Republican governor in 2002, there hadn't been a Republican elected since 1980.",
        "You know, the other thing that separates Steele is he's an African-American.",
        "So, you know, it's almost a disconnect for some voters, to see an African-American Republican.",
        "It doesn't serve Steele that well to highlight his party identification, so he doesn't."

        "Well, Jennifer is exactly right.",
        "I mean, before Bob Ehrlich, Spiro Agnew was last Republican governor, and that's certainly a legacy the GOP would love to not be reminded of in Maryland.",
        "But given the fact that you haven't elected a Republican senator since 1980, given the fact that it's at least two to one Democratic over Republican, why talk about the Republican credentials?",
        "But that's not unusual.",
        "I mean, for years, you know, Democratic candidates in Idaho would not talk about the fact that they were Democrat; the fact that they're independent of their party.",

        "But there's very, very little talk about the individual congressional races in the 11th District, which is where I live, and the other districts around the state where I see the possibility of a Democratic turnover for the first time in years - but maybe I'm overstating it.",
        "I wanted to know what your guest thinks about the possibilities.",
        "Well, for the House seats, let's go to Ken Rudin.",
        "Well, there's actually nothing I've been watching in Michigan that looks like it's turning over - is the 11th Thaddeus McCotter?"
