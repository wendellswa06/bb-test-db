        "Brad calling us from Little Rock, Arkansas.",
        "Yes, I have a question - and see what your thoughts were on the gubernatorial race in Arkansas, because it's fairly interesting - it's the first open-seated race we've had in Arkansas in about 30 years with no incumbent.",
        "And the Republican is Asa Hutchinson, who went to Washington to run the DEA and then served as the undersecretary for Department of Homeland Security.",
        "And then we've got an in-state good old boy, Mike Bebe, who is the current attorney general - and so it's an interesting battle between those two parties.",
        "And also, neither of them (unintelligible) Democrats or Republican, it just seems to come down to, you know, who has the closest (unintelligible) who knows Arkansas better.",
        "And it seems a really close play in the south because both are fairly conservative, and just wanted to know what your thoughts were.",
        "Jennifer, what do you think?",
        "You know, Arkansas is probably the least Republican of all the southern states.",
        "This is a good race.",
        "There has been a Republican governor there now for ten years.",
        "Mike Bebe, who is the attorney general, has been running this race for seemingly years.",
        "He got a big head start over Asa Hutchinson, and Hutchinson is just now raising the kind of money he needs to be very competitive.",
        "I have to put a thumb on the scale for Democrats in this one, though.",
        "One thing to add, though.",
        "People who are well remembering in Arkansas, that Asa Hutchinson was one of the lead House prosecutors during the Bill Clinton impeachment trial, and a lot of people remember that pretty well in Arkansas.",
        "Both a positive and a negative, so - Brad, thanks very much.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Let's get to - this will be Joseph.",
        "Joseph with us from Cloquet in Minnesota.",
        "Am I pronouncing that right?",
        "Yes."

        "Yeah, I'm curious about the Senate race in Minnesota because there's an open seat with Mark Dayton not running again.",
        "What is your feeling on who is going to win - Amy Klobuchar or Kennedy?",
        "Jennifer?",
        "This is the most competitive open seat - or one of the most competitive open seats - out there right now.",
        "There's some polling out there that gives Klobuchar a very wide lead.",
        "I am not all that comfortable with that poll.",
        "However, I think she's ahead.",
        "She's run a very, very good campaign.",
        "You know, Mark Kennedy, who serves in Congress, has had tough races in the past.",
        "The fact that he does serve in Congress and is a Republican is weighing him down a little bit.",
        "He's finally gone on the attack and we'll see if this closes the race some, but right now, again, Klobuchar is running ahead.",
        "I agree.",
        "I think the best think that could have happened to the Democrats was Mark Dayton not running for a second term.",
        "He was probably doomed to be defeated and that Klobuchar is a much more effective, better Democratic candidate.",
        "Thanks, Joseph.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Let me ask you - how reliable are polls this far out from Election Day in an off-year election?",
        "You know, unfortunately, in this cycle, I have seen more bad polling than ever, and even I am not comfortable relying on a lot of it this time.",
        "You know, there are groups out there using different methodologies that have yet to be scientifically proven, but putting them out there as fact.",
        "And so, you know, I won't trust most polls these days.",
        "I trust the partisan polls more because, you know, a candidate doesn't pay a pollster to get lied to.",
        "Remember just a few days before the Connecticut Senate primary, some polls had Ned Lamont up over Joe Lieberman by 14 points and he won by only four, so it's - there's a lot of volatility in these numbers.",
        "Just out of curiosity, what are those polls - since those are the two big candidates in Connecticut staging a rerun - what do they say now?"

        "Well, I could say with pretty much assurance that the Republicans will not win that seat.",
        "But the last polls I saw were that Lieberman still had a slight lead.",
        "But every day you see another union defecting from Lieberman, going towards Lamont.",
        "More and more Democrats are moving away from him.",
        "But again, you know, given the fact that he has a large percentage of the Republican vote - and if he maintains 35, you know, 35 percent of the Democratic vote - he could win another term.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's get Becca on the line.",

        "Hello, thank you for having me on.",
        "Sure.",
        "I just, you know, just noticing Nevada's had kind of a political awakening, if you can say that.",
        "And I was curious if you had seen any major changes coming from this state and how it will affect the nation?",
        "What do you think, Ken?",
        "Well, not yet.",
        "And the reason I say not yet is because Nevada has suddenly become a player in the presidential primary system, in the fact that it is a caucus state for 2008.",
        "And early, as a matter of fact, it's right after Iowa.",
        "So you'll see more presidential candidates going there - not only in 2008 but in 2006 - both for Jack Carter, President Jimmy Carter's son who's running against John Ensign for the Senate seat and Jon Porter, who's a somewhat vulnerable Republican in the 3rd District there.",
        "But I don't think there's going to be any changes.",
        "I think Ensign certainly wins with little effort.",
        "I think Porter wins again.",
        "But you're going to see more political activity there because of the importance of Nevada in the presidential sweepstakes.",
        "Senate seat all but wrapped up, do you think?",
        "Senate seat's wrapped up.",
        "The race to watch in Nevada is the governor's race.",
        "It's very close.",
        "You have Congressman Jim Gibbons as the Republican nominee.",
        "The Democrat is a woman named Dina Titus, who is the state senate president.",
        "This is going to be quite a race and I think Titus, who is from Las Vegas, is out to prove that Democrats can attract votes in the more rural parts of the state.",
        "The polls show Gibbons slightly ahead today but this race has only just begun.",
        "Plus the fact that the outgoing governor, Kenny Guin, hates Jim Gibbons' guts, so the Republicans are not getting along and that could help the Democrats."

        "The last poll that was done - unofficial poll - about a month ago, she was less than ten points behind him.",

        "Wow.",

        "Don Young's been there since 1972, since Nick Begich died in the plane crash with Hal Boggs.",
        "We always think of that.",
        "But he seems entrenched.",
        "What's most interesting about Alaska, though, is the governor's race.",
        "When Frank Murkowski lost the primary there everybody said that the Democrats are going to take back the governorship with Tony Knolls, but the woman who beat Murkowski in the primary - Sarah Palin, I believe -looks like she's going to actually keep that seat for the Republicans, and that's a big surprise.",
        "Well, the interesting - the parallel is that both Sarah Palin and Diane Benson are recognized as new faces, honest people, incorruptible, and that wave - it seems to be sweeping Alaska.",
        "Nobody's ever said Don Young is a new face, you're absolutely right about that."

        "Hi.",
        "What is the best way to find out which organization or societies giving money to the candidates?",
        "Because in this year, I mean, the easiest way would be, to me, going after candidates that they have less the support of organizations - especially foreign influence, like APEC(ph) or others.",
        "Jennifer, I guess the first place to look would be what the parties themselves are doing.",
        "That's right.",
        "You know, what the parties give to candidates, although they really make the difference giving in something called an independent expenditure, which is not coordinated with the campaign.",
        "I mean if you're interested to see what kind of organizations are giving to candidates, there is a Web site called OpenSecrets.com, which tends to break it down by industries and big donors.",
        "And you know, if you are sort of a hardcore into this, you could always go to FEC.gov and look at the report.",
        "Every candidate must list every cent they take in and every cent they spend.",
        "Is it easy to figure out who has - I mean if you, you know, that this is the Club for Growth or MoveOn.org?"
