        "One of the things that kind of struck me for several weeks now, is with so much talk about taking the House, taking the Senate, losing the House, losing the Senate - what do your experts think about the possibilities of candidate backlash or voter apathy because of the nationalization of things?",

        "If it's a local race and you entrust your - look, there are many Republican congressman who have won by 10, 12, 15, 20 points two years ago and now they find themselves in a tough race.",
        "If they vote on the merits of the Democrat versus Republican, in many states, in may races, the Republicans should do okay.",
        "But if you're weighing that with a national mood - an anger about the economy, about the war, about President Bush - then the Democrats certainly would benefit.",
