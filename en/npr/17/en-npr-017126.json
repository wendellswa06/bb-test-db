        "And he's brash and he's only been in Congress a few years, but the fact is he has a lot of money behind him.",

        "That's Virginia.",

        "So at least you have one younger person while you're still enjoying the seniority of Dan Inouye.",

        "So with all of this, Ken, it sounds like there's still a lot left to be decided in Hawaii.",
        "There is.",
        "And one of the reasons I think Ed Case is running is that you also have a Republican governor, Linda Lingle, who is most likely going to win reelection.",
        "So if fate should intervene with two 82-year-old senators, you know that a Republican would be appointed.",
        "And I think that's one of the reasons why Ed Case made his play right at this time.",
        "And have there been debates, Richard Borreca?",
        "There was only one debate.",
        "Case, early on, made that a part of his campaign, is why won't you debate me, Senator Akaka?",

        "He relied heavily on his briefing books.",
        "He stumbled a couple of times, and he frankly looked old.",
        "It wasn't that he was out of place, but he didn't like he was at all comfortable.",
        "And Case calls that the turning point for his campaign, if he can win, which is still - you know, it's really difficult.",
        "Hawaii doesn't have any kind of a tradition of throwing out incumbents, and no incumbent Congressional member has ever lost a race in Hawaii.",
        "First time for everything, I guess.",

        "If in fact a deal with Israel would include things that would be unpopular with a great many Palestinians - very limited right of return, let's say, territorial swaps that would leave big settlement blocks in place - is Abbas powerful enough, politically strong enough to agree to something that might be unpopular?",
