        "President Bush has hailed Rove as the architect of his successful career.",
        "But this week Rove had attention of another kind.",
        "He became the focus of a messy story about leaks to the press, a reporter in jail and a CIA operative whose name was made public, possibly in violation of federal law.",
        "President Bush once vowed to fire anyone involved in leaking such information to the media.",
        "For now, though, he is standing by Karl Rove.",

        "Did Karl Rove out the wife of former Ambassador Joseph Wilson as revenge for Wilson's criticism of the president on Iraq?",
        "Rove, through his attorney, confirms he had conversations with reporters about the woman, one-time CIA undercover operative Valerie Plame, but Rove insists that he never used her name.",
        "And the Associated Press reports today, citing a source close to the investigation, that when Rove testified before the grand jury he said he had learned her name from reporters calling him.",
        "We know he talked to Time magazine's Matt Cooper, who testified after Rove gave him permission.",
        "The New York Times' Judith Miller is in jail for refusing to testify.",
        "The investigation is ongoing, but the questions about Rove have burst into the headlines this week.",
        "Did the president's most important adviser break the law or, short of that, was there an ethical lapse in having the conversations he had about an employee of the CIA?",
        "And does any of this cross a line that President Bush himself said should not be crossed when, on his very first full day in office in January of 2001, he said this to brand-new White House senior staff members gathered in the East Room.",
        "President GEORGE W.",
        "BUSH: I expect every member of this administration to stay well within the boundaries that define legal and ethical conduct.",
        "This means avoiding even the appearance of problems.",
        "Such pronouncements are typical of presidents when they first take office and often sources of embarrassment later.",
        "This case began in 2002 when Ambassador Wilson was sent to the African nation of Niger to look into allegations that Saddam Hussein had tried to purchase uranium there for use in weapons of mass destruction.",
        "He reported back that there was no substance to the claim, but later the administration still used the claim as part of its rationale for going to war.",
        "On July 6, 2003, Wilson went public in an op-ed column in The New York Times.",

        "Wilson called in retribution and pointed the finger at Rove.",
        "Press Secretary Scott McClellan denied the charges.",
        "Here he is in September 2003.",
        "Bob made it very clear that it was a ridiculous suggestion in the first place and I said it is simply not true.",
        "So, I mean, it's public knowledge.",
        "I've said that it's not true, and I have spoken with Karl Rove.",
        "Rove has not talked publicly about the case or his involvement in it.",
        "All this week there have been calls from Democrats and other administration critics that Rove be fired.",
