        "What are those changes?",
        "Well, on the US side, first and foremost, has been an administration recognition that their policies the past three or four years on North Korea just have not worked.",

        "Whether they're two- or six-party talks, how do you resolve what seems to me the fundamental difference between the American feeling that dismantling the weapons program should come first and then aid and the North Korean feeling that aid comes first and then we'll dismantle the weapons?",
        "Well, that's what negotiations are all about.",
