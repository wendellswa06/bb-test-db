        "And the director of the original \"\"Mad Max\"\" movies, George Miller, will also direct this one.",
        "And of course, Marvel is always a crowd pleaser here at Comic-Con, and they're expected to show something from \"\"The Avengers 2.\"\" But I think one movie that everybody would love to see something from that won't be shown here is also worth mentioning, and that's \"\"Star Wars Episode 7.\"\" That's being directed by JJ Abrams.",
        "It doesn't look like they're going to show anything from that.",
        "And despite all of the kind of fan adoration for these films and whatever buzz the studios might be able to generate, movies actually seem to be taking a backseat to TV this year.",
        "Not actually surprising - I mean TV is coming up with such dynamite fare these days.",
        "So what's big there?",
        "I'm going to imagine \"\"Game Of Thrones\"\" is a crowd pleaser?",
        "Yes, sir.",
        "Well, certainly an actors' strike would be more devastating than a writers' strike.",
        "The writers' strike lasted a hundred days and shut down scripted-TV production and had a large effect across Hollywood, not just among writers but on below-the-line - thousands of below-the-line workers, many of whom are still struggling to get back on their feet.",
        "And a SAG would strike would also have a big effect on feature-film production.",
        "Now some feature films, independent features, have received waivers to keep shooting, so the impact would be negated somewhat.",
        "But there isn't much appetite for another strike, following the writers' walkout.",

        "But doctors and pro-opposition rescue workers we've spoken to say they count 42 people dead from - apparently with symptoms of suffering from a chemical agent.",

        "For a long time, this was a major threat to the Syrian government.",
        "And now - so in the last few days, the Syrian government has been heavily bombarding it, so they've been suffering from that, as well.",
        "They've been living under siege for years.",
        "And finally, just now, the last rebel group there, Jaish al-Islam, appears to have agreed to a sort of surrender deal.",
        "So today, as they're grappling with the aftermath of these attacks, they're also having to get on buses and leave.",
        "In the deal, these rebel groups, and their families and other civilians who don't want to stay in the regime-held areas are getting on buses and being sent to a rebel-held enclave in the north of Syria, where they don't know if they're ever going to be able to return home - so really dramatic, and a dramatic and frightening time for these people."
