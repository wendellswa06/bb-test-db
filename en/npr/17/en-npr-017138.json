        "There are a lot of very interesting charts and graphs in this book.",
        "So, I want to start with one that shows the average length of messages people post on OkCupid.",
        "You show that messages now are about just a third as long as they were back in 2005.",
        "What happened?",
        "Well, I mean smartphones happened basically and OkCupid developed a App and people started typing on their phones, which just kind of in a physical sense is harder but also it's just more chatty, I guess.",
        "You don't have a keyboard, it's very hard to go back and edit all this kind of stuff.",
        "So, it's a lot more concise.",
        "One of the nicer surprises in this book for me was that shorter messages don't necessarily mean that the writing is bad or getting worse.",
        "Can you talk about how Twitter compares with Shakespeare?",
        "(Laughter)",
        "Yes, of course.",
        "I looked at a large sample of tweets and looked at the average word length in tweets and of course, you know, the first blush would be, you know, with all the abbreviations like, U, for Y-O-U, and thx, you know T-H -X, - that there would be shorter words on Twitter and I found that just wasn't the case.",
        "They were longer, not only in Shakespearean English also in kind of long form journalism.",
        "It's much shorter obviously because there's only 140 characters but it is just as robust in a certain sense, that it's the kind of an unfettered writing environment.",
        "You spend a lot of time in the book on race.",
        "Some really fascinating stuff because your tracking what people are actually doing and saying as opposed to what they might think or profess in other ways.",
        "What were the biggest surprises that you found?",
        "All the data on race that I have is from dating, but on these sites black users especially, there's a bias against them.",
        "Every kind of way you can measure their success on a site.",
        "How people rate them, how often they reply to their messages, how many messages they get, it's all reduced and so I obviously race is always a topic in this country but especially now with Ferguson.",
        "It's such a emotional issue and it's rare that you can find data that speaks of how one person of whatever race treats another person of race and an aggregate and kind of measurable kind of way.",
        "And so online data is very good at that and specifically dating data because it's all just strangers mixing with each other.",
        "And the whole premise of a dating site is to judge people.",
        "And so you really are able to tease that out free of any sort of off-line social constraints.",
        "You know, your friends don't know what you do a dating site, like they do know what you do on Facebook.",
        "So, that's why I relied so heavily dating data for that chapter.",
        "You found that, you know, people who might say that, no, I'm racist, but in the aggregate the numbers are showing something different.",
        "They're revealing clear racial biases.",
        "Oh yeah of course.",
        "When you ask anybody directly, I mean, you know, even if it's just a computer asking the question, you know, people are like, oh yeah, interracial marriage is great.",
        "I don't care what race my match is, you know all that stuff you'd expect a kind of decent forward thinking person to say.",
        "But when you actually are observing passively what they're doing, when they don't think you're keeping track, you see a totally different story.",
        "Well, this kind of brings us to the political culture.",
        "What do you find there - is the country as polarized as it looks on cable news?",

        "Well, in the book I do look at speech patterns and political speech in particular and found that certainly if you look at divisive speech that is increasing and that does correlate to kind of more gerrymandered political consciousness in the country.",
        "So, what does that mean?",
        "Like on your dating site are Republicans likely to date Democrats or does that not happen?",
        "(Laughter) Oh.",
        "Well, on OkCupid, I mean we have found that the thing that matters the most is whether you care about politics one way or the other.",
        "If you're ambivalent you will have a hard time relating to I assume someone who's passionate whether it's red or blue.",
        "With all this data from a dating site you write about attractiveness.",
        "When you break down the data, what have you learned about what men and women think about attractiveness when they're dating?",
        "Well, age is a huge variable in online dating.",
        "Women generally like a guy to be the same age as them - up until the guy's hit about 40.",
        "Then when you flip it around, when you look at how men perceive women, it is pretty much just straight ticket vote for 20, which is the lowest age that I looked at in my dataset.",
        "So, you know, even 45 year old guys will rate 20-year-old women the best.",
        "It's very pervasive opinion among - at least the people on OkCupid.",
        "So, the data confirmed men are in fact creepy.",

        "That's NPR health correspondent Rob Stein.",
        "Ramsey, let me ask you something before we let you go, and that's the idea of just the love of music that clearly is in your heart.",
        "I mean, you not only perform, but you do radio, a syndicated program, \"\"The Legends of Jazz with Ramsey Lewis.\"\" What is it about music that is so heartfelt and infectious to you?",
        "Maybe it's because I started studying piano at four years old and maybe it's because it became a very deep love of mine by the time I was 11, 12 years old.",
        "And maybe it's because it got to the point during my teens where I just loved the feel and the sound of music in general, the piano specifically.",
        "Even to this day, just practicing the piano--my wife, when she comes home, she says, `Did you practice today?",
        "and I say, `Yeah.",
        "She goes, `Great,' because she knows when too many days go by that I don't practice, I'm not easy to live with.",
        "So there is this love, this love inside me for the sound of the piano, the touch of the piano, and there's a spirit that moves in me, just listening and participating in music in general."
