        "Surrealist artist Elizabeth \"\"Lee\"\" Miller was also an actress, model, muse and a war correspondent She has been referred to as a femme fatale - and that fatale may best describe the intoxicating effect she had on her lovers, one in particular, the avant-garde American artist Man Ray.",
        "His love for her nearly drove him to madness.",
        "She was his muse but then became a photographer in her own right.",
        "Now, a new exhibit at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts is showing the work of Lee Miller and Man Ray.",
        "It's called Man Ray/Lee Miller, Partners in Surrealism.",
        "And joining me first to talk about this is Phillip Prodger, the exhibit's curator.",
        "He joins me from member station WBUR in Boston.",
        "Welcome to the program.",
        "Hi, Jacki.",
        "And we're joined by Lee Miller's son, Antony Penrose, who is also the director of the Lee Miller Archives and the Penrose Collection.",
        "He's at the BBC studios in Brighton, England.",
        "Welcome.",
        "Hello, Jacki.",
        "Phillip Prodger, as curator of this exhibit, tell us please how these two people became a combined force in Surrealism.",
        "You know, it was only because Lee Miller was rescued from being run over by a truck in the streets of New York by the publisher Conde Nast that she was discovered as a fashion model.",
        "Conde Nast looked at her and said, gosh, you've got the makings of a great model.",
        "And before anybody knew it, she was on the cover of Vogue magazine.",
        "But she had started out as an artist and when one of her images was licensed to the Kotex Company, suddenly she found that she was a persona non grata in the fashion industry and she had to find another job.",
        "She went back to art and she was recommended to meet Man Ray, traveled to Paris unannounced - just presented herself at the doorstep - and the rest is history.",
        "Shortly after that, she became his assistant and also they became lovers at that time.",
        "So, Antony Penrose, the year is 1929.",
        "Man Ray is 17 years older.",
        "He's already known for his use of objects.",
        "Let's talk about Surrealism for a moment.",
        "Really, when Lee arrived in Paris, she had in a way been a Surrealist for some time before the movement even has a name, because she had that determination to pursue her life free of the constraints of society, which the Surrealists were already rebelling against.",
        "And they wanted to create a new world, which was not governed by religion or law or whatever.",
        "And that is where, I think, Man Ray's object-making found such free reign.",
        "Because he would take anything and transform it into something else, very wittily, and with tremendous profound thought behind it in many cases, which is often lost by the wit because we think, gosh, that's a great stunt but actually it's got a really deep bite.",
        "And so Lee to arrive in Paris at that moment was probably the best moment she could have pitched up because the Surrealist movement was going in tremendous force and she was ready-made for it and it for her.",
        "Phillip, on the cover of the catalog, you've got this gorgeous pair of gold lips.",
        "It's a Man Ray image.",
        "But it means just more than a mouth.",
        "Could you tell us what it means?"

        "Well, you know, when Lee left Man it sent him into a despair that he expressed through art, and he made some of the most memorable pieces of his career in that period after 1932 when she left him.",
        "One of the most famous is the fabulous metronome with the ticking eye on it.",
        "The eye was Lee Miller's eye, and the idea behind the piece was that you would wind up the metronome and watch the eye tick back and forth as long as you could stand it.",
        "The idea was that you would then smash it with a hammer and somehow by smashing it, you would exorcise that lost love.",
        "In his case, it was the lost love of Lee.",
        "The other thing that he did was he made a series of paintings and objects that relate to the idea of Lee Miller's lips.",
        "And I have to say I think Lee Miller's lips have now become the most famous lips in the history of art.",
        "He made a fabulous painting called A l'Huere de l'Observatoire, or The Lovers.",
        "Every day for two years, he says, he woke up and the first thing he did was he contributed to this painting - he built the painting up over two years.",
        "And it helped him get over the loss.",
        "And then eventually he produced a sculpture in lead, and this was in one of his darker periods.",
        "It was a piece of lead that was coiled up with a noose around it and it had sort of an inscribed, scrawled version of Lee Miller's lips on that lead piece.",
        "Later when his mood brightened - we don't know exactly when it happened - he did her lips in gold.",
        "He made this fabulous solid gold pair of lips.",
        "And in that way, he was literally transforming lead into gold in the same way that he had transformed that dark period of loss of her love into something different as their friendship evolved.",
        "How did these two reconcile later?",
        "Because I'm looking at a photo - and I do want to talk about this a little bit; talk about obsession.",
        "One night after the breakup of 1932, Man Ray goes to her former studio, howls in the rain all night long underneath it.",
        "And the next day sets up this photograph I'm looking at of himself posed as a suicide with a noose around his neck and a gun to his head.",
        "So how did they become friends again later after something like that?",
        "If you're going to give the commander in chief nuclear weapons, you are accepting, to a certain degree, that the commander in chief is going to be able to use those weapons as he or she sees fit.",

        "I mean what happens is - this is just measuring people's opinions not what they actually go out and do, what you see when you actually look at what people do, you see the realisms set end.",
        "So, what these 40-year-old guys who, yeah, you know, that they - 20-year-old girls are the 21-year-old girls.",
        "The people they actually have the courage to actually is a lot older.",
        "It's 30, 35-year-old women.",
        "So, Christian if I asked you to make a value judgment, because you clearly love diving into all this time, and we'll leave aside government intrusion, but just collecting all this data, tons and tons of info from various companies, is getting all this information about ourselves good or bad?",
        "Oh, I mean I definitely think it's good.",
        "I think to speak to your sort of complicate concern about privacy, for sure, I mean, you know all of this data, everything in the book and generally anything that you read online about people's behavior on sites is all aggregated and anonymous.",
        "Nobody's looking at your personal account, but when we put all this stuff together you're able to look at people in a way the people have never been able to look at people before.",
        "You know, like you have millions and millions of people living their lives through an interface that records what they're doing as they live.",
        "And, you know, look there's no way OkCupid, Facebook, Twitter, these sites even added altogether can stand in for the entirety of the human condition.",
        "People do all kinds of thing that don't do online.",
        "But they're doing fewer and fewer things that they don't do online and it's the beginning of I think a revolution in how social science and behavioral science are done.",
