        "Now most of that isn't very controversial, except that part about FDA-approved contraception.",
        "The original version of the rules issued by the Obama administration exempted churches and other religious entities, but still required religious-affiliated universities, hospitals and social service agencies to abide by the coverage requirement.",
        "After a month-long backlash led by the Catholic church, the administration decided to give all religiously affiliated organizations an additional year, while it seeks a compromise.",
        "Iowa Democratic Senator Tom Harkin said he thinks that should settle things.",
        "So, I think the exception the Obama administration has come up with is sensible.",
        "Indeed, while several Catholic and other religious organizations are suing to block the rules, at least one judge has said those lawsuits are premature, precisely because the administration has promised to try to find a workable solution.",
        "But now there's a separate legal battle being waged against the contraceptive coverage requirement.",
        "It's coming not from religious employers, but from private business owners who happen to be religious and don't want to pay for a health benefit they say violates their beliefs.",

        "But Marcia Greenberger of the National Women's Law Center says she thinks there's no way courts will eventually allow private businesses to decline to offer health coverage just because it violates owners' religious beliefs.",
