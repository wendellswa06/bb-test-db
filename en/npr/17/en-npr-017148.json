        "Well, I'm not sure that it's either case.",

        "His statement, then, suggests that if Mousavi is allowed a legal procedure that could review the results of the election and that might take a week to 10 days, that that would quiet things, and things might, therefore, get back to normal - in his view.",

        "Well, Ahmadinejad held a lengthy press conference yesterday that was seen across the world and in Iran, and then he attended a victory celebration in central Tehran, where thousands of his supporters came out.",
