        "Ayres also bet his friend, an economics professor named Dean Karlan, $500 a week that he'd lose the weight.",
        "It's a bet that Karlan says he was happy to take.",
        "Well, I have to fund my research somehow.",
        "So...",
        "Karlan laughs facetiously because his instincts told him he would never take a dime of his friend Ian Ayres's money.",
        "Through his experiments in behavioral economics, Karlan says he's learned that some people are more likely to act in their own self-interest if they sign a contract.",
        "There are a significant portion of people that have an explicit preference for commitment.",
        "Karlan describes a recent effort in the Philippines to help smokers quit.",
        "Through a local bank the smokers signed agreements to put their cigarette money into savings accounts and agreed to urine tests.",
        "At the end of six months if the tests showed they had nicotine in their system, their savings was lost, given to charity.",
        "It was wildly, wildly successful.",
        "The people who took up the account were about 30 percentage points more likely to stop smoking.",
        "At least temporarily.",
        "The results exemplify what economists call prospect theory, or loss aversion.",
        "What we know about incentives is people work a lot harder to avoid losing ten dollars than they will work to gain ten dollars.",
        "Something that is framed as a loss is really effective at changing behavior.",
        "Unidentified Man #1: (Dutch spoken)",
        "The other principle that's at work here is something economists call time inconsistencies, meaning my actions of today, maybe eating that extra cookie, are completely inconsistent with my stated goals of tomorrow, losing weight.",
        "So when a contract binds people to losing a certain number of pounds by a certain date, it may help bring today's actions in sync with tomorrow's goals."

        "It's worked for me.",
        "Ayres lost 20 pounds last year, and an ongoing bet helps him keep it off.",
        "He loses $500 a week if his weight starts to inch back up.",
        "The big question is, can it work for other people too?",
        "Ayres and his colleague Dean Karlan think it can.",
        "They've recently started a Web site.",
        "They call it StickK.com, that's stick with an extra K.com, as in stick with it.",
        "It's a free service that will send you email nudges and reminders, help put you in touch with the virtual community.",
        "If you don't meet your goal, your money goes to charity or a person you designate.",
        "Ayres and Karlan may ultimately make money through advertising if the site's successful, and they also hope to form partnerships with perhaps gyms or other clubs where people could weigh in and verify their goals are being met.",
        "This concept of gaining weight loss may become trendy, says economist John Lynham of U.C.",
        "Santa Barbara, but it's not exactly new.",
        "Since about 1993, William Helm(ph), a bookmaker in the United Kingdom, has been accepting bets from individuals who want to bet on their own weight loss.",
        "Lynham has studied the results of about 50 bets and finds the London betting house is often the winner.",
        "We find that about 80 percent of people lose their bets.",
        "Despite these failures, Lynham says he thinks the concept of StickK.com may be a winning one.",
        "He explains the betting house sets people up to lose by upping the odds and pay off on huge unrealistic amounts of weight.",
        "Structured differently, like StickK.com hopes to do by helping people set incremental, measurable goals, the results may be different.",
        "As for law student Julia Good-Stefania, who took the job of professional nagger, she says she's intrigued by the commitment system, but she's not interested in a formal contract for herself, at least not this spring."
