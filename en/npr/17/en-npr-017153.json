        "And it was the suddenness of the problem appearing, because there was also a recession.",
        "And, in fact, that recession helped precipitate it.",
        "But what came out of that experience was the birth of the supportive housing movement, which simply means shelter - an efficiency, a studio apartment that includes some services; substance abuse prevention; job and employment support; education support - some supportive services that recognize that people may have a pre- existing condition, when they come into shelter, that requires some support, in order for them to get back on their feet."
