        "And it's funny, too, because prior to that the lawmakers only worked from November to May and then they disbursed, you know, went home.",
        "And it's funny because most people say this may or may not have been a good idea to allow them to work 12 months out of the year.",
        "When did air-conditioning become a staple of the middle class?",
        "Well, actually it started in the '50s when sales exceeded over one million units, and then each decade it increased enormously, to where now today probably 82 percent of all homes either have room air-conditioning units or central air-conditioning units in America.",

        "Too often, they return with new injuries, and sometimes they don't make it.",
        "In Baltimore, the city health department has pitched hospitals a bold way to stop that revolving door.",
        "NPR's Andrea Hsu reports.",
        "The idea built on the city's Safe Streets program which hires ex-offenders to step into other people's conflicts.",
        "Violence interrupters, as they're called, use their street cred and deep social ties to talk sense into people and settle fights.",
        "Now, the health department is saying to Baltimore hospitals, give our Safe Streets guys access to patients who have been shot, stabbed or beaten up.",
        "Let them get to work before the patients go home.",
        "The idea comes from Chicago, where the group's CeaseFire is already working in four hospitals.",

        "I asked Stansbury if she ever have reservations about granting hospital access to guys with criminal histories.",
        "No, no. It makes sense to me as a social worker to have people that have walked the walk, who certainly understand what the issues are and the troubles and the barriers and obstacles that people face, that they only help me do my job better.",
        "Today, the health department is trying to revive the concept in a bigger way.",
        "They want to get six or seven hospitals on board and hope eventually the hospitals will pay for it.",
        "For each of those hospitals, the cost would be somewhere around $100,000 a year.",
        "That would cover two violence interrupters per hospital and someone to oversee the program."
