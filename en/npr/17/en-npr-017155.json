        "And it's a very, very interesting group.",
        "And they were all people - certainly the men were people who were just too young to fight in the First World War and whose brothers, perhaps, or whose fathers had fought in it.",
        "Through all the frivolity and all the sparkle, it was a very pessimistic age that was always looking over its shoulder at the black dog trailing it, so to speak.",

        "Like most youth movements, it all started with just a small group of friends who were setting out to enjoy themselves, simply decided they wanted to pass the later part of the evening by having a treasure hunt.",
        "They would be given a list of items to collect.",
        "And as they were all terribly well-connected and knew everybody in upper British society, these items would be things like the Prime Minister's pipe or a pair of corsets belonging to a celebrated actress.",
        "And they would be sent off to gather them.",
        "And by the mid-1920s, when the newspapers had taken it up in a big way, then gradually the movement spread out beyond central London.",
        "Newspapers embraced them.",
        "It's a symbiotic relationship.",
