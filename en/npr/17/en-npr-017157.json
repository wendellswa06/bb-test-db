        "The researchers looked at monitors from throughout Europe that measure the amount of carbon dioxide coming up from the ground, and they gathered information about crops from the region.",
        "Normally, plants in Europe soak up a lot more carbon dioxide than they produce.",
        "But Ciais now reports that was clearly not the case during the heat wave and drought of 2003.",
        "We have estimated that during that particular year the consequence of these extreme summer conditions--the plants in Europe, they have outgassed about a half a billion ton of carbon into the atmosphere.",
        "To put that in perspective, human activities in Europe usually contribute 1 billion tons a year.",
        "So this is half as much as the carbon dioxide that pours from tail pipes, chimneys and smokestacks.",
        "It normally takes the green plants in Europe four years to soak up that much carbon dioxide.",
        "So suddenly you have a climate spell and you are undoing, essentially, everything which was taken up during four consecutive years before.",
        "Ciais cares about carbon dioxide because this gas traps heat in the atmosphere.",
        "It's been building up rapidly as a result of human activities.",
        "The rate would be even faster if plants didn't capture a lot of the carbon dioxide that we emit.",

        "This extreme event here will be somewhat normal in 30 or 50 years from now.",
        "The big question we all want to know is: Can forests adapt to this rapid change in warming?",
        "Baldocchi notes that forests in the United States have adapted to much warmer temperatures than those typical in Europe.",
        "And it's also true that carbon dioxide is a plant fertilizer.",
        "So in the absence of extreme events some scientists say plants might actually grow more vigorously as this gas continues to build up.",
        "Baldocchi says that may or may not prove to be the case, and he notes that the drought also seems to have harmed the soils in Europe and, as a result, the plants didn't bounce back entirely the following year even though the weather was much more favorable.",
        "So these are also interesting questions.",
        "You know, if you have an extreme event, does it have lingering effects down the road?",
        "And the initial data's starting to show that.",
