        "The juxtaposition of images; the mix of brilliant, playfully somber, reinvented syntax overlaid on classical forms - some of the same qualities that had launched Cummings' reputation among fellow modernist poets of his own young manhood thrilled us rambunctious, undergraduate English majors, and drove us to exclaim aloud that news about Buffalo Bill.",
        "We had no idea who Cummings, the man, was, what kind of life he led, this Boston Brahmin and what, after his education in classic English poetry at Harvard had driven him to write these lively modernist lyrics so admired by Ezra Pound, Marianne Moore, William Carlos Williams, and other fine poets of the American century.",
        "With the help of a few earlier, groundbreaking books about Cummings, Susan Cheever has changed that situation for current and future generations of writers and readers.",
        "She's put together a smart and readable portrait of this artist as a seemingly perpetual young man whose adult years were filled with personal despair, jumbled politics, a mix of anti-Communism, polite anti-Semitism and American self-actualization as well as family heartbreak.",
        "After graduating from Harvard, Cummings served as a World War I ambulance driver for a short period and served prison time in France as a result of it, and at his father's urging wrote a powerful personal account titled \"\"The Enormous Room\"\" about that experience.",
