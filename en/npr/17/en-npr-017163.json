        "I'd like to think that we're getting smarter about the distinction between athletic accomplishment and personal virtue.",

        "Some describe that move as martial law.",
        "That came after President Morsi backed down and rolled back some of his newly declared powers, but he refuses to postpone the vote on the draft that some opponents say grants him and his Islamist-dominated parliament far too much power."

        "They are very concerned about where things are going, and one has to remember the recent history here, that is that the military of course took over after Hosni Mubarak was ousted.",
        "And their arrests of civilians and military trials did not go over well here in Egypt and around the world.",
        "I mean, there was a lot of criticism.",

        "They don't want to become involved in this crisis that's sort of a fight between different factions of Egypt.",
        "And you can understand being put in the middle like that, but there's also the irony, for decades the Muslim Brotherhood, the organization to which Mohammed Morsi belongs, railed against the emergency powers decree of Hosni Mubarak.",
        "Yeah, I think it really does demonstrate how concerned Mr. Morsi and his allies are about where this is going.",
        "I mean, in public they dismiss these people as being foreign elements, as being paid by unknown remainders or remnants if you will, (foreign language spoken) they're called here in Arabic, from the Mubarak regime.",
