        "To which people who've never played football say, I don't really get that distinction.",
        "But all of this raises the question: Can we still appreciate sports just as well without investing these competitors with any virtues other than being fast, strong, having great aim, whatever it might be that is purely athletic?",
        "Those could be 10 bums playing there and I enjoy the game just as much - are we capable of that?",
        "Yeah, how do we not become completely cynical about sports is what I think it comes down to.",
        "I think the healthiest approach is to remember that sports are of the moment and that our brains do this naturally when we're watching.",
        "I watched LeBron James and Kobe Bryant exchange dunks last night, and I wasn't cynical at all.",
        "I just saw two guys doing unfathomable physical things, and I was grateful that I could see it, and I didn't ascribe to them any personal values beyond their ability to play basketball extremely well right at that moment.",
        "Sports have been filled with scoundrels forever.",
        "We're going to learn things after the fact about our athletes that leave us with distaste in our mouth.",

        "They did, and you have to also remember that the first constituent assembly was dissolved by the courts.",
        "This is part of why Mr. Morsi decided he had to take on these powers and basically dismiss judicial oversight, because he felt that these courts, which contained judges who were appointed during the Mubarak era, that they in fact were trying to act politically and trying to make his government ineffective.",
        "And so yes, the constituent assembly ended up being virtually all Islamists, most of them Morsi allies.",

        "These are relatively smaller groups.",
        "The main judges have still to issue their decision about what they're going to do.",
        "It's important to remember that this country - in this country right now most of the courts are on strike because of what Mr. Morsi did with taking on these powers and also because of a sit-in that's been going on at the constitutional court, which of course is, well, arguably the highest court of the land.",
        "There's - we could talk about other courts that are here, as well, but the point is that's the court that's sort of been under fine for dissolving bodies like the parliament and the constituent assembly from before.",
        "And so one group of judges said that they would take part if this sit-in was removed, if certain other conditions are met.",
        "And the other group is actually a pro-Morsi group of judges, and they said they would do it.",
        "But that's not really enough to take care of the thousands of polling stations that would have to open for this referendum to take place."
