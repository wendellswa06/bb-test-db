        "And as this process goes ahead, independent people who've read this draft constitution say it isn't wildly more religious than the old constitution was or wildly religious at all.",
        "Are people more upset about process than about content?",
        "Definitely process is part of the problem, but there are a couple of things in this constitution, or more than a couple but at least two major ones, that cause some concern.",
        "One is that it opens the door for al-Azhar, excuse me, for religious scholars to sort of weigh in on law here.",
        "And it's like, OK, then who gets to arbitrate if there's a question of law?",
        "Is it going to be the courts, or is it going to be the religious scholars?",
        "I mean, this is a big question, and it changes the tradition here in Egypt.",
        "And then the other issue is that you have the military, for example, still having control over its budget, over, you know, over the way it acts.",
        "I mean, it isn't really something that's going to be seen or, sorry, overseen by people who are elected.",
        "This is one concern.",
        "I mean, also the president still retains an awful lot of power, which is something that people who were involved in the revolution wanted to see done away with because they don't want somebody who can come in and do what Mubarak did or in fact what Morsi did a few weeks ago.",
        "And we're going to be talking about U.S.",
        "policy right now and down the road.",
        "Of course the United States supported Hosni Mubarak for many years, and his predecessors, as well.",
        "It is - what role is it playing right now?",
        "Well, certainly - there haven't been as many anti-American demonstrations as one might expect.",
        "I don't think the Egyptians who are out on the street at the moment are by and large happy with the fact that the Americans have not come in and said hey, Mr. Morsi, this is probably not a good idea, or - I mean, the feeling is that America's only concern is what Egypt's relationship is with Israel, is the border going to be safe, and, you know, the money keeps flowing in.",
        "And so people here are not really looking, I think, to America, at least people in the streets that I've talked to are not looking to America for leadership or guidance or help on this matter.",
        "Well, is America, is the United States government doing itself any good by sort of sitting on the sidelines?",
        "That's a tough question.",
        "You know, I don't pretend to be a diplomat on this, but it does seem that perhaps voicing something, rather than waiting to see what happens, might be something new try.",
        "It certainly didn't work for the United States during the revolution that ousted Mubarak.",
        "There was a strong feeling among the people here that America just didn't step in soon enough.",
        "I mean, there's a lot of love here for America and a lot of respect for America, and a lot of that's been whittled away over the past two years.",
        "So what's happening now is not really helping America's case."

        "He's backpedaled a bit on that decree.",
        "Critics fear that another authoritarian regime, though, is taking shape in Cairo.",

        "I think 75 percent of Egyptians being against Morsi is an overstatement, but what's certainly true is that there's probably the highest level of discontent with President Morsi right now due to the decrees that he issued on November 21st and despite the concessions that he made on Saturday, taking back the most egregious provisions of those decrees, immunizing himself from judicial review.",
        "I still think there's quite a bit of significant reservoir of opposition in Egypt, but at the same time, his supporters are now also rallying, trying to get voters to go to the polls on Saturday to vote yes on the draft constitution.",
        "And it looks as if they are better organized than the opposition, as has been true from the start.",
        "Indeed, they're already holding both get-out-the-vote campaigns in villages and neighborhoods, they're holding national conferences in which they are going article by article over the draft and telling people that yes, we're telling you to vote yes, but more importantly what we're telling you to do is to try to read the draft and make up your own mind and turn out on Saturday.",
        "Let's turn to Michele Dunne here in Washington.",
        "The United States of course accused for many years of supporting the autocrat in Cairo, and some critics would say you're doing it again.",

        "foreign policy in general and certainly in the case of Egypt is much more reactive than proactive.",
        "And so, you know, we saw last week that - we only saw some statements from Secretary Clinton and then a call from President Obama once demonstrators started turning out into the streets in large numbers.",
        "So I think that the position of the U.S.",
        "and certainly of the Obama administration is to take a bit of a back seat, not to make the United States the issue, and to say as little as possible until things really started getting out of control.",
        "And then they felt that they had to react, they had to say something."

        "That is, each side is trying to accuse the other of trying to gain the support of foreign powers, particularly the United States.",
        "It's a very inflammatory accusation.",
        "And perhaps that might explain why the U.S.",
        "administration is trying to take a back seat, as Michele pointed out, so as not to inflame the situation further given that it's already very, very volatile and unprecedentedly polarized.",
        "Yet Michele Dunne, as you noted, the United States was reactive in the - two years ago when it was Mr. Mubarak whose political future was at stake.",
        "And late in the day, the United States played a crucial role in his removal, but late in the day.",

        "These are not representative of the people, and they know, these guys know that their days are numbered because they'll eventually be appointed out anyway.",

        "Under Mubarak, of course that regime flatly rejected any kind of international monitoring for the obvious reason that there was wide scale rigging.",
        "But kind of ironically, after the revolution, most Egyptians, or at least many members of the judiciary, who see it as their right to supervise elections, have also taken a negative view towards international monitors.",
        "Their argument is that we are able to do this task on our own, and they very much object to the term monitoring.",
        "But they're fine with the slightly less strong term of observation.",
