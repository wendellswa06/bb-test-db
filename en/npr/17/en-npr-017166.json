        "And the other part of that - well, let me turn to Michele Dunne.",
        "Just to add a piece of information to what Mona said about this, I heard from people in President Morsi's administration last week that they did invite international organizations to observe the referendum.",
        "However, that was with very little notice.",
        "It was only two weeks' notice at that point.",
        "It's hard for international organizations to mobilize that quickly.",
        "And now with the referendum being so controversial and possibly violent and so forth, I would doubt if many international organizations would agree to go and observe.",
        "And the other part of Jim's question, Mona El-Ghobashy, who's - which is the side of democracy here?",
        "Both sides would claim we're for democracy.",
        "That's been one of the main themes of the infighting between these different factions ever since the controversy erupted over President Morsi's decrees.",
        "Each side claims a popular mandate.",
        "President Morsi and his supporters, of course, claim that they have the will of the majority of voters.",
        "He was voted in by 51 percent of the vote, a very slim majority, but a majority nonetheless in elections that were perceived to be imperfect but on the whole quite sound.",
        "On the other hand, the opposition to Morsi who are not elected yet they still represent significant segments of Egyptian public opinion.",
        "And ever since the November 21st decrees, their supporters have increased.",
        "They have been able to call out demonstrations in the tens of thousands, not just in Cairo but in all the major provincial cities.",
        "And so now, you have two vying bases of legitimacy as it were, both of them not really seeking to recognize that they both have valid claims, and that's why we are in this impasse right now.",
        "And if the - let's say the draft constitution is approved, there would be another election, no?",
        "Indeed, there would be.",
        "First of all, the first thing that would happen with President Morsi, all of his exceptional powers would immediately revert to the upper house of parliament which remains undissolved.",
        "It's still sitting.",
        "And then within two months, there have to be the procedures that would begin for elections of the lower house of the legislature.",
        "So at that point, the opposition which seems to be better organized, Michele Dunne, might make itself more felt in the next legislature.",
        "Well, that might be a silver lining to this crisis than it's - it's causing the non-Islamist opposition leaders and organizations to work together more closely, but I want to make another point here which is that what we're talking about here is not a controversy over any kind of a law or elections or any - this is the constitution of the country, and it's only going to be able to be amended in the future by a vote of two-thirds of parliament.",
        "I think that the non-Islamist opposition knows that no matter how well they do in the next election it's almost impossible that they would have two-thirds of parliament."

        "Well, if we only look at what had happened last night, of course any violent act should be condemned.",

        "And so whatever constitution passes now, they're going to be stuck with it for quite a while.",
        "This is one of the reasons why in a lot of countries that undergo transitions to democracy it's preferable to convene a constituent assembly and write the constitution before you have your first general elections.",
        "That is before the political forces can go out and test their strength in the public.",

        "It brought some pretty horrific things.",
        "And just because a people is ignorant enough to be able to vote on something that they, you know, nobody - just being realistic, the - 40 percent of the Egyptian people don't read and write.",
        "How are they expected to vote on a constitution that, you know, protects the values of, you know, what, you know, protecting minorities and all these other things?",
        "And so just the argument about minorities - I mean, I'm sorry - about democracy is ludicrous as far as what position the United States should take.",
        "I think that regardless of how this is voted on that it should be made clear that there will be, you know, consequences for, you know, trespassing on the rights of minorities.",
        "I myself am atheist, and I fear for - going back to my country now that this new government is - has gotten hold of what it does.",
        "Mona El-Ghobashy, I'm not sure that the comparison to 1932 is apt, but is there some reality to Ali and other people - so he's not alone - fear that effectively in terms of rights of minorities and women and other such issues this vote will be the last vote?",
        "Indeed, putting aside the very contentious and problematic claim about the rise of Hitler in 1933 which indeed did not occur through elections, but let's put that aside for a second.",
        "The real concern is indeed the role of minorities not just in the constitutional provisions what actually exists right now in the draft that people are reading and considering, but the process by which this draft came to be was especially towards the later stages dominated by the majority of Islamists who again claim the mantle of democratic legitimacy.",
        "And many different kinds of minorities saw that their rights were run roughshod and therefore are not represented either at the table while writing this constitution nor in some of the provisions that are in the documents right now.",
        "And this is something that - unfortunately, President Morsi's decrees simply worsened and reinforced by trying to ram through this constitution or making the public - it makes it seemed as if he's trying to ram through this constitution without adequate consideration of some of the real fears of different kinds of minorities about their particular role in a post-Mubarak Egypt.",
        "And, Michele Dunne, is there some legitimacy to the criticism we heard earlier voiced by Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson of quoting people there that essentially what the United States cares about is stability, the relationship with Israel, the control of the border with Gaza?",
        "What the United States typically cares about is having someone in power in Egypt who will pick up the phone when we call, who will, you know, be responsive to U.S.",
        "concerns and so forth.",
        "And certainly, President Morsi showed himself that way during the Gaza crisis.",

        "But the business has been in a downward spiral for a number of years now and people have a lot of doubts about whether the founder, Jerry Yang, can still keep it a healthy business, and I think a lot of the stockholders and shareholders don't share my romantic notions about how cool it is that he's running things, and they'd like to see someone else come in and Microsoft has been the one that's been trying to step in.",
        "But then I think many of the shareholders and certainly Jerry Yang are afraid that Microsoft only wants to use Yahoo as a pawn and doesn't really have its best interests at heart.",

        "It really is kind of a lot going on there, but if there is some kind of hostile takeover, hostile merger-type thing, how would that affect our everyday lives, if at all?",

        "I mean, for the vast majority of us who just relate to Yahoo as consumers, I mean, Yahoo has been past its prime for awhile, you know, it used to be 'the' dominant Internet brand and it's been fading quite a bit since then.",
        "I think no matter what is the outcome, Yahoo will still be around but it will continue to fade and I think, you know, for myself as a consumer, my biggest question is what would happen if Microsoft does indeed buy it and is hoping to use it to wage a war against Google like that.",
        "Just on a visceral level, that seems frightening to me what would be the prospects there.",
        "But in the short term, I think you know, beyond people whose jobs may be affected at Yahoo, I think there's chance perhaps Yahoo will completely drown in the corporate maneuvering.",
