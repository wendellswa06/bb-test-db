        "So Bill Clegg first wrote about his battle with drugs in a book called \"\"Portrait Of An Addict As A Young Man.\"\" It was published two years ago to enormously positive acclaim, in part because it so shocked people with the honesty, the details of his decline.",
        "And now in his second book, he's telling, in a sense, part two of the rough and painful road to getting clean and sober.",

        "Hello.",
        "So tell our audience what the term 90 days refers to.",
        "What happens during those days?",
        "You know, 90 days is the sort of the goal in early recovery for a lot of people.",
        "In certain programs of recovery, the suggestion is that you go to 90 meetings in 90 days.",
        "And in those meetings there's usually a juncture at which the question is asked: Is anybody counting days?",
        "At which point people will raise their hand and say: I have four days, I have 10 days, I have 22 days.",
        "And it immediately identifies them as people in early recovery, and then particularly after that, if somebody who's had, you know, say, 50 or 60 days and then comes in with one day, you know, it's very clear that that's somebody who needs help.",
        "Well, players say absolutely.",

        "Now, yesterday on ESPN, Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young said what sets the Saints story apart is that the bounty program was institutionalized, in his words.",

        "According to the NFL's investigation, the Saints general manager and head coach knew about it and didn't stop it even when asked to.",
        "And Steve Young noted, this was happening while the league was finally trying to address the concussion issue in a meaningful way.",
        "They're trying to make the league safer.",
        "They're trying to make the league more palatable to the market.",
        "They're not going to have someone die on the field.",
        "And about three or four years ago it was very clear that they were worried that that could happen.",
        "So, on their watch while they're trying to change the nature of how defensive players tackle, under their nose the Super Bowl champions had an institutionalized program to go hurt players.",
        "And so to me that's what differentiated it from all the other stuff.",
        "That's Steve Young.",
        "And Tom Goldman is still with us."

        "Tom felt dentistry in the United States was hollow, after working abroad.�The people there were lined up to see him.",
        "They really appreciated what he did.�If things didn't go perfectly, they didn't hold him at fault.",

        "Volunteering slowly consumed more and more of Grams' life, until three years ago, as he was approaching 50, he finally quit the practice to focus on his travels.� Durango is an outdoor mecca, and like a lot of the people who live here, Grams had a passion for wild places.",
        "He was a backpacker, canyon trekker, river rafter.�The skills came in handy when he was hauling dental equipment into some of the remotest places on earth.��",
