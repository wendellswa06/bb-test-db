        "It didn't look that likely, is what it looked like.",
        "It looked like a city for other people and, you know, other people who, you know, had jobs and were successful and could afford to stay there.",
        "And so I went back because my only friends, you know, who were remaining and my only connection to recovery, I had a sponsor in the program of recovery that I'm in who had - I had met when I was in the hospital.",
        "And he was in New York.",
        "So it was a pretty thin tether, but it was really where - it was the only place where I did have any support.",
        "My only other choice was to go to Maine to live with my sister.",
        "So I went back, but I went back with the expectation that I probably wouldn't be able to stay for very long because I had no money, and I had no prospects to be employed.",
        "Everybody in the industry that I'd been in, in book publishing, knew what happened, knew that I was a crack addict.",
        "And so it just didn't look very likely.",
        "It looked like a pretty daunting place.",
        "And in a sense, your career became recovering addict.",
        "That was your fulltime, let's say, occupation.",
        "It's true.",
        "I - you know, I had had this life before where I had lots of phone dates and appointments and business trips and lunches and dinners, and it was just a very packed schedule, rushing from one thing to the next.",
        "And then when I arrived back in the city, you know, nobody was expecting me to be anywhere.",
        "So I, you know, quickly kind of put together this schedule of meetings and even appointments with other addicts and alcoholics in recovery to sort of create the illusion that I had a life, that I had, you know, people and places that were expecting me to show up.",
        "You also describe having to organize your life in New York ideally - and you didn't always live up to it, and that's where you're so honest in the book - but ideally to avoid triggers to launch cravings that would get you back using again.",
        "So to people who don't know how powerful those triggers are, take a minute just on the power of a trigger and how present they were and how hard it was to fight them off.",
        "Well, you know, particularly in New York, where the footprint of the city is so small, I mean, in Manhattan, anyway, it's a vertical place.",
        "So if you're moving through the city, you're sort of moving through a museum of your life.",
        "You can see where you were, you know, dumped in this restaurant, where you, you know, a building that you had lived in, a place where you had done drugs.",
        "And so when I came back to the city, my sponsor, Jack, had laid out a map, and you know, basically cordoned off certain areas of the city that I was just not allowed to go to.",
        "He called them the trigger zones.",
        "And so, for example, you know, there was, you know, like a two-block radius around the old agency that I'd had and lost that I couldn't go within, the house that I'd lived in before.",
        "Well, part of it is that, you know, as an addict and an alcoholic, you know, all extreme feelings and emotions were things that I, you know, often couldn't handle on my own without alcohol and drugs.",
        "And so if I was very, very happy, or if I was very, very sad or scared, like I often drank and used drugs at those feelings."

        "And so, you know, going - walking in front of the building where I had had an agency that I'd lost because of my drug and alcohol use was a pretty emotional experience.",
        "And without drugs and alcohol, you know, available to me anymore, I just - it was in that early period of raw recovery, you know, it's just that level of emotion triggers oftentimes the need to use.",
        "Or if you see a place where you've done drugs a lot, it can trigger a craving and that memory of using.",

        "And yes, it also led to relapse.",

        "Hi, thanks for having me.",
        "Sure.",
        "Yeah, so I have been clean since March of 1998 from my drug of choice, and for me in the beginning, for the first six months I did what they recommended in the hospital, and I went back to work, and I made 90 meetings in 90 days, and I got a sponsor.",
        "And then six months later I relapsed.",
        "So something wasn't working.",
        "And then I tried again.",
        "And what I found through my struggle is that there are universalities in addiction that will help you stay clean and sober, but you also, with guides, have to kind of find your own way.",
        "It's not just one way.",
        "And I think for me, being given a prescription, you do A and then you do B and then you do C, and then you'll have a clean and sober life and be OK without drugs or alcohol, was not - it didn't work for me.",
        "Bill, you've mentioned a few times, Bill, that there are different programs.",
        "I think you've actually said that three times in the course of our conversation.",

        "Yeah, I think that there - everybody is different.",
        "I think there are, you know, as Nicki says, universalities in addiction and alcoholism.",
        "But, you know, it's - what works for one person may not work for another, and so my advance always is just keep going and keep trying, and then, you know, if there's a genuine willingness to get sober, which is a very hard state to arrive at if you're an alcoholic or an addict, that willingness to really give up the drinking and the drugs.",
        "If that willingness is there, I think if you keep trying to find the group of people and the program of recovery that will help you, you'll get sober.",
        "And - but I don't presume that my way is the only way.",
        "But the thing that I've noticed, the through stitch for most people who I know who are sober and stay sober, is that they're very connected to the people in whatever program that they're in and that there's a feeling of their experience of being an addict or an alcoholic being useful to somebody else getting sober.",

        "And it was four weeks, and the island had no rooms of recovery, to speak of.",
        "I was actually with a sober friend.",
        "And we had sort of impromptu little meetings just between the two of us, and I thought that there wasn't - I mean, it didn't even occur to me that I would be vulnerable to relapse in a situation like this.",
        "And so at the end of that four weeks, just before I was supposed to fly back home through Bangkok, you know, my friend had asked me which hotel I was staying in, and I said the Mandarin Oriental Hotel.",
        "And he said, oh, well, when I was traveling as a teenager with my family, I had the best gin and tonic in the world in the lobby of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel.",
        "And my eyes became, you know, saucers, and I just - somehow being away from my sober community for that long and hearing that just triggered an obsession exactly as this man just described.",
        "I didn't tell anybody about it.",
        "I sort of - I sort of nurtured that idea of the best drink, just because it's in this lobby of this great hotel.",
        "And, you know, I checked into that hotel and got into my room, and I poured a drink.",
        "And I went through those motions as if I was being, you know, controlled by a remote control, knowing full well what the consequences might be.",
        "And so...",

        "Why was silence dishonesty?",
        "Because, I mean, just not being honest about a relapse in the rooms of recovery, that's - you know, for me, there's nothing more dishonest.",
        "And pretending to have more sober time than I did - no, that's just - that just doesn't work.",

        "And my experience was that I relapsed at five and a half years.",
        "You know, I was ashamed of it.",
