        "Julia in Knoxville, Tennessee has dropped an email to us, and she asks a very brief question: What if you don't do well in group settings?",
        "The fear of going to a group meeting is almost worse to me than my addiction.",
        "I totally relate to that.",
        "Public speaking for me or speaking even in front of a handful of people is my greatest fear.",
        "And so the idea of going into a room of strangers and being honest about the things that I had been secretive about and ashamed about my whole life was just as she describes, you know, just worse than almost any other thing that I can imagine.",
        "And - but I think that that fear of being with people and in group settings and that instinct to isolate is very typical, at least in my experience with alcoholics and addicts.",
        "And I would say to her, you know, to just go.",
        "And even if you don't want to speak or even raise your hand, just keep going.",
        "And I think once you begin to hear a version of your own story through the stories of other people, it breaks down that sense of disconnection and that sense of isolation.",
        "And at least in my experience - and I never was a joiner.",
        "I never thought that I would be part of any community, particularly one that, like, involves being honest about things that you're ashamed of...",
        "Were you uncomfortable with kind of 12-step lingo in the beginning?",
        "I was just - I was uncomfortable about, you know, walking into rooms of people who I didn't know and being honest about things that I had kept secret my whole life.",
        "And in terms of lingo or, you know, all the phrasing around recovery - you know, I worked as a literary agent and, you know, mostly with literature.",
        "So I was very dismissive of the phrases and very dismissive of things that I thought were just sort of one-size-fits-all, you know, prescriptions for life.",
        "And, you know, now I cling to those very phrases.",
        "I love them.",
        "I use them.",
        "And I think because, you know, a lot of alcoholics and addicts that I know suffer from something called - that we call in recovery terminal uniqueness.",
        "And, you know, I think we resist any lingo or any phrasing or anything that, like, attempts to describe in any universal way the experience that we've gone through because we're very persuaded that it's singular and subjective and not translatable to anybody else.",
        "And I think that's the big revelation.",
        "It was for me, going into the rooms of recovery, that my experience was so much like every other person's, and I had just been so convinced that nobody could possibly understand.",
        "Just so we know what we're talking about, what are the kinds of phrases that you once scoffed at, that actually have meaning for you now?",
        "By the time you finish hearing this, you may want to cancel your trip, or at least take the train.",
        "An annual study of airline quality shows that the industry deteriorated in every major area last year.",
        "Oh, you know, things like feelings aren't facts, keep it simple, one day at a time, things like that, and which, you know, when, you know, you're three weeks into getting sober and you're overwhelmed with the idea that you're not going to be able to live in New York, pay your rent, ever have a job again, that that feeling feels as firm and concrete as any fact that you've ever encountered, and yet it actually is just a feeling."

        "And when somebody said that to me for the first time, I mean, I just - scoffing is a light way to describe it.",
        "I was disgusted by that phrase.",
        "And then later, you know, I really started to see that so many of these feelings that I had sort of taken as fact, and that had dictated my actions, that I used drugs to deal with and to drink around, that - you know, it actually was incredibly useful.",
        "And, you know, aphorisms and phrases like the ones that are used in recovery, they - it's like what they say about, you know, stereotypes.",
        "They - they're there sometimes because there's a fact at the center of them or there's a truth at the center of them.",
        "So - but most of it is about, you know, sort of connecting your experience to other people's and that there would be language that would describe a common experience with something that initially I was very reluctant to accept.",

        "But what strikes me now, almost 23 years later, is the vivid dream I still have about drinking and drugging.",
        "I wake up in the morning riddled with anxiety, that I've gone back out and ruined my record.",
        "And really the only solution for that, to me, is to return to the program, to return to the people.",
        "And do you do that?",

        "I'm sorry?",
        "I'm saying to Bill that you have more than twice as much experience as he has.",
        "And I'm curious, Bill, whether, in a sense, you see your future in Emily's episode of - you know, that it's kind of forever, is what she's saying."

        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "I mean, I don't - if you have one year sober or 25 years sober, you know, I think you still are an alcoholic and an addict.",
        "You know, you're in recovery, but it's a daily engagement in your recovery.",
        "And so I think I have alcoholic and addictive tendencies that I have to address through a program of recovery every day.",
        "And, you know, that used to seem like a sentence to me, but you know, now I'm just - I'm so grateful because, you know, I often think people who aren't alcoholics and addicts, you know, it would be so great if they actually had the same community that we have, where - you know, alcoholics and addicts take problems that are related to drugs and alcohol into the rooms of recovery and into their sober community.",
        "But they take all the problems of life there too.",
        "And so a lot of what we learn in recovery, you know, is about how to live life on life's terms.",
        "And I think that's particularly hard for alcoholics and addicts, but I think it's hard for people in general.",
        "So...",

        "And I know a lot of this policy and whether it applies depends on where someone is in that process.",
        "Does this policy apply to you?",
        "Well, so any policy that the DOD implements is going to apply to me as a member of the DOD.",
        "I think, specifically, I'll be part of the so-called grandfather clause here and be, quote-unquote, \"\"OK\"\" as we move forward.",
        "And so maybe not in the specific sense, but I think it applies in general that any time you put a policy in place that affects a specific group of people, i.e. transgender people in this case, it's going to affect me, whether directly or because of the implications and the intention behind it.",
        "Well, one of the things this policy talks about is that if recruits who identify as transgender have to use uniforms, pronouns, bathroom facilities based on their biological sex - I mean, when you say you're grandfathered, are you free to serve as a woman, as you, or are you going to face new restrictions on things like that?",
        "No.",
        "So as the policy is currently written, I will be allowed to serve as a woman, as myself.",
        "But again, two years ago, we thought that all trans people coming into the military or already in the military or transitioning would also have that same freedom, and now that has been kind of walked back with this policy.",

        "Well, that's going to be even better.",
        "But as we look back at the career of Joe Lieberman, this is somebody who was a moderate Democrat and raises the question a lot of the times, is there room for moderation in either party?",
        "Well, that's exactly right.",
        "And we saw that a lot of senators who retired this year, including Olympia Snowe and Joe Lieberman, these are people - Ben Nelson of Nebraska - these are people who did work across party lines.",
        "Sometimes they paid for it, and of course Joe Lieberman paid for it, his support of the Iraqi war in 2006 cost him the Democratic nomination for the Senate.",

        "Yeah, yeah, right, no, because though I ran as a - after I lost the Democratic primary in 2006, I ran and, praise the people of Connecticut and the good Lord, I got re-elected as an independent.",
        "But I never left the Democratic Party, and I'm a member of the Democratic Caucus.",
        "So really the question - but the independent hat I'm wearing, I think should be: Is there room for moderation in either of the major parties?",
        "And I think the answer is yes, I hope so, and it all depends on elections, obviously.",
        "But the worrying trend that I see is that the Senate next year will actually have fewer moderate Democrats or moderate Republicans, and, you know, that's not a good sign because ultimately, this place, as diverse as it is, only works if there are compromises, and the compromises occur from the center out, and there have got to be some people in the center to work together to begin those compromises.",
        "Well, you of course were primaried from the left for your stance primarily on the Iraq war.",
        "Yes.",
