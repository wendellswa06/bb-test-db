        "We spend more time and more money and more lives are lost by us going to foreign countries, saying that we're going to spread democracy.",

        "And he had to work a little harder this year to get re-elected, but was re-elected.",
        "So I think the people will elect people that go to Washington, not only to be an errand boy but to, you know, to fight for something different than just seeing how much benefits they can get back into the district.",

        "Not so much when I'm in Washington, but when I travel around the country, I think our numbers are growing.",
        "There are more people involved in the state party level.",
