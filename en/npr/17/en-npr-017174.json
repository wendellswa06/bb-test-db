        "And it's going to be Ohio State against Kentucky there in the men's Sweet 16, also Marquette, something of a dark horse, against North Carolina.",
        "Yes.",
        "And I am very intrigued by a couple of things about Marquette.",
        "They have a great coach, Buzz Williams, who ask him a question at a press conference, he might go on for 15 minutes, but it will be a captivating 15 minutes.",
        "And they play a great offense where no one really has positions.",
        "But the deficit of their team if their defense and the University of North Carolina has great athletic players, so that - both those games should be good games.",
        "I mean, there are a lot of really intriguing Sweet 16 games around the country.",
        "As we look on the other parts of the bracket, three of the four number one seeds have made it through to this round of the men's side.",
        "Right.",
        "And so that's why Cory Booker didn't pick all four number one seeds to advance.",
        "And the exception is Pittsburgh.",
        "They lost that game I was at, also in Washington, D.C.",
        "And Butler, the number eight seed, will be facing Wisconsin.",
        "Now, in that bracket, except for the this is the Southeast and they'll be playing their games in New Orleans.",
        "Except for Pittsburgh, everyone else really held serve, so the two, three and four seeds are in the last - the regional semi-finals, it would be called.",
        "But I think Butler might be - they're not technically the favorite in Las Vegas, but I would give them absolutely as equal a chance as Wisconsin, or the winner of the game between BYU and Florida.",
        "I'm also really interested to see how BYU does.",
        "Like a lot of people, I had thought that the exclusion of their great post player, Brandon Davies - and he was kicked off the team for violating the school's honor code - I thought that would really hurt BYU, because they have no inside presence.",
        "But they have just about the best guard in the country in Jimmer Fredette, the best college guard.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So I thought they might fall apart and a lot of people did, too, but they've been fantastic in their first two games.",
        "We'll see how they do against Florida.",
        "We'll see if they win that game, if they could make the Final Four.",
        "And if they do - I mean, I was talking to a friend who considers himself a basketball fan but not an NCAA fan, and he said, I think I can name two guys in college basketball, Kemba Walker and Jimmer Fredette.",
        "And both of those guys, Kemba Walker of UCONN, Jimmer Fredette of BYU, are in it.",
        "And I think those guys are the types that can really captivate the public's attention.",
        "And the one bracket we haven't talked about is in the Southwest, where there you have the real Cinderellas.",
        "Yes.",
        "Except for Kansas, the number one team, every other team in that bracket is a double-digit seed.",
        "So Richmond, the 12 seed, they're going to be playing Kansas.",
        "Then another school from Richmond - and it's important to note that the city of Richmond has as many teams in the Sweet 16 as the entire Big East conference, which is kind of depressing."

        "And I, as a physical therapist, or a surgeon were to say, well, I think that you need surgery or I think that you need physical therapy, and after that you'll be good to go and you'll be good to serve, but the rules say that we can't actually let you do that, we can't have you have surgery, or we can't treat you.",

        "Do they have an argument, in your mind?",
        "So I think there's a couple of things there.",

        "It's if you actually need treatment for said diagnosis.",
        "Which, again, is this kind of bizarre, to me, gray area where we're now putting medical providers in this place where they have to make a decision about, well, I can say you have gender dysphoria, but if I have to treat you for it then you have to get out of the Army, which just doesn't make a lot of sense to me.",
