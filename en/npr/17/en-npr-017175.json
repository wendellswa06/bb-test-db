        "So that will - Mike Krzyzewksi is a great coach.",
        "He's never really had to do this, kind of allot minutes to a guy who hasn't played and doing it to a team that is a number one seed anyway.",
        "So in the first game, it looked like Kyrie Irving, you know, he contributed well.",
        "They were blowing out Hampton.",
        "But in the second game against Michigan, this didn't go as well, and maybe there were some criticism of how Krzyzewksi used Kyrie Irving in that game.",

        "I was looking at the ESPN prognosticators, their experts, and everyone before the tournament starts play picks their Final Four.",
        "And if you look at experts from the men's side, you'll see a great variation of which teams would play, of course, bias towards the top seeds.",
        "Of the - so there are five experts picking games from ESPN.",
        "That means they have 20 teams, 20 slots for a team to make the Final Four.",
        "And 19 of the 20 were the same.",
        "And I think one of the experts picked Notre Dame to be the only non-number one seed to make the Final Four.",
        "So you have Connecticut, who lost one game, is perhaps more vulnerable than in the last couple of years.",
        "A little thinner than usual.",
        "Yes.",
        "It doesn't mean they're not the best team in the country, but they lost one game.",
        "And yet, Stanford, the team that beat Notre Dame - sorry, the team that beat UConn, then you have Baylor with the - Brittney Griner, who is a captivating and interesting and almost Wilt Chamberlain of women's basketball.",
        "They might have to change some rules around her.",
        "She's dunked in a game -fairly rare in women's basketball.",
        "And then the fourth number one seed is Tennessee, Connecticut's longtime rival.",
        "Pat Summit, a great coach.",
        "And right now, it's looking that all four of those teams could make the Final Four, which would be really what women's basketball fans want.",
        "And I think every women's basketball fans, except perhaps those at Georgetown and Ohio State, would like to see Tennessee and Connecticut face off in the semifinals."
