        "It was opened by President Bush.",
        "President Obasanjo invited all the heads of state.",
        "And it really takes an intense amount of planning, a lot of planning.",
        "We talk about best practices when we come to our summit; we don't talk about how many people are dying from AIDS, or how many people are dying from malaria, or how many people are dying in genocide.",
        "We try to stay positive and keep the discussion and the dialog focused on how we can bring the nations and people of Africa forward rather than always focusing on the negative.",
        "I can recall talking to your father many, many times about this.",
        "And one of the things that he talked about so passionately - it's really what you're focusing on this year, and that is a continent of opportunities, building partnerships for success.",
        "Yes.",
        "And this is really the opportunity of business on the continent.",
        "Yes, yes.",
        "One of our main focuses is we're trying to marshal resources to expand the private sector on the continent.",
        "We're trying to leverage those resources.",
        "And then we're also promoting - and in so doing, we're promoting corporate social responsibility.",
        "So it's really about bringing investment and opportunities to the continent.",
        "You know, for so long, the history of Africa, the history of the nations of Africa have been a history of people taking, of companies taking, of other nations taking.",
        "And now, we really believe this is the time to give back to Africa.",
        "So we're trying to marshal resources in support of her, in the support of her countries, in the support of her people, and give them opportunities that have been denied for so many years.",
        "You have some heavy hitters in terms of business coming to be involved in the summit.",
        "I know that Chevron...",

        "We're trying to build a base of a strong labor resource on the continent.",
        "Everybody talks about the national - natural resource of the continent, but what they don't normally talk about is the vast human resources in Africa, and that's what we're focusing on.",

        "But you have to willing to sort of look beyond those comments, those expectations, and implement your style of doing things, and not necessarily trying to emulate your parent.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And that has been the challenge, to have people accept you for who you are and not always look at you in terms of that memory of the parent.",
        "Let me ask you this as an exit question, and that is what will constitute for you a successful summit?",
        "You know, that's an interesting question, because I used to think of it in terms of how many people were there, how many delegates showed up.",
        "But this time - I think that as the summit movement grows, we become more concrete in terms of our outcomes.",
        "It's about really doing the work and making sure that we can come out of the summit with some solid initiatives."

        "Did the political appointees who came in with the new administration just not trust you?",
        "I think I never had the opportunity to even get to know them or make my case.",
        "But my own impression - if I had to sum it up, what I encountered during my 15 months working for this administration was what I would call a toxic mix of incompetence, indifference and bias.",
        "Incompetence in terms of the failure to fill key positions, which continues to this day - as of now, we're nearly at the two-year mark in this administration, and we have 25 embassies with no ambassador and no nominee even named.",
        "Indifference because I have seen a failure to appreciate the value of diplomacy but the value of the public servants who carry out this work every day.",
        "You also said bias.",
        "Uh-huh.",
