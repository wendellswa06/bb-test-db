        "You would literally blow into the phone, in the microphone, and use the multi-touch to actually choose the different pitches by holding down different finger holes that are rendered on the screen.",

        "You know, how can we provide new ways of thinking in terms of how people go about making music or playing music together, or performing music or composing?",
        "That's how orchestra member Jieun Oh feels about MoPhO.",
        "She played the flute in the Stanford Symphony Orchestra through her undergrad years.",
        "Although she still loves classical music, since joining MoPhO, Jieun is excited that their music has fewer physical limitations than a traditional orchestra.",
        "At first, she thought that mobile phones had a narrow musical vocabulary.",
        "I thought things more in terms of kind of ringtones, but I realized it's not so passive like that.",
        "Since playing in MoPhO, Jieun has found that these palm-sized computers have expanded her appreciation of how she makes music.",
        "Computers can have the potential to generate, you know, any kind of sound that you can imagine.",
        "Not only does she find she can study music in new ways since she joined MoPhO, but she's having loads of fun.",
        "There's a piece called \"\"Drone\"\" that's been programmed for the iPhone, and if you gently shake the phone in a vertical direction, it makes this really rich and funny tambour, like boing sound."

        "It's not that the reserves are depleting; it's that they're using too much of their own oil.",
        "One of the strangest facts about Saudi Arabia is that its biggest domestic-management problem is an energy shortage.",
        "And the reason it's short of energy is that it is rapidly industrializing, and its natural gas supplies are limited and committed to its industrialization program, the petrochemical plants.",
        "As the population rises, the demand for water creates an insatiable demand for energy because all the water comes from desalination, and the desalination plants are huge consumers of electricity.",
        "It's now a consumer society, where the population is about 80 percent urban.",
        "Everybody has air-conditioning and TV appliances, and all the gadgets you could want.",

        "You can imagine what it takes to air-condition Saudi Arabia in the summertime.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Long story short - they need vastly more electricity, and the only fuel they have available for generating it is their own oil.",
        "In the summertime, they're using - at some point - 25, even 30, percent of their production domestically.",
        "They want to stop doing that, for obvious reasons.",
        "Since they don't have enough natural gas, they're looking for other sources of energy, and they are theoretically committed to nuclear as a big part of the mix.",
        "Anytime a country embarks on a nuclear program, especially in the Middle East, this would raise some red flags for the United States, wouldn't it?",
        "I mean, is this a program the U.S.",
        "supports?",
        "Well, you might think so, and I guess there was a time when the words \"\"nuclear\"\" and \"\"Saudi Arabia\"\" in the same sentence would have sent people screaming from the room.",

        "Bush signed a memorandum of understanding with the Saudis in which we, the United States, pledged to help them develop their commercial nuclear program.",

        "Saudi Arabia is also planning a major investment in solar and wind.",
        "Is this likely to be enough to solve Saudi Arabia's energy problem, or is there still a justifiable fear that the country could lose its energy dominance, its influence writ large in that neighborhood?",
        "Well, it's not a question of Saudi Arabia running out of oil.",
        "They have plenty of oil.",
        "What they're more worried about is running out of customers.",
        "Because the inevitable upward drift of prices, as the new oil that's found is more and more expensive oil, they're afraid they'll reach a point where people will really stop buying it and go on a crash program to switch to other sources of fuel, more likely in the United States and Europe than it is in China and India, but still it's a long-term concern.",
        "How is Saudi Arabia's energy situation connected to its political influence in the region?",
        "Well, I would say not as closely as it used to be because its principle customers now are in Asia.",
        "The biggest customer for Saudi oil since 2009 has been China.",
        "And I think the Saudis have no political influence in China nor do they really want any.",
        "It's strictly a mercantile relationship between willing seller and willing buyer.",
        "Saudi Arabia's position in the world is now no longer entirely a function of oil in the sense that it's a member of the group of 20 industrial nations, it's a member of the World Trade Organization.",
        "Its influence in the world now, I would say, is more a function of its position in Islam than it is of its position in oil."
