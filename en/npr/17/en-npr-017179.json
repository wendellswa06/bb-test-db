        "Reverend, let me ask you this: as--and you and I have privately talked about this - as we move into the twilight years for many of those who've been on the front line of the civil rights movement--we lost, obviously, Mrs. King and Rosa Parks most recently - what would you like to see the community do, not only to commemorate the legacy of people like yourself and others but to continue the fight?",
        "Well, I think--I said at the beginning of my remarks that, how marvelous it was the these Presidents and the state governor came to the funeral and mourned and praised, but then I said, in the morning, will the words turn to beads that meet needs, and that what we need to do.",
        "We need to move from ceremony to sacrament, to translate praise into policy and practice.",
        "I said to the governor, you know, Mrs. King was in state in honor at the Georgia capital where Martin couldn't because of the governor, Les Maddox, who would never have it, but at the same time, in that same capital, they are passing legislation that restricts voting rights, so it's sort of contradictory to have a woman who symbolizes voting rights in the rotunda and then in the legislative corridors, pass legislation to contradict and even defame what her life represented.",
        "That - I'd like to see us translate praise into policy and practice, ceremony into sacrament.",
        "Reverend, before I let you go, a final question for you.",
        "Again, I've always said you are one who doesn't worry about the aftermath.",
        "You speak what you believe.",
        "Those who followed, leaders of today - do you hope, do you wish that they would do a little bit more of what you and others had done and not worry about the aftermath, be less calculating if you will?",
        "Well, you can always hope that people who are in the midst of the struggle will speak truth to power and not worry about the politics of it nor the consequences nor the criticism nor the praise but to do what they have to do.",
        "It's a calling.",
        "I wish I didn't have to enter into this arena of controversy sometimes, but that's what I feel called to do, and as I have to respond and that's what I hope all leaders would do, to be true to their calling and to speak truth to power.",
        "Well, you've done that for years.",

        "I mean, so I thought it was important that you not do that.",
        "And also, they were trying to sanitize the message anyway by not having recognizable civil rights leaders who had spoke, who had worked with Dr. King, not allowed him to share the platform, like Reverend Jackson, who also called Coretta King to let her know that her husband had been killed."

        "So, having sad that, though, I mean, so I thought it was a good mix, and as Dr. Lowery just said, it was done in the right tone and everything, but I don't want to--you know, everybody clamor about Clinton and his speech and everything--I don't want people to miss something that Jimmy Carter said, not the attacks - I mean, they were necessary.",
        "He should have done that.",
        "But there was a moment there he acknowledged that he, a white southerner, would not have been elected or even considered a serious candidate for president in 1976 had it not been for Dr. King and Coretta King, and to me that was a moment like Bill Clinton had said about Ron Brown--you know, had it not been for him, I wouldn't be elected president, and I thought that was a tremendous acknowledgement of the contribution of African-American leaders and the black vote.",
        "Yeah, speaking of Daddy King and Mrs. King, you mentioned Jimmy Carter.",

        "Edgar Hoover and between Lyndon Johnson, and it was very difficult, painful relationship.",
        "We had four presidents at the funeral yesterday, but there was not a president at all at Martin Luther King's funeral, so that says both how far we've come, but it also says, the reason why it's so important for us to be political--and I saw nothing wrong with the politicization of that funeral yesterday.",
        "I know, I want to site another white president, Bill Clinton, in terms of his remarks.",
        "It was interesting that it took him to make the case, both about the fact that Coretta Scott King was a human being--she was not an icon that we should put up on a pedestal.",
        "She was real.",
        "She was human, and we should learn from her human frailties as well as her successes.",
        "And also the point he made about the King Center and the fact that African-Americans, perhaps, have not--especially wealthy African-Americans--have not put their feet forward on saving and resourcing that center.",
        "It took a white president in that environment to say that, so thank God for politics.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Eric Deggans, one of things for those that like to the political temperature of the nation, at least black America, if you believe the crowd that sat in that massive church, this bodes well for a possible run for Mrs. Clinton.",
        "We heard the President talking about present and past presidents, and then we heard someone from the crowd, as she stood next to her husband, future president, meaning Mrs. Clinton.",
        "How much do you think that's a barometer of things to come?",
        "Well, you got to bear in mind that Hillary could not have been at a more friendly crowd.",
        "I mean, if anybody was going to embrace her, this crowd was going to embrace her.",
        "Polling just consistently shows that she's an incredibly polarizing figure, and as--I couldn't help but watch Bill Clinton give his speech and wish that we could get a third term out of this guy.",

        "So I think, George, that's why he backed off.",
        "He doesn't want to be perceived as a political street fighter right now.",
