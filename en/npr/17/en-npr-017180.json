        "Absolutely.",
        "And so he's taken to the public airways and he's criticized him publicly; and Obama, suitably chastened, has sort of stepped back.",

        "I think the question here is what does this really mean for reform?",
        "And I think we should be troubled that maybe a tempest in a teapot it may have blown over, but the fact that two very respected, high-profile, bi-partisan figures are bickering over, you know, semantics and over the structure of a committee or of a task force, I think, doesn't bode well for the future of any bi-partisan discussion on this issue.",

        "And I will warn folks that normally we do not use this word, but there is a differentiation that has to be spelled out and I don't know any other way to do it, so we're about to use some graphic language for those of you who might want to turn your radio off just for a second if you will, or turn it down at least.",
        "In Kentucky, we are finding that a teacher used the N-word in it's slang form; and yes there is a slang form even of the N-word and that nigga, N-I-G-G-A, versus nigger.",
        "This is his explanation: when he told a black student to take a seat, he said, sit down, N-word.",
        "The teacher is suggesting that he used the slang term and because he used it in that version, he said all the kids use it.",
        "He said he was trying to relate to students and thought it was no longer a racial slur or offensive because he put the G-A on it versus the E-R.",
        "Eric Deggans, is this any room for credence here?",
        "Well, you know, once again, we've got this sort of intersection of a teacher with questionable judgment with our own sort of conflicted history regarding this word.",
        "You know, any white teacher in their right mind would realize that using any form of that word towards a student is something that's ill advised, to say the least.",
        "So, this guy has questionable judgment.",
        "News reports have delved into his history of discipline and resisting policies of the school administration; it's well known.",
        "So, this guy's a loose cannon.",
        "But, apart from that, we sort of have our own conflicted relationship to this word where black folks want to be able to use it with each other, but they don't want white folks to use it...",
        "Right."

        "I think when this happens, certainly from a teacher's standpoint, the penalty needs to be severe to send a real message out there.",
