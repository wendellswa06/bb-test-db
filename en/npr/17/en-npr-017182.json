        "You had some experience with that.",
        "I did, and it's been a while, but when I first got out of college in the '80s, I went to cover a Dodgers game, and a player from the visiting team, the St. Louis Cardinals, Terry Pendleton, was from the area where I worked in Southern California."

        "I was kind of looking for him and felt something smack me in the head, and it turned out to be a jock, and it turned out to be a very angry player who was unhappy I was there and came up and asked if I was there to work or to look at something I won't mention on this family program.",
        "And so I immediately, being my first experience with that, I quickly turned around and ran out of the clubhouse.",
        "And was it a while before you went back in?",
        "No, you know, the great thing that happened after that was that Terry Pendleton, the player I was interviewing, immediately came out, apologized for the other player, gave me the interview and made a point to say not everybody's like this.",

        "Well, really, the movement started in the mid-'70s.",
        "And that's when we saw women really forging this new frontier in sports journalism.",
        "And then in 1978, they got quite a boost because that was when the first big lawsuit was filed, and it became known as the Melissa Ludtke Rule.",
        "And Melissa filed they filed a suit in her behalf because she was kept out of the locker room during a major league baseball World Series.",
        "And a year later, the courts ruled in her favor.",
        "And basically what they said was that Major League Baseball violated the 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause, which goes back to harassment in the workplace.",
        "And so that opened the door and was a very precedent-setting case.",
        "After that happened, there were a lot of people who said, well, look, maybe what we should do, instead of making the players available in the locker room after the game is make them available - give them some time to dress and then put them in a news conference, and maybe that would work.",
        "Well, Paola probably can talk a little bit more about that than I can, but what the women told me, I wrote a piece for American Journalism Review in 2005 on this, and I interviewed women sportswriters, including Paola, all over the country.",
        "And what I was hearing them say is that's not the way it works.",
        "I mean, it doesn't work that way for the male reporters, and we really need to be in there as soon as possible, win or lose, to get the best story.",

        "I am disappointed with whatever mistreatment that she suffered once she was at the Jets practice facility, although when I read the material, she herself says that she was simply made uncomfortable, and she does not point to any specific things that were said to her or any physical mistreatment of any kind.",
        "So I'm not sure about that.",
        "But to the deeper point here.",
        "I'm an NFL fan, and there are some established journalists, we all know their names.",
        "Their names are Pam Oliver, Andrea Kramer, Suzie Kolber, Michelle Tafoya, Linda Combs(ph), Hannah Storm.",
        "You know, these women have covered the NFL and other sports at a very level.",
        "And when you see them doing their job, the word, one of the first words, perhaps the first word that comes to mind is professionalism.",
        "Now, Ines Sainz is probably a very good person, but she markets herself - and I know I'm going to offend some people, and I really don't care - she markets herself as to first order, a sexual object.",
        "And I'm sorry to say that, but if you Google, you know, if you Google the name Ines Sainz, the first thing that comes up is a large set of photographs, and, you know, the idea that a sports journalist, you know, would actually go to an NFL practice facility or locker room with her business attire applied with a Wagner paint gun is something that kind of flies in the face of the idea of that professionalism.",
        "All right, let's a couple of good points there, David.",
        "Let me turn to Sherry Ricchiardi.",
        "Well, I guess everybody has to start somewhere.",
        "You'd not going to be Hannah Storm on your first visit to the locker room.",
        "Well, and the fact is that the Hispanic media market differs from ours, somewhat.",
        "And I believe that it's clear, and I haven't watched a lot of Mexican television, but from what I've seen in the reports I've read, the media culture is different.",
        "If you look at the anchors, the game show hosts and even the soap operas and certainly the sports writers, you'll see a more steamy side to it than you would see here.",
        "And I think it's obvious that Sainz knows what sells on Mexican TV, what her bosses want, and she's clearly been successful at marketing herself."
