        "She held, in Super Bowl 2009, she held a competition for the biggest biceps and ran around with a tape measure, measuring the biceps of the players.",
        "And Paola Boivin, let me ask you.",
        "I mean, once the Jets give her a media credential, she's a working reporter, no?",
        "She is, and that's why, going back to the point of workplace harassment, they allowed her to come in there.",
        "And Sherry makes a great point.",
        "You know, and again, this isn't my media.",
        "It's not the one I grew up with.",
        "You know, we were sort of taught to dress down and be as inconspicuous as possible when you go in these locker rooms.",
        "And so it's difficult.",
        "It's a difficult, awkward situation to begin with.",
        "But the bottom line is the media has a new face now, and while it's, you know, a little bit difficult for some of us to adjust, I think what has to happen now is that teams and leagues just have to prepare their players and their coaches for the fact that it's going to look different, let's adjust, let's educate each other about it and move on.",
        "And while David David makes the point.",
        "I mean, her attire, was that in your opinion, Paola Boivin, professional?",
        "Let's put it this way: It is not something I have ever worn to a sporting event.",
        "But again, it doesn't excuse the behavior.",
        "It's not how I was raised to be, to cover sports, and it's not what we are used to seeing, but as Sherry pointed out, there's a different media culture where Ines came from, and whether it's appropriate or not in my eyes or anybody else's eyes, she was still in a workplace environment and deserved respect.",
        "Okay.",
        "David, thanks very much.",

        "How do you respond to that?",

        "That simple.",

        "Okay.",

        "If there's got to be a change, if there are going to be news conferences afterwards, that sort of access, it has got to be right down the middle.",

        "Yeah.",
        "It's - you know, it's a great question because I think a lot of people ask it.",
        "The league allows male reporters in there.",
        "There's a cooling off period, but the reality is, most of these women leagues are very hungry for attention, and so they are allowed in the locker room.",
        "And the situations, if they're not in other sports, they will go out of their way to allow these people access, whether it's an interview room, whether it's setting up a different interview time, because frankly, they're not getting the coverage that they want in newspapers.",
        "So there's never been an issue of access with the WNBA or other women's leagues, primarily because they've all been starving for attention for so many years.",
        "You mentioned a cooling off period.",
        "Is that applied to everybody?",
        "No reporters allowed in the locker room and - for a certain amount of time?",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's, you know, almost league wide.",
        "In any sport there's typically a cooling off period before reporters can come in.",
        "And that's true in the football games and in the Major League Baseball games?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And, you know, the biggest reason is, one, they're always giving players the opportunity if they want to cover themselves up.",
        "You know, they can always change.",
        "They can always get dressed.",
        "They can always put on a towel or a robe if they want.",
        "So there is a cooling off, I think, you know, an emotional cooling off, but also to be presentable if they choose to be when reporters walk into the locker room.",
        "Dave, thanks very much.",
        "Let's see if - well, Sherry Ricchiardi, as you look at this issue, this seems to have been a fight that was fought and won - I guess depending on your point of view - lost a long time ago.",
        "As you look at it though, this changing media environment where it's much more sexually charged, and in fact in football games, not at the practice field, but at football games, you got cheerleaders playing, you know, hired by the team.",
        "This is clearly a part of the spectacle.",
        "Well, that's true.",
        "But I think professionalism is number one.",
        "And wherever we work, in whatever profession we're in, if we want to gain respect and we want people to view us as equals, then we have to have a certain air of professionalism.",
        "And that's part of what happened here, I think, is that perhaps people felt she didn't have.",
        "I looked at the blogs, and the blogs are running pretty strong against the fact that the she should've had more sense than to do what she did.",
        "Now, I agree with Paola.",
        "She was in the workplace and she should not be harassed.",
        "But there's a strong opinion out there that perhaps she wasn't acting as a real reporter might act."
