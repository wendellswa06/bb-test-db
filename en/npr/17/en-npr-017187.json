        "Nice to have you with us here in Studio 3A today.",
        "Thank you for having me.",
        "And why are you so sure these are improbable results, impossible results?",
        "Well, the results of the election just don't reflect anything that we know about Iran, both from the anecdotal evidence of the last minute surge for the reformist candidate.",
        "Also, the history of voting patterns, what - how Ahmadinejad had done in previous elections, how previous second term presidents had done when they sought a second term.",
        "There's really nothing in these numbers that stands up to much inspection.",
        "They even went so far as to suggest that two of the reformist opponents to Ahmadinejad, lost the very provinces of which their ancestors come from, and they typically vote with some degree of ethnic solidarity in Iran.",
        "So, I don't think anyone takes these numbers seriously.",
        "Had they rigged the election with a little bit more subtlety, I think people would have been unhappy, there would have been a sense of frustration and disappointment, but there probably would have been less of a protest in the streets and you wouldn't have seen really the coalescence of a number of senior political figures including, of course, the primary reformist opponent in the elections, calling for public protest and for the elections to be wholly annulled.",
        "There was an op-ed in this morning's Washington Post that cited an opinion poll conducted in Iran about three weeks before the election that showed people there prepared to vote for President Ahmadinejad about two to one, which is not inconsistent with what happened.",
        "Well, and of course, the Post Web site has done its own analysis of that opinion poll and found it to be somewhat suspect.",
        "It's very difficult to trust polling from Iran, particularly when it's done by groups that are based outside of the country.",
        "But that's it.",
        "I think we just don't know what the ultimate turnout was.",
        "I am perfectly prepared to believe that President Ahmadinejad has a strong base of support both among the military but also among Iran's lower classes.",
        "He's done a very good job of spreading money around the country and trying to build his own base.",
        "And his nationalist message on the nuclear program, his constant accusations -and very specific during the campaign, accusations of corruption among the country's senior leaders - certainly do play to a wider array of Iranians than many of us would have liked to believe."
