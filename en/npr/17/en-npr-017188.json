        "And no matter what actually happens, it's gonna take awhile, there's now going to be an investigation of the election by the Iranians themselves ordered by the senior clerics.",
        "But nevertheless, there will always be a perception, no matter what happens, that this election was stolen.",
        "That has effects first in Iran on the legitimacy of not only the re-elected president but on the legitimacy of the clerics who gave it their benediction.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think this has really changed the nature of the Islamic republic in a very dramatic fashion.",
        "We are not witnessing a second revolution, at least not at this stage, but what we are witnessing is the end of a kind of fractured state in which you had both institutions which represented the popular view and institutions that were wholly unaccountable to the people.",
        "At this stage, the Iranian government will be wholly unaccountable to the people and it will be further divided from its own people in a way unlike anything that we've seen since the time of the revolution.",
        "And it also presents, as you note in your piece, problems for President Obama, who wanted to reach out and hoped that maybe a more flexible president might be there to reach back.",
        "It does.",
        "I mean, there - any outcome other than the one we're facing right now would have been preferable for the U.S.",
        "administration because what you'll have now is a regime which is at war with itself.",
        "I mean, a number of the senior politicians are refusing to accept this outcome.",
        "And unless they are somehow bought off in the next few weeks, you're going to have a divide within the power structure itself.",
        "You will also have a population wholly alienated, and a lot of pressure from not simply within the U.S.",
        "but around the world for the U.S.",
        "to adopt a more strenuous position of support for the pro-democracy movement in Iran.",
        "And earlier, before the election, obviously President Obama waiting until after these results to see who he'd be dealing with, but indicated that American patience with Iran on its nuclear ambitions are not unlimited.",
        "Six months is what he was talking about.",
        "Well, the president has suggested that there had to be some evidence of progress in negotiations before the end of the year.",
        "So it's a bit of a vague timeline but it was a clear indication that we can't simply either way for negotiations indefinitely or negotiate simply for the sake of negotiations.",
        "So, you know, we're in a bind now because it will be hard for any new administration in Iran, whether it's a reconstituted version of the Ahmadinejad government or something quite unexpected in terms of a displacement at this stage of that government.",
        "It will take some time for anyone to come to the negotiating table in a serious way.",
        "The regime is likely to be distracted by its own problems within and the unhappiness of its own people.",
        "Ahmadinejad doesn't appear to be in any way chastened by the experience or the protesters in the streets.",
        "He gave a very smug news conference yesterday in which he did not appear to be backing down in the least, and explicitly said he won't moderate his views or his positions on the nuclear program."

        "So the Obama administration is going to have a very hard time getting the Iranians to the table to talk in a serious way, and it's going to face a lot of pressure from the world, I think, to be identifying more with the democracy protesters.",
        "The other issue the United States would like to see movement on is support for external groups, primary Hezbollah and Hamas.",
        "Yes.",
        "And here, again I - you know, I think no one anticipated that even a reformist win would result in radical departures from past Iranian policies on all these issues.",
        "But everyone recognized that a reformist might put new energy behind negotiations, would be more ideologically flexible on some of the key issues of American concern and will be looking to strike some sort of a deal with the U.S.",
