        "On that one, and I love what he did with The Emotions on - I've forgotten the title of the song now, but he was playing the Hammond B3 with the Leslie and he played it in a manner where, in between phrases, it sounded like birds.",
        "That's incredible.",
        "Yes.",
        "I have never heard it done before then and haven't heard it since then.",

        "Yes.",
        "So, I set out to rebuild the company and put an impossible, as they said, goal there, and that goal was to go and record 28 albums.",
