        "Well, I worked as a professional actor, mostly on stage, for about a decade, and in my 20s I started to go gray.",
        "And I found that I was getting cast a lot as dads and uncles.",
        "And it was kind of uncomfortable for me at that age because I didn't feel I had enough life experience to play those roles adequately.",
        "Again, that's interesting, it was not that you were being stereotyped as old, it was that you didn't feel confident that you could play it.",
        "Yeah, I looked old, and I kind of carry myself a little bit older, but I didn't - now that I'm in my 40s, I feel fine playing older roles, but I had to do a lot of hair dye to go into an audition and be considered for those younger, younger roles.",
        "And did you succeed?",
        "Every now and then.",
        "Directors that knew me would say things like oh, you've done something with your hair.",
        "How do you feel about playing, you know, the uncle?",

        "Retta, you, too, at some point you have to put bread on the table.",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "Yeah, yeah you do, exactly.",
        "But now that I'm older, the older I - give me those dad roles because I'll take them any day.",

        "Well, a friend of mine, who is an actress, has always said that being typecast is not a bad thing, actually, because it helps you to get roles.",
        "But for me, as like, being an Asian actor, especially, I came from Pennsylvania, so it's a small market.",
        "So whenever they wanted an Asian actor, I was the one they called, you know, pretty much.",
        "And there are times - there are times when I say - you know, they would want somebody who was older, like 45 years old, and when I started I was 20-something, and they'd say well, we can't really find Asians.",
        "So, you know, you are it, you know.",
        "And they will like make me up to make me look older and all that stuff.",

        "But so that helped when I was, you know, when I was one of the few Asians.",
        "But the problem is that when - these roles are very far and in between.",
        "So when they cast something else, they never think of Asian actors to fill those roles.",
        "So I never called for any of it, or the other stuff that - when they don't specifically say Asian.",
        "And you also wrote that now that you're in Los Angeles and Hollywood, when they call for an Asian, hordes show up.",
        "Oh absolutely, absolutely.",
        "I was auditioning for a commercial, and they specifically asked for Chinese actors who are in the age range that I am.",
        "So I thought oh, OK, so that can't be too bad.",
        "You know, how many Chinese, you know, actors, you know, with my age range are there?",
        "And I went there, and there were hundreds of Asian actors, you know, from Korean to Japanese to Vietnamese, you know, everywhere.",
        "You know, it's like they don't really care, you know, what the slide said or what the casting sheet says, and they just say well, if it's Chinese, then any Asian can play it, so...",
        "It's sort of interesting, I happen to have been in a Los Angeles casting studio a few weeks ago, and there in the waiting room were a bunch of heavyset 50-ish guys with balding hair, all of whom looked almost exactly alike and all of whom knew each other.",
        "Yeah, absolutely, yeah.",
        "They always - they all go for the same role because they are typecast pretty much, you know?",
        "And yeah, it's a phenomenon.",
        "You tend to get really familiar with your peers in your type group because you see them over and over and over again.",
