        "But what's amazing sometimes is almost the other side of the pendulum, where actors can sometimes totally miss how they want to be typecast, whether it's someone who - you know, typically it would be your typical idea of it would be a woman that comes in for a much younger role, thinking that that is totally, you know, her place, that that's a role she can get.",
        "Or especially we cast for a very natural - an older, an older female lead that was very natural beauty, and someone coming in with a ton of plastic surgery.",

        "Certainly, certainly, and I mean more of the if somebody comes in and they - you know, they're - it's a cold call of some sort, and it's for a - someone that's 18, high school football player, jock type, but the guy is 35, and he's wearing a letter jacket.",
        "And, you know, it's sometimes you want to say what - aren't you - did you wake up and, like, look in the mirror and see somebody completely different?",
