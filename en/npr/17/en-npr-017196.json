        "So you have to decide whether you want to work in these parameters, you know, if you're OK with the dialogue, because there were things that I would go in for, and I thought they were too dirty, like I just - I wasn't a mature actor, and I don't think I could have handled it.",
        "And I - and so there was a point where I would turn down auditions.",
        "I wasn't turning down actual offers, but auditions because I just didn't think I could give it - do it justice because I wasn't comfortable with the material.",
        "And every once in a while you run into that, and if you're OK with that, then that's fine.",
        "It's something you choose.",

        "I won't go up for a part even if it looks like, on appearance is it looks like me.",

        "Well, it turns out that as it warms up, you get more volatiles that come off when it evaporates.",
        "And that's, of course, very enjoyable because most of our taste comes from smell, not actually from inside our mouth.",
        "So let it warm up a little bit before you drink that icy stuff.",
        "That's right.",
        "This also actually applies to beer, Ira.",
        "Let me mention some things.",
        "Many people drink beer just from the bottle.",
        "And while I understand how quickly that is to take in the beer that way, because as I mentioned to you, smell is involved, you just don't get much smell when you put a bottle to your mouth.",
        "Much better is to drink beer from a glass.",
        "Now, what type of glass?",
        "Well, many bars serve frosted glasses.",
        "They think that's quite fancy and wonderful.",
        "But actually, I think that's a bad idea, as does my friend Norman Metzger(ph) in Washington, D.C., who pointed this out to me.",
        "It turns out that if you cool liquids that contain gases, they really - the liquids dissolve the gases better and they - it is the gas coming off the liquid, which is part of the aroma, which makes, again, beer be so enjoyable to many of us.",
        "Now I understand that on a very hot day, nothing like a really cold beer.",
        "But in terms of taste, sipping from a glass that's cool is really quite wonderful.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Now I understand, as I said before, I understand that as for lipstick, lipstick will kill the bubbles?",
        "Well, the bubbles are held together by this sort of membrane of various things that surround the carbon dioxide that's making the bubble.",
        "And when you add something like too much detergent, somebody doesn't really wash out the glass well or some people even rub their nose and then put their finger down.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "And this kills bubbles.",
        "And the oils - any type of oil, including the ChapStick, Vaseline, et cetera, will actually cause the bubbles to burst.",
        "It really destroys the surface tension - makes it uneven and the bubbles burst this way.",
        "So it's very interesting to see and it's very obvious on New Year's Eve, generally, women have less bubbles in their glass of champagne than men do for the obvious reason that women generally wear lipstick.",
        "On the other hand, this thing I just told you doesn't always work, because just like you can have second-hand smoke, Ira, you can have second-hand lipstick.",
