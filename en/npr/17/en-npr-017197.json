        "You know, so that was my first thought, was this is really not the way these sorts of exercises are supposed to be used.",
        "But then, beyond that, I mean, I think what we have - this is emblematic of a larger phenomenon we have going on in the culture, which is that people - both readers and writers - make less and less of a distinction between carefully thought out, edited material and off-the-cuff spontaneous remarks.",

        "And I think that we may, as culture, be sort of moving away from that idea in the name of free expression, and it's hurting our ability to kind of tell the difference between sort of stream of consciousness and material that has been considered.",
        "If I could interject - I agree that, you know, you should have - if you're writing something quite - you know, something with structure, then that's great.",
        "But if you're writing, you know, something - and it could evolve - one day you can come back with a clearer mind one day and edit it and put things that are more insightful and more articulate or just more poignant or something of that nature to re-edit it.",
        "But I'm saying at all times you should have this writing process in mind, but I'm just saying thinking before writing is, you know, it's a good idea.",
        "But whenever it comes to writing something that is just like right in your mind, and, you know, you shouldn't have to think about should I write this down.",

        "Well, I think that I would make regarding that - and I understand what you're saying about this being a different case in terms of the student profile, but teachers are actually responsible to the law as part of our duties in the classroom to actually not make the determination.",
        "That's why it is then brought to someone at the administrative level and to psychologists to make a determination that, in fact, this isn't some sort of deeper-seeded issue that's going on.",
        "And it is, in this case, you know, potentially just a creativity issue.",
        "But I think the important piece is to err on the side of caution.",
        "Because a profile is only a piece of the puzzle.",
        "And anyone who's been in a classroom knows that, you know, any kid at any given time can have many things going on under the surface that you might not be fully aware of."
