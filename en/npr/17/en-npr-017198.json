        "But also the teacher knowing who the kid is and what else he does, so…",

        "Basically, they could only stop people from entering the country or crossing state lines and only for a very specific list of about a dozen diseases.",
        "And for the most part, the CDC didn't exercise the authorities it even had and generally would defer to state and local officials to take control in that kind of a situation.",

        "And this yeast converts the sugar into carbon dioxide and ethanol - the alcohol we enjoy drinking.",
        "And he also, of course, have other things that are leftover from this.",

        "And I need to tell you that most of champagne is actually just water, and water loves water.",

        "Instead, they form on the walls, on the side.",
        "Why?",
