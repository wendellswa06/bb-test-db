        "But the bubbles in the center glass actually have less drag, less friction on them and they rise more rapidly, more easily than the ones on the side.",
        "And the result is they set up a circulation of the liquid.",
        "And bubbles are very slowly moving in beer.",
        "In fact, if you'll notice, champagne has more rapid moving bubbles than beer bubbles.",
        "And we could discuss why that is in a moment.",
        "But anyways, the result is that because of the liquid circulation, the bubbles go down initially...",

        "Now, the CDC, I should say, did not make anybody available to talk to me about this and is kind of downplaying it on their website.",
        "But I talked to a number of health law experts and bioethicists and doctors, and they said these changes are really significant and give the CDC broad new powers that it never had before.",
        "For example, the CDC is no longer limited to just quarantining people when they come into the country or cross state lines.",
        "The CDC could under these rules swoop in anytime, anywhere in the United States and, you know, pull people off of trains or buses or subways if they feel the need to do that to stop an outbreak.",
        "All right.",
        "So what does that mean in practice?",
        "What are the criteria the CDC uses to quarantine someone?",
        "Right.",
        "So under these new rules, they wouldn't necessarily be limited to a very specific list of diseases.",
        "They could detain someone just because they have symptoms that suggest they might be carrying a dangerous disease, symptoms that are pretty common, like a high fever, cramps or a headache.",
        "Why?",
        "I mean, what's the rationale for these new broad powers?",
        "So most people I talked to said, look, the CDC needed to clarify how things would work if they needed to to stop an outbreak.",
        "And if you remember, during the Ebola outbreak, there was a lot of kind of chaos and confusion about exactly how someone could be and when they could be quarantined.",
        "And one big improvement people are saying about this is it does lay out specifically how people's civil rights could be protected if they were quarantined.",
        "All right, but there are probably groups out there who are worried about civil rights and privacy protections in this.",
        "Right, and the concern is that the protections are in there, and that's good, but they don't go far enough.",
        "For example, one big concern is that the rules say somebody could be held for 72 hours before their case could get some kind of review.",
        "But the rules give the CDC itself several layers of review to determine whether they can continue to hold somebody.",
        "And people are saying, you know, that should be - some outside objective entity should be able to step in to make sure somebody isn't being held without good reason."
