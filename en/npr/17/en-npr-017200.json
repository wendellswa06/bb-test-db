        "And is there any significance to this happening under the Trump administration?",
        "Well, obviously it does raise some additional concerns, especially from some of the things we've seen happen over the past week about the way the administration has dealt with immigrants and refugees, for example.",
        "And you also - you might remember during the Ebola outbreak, Trump put out a bunch of tweets saying that doctors and nurses who got sick in Africa shouldn't be allowed to come back into the country to get medical care.",
        "And Trump has described himself as kind of a germophobe.",
        "So there is a concern that if there ever was an outbreak, there might be an overreaction, and these new powers could be abused.",
        "All right.",
        "So what happens next?",
        "When do they go into effect?",

        "And I have to begin by pointing out that conventional analysis is that the neocons who argued for the war in Iraq are out, rejected by conservatives and liberals alike.",
        "Well, the war - Iraq is a mess, and people who advocated the war, as we did, have to take blame for that.",
        "Exactly why it's a mess, whether the policy was executed badly, we should've had many more troops, we shouldn't have dissolved the Iraqi army, or whether it was a mistaken venture in the first place, I think still needs to be sorted out.",
        "And so why is it that those who are responsible for what you describe as a mess are those who would have the solution?",
        "Well, I think there's - that the distinct neocon contribution to the discussion about what our foreign policy should be in the face of 9/11 is something deeper than the war in Iraq, which is that we need to try to change the political culture of the Middle East, that the problem is not just one little group of bombers, but the fact that this - that terrorism is so widely accepted in the Middle East and so many young Middle Easterners are willing to throw away their lives in order to kill Americans.",
        "And something very deep has to change there.",
        "The neocon insight is that the way to change that is to try to promote democracy in that region in the hopes not merely of changing some of the governments but of trying to spread a more liberal way of thinking about the world that would exclude terrorism as a reasonable resort for someone who's got a grievance or an argument.",
        "And I think that underlying idea, that we have to try to change the way the Middle East does politics and thinks about politics, is still a valid idea, and - or it still needs to be further pursued.",
        "And moreover, I don't think anyone else has put another idea on the table as to what we can do about this, if that's not the right approach.",
        "We're talking today on the TALK OF THE NATION Opinion Page with Joshua Muravchik, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.",

        "Well, the damage is very extensive, which is leading to so much loss of life and injuries and making it very difficult for us to get relief (intelligible) in.",
        "Probably the most strategic being the extent of damage to the airport facilities.",
        "So we're having to get all of our emergency relief supplies in over land by truck.",
        "Is it going to be very difficult to do that?",
        "How remote is this place?",
        "Well, Yogyakarta is actually a major city, which is also the cause of so much damage and loss of life and injuries.",
        "But on the other hand, because it is in such a densely populated area, we do as the International Red Cross Red Crescent, in support of the local Red Cross, have a lot of stocks pre-positioned in Red Cross branches in the nearby areas."

        "So as far as the impact, the two are far away from each other.",
        "But because there's been so much capacity built up and so much expertise as a result of the tsunami, we're a little bit better prepared now with emergency supplies and personnel to be able to respond more quickly to this recent disaster.",
