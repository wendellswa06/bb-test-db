        "But is the ideology behind spreading freedom a flawed ideology, or did it not work because of the incompetence?",

        "Certainly I think we should've executed the war differently than we did.",
        "But it may have been that it was a mistake to focus on Iraq in the first place.",
        "Iraq wasn't the first thing we focused on, but focusing on Afghanistan first was kind of a no-brainer, and the question was what to do next after that.",
        "And it may well have been a wiser choice for us to have focused on Iran rather than Iraq.",
        "And by focused on Iran, I haven't said what I mean, because I'm not sure what I mean.",

        "That's a bigger country than Iraq and...",
        "Wait.",
        "You're trying to address the source of the terrorism that struck this country on 9/11, and you find it in Shia Iran, not Sunni Saudi Arabia, where 19 of the hijackers came from?",
        "The fact is that the terrorists who have attacked and killed Americans come from all over the Middle East and from all ideologies.",
        "Al-Qaida is a Sunni group, but the group that has the second-most amount of American blood on its hands is Hezbollah.",
        "And the movement that has encouraged Middle Eastern radicals to become increasingly violent toward Americans, Westerners, is I think best described as Jihadism, and the original, the original source of Jihadism is in Iran.",
        "It was in the Ayatollah Khomeini...",
        "Well, we can debate the source is back in Sunni texts as well, in the Muslim Brotherhood and...",

        "If you could quickly, Rodney.",
        "Well, obviously, when I first supported the war, again, my theory was that we have terrorism and a lot of these things because people don't have economic freedom and they don't have basic freedoms.",
        "So if we were able to go into Afghanistan, so to speak, because we were justified there, and really show that freedom does work, economically, controlled capitalism and freedom, and maybe that would spread.",
        "Now, I think that one of our major problems, also, is that we were lied to.",

        "I think the point of trying to democratize the region is to see democracy as something that socializes and educates people, and particularly that gets them in the habit of resolving their differences by peaceful means, by talking and voting and negotiating and compromising rather than by shooting the other guy.",
        "And let me - we just have about 30 seconds with you left - but I mean this idea that you bring up.",
        "There are no alternatives that you see?",
        "I haven't heard any.",
        "That is, I think on the one hand, traditional conservatives have no answer to such an untraditional threat as we face from the terrorists.",
        "And on the other hand, liberals say, well, we need to fight poverty, because poverty makes people terrorists.",
        "But that's a dubious assumption.",
        "And even if it is, we have no magic way to make world poverty go away.",
        "People have been working at that long before we were confronted with terrorism, and so that's not an answer, either.",
        "I think that our answer of trying to spread democracy in the region may not be right - it's unproven, it's untested - but to this point, it's the only plausible approach that anyone has put out there."

        "And all of these things, all of these efforts, all these programs are aimed at middle and high school students.",

        "So, we use tools through our programs that kids can relate to like video games and others.",
        "To get them connected and then we start to teach them and get them to learn more in better things about science and technology so that they can remove the barriers that are in their minds, or the challenges that are in their minds.",

        "We also consider how our imagery is being portrayed in video games and in technology and bring those social discussions to the forefront.",
        "So, we're really having this roundabout ecosystem of learning.",
        "Not just about the science and tech, but other things that are impacting our kids as well.",
        "Tara it sounds like this is right up your alley as well.",
        "You're with - you wear a couple of hats but one of them is working with the MacArthur Foundation which has this multi-million dollar initiative.",

        "And tell us more about that.",
        "It's really right up the alley of the digital media and learning initiative for the MacArthur Foundation which wants to take very seriously the engagement, children from a very young age through post-college, have with the new media technologies.",
        "And rather than insight some moral panic that kids are playing video games too much, instead really engage the kids and see what they are learning from these forms, and how we need to scaffold those forms of learning to get the kind of outcomes that were just being described so that kids develop literacies around media.",
        "To understand, when you use particular media to communicate certain things in a very visual and audio driven world, how - who controls the media, who owns it?",
        "So, you know when people are trying to sell you something.",

        "One is based in Chicago with Charter and after school groups that's run by Nicole Pinkard out of the University of Chicago that engages children in technology to the production of music which already for urban youth, and in this context mostly African-American youth.",
        "And the southside of Chicago is a very technologically driven and powerfully expressive form.",
        "So, the students learn different technological skills.",
        "In these key aspects of teamwork, by producing music, distributing that online in different formats."

        "What kind of students do you have and how do you get them interested in what you're doing?",
        "I end up with a wide variety of students, both your typical average students as well as the higher level students that one would expect in a computer science or engineering classroom.",

        "And in my case because I am a classroom teacher, relate that material to what goes on in other classroom.",

        "Have you ever had - you probably have had many, but give me an example of an aha moment for a kid when maybe they were like grudgingly going through the course work and then figured out, hey this is really worth something.",
        "Well, I've actually wanted to bounce off of something Tara mentioned in terms of the digital music.",

        "So, from there once they turn that little knob up, they understand what's going on.",
        "They made that parallel.",
        "Suddenly it makes sense on the math side.",
        "So, again through practical applications, you can actually get them into all of the more theoretical stuff more than they learn in other class.",
        "There was definitely a feeling, at a certain point, that those fixed rows of desks were not the way to get kids to learn - not the way to get kids to be creative.",

        "And you know sometimes this was something we talked about in an education series that we did.",
        "Some parents are actually resistant to their kids learning, because of their own bad experiences as children in the classroom.",
        "Do you ever run into cases where the kids are fairly gung-ho but the parents have some fear?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Especially when you're talking about when we launched the Urban Video Game Academy, I mean, just the name of that alone, and I think that Theresa touched on this earlier, I mean Tara I'm sorry, touched on this earlier, the moral panic of video games.",
        "But yes, so there is this fear because they have not grown up with the same tools that our kids today have grown up with.",
        "And they don't quite understand, some parents that is, don't quite understand exactly how these tools can have positive benefit.",
        "And how they actually can relate to core academics and actually relate to powerful careers that can give them a future of sustainability and possibly even entrepreneurship.",
        "So, when we have those types of situations you really have to deal with them very cautiously and you have to show them the connectivity.",
        "If you can show parents, if you can - if parents can open their minds up and just listen and absorb the message that, wait, a video game designer is not just a video game for shooting games.",

        "And how this impacts their child and gives them a sustainable future.",
        "And when you do that, they seem to be more relaxed.",
        "But when you talk engineering in some of the households I've had to talk engineering, it is foreign talk.",

        "Tara, what do you hope is the long-term ramification of the work that you're doing with the MacArthur Foundation, in terms of social justice for example, when you don't have nearly as many percentage-wise African-Americans and Latinos going into high level science as you do whites and Asians?"
