        "There's I think a real potential problem in the future that access to digital technologies, in meaningful context, won't be available to people from lower economic status.",
        "One of my colleagues, Ellen Seiter has written a very interesting book, \"\"The Digital Playground,\"\" that looks at unequal access in, you know, L.A.",
        "and Southern California in elementary schools, the technology.",
        "And I think, one of the hopes of the MacArthur Foundation is to carefully selecting some edge or model projects.",
        "We might model best practices for the future and begin a large national dialog about what kind of infrastructure we need in place for the education system to make sure that we - the digital technologies don't increase the divide between those with access and those without.",
        "And Jerone, you know, my Mom was a teacher for many years and I remember once going out with her and some of her kids for, you know a sort of enrichment field trip.",
        "And we saw this kid, and you know, it was really cold out.",
        "It was late fall, kind of struggling down the street without a proper coat on but carrying an enormous stack of video game cartridges.",
        "And sometimes it seems like the spending patterns in, you know, a lot of our communities are like we will buy the technology and will spend a lot it but learning about it is just not even on the table.",
        "What about, you know, the idea that people are investing in technology but only on a superficial level?",
        "Well, I think it's closer to say people are investing in what they know about.",
        "If you don't know what it means to be an engineer, then you can't pursue that train of a career.",
        "If you don't know that in theory you can actually download the code to create games with an Xbox 360, you'll never go there.",
        "So, you never have that kid who it sounds like if he knew about it back then, would have gone down the I-make-video-game world because obviously he loves games.",
        "So, if he didn't know that he could do that, then he's never going to.",
        "I think one of the big problems is getting it out there, what the possibilities are to all communities, not just those communities who already are conducive to that but to that line of thinking.",
        "Mario, we talked about the billions of dollars that are being made in the industry.",
        "This has got to be a growth career.",
        "I mean, do you hope that some of the kids that you work with are going to go into, you know, not just other science and technology but, the gaming industry and actually start making some money?",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "I mean, what we're shooting for at, first and foremost, is attitudinal change because it points right to his comment of how do we change the attitudes to move you from consumption to creation?",
        "If we can change your attitude at the middle school level, and inspire you to learn about people or exposure hasn't been really talked about too much in terms of role models.",
        "But that's another thing that's key, and then I'll answer your question.",
        "Like, Lani Johnson who is the African-American developer of the super soaker.",
        "When I show this on stage, the kids, when we do our show and we bring a super soaker on stage and we shoot water and we do science experiments on a laptop that can handle it, it blows the kids away that an African-American who was a former NASA engineer, an aerospace engineer, created and made millions off of the super soaker.",
        "When you show them Jerome Solomon, who created or led the team of the video \"\"Transformers,\"\" and the development of those characters, and that they have 10 million polygons, which is geometry language, now you have kids engaged.",
        "So, yes.",
        "I want to see us change the industry.",
        "I want to see us, more importantly, change the pipeline, and we have a lack of diversity in a lot of careers but specifically in the video game industry, we're looking at 5.1 percent of African-Americans in that field.",
        "So, we need to change that and get more women into the science and technology stream as well.",
        "I've been harassed by police.",
        "And even in my state now, I'm a millionaire, they harass me regardless.",
        "Does this make you nervous?",
        "Tara, what about, you know, the practical applications for economic development?",
        "I mean, you know, you are obviously dealing primarily at this point in an educational context.",
        "But, what kind of - not just in terms of people's individual careers but, you know, overall, what could this do for society if people actually do enter this pipeline of creativity?",
        "I think those kind of creative and innovative jobs are the hope for Americans economic future, right now because those kind of jobs are very difficult to outsource or send overseas.",
        "My husband owns a video and animation company and the creative design aspects stay here.",
        "Even engineering might be shipped overseas but being able to think creatively and have design literacy, to understand how systems are organized, how the back end and front end of computers interact with each other are very important skills for the future.",
        "And ones we do a disservice to our young people, when we're not teaching science and math in a way that fires their imaginations, to make those connections on their own."

        "Jerone, what do you hope for your kids?",
        "I mean, what's your hope for the students you're teaching?",
        "Well, I really wish I could rewind her last sentence.",
        "Because that's, functionally, exactly what we attempt to do in the schools.",
        "Really what we're shooting for and we're hoping is going to occur is, as real, letting the students know what is actually available.",

        "Once they're exposed to it, they'll get the hook.",
        "They will do it themselves at that point.",
        "Once you know it's a possibility.",
