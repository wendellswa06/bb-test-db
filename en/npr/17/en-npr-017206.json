        "Nathaniel, you don't live in South Carolina anymore but you do go visit.",
        "Does this description sound a little bit like the black schools of the early 1950s?",
        "Yes, because the school - a lot of the schools, and especially in the poor communities, are still the same.",
        "It's like the case that happened 50 years ago, we celebrated it and we can move on.",
        "But that same school district that brought the case, that changed America forever, is still poor."

        "Joseph DeLaine Jr., what do you see coming out of this that has been positive?",
        "If we look back, many of the changes that occurred after this were not in the schools and they affected every American in this country.",
        "When we talk about the oppression that was there and the sensitivity to denial of citizens, that has changed.",
        "There was an attempt with the schools, however, I don't think that that was successful in equalizing them, and I think there are other basic problems in this country that have to be overcome before we get equalization of educational opportunity in schools.",

        "Obviously big emitters like coal-fired power plants and oil companies will be hit hard, but overall, state regulators say the benefits of the climate program will outweigh these costs and in fact they predict it would actually give California's economy a one-percent boost beyond what it would be under a business-as-usual scenario.",
