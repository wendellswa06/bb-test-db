        "The entire time I sat there saying to myself, Ed, that's BS.",
        "So, naturally, when I stepped to the microphone to get my award, you know what came out of my mouth - that's BS!",
        "Afterwards, so many people came up to me, in a room full of a thousand people, and they all said the same thing: I'm so glad you said that because I'm from that neighborhood, I was raised in that family; I was surrounded by those things, but I decided to go the other way.",

        "I got that all from my mother, Ed.",
        "That all came from Moms.",
        "And she passed away about 12 years ago, but I still talk to her every day.",
        "And I can never thank her enough for just that: the intestinal fortitude and instilling in me the belief that whatever it is you want to do in life, you can do.",
