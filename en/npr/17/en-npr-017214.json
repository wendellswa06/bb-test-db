        "They're not sure exactly how it works.",

        "Whenever anybody makes a big discovery like this, nobody's really sure until somebody else is able to do it themselves.",

        "It's incredibly controversial.",

        "Oh.",

        "From Senegal on the far western edge of the continent to the Democratic Republic of Congo in the heart of Africa, 1960 marked the year the countries broke free from European colonial rule.",
        "So, what have the countries gained from half a century of independence?",
        "To answer that question, we're joined by Howard French, a journalist and author of \"\"A Continent for the Taking: The Tragedy and Hope of Africa.\"\" He's at the studios of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in New York where he is an associate professor.",

        "That's why we've got most of the French colonies in 1960, but also the former British colony, Nigeria, and the former Belgian colony, the Democratic Republic of Congo.",
        "So, it was a huge year for African independence.",
        "Howard French, have the hopes of an entire continent during the wave of independence 50-plus years ago been anywhere near fulfilled?",
        "The short answer is, obviously, no. It doesn't comfort anyone to say so, but we have to put this in perspective.",
        "And to be frank, Africa was prepared for its independence from country to country almost in just about the worst possible way.",
        "Then I think one has to look at the early decades of independence.",
        "Certainly the first three decades, which coincided with the height of the Cold War, in which African politics and economics were sort of buffeted by the interests of outside powers in ways that were deeply harmful to the continent for the most part.",
        "Ofeibea, Africa seems to have some strong leaders and some very poor leadership since independence.",
        "How has this hampered development on the continent?",
        "Well, Howard French mentioned the fact that the Cold War was such a key player.",
        "Africa and different African countries being used as a pawn and some African leaders also using the Western powers, you know, playing one off against the other and then playing the Soviet Union as it was against the United States and so on.",
        "But, yes, because of poor leadership, this has led to civil wars, dictatorships, corruption and so on.",
        "But we tend to forget because of the poor leadership that there have been some good African leaders who have managed to push the continent forward.",
        "There are burgeoning democracies in Africa now, like the tiny island of Cape Verde off the coast of West Africa; Mozambique, which recently has had problems, yes, because people are saying the cost of living is too high, but which after a war has managed to push itself forward.",
        "My own country, Ghana, from where I'm speaking to you now, on the verge of becoming an oil producer.",
        "So, African leaders do have to take a lot of the blame for the continent having gone wrong.",
        "But also the West has to take a lot of the blame by imposing what it thought was best for the continent.",
        "Howard French, what do you expect for Africa in the next 50 years?",
        "The first thing I expect is an immense population boom.",
        "Africa will go from roughly one billion people to two billion people, which is just mind-boggling.",
        "I think that we will also see the dissolution of certain borders and a reconfiguration of states in certain parts of Africa.",
        "I think the big wildcard here for the next 50 years is global warming, which could wreak immense havoc in Africa."
