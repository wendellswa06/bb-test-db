        "There was one action in a Texas State probate court that essentially looked at his will, and found that she had been cut off.",
        "There was another action in a federal court, a California bankruptcy court, that said quite the opposite, that in fact, her late husband had intended to gift her $449 million, and that through acts of fraud, the heir had kept that money from her, so we essentially have a states' rights case, where we have the State of Texas saying, we get to decide this matter, and we have the federal government, in the person of the California Bankruptcy Court, saying, no, we get to decide this matter, and the Supreme Court stepped in to make a decision.",

        "No.",
        "One of the great beauties of the Supreme Court, I think, is its ability to take even the most larger-than-life technicolor psychodrama, and flatten it out into black and white, arid, dusty issues, and today, where everyone else in this country saw a flamboyant, busty blonde fighting for her day in court, the Supreme Court managed to completely vacuum out all of that social meaning, and turn it into a dry, probate matter.",
