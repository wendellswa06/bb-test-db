        "So did you come up with a conclusion?",
        "Is the country more racist or more sexist?",
        "I think for me the most important point, first of all, was sort of the most basic one.",
        "It was just to sort of acknowledge that if both Senator Clinton and Senator Obama launched sort of viable candidacies for president in 2008, this is going to be a sort of symbolically dense affair that has interests that's not just political, of course, but sort of cultural as well - that not whether they win, but the ways in which their candidacies are treated could provide sort of a crude measuring stick for, you know, for where the country is on its attitudes towards race and gender.",
        "Having said that, it does seem to me that there is a kind of more vivid series of emotions that greet race in the United States at this point than gender.",
        "And I think that you can see that in the kind of, you know, the euphoria and kind of a adorement that's greeted parts of Senator Obama's book tour this fall and just the prospect of his candidacy more generally.",
        "What was really interesting about what you wrote is that the way the two different senators approach the two different issues, that Senator Obama in his speeches goes right to his background, that that's part of what he emphasizes.",
        "Whereas Senator Clinton doesn't talk so much about her gender.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I think that's right.",
        "You know, I think that if you look through not just, you know, the speeches we all have heard of Senator Obama's - particularly the speech of his at the 2004 convention - but more obscure speeches, too, about, you know, the ways in which, you know, corruption in African governments is undermining, you know, their ability to be viable about, you know, the jobs that are leaving manufacturing towns in the Midwest because of globalization.",
        "His identity, his race and his heritage are sort of always central and always seemed to form a kind of platform for his politics, and he's very explicit about this.",
        "Senator Clinton, you know, when you see her talk - even on topics where her gender and her identity would seem to be very naturally linked, like - and the example I used in the article was this sort of extremely well-received speech she gave on family planning and reproductive rights - she doesn't really mention it at all.",
        "You know, and I think that there is a kind of - Senator Obama - at least in his public statement - seems to have a sense that his race can be an active asset for him.",
        "And with Senator Clinton, her gender doesn't seem to be, you know, such a big deal or such a strong a part of the way that she's presenting herself and her politics and her policies.",
        "And that's an interesting part of this discussion, too.",
        "To what degree are gender and race assets, and to what degree are they liabilities for a candidate?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I think it's complicated, you know.",
        "I think that if you look at the race that Harold Ford just ran, you know, an African-American Democratic congressman for Senate in Tennessee, there were a lot of people that he lost to Republican Bob Corker.",
        "There were a lot of people that thought going in, you know, Tennessee will never in a million years elect a black man to the Senate.",
        "It's a Southern state, and he came pretty close.",

        "And so, you know, some pundits looked at this and said well, you know, he did come close.",
        "But on the same hand, at the same time, he fell short in the end in part because these ads were able to bring out these sort of, you know, old and racially charged sort of stereotypes.",

        "Um, one thing that I think is worth noting is right after Senator Obama, particularly, introduced himself on the national stage and at the 2004 Democratic convention, there were an awful lot of letters.",
        "If you go back and read through the letters-to-the-editor pages of - you know, not just papers in New York or Los Angeles but around the country in Cincinnati and Salt Lake City - there was an awful lot of excitement coming just from regular readers of newspapers that said, you know, it's really exciting to see somebody who is not just kind of charismatic and, you know, kind of modern in his views, but is also African-American on this stage and being honored in this way and treated in this way and making these points.",
        "I think that, you know, when Senator Clinton also ran for - or when Senator Clinton as, you know, candidate Bill Clinton's wife in 1991 and 1992, first appeared on the national stage, there was also a lot of sort of grass-roots excitement that was explicitly tied to her gender and the fact that she might change the role of first lady forever.",
        "So though I think that this is, you know, certainly - you know, race and gender are certainly objects of interest for many in the media, I think that this is also something which comes more naturally from people out there.",

        "Hi, thanks for taking my call.",
        "I disagree, I guess, with the last caller because it seems that, you know, the Democrats I don't think have ever won a presidential election without carrying the South, and there are still states - and I'm not sure if it's South or North Carolina that still flies the Confederate flag and has large supporters of the Ku Klux Klan.",
        "And you know, David Duke ran for Senate at some point.",
        "So I think it's a very real issue.",

        "I think that she's polarizing not so much because she's a woman but because her last name is Clinton.",
        "And I just think that she's a very polarizing figure, rightly or wrongly, but I think she is.",
        "And I was hoping that, you know, somebody like a Mark Warner who could carry some of the South - from Virginia, the former governor.",
        "Now I know he's not going to, but I thought he would be a great candidate.",
        "But, you know, I think gender still plays a role.",
        "I mean, here it's 2006, and the presumptive House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, is the first woman.",

        "Mark is making the point that this could still be a problem for Barack Obama in the South.",
        "I'm sure that people in the South listen to that - there are a number of people in the South listening to that who would not agree with that.",
        "But I would think more that you would have pockets throughout the country.",
