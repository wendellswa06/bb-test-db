        "Furthermore, if you look at someone like Condi Rice instead of Hillary Clinton - who is an extremely polarizing figure.",
        "With Rice's personality and brilliance for her, she probably could be president were it not for the fact that she caved in completely to the policies of the Bush administration.",

        "Right.",
        "It's kind of a generational sort of thing going on here, where, you know, there were a series of black politicians that began to emerge in the 1970s, 1980s - Jesse Jackson perhaps the most prominent among them - who sort of came out of the civil rights movement and had a, you know, series of ideas about how government should work that was, you know, not palatable to a lot of Americans yet - too liberal, too focused on redistributionist - excuse me - sort of ideas about how government should work.",
        "Obama has sort of gone out of his way to separate himself from that tradition, and there's a - maybe my favorite photograph of Barack Obama is one in which he and Jesse Jackson are hugging right on the steps of the Capitol.",
        "And the photographer from the Chicago Tribune took a photo of the hug from - so you can see Jackson's face, and he's grinning, just a huge grin.",
        "And then he runs around to the other side and takes a photo of Obama's face, and it's just completely flat, you know.",
        "So there's sort of a - Obama's been pretty explicit about saying, you know, I'm a different, more modern, kind of politician and sort of, you know, rejecting associations with this older school.",
        "With Senator Clinton, just the simple fact of her generation makes this a little bit more difficult.",
        "You know, there are some ideas about what liberal women in politics are like, you know, this kind of feminist label, or whatever that means at this point.",
        "But it's a little harder for Senator Clinton to separate herself from those ideas and attitudes, generationally."

        "OK, Gerald, one of the things that you say in the piece is that the water crisis in Flint, Mich., which is something that our listeners are very familiar with, is a direct result of the city losing so many manufacturing jobs with the decline of the auto industry.",
        "How is that?",
        "So you look at something like the flint water crisis, the common explanation of why this happened is that emergency managers were appointed to try and get the city out of the state of fiscal emergency that it was in and they messed up.",
        "But when you asked the deeper question, which is why was Flint in a state of emergency in the first place, what you find is essentially the legacy of industrial flight in Flint.",
        "You know, in the '70s and '80s, Flint had a very booming auto industry.",
        "And then as this trend away from manufacturing employment was taking place, Flint lost a lot of manufacturing jobs.",
        "You know, I think since that booming industry, they've lost tens of thousands - like, over 70,000 manufacturing jobs.",
        "And it kicks off this downward spiral where the city loses financial resources, can't keep up with its provision of public resources like infrastructure, police and fire protection and things like that.",

        "It's a research group, but it is an advocacy group.",
        "It's a combined sort of entity involving participation by manufacturers and the Steelworkers Union.",
