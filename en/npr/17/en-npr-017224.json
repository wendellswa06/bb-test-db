        "Absolutely.",
        "And I would argue that our approaches are pragmatic.",
        "They're not philosophical.",
        "And I think that investing in infrastructure, investing in training, having a results-based trade policy would get broad support.",
        "In addition, I think we need a better system for both training and retraining, one that recognizes the realities of today, that it's probably not an 18-year-old kid.",
        "It might be someone who's transitioning at the age of 50.",
        "And at the same time, you know, we need a rational trade policy.",
        "We're not going to be ripping up our old trade agreements like Donald Trump suggests.",
        "Well, the Tibetans have gone into this saying that they are going to raise their concerns about the heavy-handed crackdown on the unrest in Tibet.",
        "From the reports that are coming out of China, the Chinese media right now, we can see that the Chinese are not ready to make any concessions.",
        "They're saying that all our policies towards Tibet are correct and that we handled the Lhasa riots in a legal way.",
        "They said that the riots have created obstacles for more talks, but the Chinese say they're being sincere and patient in holding these talks, and they've agreed to further talks in the future but no date has been set yet.",
        "But what I mean is, is the basic framework here that people on both sides have to accept, for purposes of the talks, that Tibet is going to remain part of China and just the question on the table is whether the Tibetans can be treated in a different way or a better way.",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, basically the Tibetan side has to go with the Dalai Lama's call for more autonomy and not outright independence.",
        "But you know, the details of this is why we've had six rounds of talks and not gotten anywhere.",
        "The Dalai Lama wants all of the Tibetan plateau to be one political entity, where right now the eastern part of the Tibetan plateau is split up among four different Chinese provinces.",
        "And Chinese argue that eastern Tibet was never entirely under Lhasa's control.",
        "Both sides see the other essentially as insincere, and that's why the talks have not gotten anywhere.",
        "And Beijing, for example, cites to the fact that they previously invited the Dalai Lama to come back to China for the funeral of the Panchen Lama in 1989 - that's the second highest cleric in Tibet - and the Dalai Lama didn't come.",
        "Why do both sides see each other as insincere?",
        "Well, basically they have insurmountable differences.",
        "They have very conflicting views of Tibet's role in China.",
        "While China has, you know, for some time offered to continue talks with the Dalai Lama, they seem to have no interest in his input on their policies towards Tibet, which they see as essentially correct.",
        "And now, you know, Beijing has spent all this energy making the Dalai Lama public enemy number one in the media, so much so that when they begin talks Chinese have been criticizing their own government on the Internet for negotiating with them.",
        "And I think, you know, there are plenty of analysts out there who say that China has no intention of negotiating with the Dalai Lama.",
        "They're just waiting to install their own Dalai Lama after the current one dies.",
        "NPR's Anthony Kuhn is in Beijing, where Chinese officials have been talking with representatives of Tibet's Dalai Lama."
