        "How and why did Intel miss the boat on mobile?",

        "Both Intel and Microsoft famously missed the boat on mobile partly because they were wedded to the notion that we had our personal computers and our enterprise computers.",
        "Somebody like Steve Jobs was much more willing to cannibalize his existing businesses, so he was early on in the personal computing business.",
        "Then he created music players - the iPod - but then he was willing to cannibalize the iPod by creating an iPhone that had both music and a phone attached.",
        "And so if you're going to survive, you have to be willing to cannibalize the business you're in.",
        "How surprised are you to see this titan of a company in this position?",
        "I think what's interesting about Intel is not simply that it's in a bad position for having hitched itself to the personal computer, but that it's trying really hard to reinvent itself and to be part of the Internet of things of cloud computing and to create the new type of devices such as, you know, field programmable chips and maybe new types of memory chips that will be important for both the Internet of things and cloud computing.",
        "Walter Isaacson, he's the author of a book on Intel called \"\"The Innovators.\"\" Thank you so much for talking with us.",

        "Danai Gurira is best known for playing zombie killer Michonne in the top-rated cable series \"\"The Walking Dead.\"\" But lately she's busy toggling between rehearsals and performances for two new plays.",
        "But she's not acting in them; she's written them.",
        "Jeff Lunden reports.",
        "Danai Gurira was born in Iowa to Zimbabwean parents, and the family moved back to Harare when she was just 5.",
        "She returned to America for college and has stayed ever since.",
        "Gurira often calls herself a Zimerican.",
        "I was always in a hodgepodge of culture.",

        "Nonetheless, he bought the cabinet 100 bucks a month for six months.",
        "And then I kind of lost interest and over the years basically used it as a show-and-tell case, you know, at parties.",
        "But eventually Heggestad read enough about Wallace to get drawn in.",
        "He realized the cabinet's value to the history of science.",

        "That 1990 map was based on a dozen years of data - 1974 to 1986 - a period which turns out to be colder than any since, which means the USDA map, that holy writ of hardiness, has made us unwittingly cautious growing plants well within our range."
