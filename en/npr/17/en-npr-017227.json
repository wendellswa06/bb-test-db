        "Inside the courtroom Wright said a strip search is justified as long as school officials have some reason to suspect that a kid may be hiding contraband.",
        "Justice Scalia, what about a body cavity search?",
        "Answer, we don't have the training to do that.",
        "Justice Scalia, but the legal rationale would be the same.",
        "Wright conceded the point but said that if local school districts don't want body cavity searches, they can ban them as a policy matter, just as they can ban strip searches as a policy matter.",
        "Justice Ginsburg suggested the school officials in this case had been less than thorough before conducting the strip search.",
        "They hadn't even asked the student who implicated Savana when she got the ibuprofen pill or where.",
        "Justice Souter, you're grouping every pill, whether prescription or over the counter, as posing a health and safety risk that justifies a strip search.",
        "At some point that gets silly.",
        "If you put aspirin in the contraband category, that's questionable.",
        "Justice Scalia, did the school even know what the pill was at that time?",
        "Answer, yes.",
        "But school officials had no way of knowing what other pills were out there.",
        "School officials aren't trained pharmacologists, said Wright.",
        "They need a bright line that says once they suspect a student has contraband, they can conduct a strip search.",
        "Justice Scalia, any contraband?",
        "What about a black marker pen?",
        "I see that is considered contraband at your school.",
        "Answer, yes, because they sniff them.",
        "If the school district's Mr. Wright had a tough time, it was nothing compared to Savana Redding's lawyer Adam Wolf of the ACLU.",
        "Justice Kennedy, suppose the school gets a tip that a dangerous drug like meth is going to be distributed.",
        "Does that make a difference in the reasonableness of the search?",
        "Answer, no, because there was no suspicion that Savana was hiding drugs in her undergarments.",
        "The only basis for the suspicion was that they didn't find anything in her outer garments or backpack.",
        "Justice Alito, what's wrong with that?",
        "Answer, they didn't even search desks or lockers, but they conducted a strip search.",
        "At this point in the argument a gender difference reared its head.",
        "Justice Breyer suggested that it's no big deal when kids strip.",

        "Those schools removed children from their homes and separated them from their language and culture.",
        "One of them was the father of 37-year-old Carrie Iron Shirt.",
        "My dad, being in the boarding school, they were taught not to talk their language.",
        "Iron Shirt says her father has bad memories of the treatment he received for speaking Blackfeet at school.",
        "He didn't want us to go through that, so my generation missed out on the language.",
        "After her daughter Jade was born, Iron Shirt tried to make up for that loss.",
        "She enrolled her in a private Blackfeet language immersion school.",
        "Now 16, Jade can speak fluently with her grandparents.",
        "She says she's grateful she had the opportunities her mother was denied."
