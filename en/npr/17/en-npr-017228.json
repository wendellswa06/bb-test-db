        "And this fighting comes as Ariel Sharon is facing a rebellion in his ruling Likud Party.",
        "I mean, there's--some in his party are very unhappy with the Gaza pullout.",
        "There's a vote today that could determine Sharon's future.",
        "Tell us about that.",
        "The vote is actually on a procedural issues, whether or not to advance the Likud Party primaries.",
        "Sharon's chief rival, Benjamin Netanyahu, put forward this proposal to advance the primaries and to hold them within two months.",
        "Sharon vehemently objects to this.",
        "So what started as a procedural issue has really become a contest between Sharon and Benjamin Netanyahu.",
        "How do Likud Party members view Netanyahu?",
        "Well, in the Central Committee, which is the group that's taking this vote--it's a 3,000-member sort of policy-making of Likud--Netanyahu has always been very popular.",
        "And, in fact, the Central Committee voted against the Gaza withdrawal plan and Sharon went to the Israeli parliament and got it passed.",
        "So there's no love loss at the Central Committee for Sharon.",
        "At the same time, many people are saying that if the Likud does decide to advance the primaries, that could end up bringing early elections in Israel, elections in which the Likud won't do very well.",
        "And if Ariel Sharon loses, what then?",
        "Well, that's sort of the big question.",
        "I mean, aides to Sharon say that he is seriously considering starting a new party, a centrist party, that would really kind of change the Israeli political map.",
        "Instead of the Likud being on the right and the Labor being on the sort of center left, you would have Sharon, the head of a large centrist party that would take from the Likud from Labor and perhaps the centrist Shinui Party.",
        "Other people say that Sharon will stay in the Likud and will fight against Netanyahu in the primaries, that he doesn't want to leave the Likud.",
        "And some say that Sharon might retire.",
        "He's 77 years old and he may just not do this.",
        "If Sharon does form a new party, analysts say that he is likely to pursue a peace deal with the Palestinians, assuming he wins the election.",

        "On this show in 2004, we interviewed the well-known Israeli writer and peace activist Amos Oz about his memoir \"\"A Tale of Love and Darkness.\"\" Oz vividly recalled the night in November 1947, when the United Nations voted to partition British-ruled Palestine into two states - one Jewish and one Arab.",
        "(Soundbite of NPR archived interview recording)",
        "I remember the huge outburst of emotions.",
        "It was a burst of excitement, fear, hope, almost a messianic fervor.",
        "But then, five or six hours later, the fighting began between Israel Jews and Palestinian Arabs, the same fighting that has not ceased until this very day.",
        "Palestinian philosopher Sari Nusseibeh was born shortly after the State of Israel.",
        "While reading artist memoirs several years ago, Nusseibeh decided to write his own political autobiography.",
        "The two men know each other through years of cooperation in the Israeli-Palestinian peace camp.",
        "Like Oz, Nusseibeh is an activist, a public intellectual and a leading voice of moderation among his people.",
        "Though he was schooled at Oxford and Harvard, he was also educated in prison.",
        "Israel jailed him for three months in 1991, he believes, on account of his political activism.",

        "That's probably my greatest pride.",
        "I have been to, literally, hundreds of recruit graduations - and I never tired of it because it was so enjoyable to see young people who have made a choice to serve their country in the Navy.",
        "If you have paid your mortgage all along through all these difficult times, and it is at a high interest rate, but you never missed a payment as the value of your home went down and down and down, you should have a chance if you want to refinance at the current levels.",
        "And proponents say there is actually a way to do that without more government spending.",

        "These people who are stuck at six or seven or eight percent interest rates, for most of them their loans are guaranteed by the mortgage firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.",
        "So if Fannie and Freddie agreed to guarantee new loans for those people at today's lower interest rates, then the private sector would make those loans.",
        "And Barbara Boxer says that wouldn't cost Fannie and Freddie or taxpayers anything.",
        "Fannie and Freddie actually make money on this - as we looked at the CBO analysis, about $100 million - because it would stop many people from defaulting right away.",

        "And I think it's something Fannie and Freddie ought to do by - I'm not interested in pride of authorship - if they'll do it tomorrow by policy, we're ready for them to do it.",
        "Isakson is saying that Fannie and Freddie don't need an act of Congress to do this.",

        "The question that I have in my mind, a mortgage is one person's liability.",

        "In other words, the homeowner would be saving money with a lower interest rate.",
        "But an investor in mortgage bonds somewhere was making money off that higher interest rate.",
        "So such bond-holders would lose money, or at least they wouldn't make as much money.",

        "And in general, President Obama has rhetorically shifted a lot, but substantively shifted very little.",
        "And so I think he's continued the second Bush term, but making sensible adjustments.",
        "And I think this speech is a series of sensible adjustments - trying to get the drones out of the CIA toward the Defense Department, which seems appropriate, trying to scale back the level of general alarm of threat.",
        "So I'd say the big shift happened in the Bush years, but this is a sensible continuation of getting things back to a normal footing.",
        "Interesting, though, that point that you raised about shifting it from the CIA to the military wasn't actually embedded in the speech itself.",

        "Well, I think it was an adult speech that treated Americans as serious conversation partners and, indeed, there was a protester, Medea Benjamin of Code Pink, who had interrupted the speech and it was fascinating.",
        "The president really treated her as a serious interlocutor and came back to her at the end of the speech.",
        "And I thought it was actually very significant that he really, as you suggested, said the global war on terror, which was never a very good formulation in my view because you don't wage war on methods of violence.",
