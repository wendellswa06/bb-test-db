        "We did things in the wrong order.",
        "So they've announced the closure without finding a place.",

        "And so, I do think they're doing quite a mature job of this.",
        "Could I just say, one of the reasons it's been so hard to close Guantanamo is because Congress - and this is really a problem in both parties - Congress keeps saying, well, you can't move them here.",
        "Well, if we can't move them to a secure facility inside the United States and you can't find countries to send it to, it becomes more difficult to close Guantanamo.",
