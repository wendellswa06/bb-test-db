        "When you see Brockmire always in - with the exception of maybe some of the intimate scenes - in his madras sport coat, it might seem to be like a kind of a sports rube, but he's a sophisticated man.",
        "He's been around the world.",
        "Again, Joel Cooper, our writer, kind of saw in him Jim Brockmire being the embodiment of baseball and what baseball means to America and thus, kind of an embodiment of America at this point.",
        "You know, he's rooted in a lot of the traditions of the past, as baseball is.",
        "He's struggling to find who he is and what he is and how he's relevant in the modern world, including - he's an Internet sensation, and he didn't know it.",
        "And by the way, this whole thing called digital media and social media, what is it?",
        "And how does one navigate it?",
        "And he's of the tradition of, like, Sinatra and those guys too, I suppose, those kind of hard-drinking men's men.",
        "And - but no, he's a sophisticated guy.",
        "His reference is - another comedic premise we found that was fun was a guy who describes everything and also lends itself to a lot of observational comedy.",
        "And he makes a lot of references like, you know, the way ESPN kind of blew our minds 30, 40 years ago when they started putting pop culture references into sports.",
        "Brockmire's right along with that.",
        "You've got a British director, Tim Kirby.",
        "Yes.",
        "Now, at first I wondered, is that a drawback?",
        "But then, as I thought it through, I thought, no, it might help you actually set up for him what's so important about baseball to some people.",
        "You're the first person to ask that question, and it's absolutely correct because we wondered the same thing, too.",
        "We love Tim and his work.",
        "We're like, well, can we really have a Brit who doesn't understand baseball directing all these?",
        "And then, we realized that Joel Cooper, the writer, and myself are so baseball oriented.",
        "It actually was an aid to have somebody there who didn't know any of it and was able to say (imitating British accent) so I don't understand.",
        "What's happening here?",
        "Like, oh, OK, if you don't understand baseball, you don't get this moment.",
        "So it helped us make it accessible for folks who may not, you know, understand the language of baseball.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The series is profane and utterly hilarious...",

        "It's just a believable excuse to be that foul-mouthed on the air.",
        "But what the writer saw in it was a portrait of a pretty lonely alcoholic.",
        "And then, the director really took that ball and ran with it.",
        "He didn't let me get away with anything less than honoring the dark night of the soul (laughter) that Jim Brockmire was experiencing, which was funny to me because to me it was really just a - it's a jumping-off point for comedy.",
        "But as I was acting it and working on it as an actor - not as a producer or developing it - I realized this is quite emotional stuff, yeah.",

        "Yeah, picked up for a second season already I gather.",
