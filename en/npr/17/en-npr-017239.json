        "He says in many countries across the continent, homosexuality isn't just taboo, it's illegal.",
        "In more than two-thirds of the countries of Africa, there are still what you would call sodomy laws, or laws that criminalize same sex consensual acts between adults on the books.",
        "And these laws, most of which are remnant of colonial legal systems, basically underpin a set of structures that allow for people to be regularly arrested, harassed, blackmailed.",
        "They make people insecure with regard to their housing, their ability to remain in schools.",
        "The laws themselves basically create a system in which the lives of African gay men and lesbians are considered to be the lives of second-class citizens in which they are perpetually at risk.",

        "And now, the government of Nigeria last year attempted to implement a piece of legislation, which they called the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act.",
        "And this was - and this law was a very tricky law in the sense that though it claimed to be prohibiting same sex marriage, it had very little to do with same sex marriage, that it very much to do with attempts to silence any sort of political activism.",
        "The law would make any kind of assembly of people coming together to discuss their issues or problems illegal and punishable by up to five years in prison.",
        "So the law was really an attack on freedom of expression, and freedom of assembly and association in Nigeria.",
