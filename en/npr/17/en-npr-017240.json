        "Well, I think, once again, that South Africa needs to be congratulated for creating a constitution and trying to put in the legislation to live up to that constitution that protects people based on sexual orientation.",
        "Well, it's not always helpful to make comparisons between countries.",
        "What we do know is that the levels of violence that gay men and lesbians are facing in Africa has particular ramifications, has a particular design to it in the sense of if we look at the issue of punitive rapes - what some people call curative rapes.",
        "Situations in which women whose behavior is considered to be too masculine, for example, are judged by the community and face rape as a way of punishing them and ostensibly to cure them.",
        "Those kinds of violent situations are situations that need to be addressed.",
        "Given everything you've just told us about, are there active gay and lesbian organizations?",
        "I mean, America has many, both general interests, health focused - African American, people of color focused.",
        "Are there comparable organizations in many African nations?",
        "There is a strong and growing African sexual rights movement.",
        "There are regional organizations such as The International Lesbian and Gay Association.",
        "Also interesting is the fact that a number of mainstream human rights organizations in Africa are recognizing that LGBT rights are part of the overall fight to human rights.",
        "And Nigeria is a great example of that where we saw a law being created or being proposed by the government that would silence people based on sexual orientation.",
        "The struggle to defeat that legislation was crafted and was moved forward by a coalition of organizations in Nigeria.",
        "More and more, I think what we're finding is that civil society groups in Africa are recognizing that LGBT rights are not special rights but are part of the forward movement for democracy and basic freedoms on the continent.",
        "Well, Cary Alan Johnson, thank you so much.",
        "Thank you very much, Farai.",
        "Cary Alan Johnson is an activist and Africa specialist at the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission.",
        "He's also the author of a new book that takes a critical look at HIV/AIDS programs in Africa called \"\"Off the Map.\"\" To learn more, visit our Web site, nprnewsandnotes.org.",
        "The four members of the patrol we spoke with say they were edgy that morning.",
        "The day before, another soldier from the unit, and a friend of Romero's, had been seriously wounded by a sniper's bullet at a major intersection.",
        "When the patrol reached that same intersection again, another shot rang out.",
        "They dismounted in haste, most of the platoon heading into a nearby building.",
        "Romero and his partner, Christian Jones, positioned themselves so they could keep watch on the street outside.",
        "Iraqi soldiers took up position across from them and quickly stopped one car with hand signals and shouting.",
        "Joe Romero explains what happened next.",
        "Another vehicle started approaching, we could see it way down the road.",
        "It was coming straight at us at a rapid rate of speed and we were waving at it, start yelling and pointing our weapons to get it to stop.",
        "At that time, nothing stopped and I start making out the driver of the vehicle.",
        "Romero noted it was a single man driving a white vehicle, fitting the profile of a suicide car bomber.",
        "According to Iraqi and American witnesses we spoke with, all concur that the car was doing 30 to 40 miles an hour and was about 100 meters away.",
        "Romero now had about six seconds to make a life and death decision.",
        "He says that as he and his partner, Christian Jones, stepped into the middle of the street, they fired warning shots."

        "His hands at no point were up like he's trying to show me his hands and it looked like he was hiding behind the steering wheel.",
        "Vehicle kept coming, at this point it's roughly 30 to 25 meters from me when I had to fire my last shot.",
        "And I took a shot at his head.",
        "There are rules governing contact with civilians, which call for a gradual escalation in force, a warning shot, disabling shot and finally a lethal shot.",
        "Romero says he never saw Salihee hit the brakes after the warning shot.",
        "As the car rolled past him, Romero says he saw blood as the driver's hand dropped away from his head.",
        "Air was hissing from the tire shot out by Christian Jones.",
        "Stores line the intersection on this corner in Amiriyah and shopkeepers challenge Romero's story.",
        "One of them, a 24-year old ice seller named Majeed Mahmoud Aboud, recounts that Jones and Romero took up positions next to his tiny metal kiosk on the corner.",
        "He insists, as does at least one other Iraqi witness, that the very first shot was the killing shot.",
        "A member of NPR's Baghdad staff interviewed the ice seller, who didn't want to be recorded.",
        "A translator reads from the interview.",
        "(Through translator) My mind is not like a computer, but I can remember this.",
        "It was a hot day and the Americans came in and they took the saw I used to cut the blocks of ice.",
        "I was chatting with the other shopkeepers when I saw the driver coming fast.",
        "There were four Iraqi National Guards on the street.",
        "When the driver saw the guy, he tried to stop, but as he hit the break, he was shot.",
        "Another Iraqi witness, 47-year-old Bahjat Adnan, a clothing store owner, was also interviewed about the shooting by NPR Baghdad staff.",
        "Again, a translator reads the notes from the interview.",
        "(Through translator) There were two kids in the middle of the street and they said, stop, the Americans are in the street and they will shoot you.",
        "This is what got my attention and made me turn around and look.",
        "I heard three shots.",
        "The first one was when the car tried to stop.",
        "The car screeched to a halt.",
        "I know that it was just a civilian guy who got shot and I don't know why he got shot, except that he was coming very fast.",
        "A bullet, distorted by the heavy windshield glass, crushed the bones around Salihee's eye and made a gaping wound on the right side of his head.",
        "Romero had no doubt that the bullet was his.",
        "Others thought an Iraqi soldier might have fired the fatal shot.",
        "NPR retrieved the bullet fragments from an Iraqi police station and an independent expert, hired by NPR, says the bullet did indeed come from an M14, the type of weapon Sergeant Romero said he was using.",
        "Members of the patrol say they searched the car, took pictures and found no weapons or explosives.",
        "Only Salihee's press credential and his cell phone.",
        "After that, says Bahjat Adnan, they left."

        "I will state that Mr. Salihee would still be alive if he would've been more attentive and in tume with his environment, tragic as it may be.",
