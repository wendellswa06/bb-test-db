        "For someone who likes to tell stories, like me, to be able to have more time to tell them means you can tell them in a more complete way, and a lot of these beautiful scenes that we cut out because we have a weigh-in and an elimination and a challenge and a temptation, we can now spread out and put a lot of great character development in.",
        "And I think what we found and what the network has found is our ratings are actually stronger and grow consistently every half hour on the half hour for every two-hour episode that we've done.",
        "So I think the network is happy because they see that character development works.",
        "That's what people really want to see.",
        "You know, it almost sounds like, hey, why bother with scripted television if you've got all this unscripted stuff and people are loving it?",
        "Don't say that to my wife.",
        "What's she do?",
        "Or me.",
        "Well, my wife, she likes to watch \"\"Grey's Anatomy.\"\" Together we both like to watch \"\"Heroes.\"\" You know, it affects everybody.",
        "And look, I make a living and I take it very seriously about reality television.",
        "It's a real treat to be able to do what I do.",
        "But if everything went all unscripted, I don't think that that's really a healthy atmosphere for the television business, just like if there was no unscripted.",
        "And I would think that after a while, you'd run out of ideas too.",
        "I mean, already a lot of viewers have said, wait a minute, isn't that reality show a lot like that other lost on an island reality show?",
        "I mean, after a while aren't we going run out of ideas for these programs?",
        "Well, you always try not to be derivative.",
        "I think this is an opportunity for a reality producer like me to maybe try some things that the network might not have bit off on before.",
        "I mean, if you look at shows like that in the scripted world, \"\"Seinfeld\"\" would have never been a hit.",
        "The Office\"\" even might not ever have been given a chance in that scenario.",
        "and maybe for some reality shows that are one and done, or an idea they're not sure of, they may try it now because they have the real estate they didn't have before.",
        "There are a lot of reality producers who have been saying we feel like the work that we do is the equivalent of writing to a certain extent, and we deserve to have the same kind of rights and representation and payment as the members of the Writers Guild do.",
        "But I imagine if it went down that way, you'd have to pay them a lot more.",
        "Would that cause a problem?",
        "Well, the reason networks love reality programming, A) they can pick a show up and three months later it's on the air; B) the cost is a lot less to those shows.",
        "So you don't want to take that positive away.",
        "Look, our story producers, they look at a story, they see what plays out, and then they take eight hours of it and turn it in into eight minutes.",
        "I don't really look at that as writing.",
        "I look at it as storytelling.",
        "If they were writing lines and then reality characters were saying the lines, then I would agree that that's writing.",
        "But that's not what we do."
