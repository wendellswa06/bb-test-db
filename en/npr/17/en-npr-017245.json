        "Well, I think the Governor is making three solid proposals immediately.",
        "The first is to add a number of self-contained self-rescuers throughout the mine that would allow miners to use the one that's closest to them to get started and then would provide them the ability to go from place to place and get out as they go.",
        "The second is an additional notification requirement that says that the mine operator must notify immediately and if he does not, there would be a substantial penalty.",
        "Because one of the things that we have learned is the need to get rescue teams in place quickly is absolutely essential if we're going to have any success at getting miners out.",
        "And the third is the development of a personal emergency device, that the dispatcher, or someone on the surface, as soon as they learn of a problem, can notify-- through text message to each miner--the location of the problem and how best to get out.",
        "We're going to propose to require that every miner in West Virginia be provided with one of these by the operator.",
        "These first steps are really a step to try to address the rescue and recovery phase of the operations.",
        "Now even if some of these practices are changed and some of these measures are enacted, isn't enforcement a big part of what you're talking about here?",
        "Enforcement is always a large part of it, and this is not to say that this mining industry is any worse than any other industry in that sense of the word.",
        "But in our case, because the mine is dynamic and moving every 24 hours, you renew your problems and you have to address those.",
        "How strongly are mines regulated today and how often are they checked for compliance with safety rules?",
        "In the federal level, the mines are inspected four times a year.",
        "The mine safety act is the strongest law in this country in the occupational safety area.",
        "The enforcement of it has diminished a little in the past five years.",
        "I think the suggestion is that the number of inspectors has decreased and I'm afraid that we've seen a decline in the number of penalties and citations.",
        "What did you learn from these accidents about responding?",
        "We've known in this country for a number of years that the rescue system is under stress.",
        "We're a victim of our own success.",
        "We don't have a lot of mine disasters so we don't have a lot of use of the teams and a lot of practice, etcetera.",
        "The numbers of teams have diminished.",
        "We have not enhanced the rescue team process and we haven't enhanced the equipment that these fellas have and so we need to look very hard at how to we go and bring new technologies in to detect fires and to be able to detect presence of gases and provide communications systems.",

        "A year after the Abu Ghraib scandal, the Bush administration is facing new questions this weekend about the abuse and death of prisoners in US military custody, this time in Afghanistan.",
        "The questions were raised by a two-part series published in The New York Times.",
        "The reporting was based on a leaked confidential file of an Army investigation into the alleged abuse.",
        "In yesterday's installment, reporter Tim Golden recounted the brutal deaths of two Afghans in custody at the American detention facility at Bagram.",
        "In tomorrow's piece, he writes that Army investigators initially tried to stop the case from going forward.",
        "We'll be speaking with Tim Golden in a few moments, but we begin with reaction from Afghanistan.",
        "President Hamid Karzai flew to the United States today.",
        "Before leaving Kabul, he said he was shocked by The New York Times report and would bring up the issue in Washington.",
        "The BBC's Andrew North in Kabul said President Karzai's words were very strong.",
        "He condemned these allegations.",
        "He said he was totally shocked.",
        "He said that several times.",
        "And he then said that he would be calling on the US government to prosecute those involved.",
        "And when he was, in fact, speaking in the Afghan language Dari, he called the allegations that he'd read in The New York Times against humanity.",
        "So definitely a real sense of anger there from what he this hearing.",
        "How much do Afghans know about this report?",
        "I mean, we saw that a Newsweek piece about alleged abuse of the Koran certainly spread around and helped spark some deadly anti-American riots there.",
        "Newsweek then retracted that article.",
        "Is this New York Times report being shared there?",
        "You certainly haven't seen quite the level of reaction as those allegations produced.",
        "I think because of the whole idea of this being an offense to the Koran, this caused a lot more reaction, but these allegations in The New York Times certainly have been reported.",
        "It was the lead story on the main radio stations here in Kabul today and I think that's why President Karzai is sending this very strong message.",
        "In the past, he's been criticized for being actually too soft on allegations of US abuse here.",
        "How do most Afghans view the United States today?",
        "Well, by and large, there is still a welcome for the international presence here.",
        "After almost 30 years of war, Afghans are tired of fighting.",
        "They want to see peace, and many of them believe that the international presence here is the best way of assuring that.",
        "And so certainly compared to Iraq, there is a lot more goodwill, but definitely in the last two months, there has been some signs of a change and it is more directed at the Americans, particularly concerned about heavy-handed tactics in their battle against the Taliban, down in the south and east of the country.",
        "In fact, President Karzai in his remarks today was saying that there is now going to be greater control of US operations particularly over the issue of American troops breaking into people's houses.",
        "This causes particular concern and he was actually saying these--such operations will stop, but certainly some here who feel that was more for domestic consumption.",
        "We'll have to see whether US military commanders here really do stop operations as a result of intervention by the government.",

        "Once you get past that, as the Supreme Court did by lifting the ban, then you have corporations able to spend as much as they want - unions too, like you say, supporting candidates or opposing them.",
        "Now, there's one argument that corporations really won't do that much because it's not the kind of things they want to do, but there's another argument that even if they don't want to do it now, they will later, that it will become like lobbying, something that they'd rather not spend the money on, but if you're going to play in American policy-making, which a lot of corporations feel the need to do, if you're going to do that you've got to be in politics.",
