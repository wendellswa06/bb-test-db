        "NPR's Jon Hamilton reports that drug companies are already working on what could be the next big thing in sports doping: products designed to strengthen diseased muscles.",
        "In a locked facility at Johns Hopkins University, there are a whole lot of mice that would fail a doping test.",
        "Se-Jin Lee, the scientist who created these mice, says many of them even look like dopers.",
        "They look bulked up.",
        "And those mice have about twice the muscle mass of normal mice.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF BANGING)",
        "Lee removes two plastic cages from a wall of caged mice.",
        "He explains that the mice here are part of an effort to help people with muscular dystrophy and a range of other medical problems that cause muscles to waste away.",
        "Lee says the effort began in the 1990s, when he discovered something called myostatin.",
        "Myostatin is made by muscle cells and it really plays two distinct roles.",
        "In a developing embryo, myostatin acts to limit the number of muscle fibers that are formed.",
        "Later in life, it acts to limit the growth of those muscle fibers.",
        "Lee says the amount of myostatin in the body is determined by the myostatin gene.",
        "So, when you get rid of the myostatin gene entirely then you see more muscle fibers, and then you get bigger muscle fibers.",
        "Lee opens the lid of one mouse cage and pulls the occupant out by its tail.",
        "And this mouse here is a normal male mouse, about two months old."

        "Then Lee reaches into the second cage.",
        "And here's one of these myostatin knockout mice.",

        "And if you look carefully, I think you can sort of appreciate how much extra muscle these mice have.",
        "Beneath the fur is a bodybuilder's physique.",
        "Lee says he knew from the start that his discovery was going to get a whole lot of attention.",
        "You only have to look at those mice for 10 seconds to realize not only the potential to treat patients, but also the potential for abuse.",
        "In 2008, the World Anti-Doping Agency banned substances that inhibit myostatin.",
        "At the time, there weren't any on the market.",

        "Drug companies have developed several different products that inhibit myostatin.",

        "If they work, these drugs might help tens of thousands of patients with genetic diseases like muscular dystrophy.",
        "The drugs also might help many more people with muscle wasting associated with cancer or kidney disease or even old age.",
        "And Chris Mendias, at the University of Michigan, thinks drugs that inhibit myostatin could do a lot for otherwise healthy people who simply get hurt.",
        "You'll have some sort of a joint injury.",
        "So if you have an ACL tear or something like that, where the muscles actually itself are not injured, but just that inactivity that you have - we have to put you in a brace, you have to be non weight bearing for a time - the muscle will atrophy.",
        "And in a lot of cases, as hard as we try, the muscle mass never comes back.",
        "Mendias says myostatin appears to be an important factor in muscle atrophy.",
        "Studies show that levels rise dramatically when people stop using a particular muscle.",
        "And Mendias says he's seen the result in patients who have torn the knee's anterior cruciate ligament."

        "It's quite amazing.",
        "When you look at the knees of these patients and literally looks like the muscle has kind of melted away.",
        "So what we think then is that, if you used a myostatin inhibitor for a short-term period that might actually be beneficial in preventing the atrophy later on.",
        "Another researcher with high hopes for myostatin is Lee Sweeney, who studies muscle diseases at the University of Pennsylvania.",
        "But Sweeney is also worried about doping.",
        "A decade ago, he wrote an article in Scientific American warning that myostatin manipulation could become a big problem in sports.",
        "At the time, Sweeney thought athletes might undergo gene therapy to permanently block myostatin.",
        "Now, he says, it looks like drugs will provide an easier and more attractive option.",
        "For one thing, Sweeney says, these products will probably leave no trace in the body once an athlete stops taking them.",
        "They would have a finite time that they would reside in the body and then they would be cleared.",
        "And so, unlike gene therapy, if you timed it right you might not be able to detect that they had been used.",
        "Sweeney fears that myostatin drugs will become notorious doping agents.",
        "Then he says doctors may hesitate to prescribe them for legitimate uses, like helping patients who can no longer walk because they have lost so much muscle.",
        "The sort of unmet need in all these diseases far outweighs whether somebody wins a bicycle race or a sprinting event because they cheated.",
        "If the FDA does approve a myostatin inhibitor, it will probably be for a very specific group of patients.",
        "But once a drug is on the market, doctors can prescribe it to just about anyone.",

        "EPO is a wonderful drug.",
        "I mean, it does fantastic things to increase the red blood cell count and to treat anemia and when used appropriately, it's one of the best drugs that's been discovered in the last 50 years.",
