        "Mr.�LAWRENCE LESSIG (Co-Founder, Change Congress): Great to be here.",
        "And that idea we just heard from James, the former senatorial candidate in Georgia, among many that have been put forward to, well, modify the ramifications of this Supreme Court decision.",
        "Mr.�LESSIG: Yeah, that's right.",
        "I think unfortunately what we're seeing is a little bit of a rabid dog in the form of the Supreme Court, and it's bit once, and I think many people believe it's going to bite again.",
        "So that particular law I predict the Supreme Court would strike down because it struck down essentially the equivalent law as applied to newspapers, and this court doesn't believe that newspapers are, interestingly, different from broadcast media.",
        "So that change just wouldn't survive.",
        "Well, in your article, you say what's needed now is a citizen's movement to stop the fund-raising(ph) in Congress, demand change, et cetera.",
        "How would you go about it, and how would that pass muster before the Supreme Court?",
        "Mr.�LESSIG: Yeah, I think that the biggest risk we have after Citizens United is a distraction, because, you know, the day before Citizens United was decided, we already had an enormously corrupt Congress, and not corrupt in a bribery sense but corrupt in the sense that members were spending too much of their time focusing on how to make their funders happy and not enough time spending how to make their constituents happy.",
        "And that is a basic economy of influence inside of Washington, and maybe Citizens United will make that much, much worse, but even if we just lived with the world before Citizens United, that was enough to stop every major reform both on the left and on the right.",
        "...with Junkemier, Clark, Campanella, Stevens in Missoula, Montana.",
        "So the solution here is not to get us back to the day before Citizens United.",
        "The solution has got to be to change that economy of influence so that once again members can focus on what the framers imagined they'd be worried about, what the people thought, and not focused on what their funders want so that they can raise the money necessary to get back into office.",
        "And when Lawrence Lessig refers to Citizens United, that's the shorthand for the Supreme Court case that last month in its ruling changed the face of campaign finance.",
        "We're talking about money and politics and how that's likely to change now, given that Supreme Court ruling.",
        "In a few minutes, Dan Schnur will join us.",
        "He helped run a number of campaigns and will tell us what difference it would make, well, when he was helping to run John McCain's campaign, for example."

        "And Peter, we got an interesting question during the break.",
        "Somebody couldn't hold on but wanted to know: there's a lot of places where judges are elected, obviously not on the federal level, but state and local elections.",
        "How would this would this affect their elections as well?",
        "It would.",
        "The decision applies to all elections in the U.S., not just the federal elections, and judicial elections tend to be low-budget, small affairs - you know, kind of historically they've been kind of polite things where the only people who pay attention are lawyers, unions and corporations, chamber-of-commerce types, and this has the potential to really change that, to turn them into big-budget elections where, you know, the corporations and the unions are just duking it out over who's going to sit on the bench, who's going to sit on the state supreme court, and it raises a question of, you know, is this how you want to choose judges in America?",
        "And if you have elected judges, can you not choose them that way now?",
        "Here's an...",
        "Mr.�LESSIG: What's really interesting about the decision is that, of course, the Supreme Court last term decided a case about judicial elections where one person spend $3 million in independent expenditures to get one judge kicked off an appellate court and replaced with another judge, who then cast the deciding vote in favor of that the interests of that person who spent the $3 million.",
        "And the Supreme Court was very sensitive to the interests that courts have that people perceive them as behaving in a way independent of the interests of the underlying parties.",
        "So the court actually created a constitutional rule to require that judge to recuse himself."

        "But in this case, in Citizens United, what the court has basically said is that Congress can't protect itself in the same way that the courts constitutionally must protect themselves from the perception that people have that money buys results in Congress.",
        "And that, I think, is the instability that can't survive in this court's decision.",
        "Something else that the court said is that the idea of buying access, buying influence in a generalized sort of way is not good enough to institute laws now.",
        "They said in pretty much this language that American citizens are not concerned, not alarmed that donors can buy access to members of Congress.",
        "Let me ask you a question, though.",
        "You've said things, you know, essentially that the system was too infused with money of all kinds to begin with, and this just makes it worse.",
        "How do you legally, constitutionally, change that at this point?",
        "Mr.�LESSIG: Well, there's a clearly constitutional bill right now in Congress, it has a 135 co-sponsors in the House, it's called the Fair Elections Now Act, that would invite members and candidates to opt in to a small-dollar-contribution system.",
        "So you can receive only a $100 contribution from any particular citizen, and that $100 is then matched four to one so that you can raise the money you need to run for office without ever taking big-dollar contributions from anybody.",
        "Now, if that were the system, it at least would move us towards a world where whatever dumb reason Congress made for whatever had for whatever dumb decision Congress took, we would not think it's because of the money.",
        "Maybe it's because they were too liberal, maybe because they were too conservative, maybe they didn't think about it, but at least we would not believe that it was this illegitimate reason that was driving them to the answer they picked rather than just some other.",
        "And would this law, which you believe to be constitutional, others may disagree, but anyway, would this law require all candidates to abide by that or just opt in if they wanted to?",
        "Mr.�LESSIG: No, it's opt-in, and that's what makes it constitutional, just like the presidential public-funding system is an opt-in system.",
        "And last time, President Obama, now-President Obama, opted out.",
        "Mr.�LESSIG: Yeah, and that was very unfortunate, but where we've seen this happen in the states - for example, Arizona and Maine now have this as the law, and Connecticut just adopted it recently, and when Connecticut did it, in the first year over 80 percent of incumbents opted into that system and immediately changed the character of how politics happens in states like in these states."

        "But I was going to say, also the corporations and the unions tend to be kind of status quo operations, so I suspect they're not going to jump on some wild-eyed third party person either.",
        "And the point is of all the solutions that people are talking about right now, I mean, who knows what this rabid dog is going to do, this Supreme Court, but of all the solutions that are being spoken of right now, this is the one that is clearly the most safe from a constitutional perspective and would have the most dramatic impact in changing the way Congress works.",
        "Yet unfortunately this administration and this Congress have not had the vision to be bold enough about the change that they want, and they're arguing about tiny changes at the margins that in my view will not even get us back to where we were before Citizens United.",
