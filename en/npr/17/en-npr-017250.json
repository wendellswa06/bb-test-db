        "I appreciate it.",
        "And as somebody who's worked on campaigns on the national level, what do you think midterm elections how might they change given this ruling?",
        "Mr.�SCHNUR: Well, they're going to change dramatically.",
        "There's no question that the amount of money spent on behalf of candidates on both sides of the aisle is going to increase in a big, big way."

        "One thing I'm not as certain about, though, is the common presumption that that necessarily benefits corporate spenders and their allies more than organized labor.",
        "The system that the Supreme Court has now put in place at the federal level actually bears a great deal of resemblance to what we deal with here in California in state elections, and while the amount of money involved in the campaigns is indisputably absurd, it has not necessarily led to a pronounced imbalance in favor of corporate spending.",
        "Organized labor has done actually a fairly good job of keeping up in that regard.",
        "And interestingly, obviously the state of California has a Republican governor but Democratic majorities in both houses of the legislature.",
        "Nevertheless, as you're talking about the mechanics of the campaign, the amount of time that the candidate and the campaign manager would have to now spend on money issues would seem to be even greater than they do now.",
        "Mr.�SCHNUR: Well, that's precisely right.",
        "You're competing for the voter's attention not only with your opponent and his or her message but a whole range of outside groups all shouting at the top of their lungs.",
        "And I think what this gets to, and I'm guessing you guys have already talked about this just a little bit earlier in the program, is the broader philosophical issue about whether or not money equals speech, and I wonder if we haven't set up a unnecessarily, mutually exclusive discussion here in that you assume that if money does equal speech, therefore you have a right to spend unlimited money on behalf of a candidate or cause that you believe in.",
        "Or even some sober-eyed...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...third party person nevertheless.",
        "And I guess the point that I would make which acknowledges the parallels between money and speech, but also calls for some restraints that the court did not see necessary, is that the right to free speech is critical for our democracy, but it actually is not absolute.",
        "In other words, if you were giving a speech in a town square and I stand up next to you with a megaphone and a really loud sound system, I'm exercising my right to free speech, but I'm drowning you out and interfering with yours.",
        "Mm-hmm."

        "And I wonder if a corporate or union interest that spends one or five or $10 million on behalf of its preferred cause in the name of free speech isn't drowning out the right of others.",
        "So, perhaps, there is a middle ground that if not this court, another court in the future might be willing to navigate.",
        "Well, that's another issue for another day but, Peter?",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, it's getting back to that idea of the public forum.",
        "And in the forum, can anybody speak as long and loudly as they want?",
        "Or is there some sort of regulation of the speaking so that all voices get heard?",
        "There's also the situation that, at least currently, the Internet is more and more important, and the Internet is effectively infinite.",
        "You can put as many videos on YouTube as you would like.",

        "If I was still running a campaign, that is a potential real frustration for me, which is getting my voice heard, that is getting my ads placed in a marketplace that is so crowded from outside interests.",

        "Those messages are effectively uncontrollable by the campaign.",
        "Yes.",
        "Suppose in a state like California, I am running a candidate like Arnold Schwarzenegger who tends to be more conservative on economic and law enforcement and immigration issues, and more moderate, even liberal on culture and social and environmental matters.",
        "Well, in order to turn out Republicans, a well-meaning National Rifle Association-affiliated group could begin to churn out all sorts of ads, talking about the issue of guns which is not necessarily central to my message.",
        "And it could turn off independent, even some Democratic voters you might have hoped to attract.",
        "And similarly, my Democratic opponent equally frustrated by a well-meaning group from the left arguing for single parent health care system that may or may not be part of my agenda, at least not one of my priorities or (unintelligible) priorities.",

        "If you look at the Ventura example, for the lack of a better one in the immediate political past, the reason both the Republican and the Democratic candidates were loathed to attack him is they were worried about engendering a backlash against their own candidate.",
        "So therefore, if corporate or union interests were to have weighed big against Ventura, the same backlash would have occurred.",

        "If you look at the Ross Perot candidacy back in 1992, first, Bill - a Democratic president in Bill Clinton and then a Republican Congress jumped on the deficit reduction idea that had animated Perot's campaign.",
