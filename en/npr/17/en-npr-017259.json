        "Obviously, you don't have to be a genius to figure that out.",
        "But he had this sugar craving, and he used to eat these butter rum Live Savers.",
        "But, I mean, he just popped one and after the other so he, instead of a cologne, all you'd smell was butter rums.",
        "But that's how - every time I smell those things, I immediately it's just - I think of him, and I can see him.",
        "(Soundbite of music)",
        "What was most fascinating was people's discussion of John Coltrane the human being, John Coltrane the father, John Coltrane the friend - when I spoke with Jimmy Cobb, I mean, Coltrane's band mate and drummer, we had a whole discussion, sort of, after we had recorded Jimmy's episode just about how wonderfully kind John was.",

        "He chose that as a song that we can elaborate on musically.",
        "And he did a little, sort of a vamped version of it, which I thought was a good idea because it was a chance to expound on the theme and to do their own thing with what's in that context, you know, so that we didn't lose a character of the song.",
        "But at the same time we had the freedom to do what he wanted to do it because it was a vamp.",
        "And McCoy basically said he kind of get some chill bumps when he listens to it.",
        "His interview - which will air almost at the end of the series -is so rich in just the man John Coltrane.",
        "A quiet interview went from talking about music to him and essentially saying that he has no answer why himself, Jimmy Garrison, the bassist, the drummer, Elvin Jones and saxophonist John Coltrane found one another.",
        "He just feels the spirit brought them all together.",
