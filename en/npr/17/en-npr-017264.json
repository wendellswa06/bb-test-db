        "The agenda for Hillary Clinton would have been to seek China's broader engagement on a range of international issues, to have its help in Syria, with Iran and North Korea and with Burma and all these other areas where the Chinese government - its natural inclination would be to avoid doing anything.",
        "On the Treasury secretary's side, the agenda would have been things like the value of the Chinese currency, intellectual property protection in China.",
        "The talks were mainly on those two fronts.",
        "What did they achieve?",
        "From the initial reports, as if the Chinese gave a lot of what the U.S.",
        "was looking for, especially on the economic realm.",
        "The Chinese government announced that the giant state-owned enterprises that play such a large role in the Chinese economy would have to start paying dividends.",
        "If they didn't have to pay dividends, essentially that was a built-in war chest that they could use to subsidize a lot of their efforts worldwide.",
        "In the last month or so, the Chinese central bank has significantly increased the trading range for the Chinese currency, and the equivalent of their export-import bank has agreed to ream back some of the export subsidies that both the Europeans and the United States have been complaining about a lot.",
        "Jim, for years now, the thinking among U.S.",
        "policymakers was, you know, you open our markets to China, and that will create a Chinese middle class.",
        "China will have to liberalize, become more democratic.",
        "That, clearly, has not happened.",
        "The latest State Department human rights report about China was pretty damning.",
        "Yes.",
        "The crudest version of that equation, which we heard a lot of, say, 20 or 30 years ago, which is more trade would mean a democratic China, that clearly is not true.",
        "There's a refined version of it, which actually does become important for China in the next generation or two, which is whether its move from this low-wage manufacturing economy to a more sophisticated prosperous one will require a kind of opening the government has not been able to do so far.",
        "And that is - we'll see how that unfolds.",
        "That's James Fallows of The Atlantic.",
        "He joins us here most Saturdays.",
        "Jim, thanks for coming in.",
        "Thank you, Guy.",
        "That expected GM shutdown serves as one more reminder that Southeastern Michigan is looking for a job.",
        "Its big auto companies expect to get smaller if they survive at all.",
        "So Steve Inskeep is in Detroit this week, tracking the effort to diversify in a deep recession.",
        "And Steve, I suppose if you are Michigan, you can't go looking for another General Motors."

        "Another giant corporation that's going to dominate most of a century and be for a while the largest corporation in the world, provide all those jobs?",
        "No. So one official says Michigan is making a series of smaller bets, Renee.",
        "And of course the challenge, as we heard yesterday, is to somehow create jobs as quickly as the auto firms are losing them.",
        "Well, give us some examples of some of those smaller bets.",
        "Well, they're pushing employers toward things like defense contracts or biotech work.",
        "And if you want to know what that means, you could snap on a pair of surgical gloves.",
        "(Soundbite of snapping)",
        "Those are going on the hands of an employee at a firm called Asterand.",
        "And by the way, Renee, don't worry, this won't hurt a bit.",
        "And you walk into a storage room full of silver tanks.",
        "Our guide here is Victoria Blanc, who says the inside of each tank is cooled - 190 degrees below zero.",
        "So they're basically giant thermoses that are very, very, very, very cold.",
        "Stainless steel tanks, each one about four and a half, five feet tall.",
        "Yes.",

        "They are now tied in New Hampshire.",

        "You know we're wise to talk about policies and nothing like personal attacks.",
        "Well, it's not a personal attack.",
        "In New Hampshire, the bigger threat to Romney is John McCain.",
        "He won the primary in 2000 and has focused almost exclusively on the state since his campaign ran out of money in the spring.",
        "In his commercials, Romney has been hammering McCain for his position on tax cuts and for supporting amnesty for illegal immigrants.",
        "McCain responded last night, insisting he never supported amnesty and pointing out that at one time Romney had agreed with him.",
        "No better authority than Governor Romney believe that it's not amnesty, because two years ago, he was asked, and he said that my plan was, quote, \"\"reasonable and was not amnesty.\"\" And for you to describe it as you do in the attack ads, my friend, you can spend your whole fortune on these attack ads, but it still won't be true."
