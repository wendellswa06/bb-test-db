        "There, of course, was a lot of talk before this happened about whether or not it would happen.",
        "How do you think this is going to play here at home, David?",
        "It seems almost normal.",
        "It's like a normal presidential visit with a bilateral with the Russian leader where you raise a bunch of issues, you apparently go by the talking points.",
        "So the wheels didn't come off the train, so let's pop the champagne.",
        "Right.",
        "As we heard, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said, you know, Trump and Putin agreed that the issue of Russian meddling is, quote, \"\"a substantial hindrance in the ability of us to move the Russian-U.S.",
        "relationship forward.\"\" What did you take from that, Kimberly?",
        "Well, it seemed that Rex Tillerson, in making that statement and in stressing that the point now is to see how we move forward, where we go to from here - let's not dwell in the past - is something that, you know, as a diplomat he's going to try to do at this point, to push aside the fact that the president seems to have done a bit of a 180.",
        "He was just, you know, the other day still refusing to confirm that Russian meddling had even taken place, but if it had done so it's President Obama's fault.",
        "Now he's sort of standing up to Vladimir Putin and saying that this is an important issue.",
        "So, I mean, there's really no place for Rex Tillerson to go at this point than to try to push forward.",
        "Trump started this trip, of course, in Poland, where he has friends at least in the government.",
        "Poland is moving toward the right by refusing Muslim immigrants, putting restraints on the judiciary and the media.",

        "What did you make of it, Kimberly?",
        "Yeah, I think it was definitely a return of the kind of tone that we saw in the president's inauguration speak - speech, very nationalistic.",
        "It bore the fingerprints of Steve Bannon and Steve Miller in the White House in that it was a very nationalistic speech that spoke of the threats to Western civilization - I mean, that sounds really scary, right?",
        "- of these threats and talked about immigration and talked about, you know, Islamic terrorism and these things.",
        "So he had a very good audience, receptive audience in Poland, which, as you said, has been trying to crack down on immigration, particularly when it comes to Muslims.",

        "It stands for equality, the growing emancipation of rights of minorities, respect for minority rights.",
        "I mean, it's a pretty great civilization.",
        "And for a lot of people, frankly including me, it means a lot.",
        "And to have a president sort of celebrate it - whether his behavior always lives up to it is another issue - but to somebody celebrate it, I think, is a good thing.",
        "And I think it's an ennobling thing for people who want to feel part of something.",
        "At a time, though, when people see words like this as a kind of a wink and a nod to more extremist wings of Western civilization, shall we say, I mean, they might consider it as a - you know, a pass to the kind of alt-right white nationalist views.",

        "And I've talked about that for the last two years.",
        "But on this one speech I thought it was OK.",
        "Kimberly, thoughts?",
        "Yeah, I mean, I think that this speech did - could have come across to a lot of people and did come across to a lot of people as hostile.",
        "And I think when you have that sort of sentiment, you know, you have to - that sort of tone you have to walk a fine line.",
        "We have to remember that we do need our Muslim partners in Muslim countries to fight against terrorism, that you don't want to fan the flames of terrorist recruitment.",
