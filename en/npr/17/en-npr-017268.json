        "And Britain is a huge question mark, whether it decides to replace nuclear with nuclear or go in a different direction.",
        "A different direction would be either continuing to rely on fossil fuels such as coal and gas, which emit greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide when burnt, or increasing investment in renewable energy such as wind, sun, and water.",

        "And were - the idea also that you nearly crash, a lot of people would think it's counterintuitive to them to take off again and go around for a second landing.",
        "Yes.",
