        "Two years after a new president's been elected, bringing in new members of Congress with him, what should we expect?",
        "What typically happens?",
        "Well, historically the president's party has problems in midterm election.",
        "It didn't occur in 2002, the Bush first mid-term.",
        "But if you look back over the past few decades, the president has problems.",
        "Voters become disgruntled, disappointed, they turn to the other party.",
        "So let's start with the House.",
        "Of the 435 seats, all that which are up every two years, how many seats do you regard as competitive and what do you think is a likely outcome now?",
        "Well, we have about 80 seats right now that are competitive.",
        "Most of them, all but a dozen currently held by Democratic members of Congress.",
        "I think right now everybody agrees that the House is generally in play.",

        "I think it's a little too early, Robert, to make the call for 39, 40 seats.",
        "So we see substantial Republican gains.",
        "At this point I think it's just premature to call the House.",
        "Now, in the Senate, I gather 36 seats are up and 18 of them are now held by Republicans, 18 by Democrats.",
        "According to your rankings, what does it look like now?",
        "We think that right now the Republicans are poised to win between five and eight seats.",
        "So they will have a good year, quite a good year, but right now they need a couple of other states to come into play before they'd have any chance, really, of netting 10.",
        "So for now, at least, the prospect for President Obama is to be dealing with a Congress that is significantly more Republican, maybe split majorities in the two chambers.",
        "Right.",
        "No, the dynamic in Washington will be very different after November.",
        "The president will have to get along with substantial Republican minorities in both houses or Republican control of one house.",
        "That might not be a bad thing for him.",
        "He'll be able to play off them.",
        "Right now the Democrats are responsible for everything.",

        "Or is it dozens and dozens of local elections with different issues?",
        "Well, you don't get numbers like this if it's race by race.",
        "No, there is a definite political wave building, as one built in 2006, and another one built in 2008.",
        "This is building, except that this time it's to the Republicans' direction.",

        "What happened with the court is they threw out the rules for phone calls that are made within the state.",

        "It was a complete legalese interpretation of the rules.",
        "In fact, the judges themselves commented many times how they felt like their prices were too high, but they ultimately decided in a 2-1 decision that the FCC exceeded its authority, that the 1996 Telecommunications Act says that you, the FCC, cannot regulate state phone rates within a state.",
        "That's up to the states themselves.",
        "And that's what the current FCC that's now Republican-run by a Donald Trump appointee agrees with.",

        "Well, the rate of recidivism, the ability to leave prison and to stay out of prison, is oftentime deeply connected to the ability of people within prison to stay connected with their families.",
