        "For example, they say Putin had many - has had many positive experiences working with Western political leaders whose business interests made them more disposed to deal with Russia, such as Berlusconi of Italy and Schroeder of Germany.",

        "- I want to jump in here because even before Donald Trump got his briefing, he was calling the inquiries into this a political witch hunt.",
        "And I want to get your sense from the two of you about the relationship between Trump and the security community after this week.",
        "Well, first of all, I think Trump's relationship with Russia is only further underscored by this report.",

        "He wants to take full credit for this election, and the idea of the Russians may have helped him, more of a line, is an insult to his sense of self.",
        "And so he's very sensitive to the thought that he got any help in winning this election.",
        "But there's a larger and substantive issue, especially within the Republican Party.",
        "The Republican Party, including Paul Ryan and John McCain and others, have always basically believed in the post-war global international order - the organizations, like NATO that we built.",

        "Now, before I let you go, I want to just touch on one more thing because Congress was back this week.",

        "So they're sort of opening salvos in that battle.",
        "Meji, let me ask you about money, because Senator Clinton's campaign, according to the Washington Post today, is 20 million dollars in debt.",
        "That means that not only has she put in 11 million dollars of her own money that she might not get back, but also there are advisors who haven't been paid.",
        "And there's also talk of whether or not Senator Obama should actually, you now, kick her the cash and say hey, you know, here, peace and blessings, be gone.",
        "What do you think of that?",
        "I think she's just wasting her time, you know, like putting her own money in there.",

        "Shay, it's funny, you know, here on the show we get letters from Clinton supporters saying that we're too pro-Obama and for Obama supporters saying that we're too pro-Clinton.",
        "I know we'll get letters about this but what I want to do to follow up on that money question is, you know, I talked to someone who was an Obama supporter, and she said under no circumstances should my campaign donations go to Hillary Clinton.",
        "What do you think of that campaign argument?",
        "Even if it made it easier for Senator Obama to get the nomination if he paid those debts, and this is all speculation, but it's speculation by a lot of political insiders.",
        "Do you think that Obama supporters would be unhappy if their money went to pay off Senator Clinton's debts?",
        "I don't think so, because I think they would understand in terms of, I would assume their long term goal which is to get Obama, and if not Obama, a Democrat into the White House, they would understand that strategic maneuver, if you will.",
        "So I think that people would be maybe a little upset in the beginning, but would understand that's what Obama has to do, if he has to do that, in order to get Hillary Clinton out of the race.",

        "The race is over, I mean how many, there are 40 some delegates I believe up for play tomorrow in West Virginia.",
        "It's just - again it's prolonging the inevitable, and I think overall I know you're probably going to mention the whole soundbite that Senator Clinton came out last week about the hardworking Americans.",
        "And I don't know, obviously she'll probably have a very healthy victory tomorrow, but it kind of goes back to, you know, her comments about having the support of hard working white Americans as if those are the only people whose votes matter.",

        "And you know - please go head.",
        "Oh, OK, I just wanted to piggy back off of that, you know I definitely agree that Clinton should be rightfully criticized, and has been for that heard working white Americans comment which implies that black voters or affluent white voters, educated whites, aren't hard workers.",
        "I certainly understand the offense taken with that.",
        "But I think she was correct in that her base of support is potentially broader than that of Obama's, and Obama has not been fully vetted yet.",
        "And I think that that's part of the reason why there's some superdelegates who are kind of on hold to see how it plays out, even though it looks like Obama will get the nomination because of the pledged delegates and such.",
        "But because Clinton has her base of working class whites, Hispanics, and white women, that is potentially a broader base than the kind of McGovernesque base that Obama has going into the general election.",
        "Because black voters, no matter what, are going to support the Democratic nominee 90 to 10 anyway.",
        "And that's what Clinton is counting on.",
        "White working class voters, and Hispanics are more swing voters."

        "And what I was going to say about, they were saying about Hillary only being interested in the white vote in those states, I just think that, you know, America is more than white, it's a mesh of different cultures, and she should like focus her campaign on all the races instead of just talk about how hardworking people are white.",
