        "Jay, we have been talking, this month, about criminal justice.",
        "We are doing a month-long series on criminal justice, and one of the things that keeps coming up is the rifts, sometimes, between communities and police officers.",
        "And of the irony, of course, that some of the people who probably need the most protection, either fear the police, or feel intimidated that if they talk they are going to be in trouble with their neighbors.",
        "How can we go about healing that divide?",
        "I think, you know, we can't just put the onus on the police.",
        "I mean, they are there to protect and serve, and there are unfortunately bad apples in every bunch, and that's what keeps ending on YouTube.",
        "But, I think honestly, the community has to be more accepting, and more open to working with police, and just cooperating in general.",
        "You know, the tension between police and, you know, the people in some communities, just they prohibit that from happening in the first place.",
        "So, until that, that rift is cured in some way, shape or form, you are going to keep seeing innocents like this, and you are going to keep saying a dishonesty and distrust on both sides.",
        "Shay, just quickly, Reverend Al Sharpton visited one of the men in jail.",
        "And do you think that Reverend Al Sharpton's involvement is a positive or negative?",
        "Will it raise attention, or how do you think that's going to play out?",
        "Well, you know, I'm not usually Reverend Al Sharpton's biggest fan.",
        "But on this, when he and I are, you know, totally in agreement.",
        "You know, it will bring attention to the case, in terms of how police officers basically convicted these men, without allowing the justice system, of which they are part, to play itself out.",
        "So I think his involvement is a good thing.",
        "It will raise attention to the issue.",
        "I just hope that he also raises attention about those, you know, more than 300 murders, you know, of black crime victims as well.",
        "I think he can get involved.",
        "I'd like to see him do both.",
        "Shay, Jay, and Meji, thanks so much.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Thank you.",

        "So Connie, you've read this report.",
        "What's your reaction?",
        "Well, I think people need to understand that for LAPD, this is an unusually blunt and self-critical report.",
        "In the past, we couldn't even get LAPD to ever recognize that it had done anything wrong, and here we have a chief of police, Chief Bratton, who has taken responsibility, apologized and issued a first-phase report, because there's still investigations going on.",
        "But this report actually sets out the facts.",
        "It admits there was a meltdown in command and control, the training.",
        "The use of force was probably excessive, although they haven't concluded conclusively those investigations.",
        "But as self critical as it is and as probing as it is - and they need to be congratulated for that, I want to make that clear - the question really is how you could have had such lapses in judgment and have made the same mistakes, because this is the not the first time that LAPD has found itself in this situation.",
        "What were some of the explanations that they've offered as to why they made these mistakes?",
        "Well, they focused at the operational and strategic level first - the lack of coordinated command, lack of situation awareness.",
        "The commanders didn't know the whole situation.",
        "There was clear confusion on the ground.",
        "They pushed a few rabble rousers into the peaceful marchers, and then created a situation in the park where the police felt they were losing control.",
        "But what the report doesn't get into is why weren't the lessons learned from other similar public marches that also went wrong?",

        "It can be that having a police officer in a very non-obtrusive way at a polling place really does help people feel safer and is not intimidating at all.",

        "Which is what some people thought in 2008 when two members of the New Black Panther Party, one with a billy club, were stationed outside a polling site in Philadelphia, although charges in that case were eventually dropped.",
        "Becker says election officials have to take into account everything going on at a polling site to know if something has or hasn't crossed the line, and most states routinely allow representatives of political parties, campaigns and the general public inside the voting place.",
