        "The brain begins to accumulate abnormal proteins, and it will eventually strangle or kill the cells, like it said in the movie.",
        "And in some time - it may take weeks, months, years, decades, sometimes up to 40 years later - and you now begin to manifest with symptoms like mood disorders, major depression, suicidal attempts, disinhibition.",
        "There's a scene in the movie, which has now become famous from the trailer, where you meet with this neurologist who's on the NFL's side.",
