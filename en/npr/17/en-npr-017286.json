        "But it's still a trade deficit.",
        "We're still importing a great deal more than we export, right?",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, the numbers today - what was it exactly, 56 billion or something like that - trade deficit meaning that we imported 56 billion dollars more than we exported.",
        "That's huge.",
        "These are massive numbers without question.",
        "Every month, we get seriously in debt seriously to the rest of the world by a very large amount of money.",
        "But it was less.",
        "Less than expected, so that's good news.",
        "But nevertheless, isn't that a big deal, over time, month after month, year after year, when we import, and again, a lot of it's oil, but it's not just oil, now when we import so much?",
        "Yes, it's a big deal.",
        "It's a transformative deal.",
        "It is a different economy.",
        "We're living in the economy we had 20 years ago, 30 years ago.",
        "In fact, we - our trade deficit is so big we get in debt, something like five percent of our GDP, I mean, five percent of the money we make a year, deeper in debt to the rest of the world every year.",
        "And if you would talk to some economists, say, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, some would have told you that is theoretically impossible, that an economy would have collapsed under the weight of that.",
        "It's not unlike, although it's not exactly like, you know, a credit-card debt.",
        "If every year you get five percent deeper in debt to the credit cards, that isn't sustainable.",
        "And eventually, that has to be paid back.",
        "To paraphrase every (unintelligible), a trillion here, a trillion there.",
        "Pretty soon you're talking real money.",
        "You're talking real money.",
        "Yes.",
        "Now, it's not as simple as the credit-card analogy, but it's - this is a - what this month - here's what people are hoping happening.",
        "By people, I'm now talking about economists, maybe I shouldn't use the word people so readily, but what economists and analysts are hoping is that what has happened this year is that the U.S.",
        "has turned a corner and 10 years from now or something like that, when we look at the graphs and we look at the period, this will be the time when the U.S.",
        "stopped its crazy consumption binge, which we truly have been on for many years, and that what feels like - it maybe is, a recession or and a weak dollar and all of the stuff we're dealing with - is actually a transition to a healthier world.",
        "You and I have actually talked about this before.",
        "Yup.",
        "And these numbers do support that idea, that maybe that's what's happening.",
        "We're becoming an economy that doesn't survive on borrowing money from overinflated homes and buys a bunch of cheap junk from Asia that we can't afford.",
        "We're becoming an economy that actually makes things that people want and we're selling it to them, and that's fueling our economic growth.",
        "Or it's one aberrational month that we're going to go right back to our...",
        "Or just a total noise, and it's completely irrelevant, and yeah, it will be a blip."

        "Yeah.",

        "...Just tell us what you have to say.",
        "Well, I wish I could explain it better.",
        "From what I understand, based on a very quick overview that I received from Fisher Investments, was that a double-bottom bull-market correction is similar to the '97, '98, where it's - there is a small recessionary period, a quick bounce-off, and another drop.",
        "And then from there, everything's corrected and the economy just continues to grow at that point in time.",
        "All right.",
        "I understand.",
        "Just a couple of terms.",

        "A correction is when those prices drop by 10 percent.",
        "So...",
        "Now, let me try and - there's a whole school of thought called technical analysis.",
        "And I'm going to just come out and explain my bias.",
        "I don't believe in technical analysis.",
        "Technical analysis is people who look at charts of economic activity and in the - what I would consider random noise of how the charts bump up and down whether you're talking about stock prices or price-to-earnings ratios or whatever you're looking at.",
        "They feel that they can discern patterns and predict future events and then they invest based on those ideas.",
        "There's, you know, millions and millions of dollars of books sold every day and websites, and this is a whole world of technical analysis.",
        "I'll be honest, and this might be biased and you can write your angry letters right now, but I see this is akin to astrology or something.",
        "It doesn't seem, this- the academic data I've seen does not seem to support this work.",
        "So, this sounds like one of those ideas.",
        "I'm a strong believer in the idea that we don't know in the middle of the something what we're in the middle of, and any - the more certain someone is about what next month will be or what six months from now will be, the less confidence I have in what they're saying."

        "But relative to the European prices, they're a lot lower, and the wines that I have that are quite rare - they're produced in California and Oregon - I can't get it as much of, because they're more attractive on the export market, particularly in China.",
