        "AP always has to have their story out first.",
        "There's a lot of pressure, much more pressure than at a newspaper.",
        "And I think over the decades, it's actually gotten worse; just the Internet has hyped everything up.",
        "Mason joined a chorus of political reporters, and politicians from both parties, attesting to the quality of Lewis's work.",
        "It's just terrible for someone's career to be ruined over something like this.",
        "And especially someone like Bob Lewis, who is so well-respected.",
        "I mean, you saw the outpouring.",
        "When politicians you've covered speak well of you, you know that you've done a good job - not because you were kind to them, but because you earned their respect.",
        "Mason noted that the AP sent out a corrective item in less than two hours - before the larger article went out, and before it got into print.",
        "But no one is defending the mistake itself.",
        "And what few details are known, are troubling.",
        "The story carrying such explosive allegations, just before an election, came together in only a few hours.",
        "And the AP did not wait long to hear back from McAuliffe for comment.",

        "And so she's technically classified as kind of an unknown vaccination status.",
        "But just after she was exposed, the young woman was tested, and she was found to have antibodies against measles, enough that would've protected a healthy person.",
        "But she also had multiple underlying health conditions.",
        "And so her immune system was suppressed, and she was vulnerable to the infection anyway.",

        "Tell us about it.",

        "The vaccination rate in Clallam County was quite a bit lower than other places in the state when we looked earlier this year when this outbreak occurred.",
        "After, a kindergartner at a local who was exposed to an unvaccinated man in his 50s - she went to a school with high rates of parents who opted out of vaccination.",
        "And so when that little girl was diagnosed with measles, the vaccination rate shot up.",

        "Washington is pretty much in line with the rest of the nation.",
        "However, like other places across the U.S., we have pockets of places where people are less likely to be vaccinated, and Clallam County is certainly one of those places.",
        "You actually reported that after last winter's outbreak at Disneyland - that was linked to Disneyland - vaccination rates actually went up in Washington state.",
        "What happened there?",
        "Well, you know, there was an awful lot of discussion both locally and nationwide about vaccination.",
        "And so people just started getting their kids the shots.",
        "And we had a big discussion because we had a bill in the legislature that would have done away with the personal belief exemption.",
        "It ultimately failed, but the conversation certainly sparked people to look at their own kids' vaccination status.",
        "And this outbreak that happened in Washington state that affected this little girl and this woman in her 20s who's now died, those were unrelated to the outbreak at Disneyland.",
        "Is that right?",
        "Exactly.",
        "We did have two cases in Washington state that were related to Disneyland, but this outbreak wasn't.",
        "And do you feel like this most recent death is now starting a conversation anew in Washington state?"
