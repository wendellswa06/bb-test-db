        "Thank you very much.",
        "Ron Estes faces a spirited challenge from Democrat James Thompson - maybe there's a John in there somewhere as well.",
        "The president's approval rating, of course, is at historic lows, but Republicans hope he's popular enough in Kansas that he can benefit his candidate by making a robocall.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "On Tuesday, Republican Ron Estes needs your vote and needs it badly.",
        "Ron is a conservative leader who is going to work with me to make America great again.",
        "OK.",
        "So Domenico Montanaro of NPR's Politics team is still here with us, so what does this race really look like, Domenico?",
        "Does the Democratic candidate really have a chance?",
        "Well, the Republican is still heavily favored here most likely given the fact that Trump won this district by 27 points.",
        "But consider the fact that because Trump made this robocall, it elevates the status of it and tells you just how worried Republicans are of the potential that this could be a closer race than expected.",
        "If this race winds up in single digits, which is not impossible given low Republican enthusiasm, a likelihood of a low turnout, which is why you have the president go and make this kind of robocall to get those Republicans out and the fact that this is the first chance for Democrats to express their frustration and outrage with the Trump administration - there's money pouring into this race.",
        "There are going to be Democrats heading to the polls in Wichita for sure, and they want to make sure that Donald Trump is somebody who Democrats will be able to show their enthusiastic outrage against any...",
        "Enthusiastic outrage, yeah.",
        "It is the first in a series of special elections we're going to be watching.",
        "Let's nod to another election coming up in Georgia.",
        "What's the dynamic there?",
        "Well, in Georgia, you have a special election to replace Tom Price who is now the HHS, the Health and Human Services secretary for Donald Trump.",
        "And Jon Ossoff is a former Capitol Hill aide, 30 years old.",
        "He's raised $8.5 million.",
        "It's more money than he knows what to do with.",
        "Consider the Ohio Senate race in the last election.",
        "The Democrat there only raised $10 million.",
        "He's already got 70 staffers.",
        "It is a ton of money that he's trying to pour in there, the Democrats trying to pick that one off in a district, by the way, that Trump underperformed in.",
        "And it's a much narrower election unlike the one in Kansas."

        "Let's remember then in 2009 after Democrats captured everything, they began losing everything.",
        "And surely this is what Democrats hope will begin to happen in this year.",
        "Now the Republicans seem to dominate.",
        "This is the beginning of a kind of season of bellwether elections we'll have later in the year, governors elections in Virginia and New Jersey - much to watch.",
        "But as for today's race, remember what Domenico said.",

        "Sounds a little bit like this.",
        "Not a happy passenger being pulled by the arms.",
        "That sound is bloodcurdling.",
        "Well, the airline said it needed its seat, and he refused to get out, even when offered money.",
        "And he was pulled off and bloodied.",
        "Well, this story has gone viral in China because according to a witness, the man said he was targeted for being Chinese.",
        "OK.",
        "So for a quick rundown of this, we've got NPR Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz on the line.",

        "How is this story playing in China?",
        "Well, this video has gone viral faster than any that I can remember in my seven years as a journalist here.",
        "One of the videos of it that I was tracking today had 120 million views by 3 in the afternoon.",
        "Wow.",
        "And when I looked half an hour later, it was up to 130 million.",
        "So that was moving at a rate of about 20 million views an hour.",
        "And that was just one replaying of the video attached to a single hashtag on Webo, one of China's largest social media sites.",
        "So when you consider the hundreds of other media outlets here that are playing this video too, the estimate is likely much higher.",
        "So I mean, this is - has provoked calls to boycott United, both here in the States and in China, I understand.",
        "Does the Chinese government see this as a kind of opportunity to shame a major American corporation?",
        "Well, I mean, when there's so much public rage over an incident like this, I'm not sure if the government of China feels like it needs to do much more than just get out of the way.",
        "Let it just go.",
        "I mean, United - yeah, United is obviously a competitor of many of China's state run airlines for across Pacific routes to and from the U.S.",
        "and Canada.",
        "So what I'd imagine we'll see in the days to come is a lot of coverage on state-run television news and the newspapers.",
        "But overall, this promise is just to get a lot of play here in China.",
        "And that has a lot to do with public demand for it, rather than government propaganda.",
        "Also a reminder, man - cell phone videos.",
        "There you go."
