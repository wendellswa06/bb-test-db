        "...without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid on the table.",
        "(Soundbite of cheering, applause)",
        "And with that, depending on whether you were listening to Democrats or Republicans, either the best or the worst bill of the last generation was formally approved.",
        "Just moments after the vote, President Obama made it clear which side he was on.",
        "If you have health insurance, this reform just gave you more control by reining in the worst excesses and abuses of the insurance industry with some of the toughest consumer protections this country has ever known, so that you are actually getting what you pay for.",
        "If you don't have insurance, this reform gives you a chance to be a part of a big purchasing pool that will give you choice and competition and cheaper prices for insurance.",
        "The House actually had to pass two bills last night: first, the bill the Senate passed in December, which now goes to President Obama for his signature.",
        "Then lawmakers passed a second bill to make compromised changes to that Senate bill.",
        "It now goes to the Senate, where it's been promised quick consideration - as quick, that is, as anything ever can be in the world's most famous debating society.",
        "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was convinced the Senate, under Majority Leader Harry Reid, would, in fact, pass the second bill promptly.",
        "And I salute Senator Reid for his leadership in bringing Senate members together -the majority of the Senate - around this legislation."

        "Yesterday was not only a rare Sunday session for the House, it was one of the most raucous days anyone could remember.",

        "If we pass this, I feel this is the end of the health care as we know it.",

        "Today, the president has announced he will be signing an executive order.",
        "That executive order will be signed after the health care legislation to reinforce that principle, that belief that we all stood on: no public funding for abortion.",
        "The promised executive order appeased at least eight members who'd been worried about the possibility of federal abortion funding, but abortion rights supporters, like Colorado's Diana DeGette, insists that it merely restates what the bill already did.",
        "What the executive order does is it simply says the White House is going to follow the law.",
        "Between all the scrambling for votes, though, the enormity of what was about to happen was starting to dawn, some lawmakers said.",
        "For House Whip James Clyburn, it came Saturday when he got a text message from his 15-year-old grandson wishing him luck.",
        "His grandson had been born prematurely and had three operations before he weighed 20 pounds."

        "This has been happening for quite a few years.",
        "That is why India is called as the pharmacy to the poorer countries.",
        "Now, what exactly did the Supreme Court have to say than to Novartis ?",
        "Novartis had challenged a provision in Indian patents law which bans companies from extending patents on their products by making slight changes to an existing compound.",
        "This practice is called an evergreening.",
        "Other words, when Novartis was refused a patent protection for a cancer treatment called Glivec in 2006, it eventually approached India's Supreme Court.",
        "Wherein, it claimed that the modified form of Glivec was an improved drug from the older form.",
        "However, the Supreme Court clearly said that Glivec fails both the tests of invention and patentability, according to the Indian laws."

        "Does this ruling really set India apart from how the U.S.",
        "approaches the issue of evergreening or drug patents?",
        "It does.",
        "And this is not the first time or this is not something new that has happened.",
        "When India agreed to sign the global TRIPS agreement in 2005, that time itself India had introduced this provision of not granting multiple patents on a single drug.",
        "Because India believes that it's people who are mostly poor cannot afford patented medicine.",
        "And hence to prevent this practice, India had clearly introduced a section which does not allow evergreening within the country.",
        "And, yes, it is quite significantly different from the provisions that exist in the United States or, say, in China or in many other countries where Glivec has been patented.",
        "Now, the pharmaceutical makers argue that this ruling could have a kind of chilling effect on innovation; that it would just incentivize companies from developing new drugs, if it means that they're going to lose control of it and their ability to make money from it.",
        "There is American argument, but it's not entirely true.",
        "Because when new compounds are discovered and when they're launched, they're mostly launched in advanced markets such as the United States, Europe and Japan.",
        "Now, when these drugs are sold in these markets were patent regimes are very strict, companies try and make most of the cost recovery from these markets.",
        "And at a later stage such drugs are introduced in India.",
        "Hence, their claim that just because they are not having a great patent regime in India it doesn't mean that they will be making heavy losses on their innovation.",
        "It just means that their attempts to make more and more money from countries like India would get curtailed.",
