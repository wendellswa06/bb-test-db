        "And then you got Saudi-trained clerics coming back, Kosovars who'd gone to Saudi Arabia to train.",

        "I asked Carlotta Gall whether the United States has some explaining to do given the American presence in Kosovo.",
        "This was all right under the noses of American peacekeepers and Americans who were clearly following some of this because we do know that some of the big Saudi charities, which then were linked to al-Qaida after 9/11, they were closed down in Kosovo.",
        "So the Americans knew there was a problem.",

        "This was when the war in Iraq was starting.",
        "I think they took their eyes off it.",
        "Does the Saudi government have a legitimate argument to make that they have been blamed for too much, that they are not directly supporting the export of extremism, terrorism, that in many cases they are just trying to help spread Islam and do charity work and missionary work in countries around the world?",
        "Well, that's certainly what they say, and I hear that.",
        "But what's interesting is a country like Kosovo has decided they have to close these charities down because, I think, they tried to get Saudi help in tracing what was bad money and what was well-intentioned money and, I think, got very little help.",
        "They said, even if we're closing down an orphanage that's doing good work, we cannot tolerate this because it's pushing a certain kind of Islam that is not our own and that is then leading people further into either incitement of hatred or into terrorism.",
        "And, I mean, you say you've covered so many stories like this and looked at radicalization around the world.",
        "Is there a lesson from Kosovo that might inform us on sort of a larger scale and in terms of ISIS recruitment or how ISIS can be defeated?"
