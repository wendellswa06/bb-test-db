        "Let there be no reason now for any American to fail to cherish their citizenship in this, the greatest nation on earth.",
        "McCain also reached out to his former rival, promising to do everything he could to help Obama lead the country through the difficult challenges it faces.",
        "I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited.",
        "Although that may be the kind of thing that candidates say at the end of elections, last night those words seemed to mark a true defining moment, as Obama likes to say.",
        "All at once, a historic racial breakthrough, a break with the policies of an unpopular president, and the stunning achievement of a young first-term senator who rewrote the rules of modern presidential campaigns and in the process, as John McCain said last night, inspired the hopes of millions of Americans who once wrongly believed they had little at stake in the election of an American president.",
        "We're listening to NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson.",
        "And Mara, as huge as that election is, it was just one of the elections that was decided yesterday.",
        "How are the House and Senate going to be different after Tuesday?",
        "Well, they're going to have a lot bigger Democratic majorities.",
        "The Democrats are just about back to the kind of majority they had before the Republicans took over the House in 1994.",
        "It's rare that there are two back-to-back elections with gains this big.",
        "The last time Democrats won back-to-back, double-digit gains in the House was in the 1930s.",
        "Although, we have to mention that in 1992, brand new President Bill Clinton came in with big Democratic majorities, and it didn't work out so well.",
        "That's right, Steve.",
        "Bill Clinton had 58 Democratic senators and 258 Democrats in the House, but it was a different kind of majority.",
        "These new senators and new members of Congress are beholden to Obama in a way that Democrats were not to Bill Clinton.",
        "These new senators and congressmen didn't just ride the Democratic wave, they rode a wave that Obama helped to make bigger.",
        "And I think the real question for the Democratic majority and President-elect Obama is how they're going to confront these huge problems they're facing right now and whether they think they have a mandate or just a chance to make their case to the American people.",
        "Mara, thanks very much.",
        "Thank you, Steve."

        "Add to that, the dramatic declines on Wall Street this past few weeks.",

        "We begin with NPR's Audie Cornish.",
        "First of all, we're going to get a new regulator in the form of this consumer financial protection bureau or agency.",
        "So far, we've only had banking regulators, so they didn't know what to do with mortgage lenders who aren't banks or an AIG, which sold insurance, but also did some betting and other kinds of risky trades on the side.",
        "They were focused on the big guys, not on the consumers.",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "So you're going to have a consumer-oriented bureau, which is going to watch over all the lending that's, you know, in your file cabinet at home, your checkbook and your student loan and your mortgage.",
        "All that paperwork is going to be watched by someone.",
        "And then the regulators themselves, as a whole, will now be tasked with watching over the entire system to monitor for big sort of seismic shifts or changes.",
        "Is everyone starting to trade in one kind of thing and what's that thing made up of?",
        "And the idea is that once they get a sense of what's going on, they can drill down and maybe address the problem.",
        "What does it mean for the average consumer?",
        "Will it mean that, you know, mortgage paperwork will be easier?",
        "Will it mean that our credit card fees will go down?",
        "What does it mean for people, you know, like us?"

        "Well, the Republicans who oppose the bill would probably say regulation never makes anything easier.",
        "So, if you can think about it that way, you're going to have an agency now who is going to be looking at that mortgage.",
        "And if it's an adjustable rate mortgage or a subprime mortgage for someone who doesn't have great credit, things are going to be a lot more stringent.",
        "You won't be able to get a loan without really showing evidence you can pay for that loan.",
        "We just come out of a few years where you didn't have to do that.",

        "That's also in - a provision in there.",
        "It's a huge part of the bill and it's actually the most contentious part of the bill because it's a big unregulated market, basically, bankers or investors or even farmers or airlines.",
        "They can call up banks and say, I think the price of oil is going to go down or up, I'm gonna put some money down against that to protect me from when that price change happens.",
        "The problem is during the loan crisis, people were doing that with loans, bundled packages of loans, which are called mortgage-backed securities.",
        "So they were betting on whether these things would go up or down.",
        "They were betting on whether or not you were going to pay off your mortgage.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Here's another story we're following this weekend.",
        "Newsweek is set to publish a piece on Monday that back in 2009, the Obama administration secretly provided Israel with 55-deep penetrating bombs, so-called bunker busters.",
        "And there's some speculation that those bombs could be used in the event Israel decides to launch a military strike against suspected Iranian nuclear development sites.",
        "Reporter Eli Lake broke the story, and he joins me now.",
        "And, Eli, first of all, these were the same bunker busters, I understand, that the Bush administration initially refused to sell to Israel.",
        "Remind us of the background here.",
        "Yes.",
        "In 2005, the Israelis initially requested this particular kind of bunker buster, which is the top of the line.",
        "It can go through 20 feet of solid concrete.",
        "And the rationale at the time was deep concerns with Israeli transfers of military technology to China.",
        "That issue was largely resolved by 2007.",
        "And in a secret letter from President Bush to Prime Minister Olmert, Bush agreed to sell the bunker busters.",
        "But that sale was then deferred two years into what became the Obama administration.",
        "And then Obama, very early in his administration, approved the transfer of 55 out of 100 that had - Bush had agreed to sell Israel in 2009."

        "You write that the Bush administration did not sell them to Israel because there was concern at the Pentagon that it would send the wrong message about Iran, right?",
        "Well, the original concern was about the China transfer.",
        "But later on, the Pentagon did not have this concern, but it was described to me by the just-retired vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General James Cartwright, as a concern the administration that selling the bunker busters openly would send a message to the Iranians that the United States was not interested in the diplomatic outreach that President Obama tried in 2009.",
        "And also, it could send a message to Prime Minister Netanyahu that this was, in fact, a green light to attack Iran.",
        "Mm.",
        "But why did the Obama administration agree to do it?",
        "I think the Obama administration has done a lot of things continuing with initiatives under President George W.",

        "And one example is a concept of trying to link the missile defense systems of the entire Middle East region together in sort of one coherent missile defense group.",
        "So that is another thing that Obama has asked the State Department to pursue, again, very quietly, something that's fairly significant in Israel's favor in a sense that missile defense requires far more geographic territory than Israel has to just do it in a national level.",
        "Eli, as you know, there are some American Jewish voters who regard the Obama administration as insufficiently pro-Israel.",
        "And I wonder whether this leak or whatever it was by the administration was a deliberate or maybe a subtle attempt to send a message to those voters.",

        "Here in Washington the focus was on who's up and who's down and what this Republican is saying or that Democrat is saying.",

        "If they were at the White House, the president would likely be surrounded by the lawmakers who backed the stimulus package, and it would be hard to escape the fact that there were only three Republicans in that crowd.",
        "So instead he's going out to Colorado, where the focus will not be on the messy politics behind the stimulus but on the economic impact for the people.",
        "Why Colorado specifically?",
        "I mean, people are losing jobs, sadly, in many parts of the country.",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "To hear Colorado's governor tell it, this is a salute to that state's investment and leadership in green energy, alternative energy.",
        "The stimulus package includes about $50 billion in incentives for energy efficiency and alternatives.",
        "And so the president will be speaking to a couple of hundred clean energy business executives and he'll be using as his backdrop a museum in Denver that has a large solar collector on its rooftop.",
        "Now, the Obama administration has said this measure will save or create about three-and-a-half million jobs over the next two years, but that number is lower than the number that we heard when these conversations began, isn't it?"
