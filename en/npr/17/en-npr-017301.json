        "The admissions policies of that institution, as well as others, have been debated at the court for years.",

        "Some NIEs were put on the boards and there was no urgency associated with the delivery of the NIE.",
        "And they could string out for as long as this one has.",

        "Kennedy believes the intelligence community's leaders are, quote, \"dragging their feet\" on producing a new estimate.",
        "Specifically, he's furious that delivering the NIE at the end of this month means it will arrive after the president's speech.",
        "For the intelligence community not to have that available to the president and not to have it available to the Congress when we are going to give a reaction to the president's proposal, I think is irresponsible.",
        "Spokesmen for Negroponte point out the president gets a daily intelligence briefing.",
        "It's not as though he's operating in the dark regarding what his intelligence advisors think.",
        "The spokesmen also argue better to get the Iraq Estimate right than to rush it - an argument that does not sway Senator Kennedy."

        "So it sounds like multiple attackers, then?",

        "And then two suicide bombers followed up the shots.",
