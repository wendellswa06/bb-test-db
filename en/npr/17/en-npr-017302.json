        "Oh, best way to binge watch, always make sure you have snacks, always make sure that you actually take time - maybe not after every episode but maybe after every three episodes to, like, stand up, maybe look out a window, breathe in some air before you dive back in.",
        "Nice.",

        "For the Rwandan soldiers here on the ground, this crisis brings back very painful memories of what happened in 1994, and they are determined to put their lives on the line to stop the killings.",
