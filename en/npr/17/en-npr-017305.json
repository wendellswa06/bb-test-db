        "If Cuba sees this as just another way for Washington to encourage regime change, the negotiations won't go well.",
        "If there's an intelligent, low, incremental way of pushing the envelope, I think that that approach has the potential for being more successful over the long term.",
        "But Arnson doesn't think the Obama administration has quite figured out how to do that.",
        "Michele Kelemen, NPR News, Washington.",

        "Well, this backlog has been something that on - the claims has built up because there's a record number of new claims coming in because we're doing very aggressive outreach to our veterans, educating them in what they're eligible for and encouraging them to come on in and file a claim.",
        "And on the medical side, we're taking all the actions that we can.",
