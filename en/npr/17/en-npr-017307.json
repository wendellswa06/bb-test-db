        "Best case scenario that I can see is going to be a little less than three feet.",

        "We do nothing.",

        "But anything above five feet and you're talking tremendous economic and biological dislocation.",
        "Worst case scenario?",
        "Worst case scenario would be five feet by 2100.",
        "But the problem with the five-foot rise, a sea level rise is something that doesn't take place at a constant level.",
        "It's accelerating.",
        "So once you have a five-foot rise by 2100, you might have a 50-foot rise by 2200.",
        "So the five-foot rise would be catastrophic economically but it would also really be pointing the gun to the head of all of the coastal cities.",
        "Sooner or later, within a century or two after that, you're going to be dealing with triage, trying to figure out what do we save and what don't we.",
        "Where in the U.S.",
        "are we likely to see the effects?",
        "I mean, we think about, let's say, the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, and we can imagine what that looks like on a map, right?",

        "In some senses.",
        "The place that will be most mitigated in terms of geography will be the entire Gulf region.",
        "I mean, that poor benighted place where we have all that nasty oil going to shore, that is the area where sea level will have the greatest impact.",
        "So when you talk abut the Gulf, are you talking about, for example, the Mississippi Delta?",
        "Yes.",
        "The Mississippi Delta and every other delta on this planet is an endangered species.",
        "Deltas are completely tied into sea level.",
        "Even a one-foot rise in sea level tremendously affects the sedimentology of delta formation.",
        "And here's why deltas are so important: an enormous proportion of the world's rice comes from the deltas in the tropical areas of the planet.",
        "When we have a rise even of a foot in sea level, we have many feet of lateral salt migration, the problem isn't the vertical rise of the sea.",
        "It is the fact that salt has this nasty habit of migrating sideways.",
        "And sideways into soil kills off agricultural crops.",
        "Salt and plants that produce crops just don't mix.",
        "Mangroves, if we could eat mangroves, we'd be in great shape.",
        "But we're looking at this confluence, and this is why I'm so disturbed.",
        "We're looking at a global population that's going from 6.6 billion to nine billion.",
        "We're looking at a sea level rise from one to three feet, and we're looking at a reduction in arable land because of that sea level, so the equation is more people less food."

        "One, that scientists are wrong and that the icecaps won't actually melt; the second that the icecaps will melt but humans will adapt and they'll begin to cooperate; and the third is kind of a, I would call, \"\"Mad Max\"\" scenario where the ice caps melt and you have something akin to global anarchy.",

        "And this was in consequence to changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide far less than what we're doing now.",
        "And that would've been the results of volcanoes, for example?",
        "What we're doing to the atmosphere now is very similar to what I studied in the deep past, which is that the Permian extinction and the Triassic extinction, when there were enormous volcanic vents of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at rates that seem to be akin to what we're doing now.",
        "Now, we just came through a horrible global recession and yet emissions globally did not reduce to where we hope they were.",

        "Peter Ward, all of the scenarios you lay out are quite shocking and they're fascinating, but I wonder at what point does all you say become tangible, become something that people can actually see and be affected by, because, you know, one could argue that until that point, this is just theoretical and it's difficult to get people to respond and to make changes.",

        "We will have tried to do defenses on our coastlines, and with rising temperatures we're going to get stronger hurricanes; all good.",
        "So even if the sea level doesn't rise, the attempts to defense it are actually very powerful and positive things.",

        "But it is not to say that the government of Iran would not have done this campaign of harassment against NGOs anyway, but now it has the perfect excuse to legitimize and justify its action.",
        "Ghaemi estimates that 100 Iranian human rights and democracy activists have been hauled in for questioning by intelligence officials in recent months.",
        "People are being asked about travels they made to conferences abroad, who they talked to, who they met, what were the conferences about, where the funding came from, to basically build up a hypothesis that all these activities were somehow supported or being planned through the State Department."
