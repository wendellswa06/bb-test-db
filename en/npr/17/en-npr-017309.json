        "So let me ask you this: why does this happen?",
        "Why won't homeowners lower their price when they're trying to sell their house and it's not selling?",
        "When a homeowner thinks that they're going to have to take a loss if they sell their house, they're inclined instead to gamble by setting a much higher asking price, hoping that they can beat the odds and the magic buyer will come in and is willing to pay at least what they originally paid for their house so that they don't have to feel that they have taken a loss on the investment in their house.",
        "So what's this effect do to the housing market as a whole?",
        "In normal times, sellers ask for something like 12 percent more than they think is reasonable to get for their house.",
        "And on average it takes about six months to sell a house.",
        "In a down market, what happens is sellers ask for about a third more - not 12 percent more - but 33 percent more than what they think is the reasonable going rate for their home.",
        "You know, they can wait up to two years to sell their house if they manage to sell it.",
        "That's really odd seeming.",
        "I mean, why in a worse market would they ask a much higher price for their house?",
        "Ego.",
        "We call it the psychological tendency aversion to a sure loss.",
        "And so the psychological pain is something that is difficult for most people to accept and so they defer it.",
        "So what does this do for all those buyers out there driving around looking at the signs on the front lawn?",
        "I mean, if people are looking for a bargain and they're finding prices that are set a lot higher this time, how do they and how should they react?",
        "Well, most buyers are simply going to find that they're going to be coming up against sellers who look like they won't negotiate.",
        "And that's the reason why the sales don't actually happen.",
        "That's why even though there's a lot offered on the market in terms of number of homes during down markets and housing cycles, the turnover rates rocks dramatically.",
        "You know, I would tend to assume that that would be because there aren't very many buyers on the market.",
        "But you're saying that part of the blame goes to the sellers for being stubborn about their asking price."

        "That's right.",

        "How does recovery happen?",
        "Housing cycles last for about four years.",
        "I think what will happen is that prices are going to continue to decline, and as they continue to decline, we're going to go through a bit more pain.",
        "But ultimately the excess supply of housing, people are going to buy it.",
        "There are going to be bargains.",
        "There are going to be professional investors who buy homes and put them on the market as rentals.",
        "So what will happen is that prices will do their job and the excess supply of housing will get absorbed and then we'll be back to normal.",

        "I asked him, why so many rewrites?",
        "To be fair, the first one was really about an interim constitution.",
        "The next two, the one in December 2012 and this one, really are not about a fundamentally different document.",
        "It's much more about who's writing the document.",
        "The document that was passed in 2012 was written by an assembly dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood.",
        "The Muslim Brotherhood is now out of power, treated as a terrorist organization by the government, and there's a new group in charge that's writing this document.",
        "So how is the document different?",
        "What are the changes?",
        "Well, if you were to read through the two documents, you wouldn't see an enormous number of differences.",
        "What you would see would be a little bit more robust human rights protections in this one, a little bit less religious language and also what probably hasn't attracted enough notice, an awful lot of insulation for some institutions of the Egyptian state, like the military, the religious establishment and even the police."

        "And any political process that moves forward has to be based on a recognition of the legitimacy of that election.",
        "There are still factions in Egypt that are budding heads over the constitution, you know, even just beyond the Muslim Brotherhood.",
        "Assuming that it does pass, as you say it will, how far do you think that the constitution will go towards solving some of Egypt's very serious problems?",
        "Well, it's certainly not going to heal Egypt's deep political wounds, these divisions between the Islamists and the non-Islamists.",
        "It may perhaps result in a more powerful, more coherent government.",
        "The government that is there now is this kind of motley coalition of civilian political figures with the military and the security apparatus lurking very much in the wings.",
        "You could have an elected president who would have a little bit more of a mandate, especially if that president comes from the military and can therefore rule partly from the military and partly from the regular constitutional framework.",
        "That's not a recipe for a real democracy, but it might be a political system that at least can make some firm decisions rather than the current pattern, which is of a government a little bit adrift."
