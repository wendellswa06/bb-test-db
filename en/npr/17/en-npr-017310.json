        "This is the Ingalls homestead, the land that Laura Ingalls Wilder's family of \"\"Little House on the Prairie\"\" fame finally settled on in the 1880s.",
        "It is breathtaking: waving grasses and wildflowers to the horizon; a patch of low-lying wetlands called the Big Slough, where Laura's dad mowed hay for his horses; and five of the original cottonwood trees the Ingalls family planted as a windbreak 120-some years ago.",
        "Seventeen-year-old Ann Poppin is teaching these city kids how to drive the covered wagon.",
        "She loves her job, but she says sometimes she's afraid the tourists don't really understand pioneer life; they romanticize it.",
        "I guess being a rural person and living on a farm, you kind of have a better understanding of what it's like to actually farm.",
        "And so you can relate to these people that, you know, had to come out here and travel so many miles and struggle and struggle and struggle for hours on end just to get a crop in and then watch it, you know, burn up in the heat with no rain or, you know, watch grasshoppers devour it.",
        "Poppin's family farm is about 12 miles from here, a thousand acres of crops and 120 head of cattle, and she loves it.",
        "But she says sometimes the government seems to respond to the ideas that city people have about rural farming life rather than what the farmers themselves need, like with regulations on how many animals can be kept in a feed lot, for instance.",
        "Well, sometimes people in cities don't understand that while, you know, I like my beef and I like my pork, but you know, I don't like to see animals like that, you know, well, that's how it works, you know.",
        "It's just, you know, sometimes the urban people and the government don't agree with the rural people.",
        "And, Poppin says, even for pioneer Charles Ingalls, Laura's dad, government was part of life.",
        "Though he took his family west looking for an independent rural life, he had to follow certain rules.",
        "The Ingalls had to live on this land for five years, till and sow at least 10 acres every season and plant the required number of trees for that windbreak.",
        "Only then was this 160-acre homestead in Dakota Territory awarded to them by the government.",

        "Don't they?",
        "So what does the president have to gain with this tactic?",
        "Well, that is a really good question because, as Republicans in Congress keep on telling him, putting tariffs on Mexico is the same thing as putting taxes on Texas because, despite the president's deep beliefs about how tariffs work, no one else agrees with him.",
        "The fact is that Mexico does not pay these tariffs; U.S.",
        "companies and consumers do.",
        "And trade really has been the rare issue where Republicans in Congress are willing to split with the president.",
        "And he, right now, is facing his biggest revolt yet of Republicans.",
        "There isn't a veto-proof majority in Congress yet, but he's getting a lot of pushback.",

        "On the other hand, the Military Commissions Act does have a broad definition of what an unlawful enemy combatant is, and that definition can include American citizens.",
