        "And I learned as a military commander, as an infantry platoon leader, that I owe my soldiers, my subordinates four things: I owe them proper training, I owe them proper equipment, I owe them a complete plan, and I owe them a time line.",
        "A timeline is a reasonable part of incorporating a complete military plan.",
        "Everything in the military has a time line.",

        "Frank Adams, one of the things that we've heard from some of the veterans that we've spoken with is that they would like to hear more talk of a, quote, \"\"victory strategy\"\" than all this talk of a, quote, \"\"exit strategy.",
        "Well, I can relate to that.",
        "I think they want to know what their mission is and when they may be coming home, you know, sooner or later, but military for the boots on the ground in harm's way definitely needs the support of the American people and especially our folks at the White House instead of hearing about partisan issues.",

        "To use the troops as some kind of a hostage or to say that, you know, every bit of political criticism is undermining the troops, I think, is ridiculous.",

        "We're grown adults that have our political opinions and we have a job to do, and we're going to do it no matter what happens back at home.",
        "Frank Adams, what do you mean when you say we've got to support the troops?",
        "When you hear certain rhetoric coming out of the mouths of people that are governing this country and they're trying to put time lines and they are saying what we're going to do over there and when we're going to do it, I think that it puts our men in harm's way.",
        "You know, with the technology we have, everyone is listening.",

        "Well, it's hard to tell, Madeleine, but there's a deep well of good feeling for the newly elected president.",

        "And what he said to them was, you know, I understand Republicans have objections.",
        "I understand some Democrats want more, but we have an unprecedented economic crisis.",
        "And then he went on to say, we need to deal with it rapidly.",
        "So, he's making an appeal for bipartisan support because he wants to maintain that going forward so that everyone can understand he doesn't want to get locked into the kind of partisanship that was so debilitating to President Bush and even to President Clinton over the last 16 years.",
        "Well, Juan, I have to ask you - is this just a photo-op?",
        "Because really, Democrats are in control of both Houses and now in control of the White House, so does it really matter that he meet with the Republican leaders on the stimulus bill?",
        "Won't he get what he wants anyway?",
        "Well, he'll get what he wants, but he wants to present himself as a pragmatic, centrist politician who's looking for what works.",
        "So, that's why he wants to make sure that he can get that bipartisan support, and in the Senate - this is really important - he doesn't have 60 votes.",
        "It's not filibuster-proof, so he would like to, especially in the Senate, maintain a strong bipartisan look to whatever stimulus package he produces.",
        "Well, speaking of vocal Republican opponents, Texas Senator John Cornyn has held up two of the president's Cabinet appointments.",
        "At first, Hillary Clinton, who is now secretary of state, but also Eric Holder for attorney general.",
        "What's going on there?",
        "Well, the stories that's kind of untold in Washington these days is the Republican attempt to find out how they will voice opposition to President Obama without appearing to be petty or simply obstructionist.",
        "And in the case of John Cornyn, he raised a very important point about president - former President Bill Clinton's contributions to his charity, and whether or not that could be a conflict in interest given that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will be running American foreign affairs.",
        "But the more serious challenge here is to Eric Holder.",

        "So, the federal government now can assist state governments in investigating hate crimes.",

        "So, Chris, we have we've had speculation in this case, the Tulsa shooting, along with the Trayvon Martin shooting death, a lot of speculation about what are the factors that might make these cases hate crimes.",
        "What are the things that the prosecutors would be looking for?",
        "Well, on the one hand, prosecutors are going to want to look for some manifestation of bias at the time of the commission of the crime.",
        "So, something that the accused says, a racial epithet, for example, would be that kind of evidence.",
        "Absent that, the prosecutor is going to want to try to find circumstantial evidence that suggests a state of mind that would contribute to elements of a hate crime.",
        "So, for example, membership in a hate group, a white supremacist group; some family background of exposure to some of these issues; writings, posters, past statements in this regard are going to help to form that circumstantial case.",
        "And conversely, and in other cases, defendants have tried to find the opposite - tried to prove that they have relationships with the group that they're said to have offended.",
        "Yes.",
