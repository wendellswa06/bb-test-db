        "Well, you know, what has happened is that the Bush administration's strategy for detention is continually been rebuffed by the highest court, and that really gives a lot of people pause, not only just politicians, but, you know, really the country, the whole idea of setting up this separate structure to detain those who we consider terrorists.",

        "Uh-huh.",
        "How do you think - is there any special perspective that some members of the black community bring to a discussion like this?",
        "I certainly think so, because as you said, it's been abused in the past, and I just think it sets a bad precedent, you know, here in the United States we have the rights, and privileges, and protection under the law, but anytime you have the kind of system that's being set up there, where you can be detained for years with no protection, no information, I just think that it really leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the African-Americans.",
        "For a system where you just don't have any information, because it can be abused, and if it's allowed to go on in that part of the country, or that part of the world, then, you know, African-Americans think that it can expand and go on elsewhere.",
        "And so, I don't have a problem with the ruling of the Supreme Court.",
        "I think that people who were detained should know why they are detained, and have a right to fight against it.",
