        "In recent years, as opposition to gays became an overt rallying point in the GOP, Tafel says a schism happened in the gay community in Washington.",
        "If you were a Democrat you came out.",
        "If you were a Republican, Tafel says, you probably went deeper into the closet.",
        "So it created a out of balance, in a way, beucase now as a political weapon, knowing that you're gay and you work for a Republican could be something that I could exploit against you politically.",
        "And there's very few weapons in this town that partisan politics on both sides don't use.",
        "This week, both the House and Senate have convened panels on climate change, during which scientists have accused the White House of bending the data and intimidating researchers who are ready to sound the alarm on global warming.",
        "And the outrage has been kind of amazingly bipartisan.",
        "Well, there's some discussion as to whether or not these text messages are admissible.",
        "Clearly the prosecutor feels that they are.",
        "We've had judges rule that they can be delivered by subpoena.",
        "So they don't seem to see a problem with it.",
        "And just politically one of the problems the Mayor is going to have is that he doesn't seem to be denying that they are accurate.",
        "He just seems to be trying to take him out of the mix.",
        "In other words, if I can't win on the evidence, let's hear the evidence.",

        "What I know about the local affiliate here, if I can call it that, this is probably one of the most balanced and fair forums that you're going to get.",
        "And so I think it's a bit disingenuous to suggest that somehow the press has created the mess we're in right now.",
        "I just don't get that from a majority of the people that are talking to the pastors that I represent.",
        "I think the feeling is probably better expressed in terms of frustration, in terms of disbelief.",
        "There is a willingness to be forgiving.",
        "But there is also this notion of accountability.",
        "And often when people turn to the faith community, they say - even politicians will often say - well, you're supposed to be forgiving.",
        "Yes, the faith community is forgiving, but there is also accountability that is attached to forgiveness, and I think that's where most of the people that we're talking to are expressing.",
        "That seems to be their general sentiment.",
        "Nobody wants to see this mayor, his family, this city suffer through this devastating situation.",
        "We're hoping that it can be resolved quickly.",
        "When you think about politics today, there's been a spate of people having to face sexual revelations; Spitzer and Patterson in New York, Kilpatrick.",
        "But this is not - the prosecution, the legal prosecution, is not about sex.",
        "It's about, you know, lying under oath and questions like that.",
        "Nonetheless, you know, as someone who works in the faith community, is sex what's making people pay attention to this or is it these larger issues of corporate and city governance and propriety?",
        "I mean how are people relating to this, do you think?",
        "There's where we are getting some mixed views.",
        "Some people do believe this is a situation that's simply involves the mayor and his wife.",
        "I don't believe that average citizens have educated themselves on the issues, the deeper issues, the issues that affect his oath of office, the issues that affect his fiduciary responsibility as it relates to being the mayor.",
        "I don't think people are looking at the actions that were taken relative to the police officers who were discharged and why they were discharged.",
        "If people would look at those issues, I think they'd probably formulate different opinions.",
        "But it would be disingenuous for me not to say that, absolutely, we have heard from some of our constituents that, you know, this is a private affair of the mayor's; why is the press digging into this; if - or but for this, these sexual revelations, this would be a non-issue.",
        "Do you believe that the prosecutor, Wayne County prosecutor Kym Worthy, is taking on the establishment by pursuing this case?",
        "I don't.",
        "What I know about Kym Worthy is that she is a very fair-minded individual and she's also a very focused individual.",
        "I don't think that any of the ramifications of these charges one way or the other have influenced what she decided to do.",
        "I think she looked at the situation, made an informed judgment and determined that she had to bring charges.",
        "I just don't view her as sort of taking on the establishment.",
        "Now, the effect of what she's done is going to reverberate through the establishment.",
        "I think that she's ushering in a new era in Detroit politics.",
        "One which says that, you know, you've got to place a very high value on integrity and on transparency and on being open and honest when communicating with the city.",
        "And my hope, my prayer is that the mayor, no matter what happens in the situation, and not just the mayor but politicians who are coming forward, politicians who are sitting now, get that message, that integrity does mean something and honesty is the best policy.",
        "What role if any does the faith community have in making sure that as these things unfold people are in a position to advocate for themselves as citizens and make good decisions?"

        "He has not been driven by the spotlight.",

        "So I'm not sure anyone's really out there calling that a clear win for the new majority.",
        "But with divided government, I think Democrats see a lot of their purpose is about creating a contrast with the president and with the Republican Party.",
        "And when - if you look at the legislation that they are - have already passed and are soon to pass, it does kind of tell you a story in that one of the throughlines in this agenda is the Democratic Party is really advocating for a much bigger role for the federal government in day-to-day life here.",
