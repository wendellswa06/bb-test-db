        "That really gets to the heart of what is a feminist, and it's a very malleable term.",
        "It historically - and I should say, the term only is used after the late 19th century, but if we use it ahistorically, all the women's rights movements and all the historical movements for women's full humanity, for education, spiritual equality, and the like, there have been varieties of feminism: liberal, radical, socialist, ecofeminism.",
        "Can there be conservative feminism?",
        "That is an interesting question right now because conservative women have mobilized in the United States, certainly since the 1920s.",

        "I think you're making a very good point.",
        "And I think that there's several ways of understanding that.",
        "One is that there are some conservative women who agree with parts of feminist politics from a libertarian individual rights position, and who sincerely see a link between equal opportunity and their classic conservative politics.",
        "That is, everyone should have opportunity, but individuals rather than government.",
        "Then I think there's a more cynical or a more politically exploitative use which is to sort of subvert or appropriate the feminist label and to say because I'm a woman and I agree with the conservative policies, I'm going to call myself a feminist and I'm going to therefore try to bring in women's votes.",
