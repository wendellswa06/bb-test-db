        "We've got something that's right on our laps that is absolutely the worst kind of drug that the nation has ever seen, and to not address it now, it will be a huge mistake.",

        "And she was proceeding in a three-car motorcade that was three, bulletproof 4-by-4s that were leaving the park where the rally had taken place.",
        "And they had just made their way out of the park when she decided that she wanted to wave goodbye to her supporters as she often does at the end of her rallies.",
        "And she poked her head out of the moonroof of the vehicle she was riding in.",
        "And at that point, between three and five gunshots rang out.",
        "She slumped back down into her seat at that point.",
        "And literally, seconds later, a very powerful suicide bomber detonated himself right next to her vehicle.",
        "And it's unclear whether she was actually hit by the bullets or by the shrapnel or both, but it was a very well-coordinated attack.",
        "So it sounds like multiple attackers, then?",
        "It is possible that it was a single individual.",
        "But it was, in many ways, similar to the attack that was carried out two months ago when Benazir Bhutto returned to Pakistan after eight years in exile, where 140 people were killed.",
        "And again, in that situation, several shots were fired at her vehicle.",
        "And then two suicide bombers followed up the shots."
