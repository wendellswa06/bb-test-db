        "Well, by numbers, it's the anticipated--stepping on glass, stepping on nails, a couple of falls--but we are also seeing some significant injuries in terms of electrocution.",
        "We had an instance the other day across the lake where a teen-ager was cutting wood and another part of the tree collapsed, fell on him, and he was significantly injured, most likely a spinal cord injury.",
        "We're also seeing again electrocutions and now we're seeing motor vehicle accidents as a result, as much as anything else, from a lack of traffic control.",
        "In most parts of the city, there's not even a basic red-green system.",
        "So in some areas, we have four-way stops, but quite frankly, traffic control is primarily based on the drivers themselves.",
        "And now we're going to have drivers who are very anxious to get back to their homes, have things on their minds, and we certainly are anticipating an increase in those type of injuries.",
        "Dr.",
        "Redlener, let's talk a little bit about a previous experience of disaster, 9/11 in New York.",
        "What were some of the differences between a situation like 9/11 and the situation that you've got in New Orleans right now?",
        "Well, there really were some extraordinary differences between the 9/11 experience and what we're experiencing throughout that 90,000-square-mile area that's been hit by the hurricane and the flooding in New Orleans.",
        "And in particular is the absence, in this case, this current case, of proximal resources to come in to the rescue.",
        "Even in 9/11, which was horrific beyond description for all the reasons that we all know, we had a flood in of resources and help from hospitals, first responders, everything you can imagine from the surrounding communities of New Jersey, Connecticut, and even the rest of New York City.",
        "So it was a much more confined area.",
        "So the problem now with such a vast area that's been affected, that the neighboring communities, even the neighboring states that you might anticipate could come in to help are themselves struggling with the consequences of the storm.",
        "So the fact that we don't have the proximal resources to help out, as we did in 9/11, is a very big difference.",
        "And the second thing is that we didn't see in New York City after the initial explosion any secondary problems.",
        "Here, we had the storm, the hurricane, the flood, and a long-term problem with the kinds of injuries and illnesses that Dr. Aiken was just talking about.",
        "So the conditions here are extremely different, both devastating, but this one requiring a whole other level of preparedness and response.",
        "And Sue Paulson in Crystal Lake, Illinois says, Principal Salter ought to be teaching other principals and school boards to be bold enough to raise young adults, not simply supervise animal behavior.",
        "And is that the most desirable part of the party, to get your photo taken with the president?",
        "Well, it's not oil for arms.",
        "It's oil and arms.",
        "Of recent years, the United States has become much more self-sufficient in terms of energy, but Saudi Arabia remains a huge producer of oil, and more important, incredibly influential in the international setting of oil prices.",
        "But it's also a purchaser, as President Trump has repeatedly said, of arms made by U.S.",
        "companies.",
        "But there's something more, and that is mainly Iran.",
        "The United States has seen Saudi Arabia as a check on Iran, both in the region internationally, and to the extent that it's a live issue, the U.S.",
        "also thinks that Saudi Arabia could be helpful in any elusive Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.",
        "Now, oil is also on the mind of our next listener.",
        "Hello.",
        "My name is Sean Fitzmorris.",
        "I'm from New Orleans, La.",
        "How did the U.S.",
        "view Saudi Arabia before oil was a thing?",
        "Thank you.",
        "Basically, there was no view before oil was a thing.",
        "Saudi Arabia as we know it was - became a country in 1932.",
        "The very next year, it signed an agreement with Standard Oil of California to form Aramco, the Arabian American Oil Company, which is now owned by the Saudi state.",
        "And that happened even before it was clear how oil rich the country would be.",
        "The leader who unified the country and started the relationship with the U.S.",
        "was Abdulaziz ibn Saud.",
        "He had 45 sons, Steve, and all the kings since his death in 1953.",
        "And then one of those sons, the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, we've been hearing so much about lately, would be the first of the next generation if he becomes king."

        "This would have been inimical to anything that the Persians would have brought.",
        "Of course history being written by the victors, the Athenians and then the historians of Athens did not paint a pretty picture of the Persian Empire, but was it really so tyrannical?",
        "Was it so bad?",
        "Most of that would have been lost or extinguished.",

        "Maybe, but we're not - obviously it would not have been the same.",

        "A lot of debates about who was exactly there and who was exactly where.",
        "Herodotus may not have mentioned it because everyone just assumed they had calvary on the battlefield, but in a tight box, a phalanx of fully, heavily-armored men coming at you like a steamroller, where you have no room to get on their flanks, would just crush everything before it.",
        "There were not heavily-armed infantrymen in front of them.",
        "So the Persians had wicker shields."
