        "Because there was a navy person, you know, involved in this, and was the senator somebody the overall...",

        "The battle you're talking about, I think, is Salamis, which was critical in the second invasion, Persian invasion.",

        "They lost that.",
        "Half their army marched home, and the other half was defeated the following year at Plataea by a combined Athenian-Spartan force.",

        "And they vowed to send forces to participate with the Athens, to defend Athens against the Persians.",
        "Why didn't the Athenians wait for them?",
        "My contention - because we don't know why exactly the Persians - the Athenians did not wait.",

        "He did have a lot of experience with the Persian army, so he may have been a top advisor.",
        "He may have been there to help make decisions.",
        "He may have been the most dominant personality after Callimachus died and had quite a bit to do with the forced march back from Athens to the other side of Greece, basically, to stop the Persians, the defeated Persian army, from landing there.",
        "And, Jim Lacey, writing in the National Review, just before you left for Afghanistan, you said your analysis after all that time there, the numbers of years, 12,000 American men and women killed or wounded, however many billions of dollars, 350 billion expended, that it was time to think about cutting our losses and give it up and come home.",

        "Some people would argue that the conflict in Afghanistan is just as much about Pakistan as it is about Afghanistan, and that losing a conflict to release forces that would then overrun the country next door, a country with nuclear weapons, that is something you need - you really need to think about.",
        "But us being in Afghanistan, I do not know.",

        "And I guess my question is is do you think that the decision by the Persians to move forward - and you alluded a little bit to the fact that they needed to keep moving, as if they had already made land - that it was - that the tactical failure was either due to their arrogance, that they just believed that they could overcome the hoplite army?",

        "So, how do you react hearing a statistic like that?",
        "Those who follow politics know that these months can be a lifetime in a political cycle.",
        "And one of the things that is demonstrated in those polls is that, unfortunately, name ID is low, so that's some of what you're seeing.",
        "And as the Republican candidates start really targeting and connecting and speaking to Hispanic voters across the country, that'll change.",
        "Still, President Obama apparently won 67 percent of the Latino vote in 2008.",
        "That's, again, winning by just about 40 points.",
        "So, do you believe that the findings of the Pew Research poll that show the president ahead by 40 points have nothing to do with what a lot of the Republican candidates, including Mitt Romney, have said about immigration?",
        "I think that polls are just a quick snapshot in time of where we are now.",
        "So, does the Republican Party have a lot of work to do to connect with the Hispanic vote?",
        "Of course, but we are doing that.",
        "Just this week, the Republican Party announced six state directors in key battleground states that will be working directly with community leaders in each of these states, which is Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and Nevada.",
        "Each of these state communities is different, where Hispanics are not a monolithic vote.",
        "There are different communities with different priorities.",
        "They have a lot of things in common but we have to reflect those differences within the Hispanic population.",
        "But the one thing that does tie them all together is the number one issue for the last two years for Hispanics, and poll after poll said it's been the economy and jobs.",
        "I certainly think it's important to understand that Hispanic voters are not a monolith.",
        "That being said, the immigration issue has certainly gotten a lot of attention.",
        "And I wonder to what degree you think it might be responsible for how badly Republican candidates seem to be doing in nationally polling among Hispanic voters right now.",
        "Immigration is an important issue.",
        "We can't ignore the issue of immigration.",
        "But when we talk about immigration, we can talk about another failure of this president: he promised as a candidate that he would pass immigration reform within his first year, and the only thing he has done is he's been the president that has a record number of deportations - most deportations of any president in American history.",
        "He talks about not dividing families; that's exactly what he did.",
        "So, that's President Obama's immigration record.",
        "When we talk about the bigger picture of how things are going to play, like, it is important but we have to talk about what's going to get them to the polls and it's going to be jobs and the economy.",
        "Would you foresee a Republican candidate - and, obviously, a lot of people seem to think it looks like Mr. Romney now - saying that he would be in favor of fewer deportations?",
        "I don't know exactly what Romney's position is going to be on immigration.",
        "I know he's looking at different proposals.",
        "But we want to talk about Republicans and the Latino vote and how they will do.",
        "You talked a little bit about, you know, the polls.",
        "In 2010, the Republican Party did incredibly well with Hispanics.",
        "The only senator elected that was Hispanic was a Republican, Marco Rubio.",
        "The only Hispanic governors elected were both Republicans - Sandoval, the first Hispanic governor of Nevada, and the first Latina governor in American history was a Republican, Susana Martinez.",
        "And all the new Hispanic elected members of Congress were all Republican.",
        "That's a direct reflection of how important the Republican Party takes the Hispanic vote, not only reaching out to them but making them leaders within our own party.",
        "It sounds like - forgive me for wording it colloquially - that you're sort of saying in so many words: it's the economy, idiota.",
