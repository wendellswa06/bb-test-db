        "We saw two days ago a young girl had fallen off a roof that she and her family were trying to repair, and she suffered a fracture in her cervical spine.",
        "So I think we're going to see an awful lot of these kinds of injuries as well as time unfolds and people try to re-establish their houses and their communities.",

        "I don't think there's any precedent in terms of the amount of damage and destruction and disruption to give us a good sense of what that'll ultimately be.",
        "But the answer to the question about what people need to do is a lot of community support and a lot of focus on how quickly we can get things back to normal and support people during the process of relocation or coming back to their homes to re-establish those communities.",
        "I couldn't agree more.",
        "It's my opinion that illnesses from the stress that's related to what has happened here will probably be the number-one long-term chronic issue as it relates to health care.",
