        "There's just, you know, just a ton of different things that can be done to make that more accessible.",

        "And just taking a knit glove from the dollar store, and we find is if you cut off the tip of the middle finger on the knit glove, then the hand can rest on the glass, and then the middle finger can access various interactive points on the iPad without accidentally hitting something that you didn't want to hit with your finger.",
        "And that's something we frequently see people do, and they get really frustrated.",

        "So they haven't been able to observe people succeeding with them.",
        "They haven't been able to see what people are getting out of the use of these new tools.",
        "And so one of the first things that we really need to do is work with them around understanding the value and understanding what you're going to do with a device.",
        "So before people get to the notion of whether they need an assistive tool of some sort, the vast majority of older folks actually can just take a regular iPad and learn how to use it with the appropriate support.",
        "Thanks, Bob.",
        "In the 20 seconds we have left, is there - are there places people can go if they don't live in New York City?",
