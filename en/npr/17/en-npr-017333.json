        "You know, I've been hearing about email, and I'm hearing about W-W-W this.",
        "Can you show me and get us started?",
        "And so we work with them for - we have a 20-session class for iPad basics.",
        "We're also doing a social engagement version of that in partnership with the AARP Foundation in Washington, D.C.",
        "And what we're doing with folks is really getting them comfortable with the device itself, learning how to do things like just build up your contacts in the contact field and connect with your friends and family so that you can just send an email, or you can do a video chat with somebody, just kind of getting them over that hurdle is critical for most people to get started.",
        "And that social engagement piece is so huge, about being able to connect with family and friends using FaceTime is so powerful on having real-life conversations, real-time conversations.",
        "And one of the most creative things we did was for an individual that has Parkinson's, who's in an assisted-living facility, she has a very difficult time lifting her head, she has a hard time leaving the assisted-living facility, but wants to take tours of the new nursing department that we have at the university.",
        "And so what we did was we mounted an iPhone on top of a bicycle helmet and sent a student around, and she could say move to the left, let me see what changes have been made with perhaps the new I.V.",
        "pole, move to the right and so real-time.",
        "Or perhaps she wants to go on an adventure, kayaking, and being able to say I think I heard a pileated woodpecker, can you paddle to the left or paddle to the right.",
        "So like a surrogate explorer.",

        "And about three years ago, I gave him an old Macintosh computer that I had because I recognized the desire in him to continue learning, and he's always had that.",
        "And since then, he's able to get online and read his Google news and also get CDs and create iTunes lists.",
        "He also has been making videos of his life, his stories from the war, his stories growing up in the Depression.",
        "And the one thing I could say is I try to create analogies that he can understand.",
        "He was a mechanic.",
        "And so when I talk about the Windows and things, I talk about opening up folders like opening up different - using different tools, things that connect to his life, not to try to have him learn all the new technology, you know, the words, but connected to things he already knows so that that learning curve is less.",
        "And he just can - and also to be available for his calls.",
        "Sometimes, he'll open up, and he said I got all these screens all over the place.",
        "What can I do?",
        "And then, little by little, one step at a time, I walked him through, and he calms down, and he actually continues to learn.",
        "Yeah, that's interesting.",
        "It also helped me to connect to him too in a way that I never had before, in a very intense intimate way.",

        "Yeah, that really reflects the kind of experience we've been having with older adults in our classes.",
        "The - one of the things that Andy was talking about that really strikes me here, is that when you work with older individuals around technology, it's not about being a technology expert.",
        "You know, people often say, oh, you know, I needed somebody to teach me how to use an iPad or do email.",
        "And so they go to - try to find somebody with a computer science degree.",
        "And really what you want is somebody who is much like Andy here who enjoys the experience of talking and being patient with an older person on their learning track and their learning pace, and can relate it to the things that older people need.",
        "I mean this notion of relevance is so powerful and so important for older learners.",
        "Many of whom feel really alienated by the technology and the way that we market it and design it.",
        "And so being able to relate it to something that somebody cares about, both tells that person that it's something that they can engage with, but also makes it clear to the older person who often lives in a sort of ageist environment that you're paying attention to them and that you know what they care about.",
        "And that creates a really positive learning feedback dynamic and they make progress.",
        "And what's that point about how it's a way to have a new relationship or to keep in touch in a new way?",
        "That seems very powerful.",
        "It is.",
        "And one of the best parts about my jobs is really that, you know, technology for us is really a path to a sort of opportunity for really socially engaging with older people and honestly enriching our own lives.",

        "And one of the things that we've explored with our older learners at the Senior Planet Center is how they used text to supplement other forms of communication.",
        "You know, we do a study a few years ago with an external group that came in to look at the seniors that we're training.",
        "And they asked them, what are you using that technology for after you go online?",
        "And one senior said was, I am actually still calling my grandkids.",
        "I'm still calling my family members, but I'm also emailing and now texting them more.",
        "And so it becomes a supplemental way for them to communicate, and it adds another layer of richness to the interaction that people are having.",
        "So it's been a, really, a great way for people to kind of flesh out and strengthen that relationship to their family members."
