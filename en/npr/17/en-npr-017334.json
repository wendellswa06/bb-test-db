        "Did that help, Bob?",
        "Well, you know, the thing is that he was 50 when we started to try to get him to use computers.",
        "And since - because of his refusal, he's been unemployed - underemployed for the last 30 years.",
        "And I mean, we've never even got to the point of having him sit down at a computer and be willing to turn it on.",
        "Does he use any technology devices at all?",
        "He has a simple cellphone that he got within the last couple of years, and he watches TV, cable TV, but that's about it.",
        "I think, you know, one of the things that you might try is to pick something where he has a very immediate need.",
        "Maybe his phone isn't quite as robust as he'd like it to be or even his cable TV.",
        "You know, you can add something like Netflix onto the cable TV and give him a sense that there's - the Internet is connecting to that.",
        "So it extends something that he's already using and gives him a kind of small step into technology adoption where you're really working closely with and make sure he has a good, positive experience with that.",
        "I think creating momentum and creating at least a little bit of positive feedback makes a difference.",
        "And one other suggestion, I have to say I've never been able to teach my own parents to use technology, and many, many, many people have a hard time learning from their family members.",
        "And so bringing in an outsider and giving him an hour a week of technology support from anybody who's just patient and will sit with them is - really can make a big difference for somebody.",
        "You might try that route as well.",
        "The climactic battle sequences and the speeches that roused the warrior dwarf in all of us.",
        "There is a number of different websites.",
        "As far as learning to use new devices and adaptations, every state has a statewide assistive technology program.",
        "And so they can look at, you know, within their own state for who's their assistive technology provider.",
        "I think Tom's got probably some ideas on just, you know, where they can go learning as far as technology.",
        "Tom?",
        "Sure.",
        "There are two principal places that people go.",
        "And the first place most people look is the library.",
        "And the libraries really are the first point of access for so many older people that are trying to learn technologies.",
        "And the second area really are the wide range of senior services programs that proliferate throughout states and cities.",
        "Every city has a department of senior services.",
        "And I should mention that, you know, we - because of the investment from the Department of Commerce in the stimulus package over the last few years, we've built 3,000 free access, public access computer labs all across the country, not OATS but a program called Broadband Technology Opportunities Program.",
        "And here in New York, OATS has built 23 of those, but they're everywhere out there now.",
        "So if you call your local city or state government and ask where they might be a free computer lab with the senior services trainings now, there's a lot more out there than there was just a few years ago, and you're likely to find a program right in your community."

        "And John, why is it so important that the president get Republicans on his side on this?",
        "I mean, after all, he just said recently, I won.",
        "That's right.",
        "He won, and he certainly has the votes in the House, and he only needs a small number of Republicans in the Senate.",
        "But even before he started working on the stimulus package, he told his Democratic allies that he wanted to get big margins, if he could, with a lot of Republican support.",
        "Why does he need that?",
        "Well, one is, he campaigned on the notion of building bridges and changing politics in Washington.",
        "But he also - he's got a lot of tough legislation coming down the road.",
        "If he gets into a confrontational fight with Republicans right off the bat on something that the public is behind and that everybody agrees needs to be done, this rescue package, then it doesn't portend well for the rest of the fights he's going to have coming down the lane.",
        "So he wants to try and get as many Republicans as he can.",
        "And the question now is how much of this opposition that he's seeing, how much of it is real?",
        "And how much of it is part of the dance of legislation that goes on with any new president?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, House Minority Leader John Boehner is urging his members not to vote for this, to say no to it.",
        "That's right.",
        "And then, we have another interesting question, which is, in Boehner's case, you know, there was a time in his career where he was considered kind of a deal maker.",
        "In fact, back during the Gingrich Congress, some of the diehard conservatives said Boehner wasn't sufficiently conservative.",
        "Now, you see Boehner taking a very hard line on this bill, telling his fellow Republicans not to vote for it."

        "And in the Senate, you see Mitch McConnell, who has also said some negative things about the stimulus, last week - on Friday - he gave a speech at the National Press Club in which he talked about bipartisanship.",
        "And Mitch McConnell, who is considered kind of a hard-liner, was sort of sounding all the right themes about bridge-building.",
        "So that's been an interesting reversal to watch here as well.",
        "Well, a lot of pundits are talking about what this means for President Obama and his ability to link the two parties.",
        "But really, what does it mean for Republicans when, as you say, most of the public is behind the stimulus bill?",
        "For Obama, it's a challenge about whether he can meet the very high expectations he set for himself.",
        "Republicans have a different problem.",
        "They are not supporting this bill at the moment.",
        "And they have a very popular president who is doing everything - by appearances sake, anyway - to listen to them.",
        "As the public sees it, President Obama has made a real effort to reach out to Republicans, and the Republicans have not responded in kind.",
        "And if you look at the polling, Obama is not just popular across the land, but he's also popular with a lot of Republicans.",
        "And that's something that Republican leaders have to be careful and look out for as well.",
        "So in the end, do you think that a fair number of Republicans will go along with this plan?",
        "Well, we'll see in the House on Wednesday.",
        "My guess is that you won't see a great number of Republicans in the House go for it.",
        "But in the Senate, Obama will get a few more, and he may get ever more, as he's in the middle of negotiating now.",
        "John, what about this call for bipartisanship?",
        "Is it perhaps overstated, that maybe there's a good thing in two sides having differing opinions and battling it out?",
        "Bipartisanship is always tricky to define, you know, and what parts are good and what parts aren't that good.",
        "What Obama has said is that he wants all ideas to come forward.",
        "He hasn't said that he would accept all of the ideas.",

        "Alan, what about on the field?",
        "There were so few significant free agents available this off season.",

        "But here's a question: how many men were there in the West and were they cousins, brothers, neighbors?",
        "Maybe friends.",
