        "And the case centered on conversations that Valle had with two other men online; and some scenarios that even the prosecutors labeled as fantasy, but some where they said he crossed the line.",
        "What was the difference?",
        "Well, it was actually three co-conspirators online.",
        "And when they went through his computer, they found - I think - 24 sets of conversations.",
        "As you say, 21 of them, they deemed fantasy.",
        "These are explicitly short story creation or chats in which, you know, at one point, one of the people in the chat said hey, is this for real?",
        "And Gil Valle said, no, this is a fantasy.",
        "No matter what I say, it's all make-believe.",
        "But in those three - the three chats, or sets of chats that were at issue in the trial, he never said that.",
        "In fact, there were some moments in those chats where one of the participants would say, hey, are you for real?",
        "And Gil Valle would say, yes, he was.",
        "And the defense argued, well, saying something's for real is part of playing out the fantasy.",
        "But as I understand it - I'm not a lawyer, but as I understand it, at least one of the co-conspirators has to commit what's called an overt act to make something a crime.",
        "Right.",
        "So the fact that he said it was for real, that's evidence - or the jury took that as evidence that this was a real conspiracy, something he really meant to do.",
        "Then the prosecution needed to show that he actually did something; there was an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy; and that was the second part of the case against him.",
        "He did a - he traveled to Maryland, to visit one of the alleged intended victims.",
        "He sent PBA cards, the police union cards, to a few different women that he'd talked about kidnapping.",
        "And he did a whole bunch of Google searches of various methods for abducting women.",
        "So that was - yet that sounds a little ominous.",
        "But that meeting in Maryland - again, as I understand it - he took his wife and their small child with him.",
        "Yes, it was a trip.",
        "So this target of his - you know, of his supposed plot was his college friend.",
        "He went to school at the University of Maryland, and he traveled down to Maryland with his wife and baby, and he hung out with his college friends.",
        "And among the friends he visited was this woman that he had, around that time, been talking about abducting; taking to a mountain hideaway that didn't really exist, but he talked about it online as if it did; and cooking her over Labor Day on a - roasting her on a spit, with a friend from England.",
        "And were there any - was any equipment - without going into detail, was any equipment purchased?",
        "Was he preparing to do this, in any way?",
        "No.",
        "Well, that's what's at issue here.",
        "Certainly, there was no real-world attempt to plan for this - what the defense referred to as a Labor Day cookout, and what the prosecution referred to - well, I don't know if they described it in any specific phrase, but what they would have us believe was a - sort of a killer's getaway."

        "But he'd never actually acquired any of the chemicals for making chloroform, nor did he ever try to go ahead and purchase chloroform directly.",
        "And the defense throughout, argued this was a - I think the phrase they used was \"\"thought prosecution.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, it really came down to - I mean, this kind of comes down to two questions: One, did he really mean to carry out these plots?",
        "Were they just fantasies?",
        "So that was the defense's first argument - this is just a fantasy.",
        "And then the second one, I guess even if it really was a plot, did he take any real-world actions?",
        "And it sort of comes down to what you think is a real-world action.",

        "I think it was - you know, the discussions were just so disturbing, the fantasies.",
        "I mean, even in the 21 out of 24 that are established as fantasies, the fantasies are so upsetting, so violent and, you know, hateful that I - it just - it's hard to get past that, I think.",
        "And so if you find that so scary and think this is a dangerous, dangerous man, then everything that he did in real life takes on this really ominous, you know, color to it.",
