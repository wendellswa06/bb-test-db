        "A lot of these teams end up having to dump their players for almost nothing.",
        "And I think the Twins are saying, what, you want Santana, you are going to pay us.",
        "And it's important to say no to trades before you say yes.",
        "The team that did say yes to a huge trade this off-season was the Florida Marlins and all of the sudden the Detroit Tigers looked very formidable in the American League.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That was an unbelievable trade, wasn't it?",
        "Dontrelle Willis, the incredibly charismatic and talented - although there are some questions as to how much of that talent truly remains, he had a poor year last year.",
        "But Dontrelle Willis is the new leftie for that rotation, outstanding young rotation, most of it.",
        "And well, the key part of that trade was the third baseman Miguel Cabrera.",
        "Outstanding young slugger, filling in now one whole in the Tigers lineup and there weren't many.",
        "Yes, the Tigers look outstanding, particularly with the Twins going downhill.",
        "It's really going to be an exciting year watching the Indians and the Tigers duke it out.",
        "And the phrase we heard so often in the past few years in terms of baseball was money ball, and one of its precepts was that, you know, you can take almost to anybody and make them into a reliever.",
        "Certainly, there's no worse odds for bringing up a kid from your minor league system than spending, what, seven million dollars on somebody who had a good year last year because relievers traditionally never have two good years in a row.",
        "A lot of teams seem to be taking that to heart.",
        "Now, the Yankees, of course, they always have the outstanding Mariano Rivera during this entire period.",
        "But a lot of teams are saying, look, why overspend for a closer, we can get a lot more banks for our buck elsewhere.",
        "And it's just a smart way to allocate resources which even in a six-billion-dollar industry are limited.",
        "And in an industry, if we're going to call it that, where pitching is a premium, we're seeing the rise of - it just seems to me - a huge number of immensely talented young pitchers."

        "And that's why Sandy Alderson's work with major league baseball was so important before he moved on to the Padres.",
        "He was the guy who told the umpires to start calling the proper strike zone.",
        "And that's one of the reasons, I believe, that we're seeing more young pitchers exceed these days because they don't have to throw the ball into a rectangle the size of a breadbox anymore.",

        "...all strike wall and strike call monitoring system that baseball uses to make sure that the umpires aren't wretched.",
        "And, you know, I think all that was is just a way of quantifying, hey look, guys, you know, you're really missing the outside corner here.",
        "Stop doing that.",
        "You know, that a strike is a strike.",
        "And I know you guys like having your personals strike zones, but you got to follow the rule book.",
        "It was a way of making it a little more objective.",
        "And I think once the umpires grew more comfortable with how that system was going to be administered, they accepted that okay, we see what this is about and we were less opposed to it than we were.",
