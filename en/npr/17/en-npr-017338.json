        "Well, it seems right on the line, which is why it's such a fascinating case.",
        "It's very hard to know what to think about this.",
        "Daniel's reporting has been exemplary in showing the complexities of the case.",
        "And as you've been discussing, conspiracy requires that you have an intent to create - take a conspiracy, that you actually take active steps to join it, and then that you take some overt act in furtherance of it.",
        "And the difficulty is that the overt acts themselves, like Internet searches, are just as compatible with fantasy as with an attempt to carry out a real murder.",
        "And what makes it further complicated is the fact that there's these fetish sites - which are so disturbing, so viscerally hard to fathom - appear to be composed of fantasists.",
        "Most of the conversations introduced were concededly fantasy; and I don't think there were any examples given of people who participate in these sites, who actually do act out their fantasies.",
        "So that's what creates the disturbing - the concern that he might have been convicted for his thoughts.",
        "And there's sort of a - as I understand it; I've not visited the website - a disclaimer at the head of the website.",
        "It says, essentially, \"\"all in good fun.\"\" It's obviously, very disturbing.",
        "The boldface message on the homepage says, \"\"This place is about fantasies only.",
        "So play safe.\"\" And the defendant says, on his personal profile, \"\"I love to push the envelope but no matter what I say, it's all fantasy.\"\" And in a lot of his chats, he kept repeating, it's fantasy.",
        "A few times, he said, \"\"this time, I mean it.\"\" But of course, that's consistent with fantasy as well.",
        "As well.",
        "And so therefore - again, you certainly don't want to get into the situation where you have to wait until somebody's actually abducted or killed.",
        "Of course not.",
        "And there are all sorts of conspiracies that you'd want to nip in the bud, prosecute in advance.",
        "A real murder, obviously, has to be stopped before it's carried out, and a real kidnapping.",
        "It's not really the case that the Internet has changed everything, and the fact that this takes place online means that what used to be fantasy is now criminal.",
        "It's just the case that the overt acts allegedly offered as furthering the conspiracy themselves could be considered thought crimes - Google searches and so forth.",
        "Many of us search for things that we think about, but don't intend to follow through on.",
        "Obviously, there's this broader question of whether it's possible to prosecute purely virtual conduct.",
        "And there was a big debate a few years ago, when somebody committed a virtual life - a virtual rape in a virtual reality site and, you know, should that be prosecuted as immoral because it's wrong?",
        "The Supreme Court has made pretty clear that you cannot prosecute the possession of virtual child pornography, pictures that appear to be children, but are actually animated...",
        "Constructs.",
        "Constructs can't be prosecuted because, the court said, the reasons that we allow the criminalization of the possession of images of real children - which may not actually be obscene - is to deter the abuse of actual children in the production of the photographs.",
        "And therefore, to forbid the virtual possession would be essentially, to prosecute a thought crime.",
        "And this goes on to cases of terrorism.",
        "A group of young men says, well, I'd really like to - maybe we should blow something up.",
        "When is it intent, and when is it action?"

        "All right, thank you - how often does this come up, in your experience?",
        "This is - this type of case is relatively rare, and I think, quite frankly, that in our case it was the government's idea to take out an ad in this sex magazine.",

        "And you obviously don't want to create a situation where someone can say just kidding after any fantasizing about an illegal act and immunize themselves, but there's something unique to fetishes that do involve pure fantasy, and that's why it's so tough.",
        "Daniel Engber, I wanted to ask you, one of the aspects of this case in New York was that the defendant's wife was one of the alleged victims and in fact provided critical evidence against him.",

        "And the Ninth Circuit basically said, you can't do broad computer searches without some degree of reasonable suspicion that someone is guilty of a crime to begin with.",
        "That was - that's a watershed holding, because other courts have said you can open up a computer and look at everything even without reasonable suspicion.",
        "Then there was a dispute about whether the fact that he had this previous sex conviction and was going to Mexico was enough to create reasonable suspicion.",
