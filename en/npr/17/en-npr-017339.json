        "She was very disturbed by it.",
        "Unfortunately, you know, being the commander, I was caught in between exactly what to do, because he didn't actually do anything, but the story was just so disturbing that we had to do something.",
        "So we ended up going forward with administrative punishment, moving him from under her leadership, as well as recommending him or mandating that he go receive psychological evaluation.",
        "But it's kind of one of those - you're caught in between exactly what you can do, because he didn't really do anything officially yet, but I wish I had more help back then.",
        "Yeah, there was no overt act is what you're saying.",
        "Yes, sir, there was none.",
        "And is this one of those things that keeps you up at night?",

        "I mean, obviously, well, as of right now, everybody's still OK, but who knows if he really was thinking about it or how far he went with thinking about it.",
        "Because it was more than one story, short story, handwritten.",
        "So he put a lot of effort and time into it.",
        "And again, it's - administrative action, in a military sense, not insignificant.",

        "Unlike Europe which allows the banning of hate speech, really, because it offends the dignity of a group, you have to prove that someone both intends to and is likely to have the effect of stirring up a crowd and actually leading others to kill.",
        "So that's what makes conspiracy of terrorism cases so hard, is simply expressing support for an organization likely to lead to imminent violent action, and it's very hard to prove in many cases.",
        "Steven, did the federal government prove it in this case?",
        "Well, they did.",
        "He was convicted, and I would say that one provision of material support that the government proved was the actual translation of those religious texts.",

        "And I think that was really central to what was going on in the trial.",

        "I had trouble believing that she was actually searching for something in particular, and Valle himself typed similar things in.",
        "I think that, sort of, goes to show that we sort of use Google as an extension of our brains, and a lot of it gets typed in there, they're just thoughts passing from head to fingers.",
        "But these, you know, I'm curious - does - is that speech or is that action when you're searching for things online?",
        "Then, of course, there were the genuine actions he took, driving to Maryland.",
        "Is that speech?",
        "Is that action, Jeffrey?",

        "On the other hand, you can also use a Google search to find the murder weapons, and that's why this is right at the core of both of these things."

        "It's true.",
        "It's very hard to criminalize fetishistic fantasies, and it raises deep First Amendment issues.",
        "And it's interesting that the times when Congress has tried to criminalize fantasy and fetish overtly, it's run into First Amendment problems.",

        "That's exactly right.",
        "But what it couldn't - what couldn't be - really, what we're talking about is, is it OK to ban certain thoughts as immoral?",

        "That they just thought that no decent person should be allowed to think like that.",
