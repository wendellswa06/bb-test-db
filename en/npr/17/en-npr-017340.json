        "Well, that is a really good question because, as Republicans in Congress keep on telling him, putting tariffs on Mexico is the same thing as putting taxes on Texas because, despite the president's deep beliefs about how tariffs work, no one else agrees with him.",
        "The fact is that Mexico does not pay these tariffs; U.S.",
