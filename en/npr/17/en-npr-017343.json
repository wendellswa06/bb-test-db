        "And okay, now, the question I was going to ask you is, what is - why is this repair mission so essential?",
        "Because Hubble's still working today.",
        "Well, it's essential because there are parts of the telescope that wear out just like any other machine.",
        "And the two crucial parts we worry about are the batteries, which supply power to keep the telescope warm, and the gyroscopes that allow us to point the telescope anywhere in the sky.",
        "And the batteries are the same batteries that were installed at launch in 1990.",
        "So they're now 16 years old, and just like the batteries in your PC or even your car battery, you know, they wear out after they've been recharged many times.",
        "And without them the telescope will literally freeze up and die.",
        "So that's the crucial kit that has to be changed."

        "But the gyroscopes also wear out.",
        "They spin.",
        "They're the most precise gyroscopes ever made, and they typically have lifetimes of three or four years.",
        "There're six gyroscopes, and you need three to point the telescope well, but we've learned how to point the telescope pretty well, at least a part of the sky, with fewer than three.",
        "And we're down to four gyroscopes now, and we estimate that we'll lose another gyroscope or two in the next couple of years.",
        "So without a replacement, we won't really be able to use the telescope to do science.",
        "Is there any concern that things will break down too fast and that by the time the repair mission gets there, which I gather is sometime in 2008, it'll be too late?",
        "No.",
        "We worried about that with the batteries.",
        "I think the only thing that's really critical to keep the telescope alive are the batteries.",
        "And that's because when the telescope - every 96 minutes it goes around the Earth, and about a third of that time it's in the shadow behind, you know, in the night side of the Earth.",
        "And during that time, we need to put power to the telescope to keep it warm.",
        "And if we don't do that, it will freeze up, the truss will warp in ways that we don't even want to contemplate.",
        "And so we do that by charging the batteries through sunlight on the light side and the discharging the batteries and heating it on the dark side.",
        "So if the batteries really fail to hold charge, the telescope will freeze up in a matter of just a few days.",
        "And we worried about that a lot because they are the originals.",
        "But we've done tests over the last two years.",
        "They've changed the charging cycle, and the tests - the recent tests show there has been no loss of charge capacity over the last two years.",
        "And now we're really pretty confident they'll work fine.",
        "They'll keep the telescope safe till 2010.",
        "so we have plenty of leeway.",
        "The other things that can wear out, like the gyroscopes, even in the worst case where we lost all the gyroscopes, although we wouldn't be able to do science there would be no real danger to the telescope.",
        "So it could - it could orbit happily up there until the astronauts visit it and swap out the new equipment.",
        "But if they can last to 2010, isn't that long enough?",
        "Or when does...",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "No, that should be plenty.",
        "I mean even if there are delays on the next mission, we're pretty confident the telescope will be perfectly safe.",
        "And frankly, we think that - I mean luck has favored us as the well prepared.",
        "I think the telescope will be doing science, first-rate science, right up until the time of the servicing mission."
