        "I'm Barack Obama, and I'm running for president of the United States.",

        "And my family didn't fit in.",
        "You know, I heard people call them names or tell them to go back.",
        "And that was from a very young age.",
        "But Tahir says feeling different helped form her as a writer.",
        "She stopped working for The Washington Post seven years ago partly to focus on fiction.",
        "Growing up in a motel, she says, meant exposure to a parade of characters passing through.",
        "You know, crazy people, weird people, interesting people - there was this one guy who kept birds.",
        "And I remember that he wanted to pay us with a bird.",
        "And when he left, he gave us a parakeet.",
        "For the fantastical characters in her books, Tahir also drew on elements of folktales she heard growing up, like the supernatural beings called Jinn, spirits common to Muslim mythology in South Asia and the Middle East.",
        "And, you know, my mom told me stories about Jinn.",
        "She said that they lived in trees.",
        "And they have really bright eyes.",
        "That's something that made it into the book.",
        "That they have freewill - they can be good, or they can be evil.",
        "Reading fantasy and dystopian novels now, Tahir says, is not an escape for readers.",
        "Maybe it's a way to understand real parts of the world that many of us, through a twist of fate, are lucky enough not to live in.",
        "Neda Ulaby, NPR News.",
        "I think I saw the moment Philando Castile died this week.",
        "It was on the video his girlfriend made after he was shot by a police officer.",
        "He was still alive when the video began, his girlfriend talking into the camera while blood seeped across his chest.",
        "Her 4-year-old daughter in the back seat, trying to reassure her mother everything would be all right.",
        "The police officer still at the window of the car, a gun in his hand.",
        "And then Castile died, and his girlfriend's calm voice suddenly changed as she realized what had happened.",
        "I saw it.",
        "Many of us did, as it splashed across the internet.",
        "Earlier in the week, I saw Alton Sterling die, too, in another video.",
        "He was lying on the ground, two police officers holding him down.",
        "The gun was fired.",
        "His hand reached up behind his back, I think, and then it stopped, and I knew he must be dead.",
        "I watched two men die, and then on Friday morning, I woke up to the sound of bullets raining death on the streets of Dallas.",
        "And all day long, I saw the images on TV screens - the chaos in the street after a sniper took out his anger at police and white people, aiming his gun and killing five law enforcement officers - five men who had been watching over a peaceful demonstration.",
        "These are not pretend deaths on a violent TV show or video game, where the blood may look real, but isn't.",
        "No, this was real death, where the breath leaves the body, and the person someone loved is gone forever.",
        "These deaths fill me with sadness and anger and fear and dread - dread because I felt sure it would not be the last time I would be a witness to a violent death.",
        "It seems inevitable that it will happen again and that it will be caught on video.",
        "Violence has become the norm.",
        "We grieve.",
        "We lay flowers on the spot where the dead have fallen.",
        "We protest.",
        "We demand justice, but the violence doesn't end."

        "That's no problem.",
        "How have Syria's rebels gotten so far with so little weaponry until recently?",
        "I think part of it is that Syrian government forces, until very recently, have been very reluctant to actually go into the areas under the control of the Syrian opposition.",
        "This has meant they've relied on artillery attacks and more recently air power to do the damage.",
        "But when they're actually going on the ground, a lot of the time they're sending in undefended tanks.",
        "And if tanks are going in like that, you don't really need much more than a rocket-propelled grenade and a bit of cover to get around the back of it and hit in the rear and destroy it.",
        "But you've written recently about the increasing sophistication and destructive power of some of the weapons now in rebel hands.",
        "What are they using now?",
        "More recently, what we're seeing, is increased numbers of multi-barrel rocket launchers being sighted.",
        "And these are long-range rocket launchers, capable of firing quite a distance - up to eight miles, I believe.",
        "Very, very effective against stationary targets but only if you know how to fire them.",
        "And the question I have is really how well-trained are these opposition fighters when they're actually operating them.",
        "Where do rebels get rocket launchers?"
