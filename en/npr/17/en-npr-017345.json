        "I am just reminded of when I watched \"\"Saturday Night Live\"\" with Janet Reno, and before, I had been absolutely terrified of this woman because she is critical and severe-looking, a little bit austere.",
        "But then for her to do a, you know, 180 and, you know, just snap on out of it on such a good platform as \"\"Saturday Night Live.\"\" It was - I enjoyed that a lot, and it definitely affected my view of her as a politician.",
        "Are you talking about when she broke through the wall and Janet Reno's party machine?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We should clarify that for people.",
        "Janet Reno apparently loves to dance.",
        "Now, who would know?",
        "And so, what they did, if you didn't see the episode, was they have Janet Reno's party machine, and they had done it where there was big party, and I'm sure one of the cast members dressed just like her.",
        "Dana Carvey was a running character - she was a running character, part of his repertoire.",
        "So, the real Janet Reno comes bursting through the door like the old Kool-Aid commercial and starts dancing wildly to disco music.",
        "You know what?",
        "It does humanize someone dramatically, and that was huge for her, yeah.",
        "Well, thank you very much.",
        "And thanks very much for the call, Abby.",
        "And do you, as you're making fun of politicians, though, do you worry about being balanced?",
        "It's - you know, if you're - if we're in the middle of a presidential race, do you try to make sure you take enough shots at both sides?"

        "That's out there in the vernacular.",

        "And which are OK and which aren't?",
        "You know, I think it's interesting.",
        "I think that - I often wonder if John McCain's goofy policy decisions are based on his age or just goofy policy decisions.",
        "I happen to think he's kind of a goofball, I'm not sure it is about age, although I do - when my father retired, he did have many of the same qualities as John McCain, just not publicly.",
        "So, maybe part of it has to do with his age and part of it has to do with just being a goofball, you know?",

        "Hi.",

        "You would think so, right?",
        "Sometimes, and that's why it's so surprising to me, when you look at political advisers, and again, I go back to two campaigns where people feel lost in not knowing whether these candidates really believe in what they're going for the country, and then you have Adam McKay putting a policy into Paris Hilton's mouth.",

        "And it was really a clever, great thing to do.",
        "So, I think showing hypocrisy of the powerful is always good.",
        "And I think \"\"The Daily Show\"\" does it very well, and Colbert does it very well.",

        "Yet, doesn't the idea behind that - which is kind of, well, they're all idiots, aren't they really?",
        "- lead to being cynical about politics?",

        "I think that people do feel frustrated that they're not getting deeper and more interesting stories.",

        "I think they feels like these comedy shows, Bill Maher included in all of this, are really sort of the ones telling some of the bigger stories, maybe through humor, but they're the ones keeping them alive sometimes.",
