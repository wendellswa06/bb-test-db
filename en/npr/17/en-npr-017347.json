        "Well, Adam McKay, we just played one of the bits that you have on your site about Barack Obama, but some things are definitely off limits, aren't they?",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "I always say when it comes to, you know, certain kinds of jokes, you know, if you're going to joke about someone's skin color or their weight, it's not so much not doing it because it's insensitive, which certainly is, you know, the main thing, but it also is just not funny.",
        "It's not the most insightful joke to make, the fact that someone has, you know, just so happens to have a little more pigmentation or their hair looks a certain way, it's just not that interesting to me.",
        "So, that would be the reason not to do it.",
        "It's just not very insightful."
