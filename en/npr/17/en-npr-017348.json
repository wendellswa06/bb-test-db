        "Okay.",
        "One thing I think maybe people always wondered, and maybe it's just good to remind them, why is it important to have a telescope orbiting from space?",
        "And can it do things that - I mean, is it completely better than anything on Earth, or is it just better in some ways?",
        "Well, I'm a bit - you know, I'm a bit of a Hubble-hugger here, but yes, it is completely better than every other telescope.",
        "It's the most powerful telescope in the world, and even though it's not the biggest telescope, the lack of atmosphere, or rather the freedom of, you know, just observing the light unimpeded by the atmosphere gives it a tremendous additional power over anything we could build from the Earth.",
        "And there are really three problems that you have from an Earth-bound telescope looking through the atmosphere.",
        "The first is that the atmosphere only transmits some wavelengths and not all wavelengths.",
        "So the critical wavelengths in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum and many wavelengths in the infrared part of spectrum the atmosphere blocks completely.",
        "So for the space telescope, we can see everything, and that's quite important for many kinds of science.",
        "The second thing that the atmosphere does is it distorts light, and anyone who goes out at night and looks up in the sky and sees the stars twinkling recognizes that it's the atmosphere that really causes that distortion.",
        "And on a windy night, it looks even much worse.",
        "So that distortion sets a fundamental floor limit to what you can really resolve from the ground, and Hubble overcomes that, of course, by being in space.",
        "And then the third problem that most people don't think about is the atmosphere itself does glow, and so for a lot of the wavelengths that Hubble observes at, if it were on the ground it would be a lot like trying to observe during the daytime.",
        "You know, the sky itself is tremendously bright, especially in the infrared.",
        "So by getting outside of the atmosphere, you just open all of that up, and it means that as far as sensitivity, taking the deepest photographs, the most sensitive images ever, Hubble still beats the largest telescopes on the ground by quite a bit.",
        "We can't even follow up some of the discoveries on the ground, just because Hubble is so much more sensitive.",
        "It's about 10 billion times as sensitive as the unaided human eye.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, Hubble-hugger, I like that.",
        "It scans nicely.",
        "Let's hear what some of our listeners have to say, and first let's go to Chris(ph) in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.",
        "Chris, welcome to the show.",
        "Yeah, hi.",
        "I was just wondering - I mean, when you have something as historic as something like the Hubble or Skylab, why couldn't they just, you know, add enough fuel to it while it's in orbit, while they're up there, to put it in a slow orbit around the sun?",
        "Why let something like Hubble burn up in the first place?",
        "I know we're getting a reprieve now, but you know, later on, why not just - you know, if it comes back in 500 years, what do I care?",
        "Okay."

        "Why let it burn up?",
        "All right, Chris, good question.",

        "Well, Chris, I love you.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "There's no real reason that Hubble has to re-enter the atmosphere, and typically, when the astronauts visit it, they re-boost it.",
        "It doesn't take very much.",
        "So right now, if there's no re-boost at all, it will not re-enter the atmosphere until about 2025, I think.",
        "With a very modest re-boost, that is, just boosting it up about 10 or 15 kilometers, it will stay up there for much longer than that.",
        "So there is - of course, there is an advantage to the orbit that it's in, and that advantage is the space shuttle can reach it and therefore can not just repair it but can upgrade it.",
        "That will be the biggest advance from the next servicing mission, will be the new instruments.",
        "But really, Hubble could live for a long time and, frankly, I don't think we have anything in the planning stages that will surpass Hubble over most of its wavelength range, and so I believe it will be competitive for at least another decade, and possibly beyond.",
        "And whether or not they want to keep operating it will be a decision some future NASA administrator will have to take.",
        "So in other words, if - as I understood it, at least at some point they do have to do something affirmative to make it re-enter the atmosphere in a way that it won't land on people, or won't by chance land on people.",
        "Could they also boost it into an orbit so that it would never come back to Earth at all on this mission?",
        "Because as I gather, they're not going to...",
        "I don't think they could do it on this mission, but that's always an option.",
        "They studied that option some time ago, and they concluded that - you see, NASA is a pretty risk-averse agency in some ways, and it would be relatively easy to put it into an orbit in which it would last one or 200 years.",
        "But even that isn't enough.",
        "I think they require, if you're going to leave anything up there, it has to be up there for at least 10,000 years, and that turns out to be harder than it is to just push it down into the atmosphere.",
        "But really, it's such a useful - it's not just a useful scientific device, but it's one that - it's very much loved by the public and I think has kept a lot of public support and enthusiasm for astronomy over the last decade.",
        "If it continues to do that, it's a benefit to everyone, and they may well decide just to give it a modest re-boost from time to time and keep it up for a while."
