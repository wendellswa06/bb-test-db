        "But at a billion dollars a pop, I guess that's going to be a pretty big commitment.",
        "Well, it's - you know, it's not a billion dollar - the billion dollars is the worst, or I would say the most extreme estimate of the transportation cost, because the shuttle program costs about $4 billion a year, and typically they get about 4 billion - sorry, four shuttle flights.",
        "Once you have a shuttle program, or any kind of a program that can service satellites at all, most of the cost is just in the infrastructure of the program.",
        "The marginal cost of extra flights is not very high.",
        "I'm sure.",
        "Thanks very much for being with me today, Dr. Beckwith.",
        "Thank you, Joe.",
        "So the cost of building Hubble to begin with was $4.3 billion, and every time we've serviced it and put new instruments on, it's like a whole new observatory.",
        "We get, typically, 10 to 50 times the additional observing capacity with these new instruments.",
        "And so that's a real bargain compared to what it would cost to build a new Hubble and put it up with new instruments every time.",
        "Got it.",
        "Okay, let's take another call from one of our listeners.",
        "How about Janiel(ph)?",
        "Did I say that right - in Miami, Florida?",
        "Yes, Janiel Garcia.",
        "Hi.",
        "Well, I love the Hubble just as much as the next person, but I'm a progressive thinker, and I was just wondering when - or what are the plans for a telescope that's just as powerful or even better than the Hubble?"

        "Hmm, okay.",
        "Anything like that in the works?",
        "All right...",
        "Well, there are telescopes in the works, which will go well beyond what Hubble can do over certain parts of its wavelength range.",
        "The one that is planned now for launch in 2013 is the James Webb Space Telescope, and that will be a 6.5-meter telescope.",
        "Hubble is a 2.4-meter diameter telescope.",
        "Those meters refer to the size of the mirror.",
        "The diameter of the mirror, yes.",
        "It's actually a much bigger facility.",
        "Hubble's about the size of a school bus, and you know, it weighs about 25,000 pounds.",
        "So it's like a large school bus.",
        "James Webb will be larger still, and it will not be in low-Earth orbit; it will be out in deep space, about a million miles away.",
        "And that will be much more powerful than Hubble over the infrared range.",
        "But actually the James Webb - the wavelength range of the James Webb will not overlap very much with Hubble's wavelength range, so it won't really be a replacement for Hubble.",
        "And right now there isn't anything on the drawing boards or in the planning stages that will replace Hubble's critical visible and ultraviolet capability for the foreseeable future.",
        "So Hubble is it for now.",
        "Hmm.",
        "We're talking with Steven Beckwith, the former director of the Space Telescope Science Institute about the upcoming - I guess it's upcoming now - Hubble Space Telescope repair mission.",
        "I'm Joe Palca, and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And let's take another call now and go to - here we go - let's go to Todd in Cincinnati, Ohio.",
        "Let's get out of Florida.",

        "Thank you, and thanks for taking my call.",
        "My question is, the past NASA administrator had decided not to save Hubble, and now we get the new administrator in to go up and save it.",
        "What's the chances by the time the saving program is put in place that someone else couldn't come along and say, well, we're going to scrap this policy and not save it at all, when it comes down to the end of the day, and not save it at all?",
        "Kind of a gloomy question there, Todd, but probably a legitimate one.",
        "Well, my belief about space politics is that your mission is never really safe until it's on the launch pad and they've actually lit the fuse.",
        "Then you can at least, assuming everything was planned correctly, you can at least breath a sigh of relief.",
        "So certainly, Todd, it is possible that a future administrator might cancel the mission to Hubble, although, you know, the planning right now is to carry out this mission in May, 2008.",
        "Unless President Bush is unhappy with Dr. Griffin - and I don't see why he would be; Michael Griffin's doing a marvelous job as administrator of NASA - Mr. Griffin will still be - or Dr. Griffin will still be in charge when Hubble is serviced.",
        "Now, there can be delays, and there can be politics, so it's always possible.",
        "But I think the motivation that Mr. O'Keefe, the previous NASA administrator gave for not servicing Hubble, was based on his notion of the safety of a Hubble mission.",
        "But he hadn't really done the full-up probabilistic risk-analysis, and when that was done, they concluded that it really isn't any more dangerous to fly to Hubble than to fly to the station.",
        "So I believe as long as we've got a space shuttle fleet going up there, flying to Hubble will be considered a very desirable and a very doable mission.",
        "I think probably we - we haven't really talked about the other things that are going to happen on this mission besides the gyroscopes and the batteries.",
        "There are some new instruments being carried up, isn't that right?",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "In fact, the thing that's really interesting - most people aren't aware of it.",
        "They think of these servicing missions as kind of like fixing your car, but really what we do each mission is we install new instruments, and because of the advance of technology, the instruments typically give improvements in observing capability of enormous factors.",
        "In the case of the upcoming one, there will be two new instruments.",
        "The Cosmic Origins Spectrograph - that will be about 20 times as powerful as its predecessor.",
        "And the Wide Field Camera 3, and that will be between 10 and 50 times as powerful as its predecessor, anything up there now, in different bands.",
        "And so you get a whole new observatory.",
        "I mean it's really - Hubble will then be at the peak of its powers.",
        "It will be more powerful than it's ever been, and the kinds of capabilities it had are perfectly set up for what I would call the big four astrophysics questions of the day: the study of dark energy, the study of dark matter, characterization of extra-solar planetary systems, and the study of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang."

        "So you can expect that Hubble will, you know, churn out discoveries at a rate just as high as it has in the past after this next servicing mission, and that's what's so unique about this.",
        "It's not so much the maintenance, but it's the upgrades that give it whole new characteristics.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, I guess we'll look for reporting on that mission when it comes up in a couple years, and I guess we'll call you back afterwards and see how it went.",

        "Well, maybe we might be willing to bend an amendment or two when the bad guys have superpowers too, but a new series that hits comic book stores tomorrow pits hero against hero.",
        "A group led by Iron Man embraces the government's demand that they register as living weapons of mass destruction and reveal their secret identities, while Captain America and his allies refuse.",
        "The issues include civil liberties and national security, public safety, and private freedom.",
        "As Captain America and Iron Man could not be reached for comment, we're talking to with Joe Quesada, the editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics, and Paul Jenkins, who'll be writing Frontline, a part of the series which features embedded reporters within the Marvel universe.",
        "Joe Quesada is at our New York bureau, and Paul Jenkins joins us from the studios of Georgia Public Radio in Atlanta.",

        "Joe, I wonder, it's, do you have to be careful about how closely comic book universes track the real world?",
        "No, not at all, actually, Neal.",
        "The interesting thing in particular with the Marvel universe is that, when we are at our best, we deal with the real world and use the real world as metaphors and allegories to tell our stories.",
        "The basic crux, the basic foundation on which our characters are built are all built on the real world.",
        "They're just, you know, again, we use them as metaphors, and we're able to tell wonderful, fantastic, great stories that are entertaining for the general public, but at the same time they carry a deeper meaning and a deeper message.",
