        "And Joe, it's hardly the first time that comic books have tried to address social situations, political situations, broadly.",
        "You remember back in the ‘70s when the comic books code was lifted off, a couple of DC Comics, when they actually mentioned the subject of drugs--something that might have been brought up a few years before in comic books and otherwise.",
        "But, you know, it's such a odd world, the comic book world, but it's changed so much because your audience has changed.",
        "Yeah, I mean, our audience has become much more sophisticated, and to some extent, somewhat older as well.",
        "And comics are no longer, you know, the child's medium that people may remember, if they haven't picked up a comic recently.",
        "By the way, I do want to make a correction there.",
        "The actual drug, although DC did do some drug issues, it was Marvel that did them first.",
        "Actually, those were the books that got me into comics in the first place.",
        "My father bought me those books to hopefully keep me from ever getting addicted to drugs, and yet he started a whole other addiction called comic books.",
        "But…",
        "Even more dangerous in some respects.",
        "Yeah, no kidding!",
        "Look where I ended up.",
        "But, yeah, we're always at our best when we do this sort of thing.",
        "And Civil War, when we first came across the idea about eight months ago, we knew that it was something that we had to do, because it created such a polarized effect within our own office that we knew that we were onto something.",
        "And we realized that it was very important to tell the story.",
        "I think what's really unique about Civil War, aside from all the political, sort of undertones that are within the series, is that I think it's the first real comic event of its kind that doesn't really have a villain.",
        "There're, you know, I can guarantee right now if you read the series, there will be no, sort of, big reveal in the third act of the dastardly villain twisting his mustache saying, I plotted this all along just to have the heroes fight each other.",
        "The villain is really up to the viewer, the reader.",
        "It's a matter of what your point of view is.",
        "And hopefully, as Paul was saying, if we do our job right, we'll have people thinking.",
        "Because I know that if I'd stepped out of my office and asked people the question about personal liberties versus personal freedoms--personal safety, rather--would you, you know, we would get ten diverse answers to that question as it happened within our offices.",
        "So I know that readers are going to go into Civil War with a certain mindset, and already rooting for a particular side because of their own personal beliefs.",
        "But if we do our job well, if Paul does his job well, we will end up hopefully having them at least consider what the other side is going through.",
        "It depends.",
        "Most people who attend the White House holiday parties want to get their photo taken with the president, even the members of the press who try to maintain a professional distance.",
        "And so that line forms early and people are very happy to get a photograph with the president."

        "And so when you're getting your picture taken, I guess you have--What?--all of three seconds to actually have a conversation with the president and first lady?",

        "This is how it works.",
        "A Marine will call out your name and then you'll have to walk quickly to your spot next to the president and the first lady.",
        "If you can exchange some conversation then, that's fine, but the picture's about to be taken.",
        "It's snapped and then they move you on your way because the next couple is coming into place.",
        "Who gets on these guest lists?",
        "You mentioned earlier journalists, the diplomatic corps, etc. But I imagine it must be quite a coveted invitation.",
        "That's right.",
        "And there are a number of parties that are for the president's political allies and Karl Rove, his top political man in the White House, keeps a list going long before the Christmas season arrives and he pays back people who have donated money or helped the president along the campaign trail.",
        "So people come from all over the country.",
        "And it's also a way that the president's political operation can sort of get some favors in line for whatever they may want to do next.",
        "And so a lot of people who are coming to these parties are there for political purposes.",
        "So you're describing something that seems like a chore for everybody.",
        "Does anyone enjoy these things?",
        "People complain about the party, but there is also this kind of mist that comes over people and they start to talk about the White House the way little children might.",
        "And the decorations are quite extraordinary and they're very tasteful with a few small exceptions, and people mostly in bulk have a cheerful kind of glowing sense about them when they go through this, though they may complain to their more cynical friends behind the scenes.",
        "And, John, are you going this year?",
        "I am going this year.",
        "And you're going to get a photo?",
        "I'm not sure whether I'll get a photo.",
        "I've gotten a photo two of three years I've gone, and it depends whether I want to spend that time waiting in line or visit with the others at the parties.",
        "It's a decision one has to make in the mood of the moment."

        "The Social Democrats' party conference this week was as much about saying goodbye to Gerhard Schroeder as it was about voting on the new coalition strategy.",

        "(Through Translator) The coalition government may not be ideal, but we must treat the outcome with respect.",
        "What is clear is that the voters still want the SPD to govern the country, and we will do so in a coalition without diminishing our commitment to social values.",
        "Schroeder's speech was followed by 20 minutes of applause, a tribute to the man who made his name on the international stage by being the first leader in postwar Germany to deploy troops to a conflict zone, Afghanistan, and the first to distance himself from the United States over the war in Iraq.",
        "But it's Germany's economic problems that define the recent election and shape the new coalition deal.",
        "Both the CDU and the SPD overwhelmingly approved the last-minute coalition plan, which paves the way for Angela Merkel to become the country's first female chancellor.",
        "Speaking to the CDU conference, Merkel underscored the need for continued compromise.",
        "(Through Translator) Dear friends, the coalition contract you see in front of you right now is not the end but the beginning of our work.",

        "After six weeks of political wrangling, both parties had to make serious compromises.",
        "The CDU scaled back plans to make it easier for businesses to hire and fire workers, while the Social Democrats begrudgingly agreed to a 3 percent increase in the sales tax.",
        "That hike is supposed to help close the country's $40 billion budget shortfall, but critics say it won't do much to curb Germany's unemployment problems.",
