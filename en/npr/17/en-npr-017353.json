        "It has been a little more than a year since the Arizona lawmaker was diagnosed with an aggressive form of the disease.",
        "Shortly after the diagnosis, McCain took to the Senate floor and addressed - well, some people might say challenged - his colleagues.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "What greater cause could would we hope to serve than helping keep America the strong, aspiring, inspirational beacon of liberty and defender of the dignity of all human beings and their right to freedom and equal justice?",
        "That is the cause that binds us and is so much more powerful and worthy than the small differences that divide us.",
        "Senator McCain has not been in the Capitol for months, but he has stayed a prominent voice in the national conversation, and his family has shared the progression of his illness and treatment.",
        "Democratic Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island is the ranking member on the Armed Services Committee which McCain chairs.",
        "Senator Reed joins us now from Warwick, R.I.",

        "Have you spoken to Senator McCain or his family recently?",
        "Not recently.",
        "The last time I had a chance to speak to him was frankly about two months ago when we were getting ready for the national defense bill.",
        "We had a great conversation, he and Cindy.",
        "He was upbeat and cheerful and the fighter he always is.",
        "You know, although McCain's been physically absent from the Hill, he has continued to weigh in on all matters from national security to foreign policy.",
        "He urged, for example, his colleagues to reject Gina Haspel's nomination for CIA director.",
        "More recently, he criticized President Trump for his remarks at the Helsinki summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
        "I mean, most people fighting a serious illness would focus on that illness.",
        "Do you have a sense of why Senator McCain has felt so compelled to remain vocal?"

        "He has put this country above his own self-interest, his own safety, his own security.",
        "He has - those words that you played were for other people words.",
        "For him, it was his whole life.",

        "Oh, I've seen it every day.",
        "We work closely together.",
        "We would have a hearing practically every day.",
        "And his whole demeanor was one of encouraging bipartisan participation in the committee.",
        "And because of Senator McCain, we were able to continue the tradition of passing a national defense bill each year.",
        "We did it this year.",
        "He was not physically present, but he was there inspirationally.",
        "His spirit of bipartisanship, cooperation and collaboration, principle differences and then take a vote, and let's move on - that was John McCain.",
        "And that's a remarkable contribution.",
        "And I think what motivates it all is that he understands that what we do is about ultimately the success and safety of the men and women in uniform in the United States.",
        "And he takes that obligation as a sacred one.",
        "What has his physical absence meant for the Senate in these past several months?",
        "Well, his physical absence has meant that his his voice - his literal voice is not there.",
        "He's been very, very good about issuing statements, giving guidance to his wonderfully talented staff.",
        "But if he was there, his voice would be reverberating, calling out principled claims, not personal tweaks or displeasures.",

        "Between your voicemail inbox, the fax machine, your cell phone, and your inbox in your e-mail and the Web, it's just becoming too much.",
        "And I'm hearing too many e-mails and calls from folks that are saying, I'm just having information overload, I can't take it anymore, it's just constant fatigue."

        "Do you have any hints on how to search smarter, because I know as a journalist, I'm on the different search engines all the time.",
        "And we know some of the tips of the trade, and we have some of the greatest tools, like LexisNexis, and others that help us in the media.",
        "But for the average person using web search engines, there's a really easy one that a lot of people still don't do, although the search engines have made their technologies smarter, and that's using quotations marks around two or more key words that you want to search as a phrase.",
        "So instead of me maybe looking for Farai Chideya of NEWS AND NOTES, I may put Farai Chideya in quotes of NEWS AND NOTES.",
        "Or I may leave Farai Chideya as is, and put NEWS AND NOTES in quotes, and the quotation marks make that search a phrase.",
        "That's a simple one, but the search engines are getting better.",
        "Another one that I really like is called Google Alerts.",
        "This kind of flips the whole search process inside out, Farai.",
        "What you do is you go to Google, and you assign key words of things that are of interest to you that you want to track.",
        "Maybe your favorite hobby, maybe politics or competitors, favorite sports, news sites, industry information, and you plug in these keywords, and you allow Google to email you on the frequency that you suggest daily, weekly, monthly, of the results of those keyword searches.",
        "So no longer are you going to Google saying, I need to find this information.",
        "Google is saying, hey, you've given us these keywords, and new information just showed up on the internet, and we're emailing it to you.",
        "Hey, that sounds great.",
        "Yeah, for free.",
        "What other technologies are companies like Google and Yahoo giving to consumers?",
        "And one of the things I find interesting about this is that of course these search engines are free, and they're relying on their ads being attractive to you.",
        "So I guess they're constantly competing to see who can be the best.",
        "What other tools are they creating to help you navigate through the searchers?",
        "Google just announced a new one called reader.google.com.",
        "Now, what this allows you to do, a reader is really a program that allows you to aggregate information that's out on the Internet.",
        "Other terms you may have seen or other acronyms you may have seen are RSS, and you'll see these little orange boxes maybe that says XML or RSS on your favorite websites, that stands for really simple syndication, which is what this reader.google.com site does.",
        "And essentially, it allows you to sign up or subscribe to for free to your favorite websites that offer this RSS technology, and then you download an RSS reader, a simple program that you download on your computer that allows you to receive any updates that you subscribe to.",
        "So in other words, in layman's terms, instead of going to your favorite 15 websites that you always visit everyday, you can have those favorite 15 websites send you the updates of their sites to your reader program on your computer.",
        "So you only use one program, but you're surfing as many websites as you're interested in, almost kind of creating your own online news channel, if you will.",
        "Isn't there a danger that if you do that, that all you hear is what you want to hear, and you don't really get to explore new ideas?"

        "However, on the positive side, I think that's good if you have specific things you're looking for.",
