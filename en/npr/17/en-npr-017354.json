        "I am Ira Flatow.",
        "Up next, something you may have heard about already, especially if you're a dog owner.",
        "It's the canine flu virus that's spreading across the country.",
        "It was first discovered at a greyhound racing track in Jacksonville, Florida, and the flu has spread to tracks in several other states as well as kennels and vet clinics, and this flu can be fatal.",
        "And because it's an emerging disease in dogs, they don't have a natural immunity to it, so nearly every dog exposed to the virus will get it.",
        "Could your dog be at risk?",
        "Well, here with some of the answers is one of the scientists who first discovered this disease in the Florida greyhound population.",
        "Cynda Crawford is an immunologist in the department of small animal clinical studies at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine in Gainesville.",
        "She joins us from the campus there.",
        "Welcome to the program, Dr. Crawford.",
        "Thank you, Ira.",
        "Glad to be here.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "Tell us a little about the history.",
        "This story begins last year when some racing greyhounds got sick?",
        "That is correct.",
        "It started actually back in late 2003 when we put together a research team here at the University of Florida to determine what causes outbreaks of respiratory disease in racing greyhounds.",
        "And that's the number-one health problem with that dog population.",
        "And our first initial outbreak for investigations just happened to occur in January of 2004 and we stumbled upon the virus during that outbreak, and it's all been a roller coaster since.",
        "And what was also interesting about it is you discovered that it was very similar to a horse virus.",
        "Yes, it is.",
        "This virus has evolved from the equine influenza virus.",
        "There have been some changes in the structure of the virus that is now infecting the dog, though.",
        "So it jumped from horses to dogs, you think?"

        "Yes, it did; it did jump from horses to dogs.",
        "We don't know when.",
        "We think it's in the recent past.",
        "We don't know if it was really in the Jacksonville area.",
        "It could've been somewhere else in North America or even on another continent.",
        "And how far has this virus spread now in the dog population?",
        "It has spread to three or four states so far in this country, as verified by testing of samples submitted from dogs that have a clinical syndrome that fits the flu profile.",
        "And is it spreading from dog to dog now?",
        "Yes, it is.",
        "That's one of the unique properties of this whole event, is that once the horse virus started infecting dogs, it actually adapted to the dogs so that the dog could now serve as a source of infection to other dogs.",
        "And I understand that it has shown up in dogs as far away and as apart as New York and California.",
        "Yes, it has.",
        "Wow.",
        "Does that worry you?",
        "Well, it doesn't worry me.",
        "It's something that I suspected would happen and really (technical difficulties) be in dogs in virtually every state.",
        "Once we complete the testing with all the, you know, cooperation of the dog owners and veterinarians, I think we'll have a pretty full map of the United States.",
        "So it's not just the racing hounds, dogs anymore; it's in dogs that are, you know, at your vet?"

        "Unidentified Man #2: (Polish spoken)",
        "And a new book aims to help us see those kinds of movements.",
        "It's called \"\"No Small Matter: Science on the Nanoscale.\"\" The authors have tried to bring the tiniest-known pieces of the universe up to a level that anybody can see and understand, and they say that with the challenges we're facing today in energy and biotech and Internet communications, nanotechnology, which is what this new world of small research is all about, is more important than what it's called is more important than ever.",
        "So if you want to join our small talk ha-ha give us a call.",

        "You really, I mean, this is a visual story.",
        "I mean, we're going to do our best to describe it to you on radio, but the pictures will really help, and so if there's any chance you can go over to the Web site, please go do it.",

        "Okay, so I we just talked about why this book is important and nanotechnology is important.",

        "Why is nanotechnology something that people should know about today?",
        "Why is this book important today?",
        "Well, think about what's changing the world.",
        "It's the world of electronics, from your computer and BlackBerry to the Internet.",
        "It's concerns about energy.",
        "It's concerns about climate.",
        "In every one of those areas, there is a component of nanotechnology, sometimes invisible but critically there.",
        "And how so?",
        "I mean, for example, we've said climate change.",
        "What's the nanotechnology there?",
        "Almost everything that happens in between an oil well and the gasoline that burns in your automobile engine has to do with what are called catalysts, nanometer-scale particles that aid in the transformation of the fuel crude to the final substances.",
        "So everything that you think about in the future of energy production, almost everything you think about, will have dimensions through which electrons flow, across which photons flow, across which hydrocarbons get transformed, that are nanometer in scale.",
        "So it is ubiquitous in the area of energy production and utilization.",
        "Now, maybe you can help us a little bit with scale.",
        "I bumbled through an introduction which talked about microscopic and nanoscopic.",

        "But it's very small.",
        "It's in the ratio of an inch to the diameter the width of the United States.",
        "But another way of thinking about it is that a nanometer, a few atoms put together make up a nanometer so that when you talk about one, two nanometers, you're talking about small molecules.",
        "When you talk about 50 nanometers, you're talking about things that are impossible to see by anything to do with the naked eye, anything to with a light microscope.",
        "Only very specialized techniques can, quote, see things in those dimensions.",
        "So the easy way of thinking about is really, really small.",
        "Okay.",
        "So Felice Frankel, what brought you to George Whitesides and this book about nanotechnology?",
        "This is obviously not you haven't been trained as a nanotechnologist, I presume.",
        "Hardly.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I have been privileged to be making pictures in science for quite a number of years at MIT and at Harvard, working with researchers, mostly photographic images that we can see on some level because we're using photons.",
        "So when we George and I have been colleagues for quite a while, and we realized it's tough.",
        "It's a tough thing to describe what is going on on the nano-level, and why not use the metaphor that somebody can perhaps get a handle on the phenomena that goes down, that goes on way, way down there?",
        "Why not not just make images on the nano-level, which there is an abundance of, and frankly, there are people out there who could do it much better than I can, but why not at least try to get the reader to look at an image that they can perhaps identify and then read the text so that they can have some idea of what in the world is going on.",
        "How do we communicate this wild and crazy world, which it really is, how do we communicate it so that people want to know more about it?",
        "And that was our approach.",
        "Okay, well, let's take a for instance, and if people are able to see it I'll describe it.",
        "There's a picture that's called Quantum Cascades, and, well, maybe you can describe it and then tell us what you were trying I mean, this, I presume, is a macro-world picture representing a nano-world feature.",
        "Yeah, it I was really, literally walking along a pier in Bath with some very good friends, and I saw this cascade of water, which was very, very beautiful and just happened to have my camera."
