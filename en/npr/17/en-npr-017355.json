        "I actually don't usually travel with cameras.",
        "That might be unusual for a photographer, but I don't.",
        "And knew somewhere, I knew somehow we would be able to somehow use this image as some sort of expression of what's going on at the nano-level.",
        "Unidentified Man #1: Thank you, sir.",
        "Now, of course the metaphor is very limited.",
        "The readers should know that none of these images are written in stone as the explanation of something that's going on, but there is a connection to what is going on at the nano-level.",
        "So then, of course, I counted on George to explain it.",
        "Okay, and George, what does this help us understand?",
        "First of all, just to describe it a little, in case you don't have it, this is I guess it's cascades of water coming down, what are concentric, circular ridges with water pouring over them, or at least I think that's what I'm looking at.",
        "Right.",
        "The key point is that what you see is water going over a series of steps, and every time the water falls, it falls a fixed distance, and one can say it's a fixed distance, or you can say the distance is quantized.",
        "And the point of the picture is that there is a mysterious word that one hears, quantum this, quantum that.",
        "It's not that mysterious.",
        "It just means that it's a fixed height or a fixed difference in energy or a fixed difference in wavelength.",
        "Now, where that fixedness, that quantization comes from, can sometimes be pretty complicated, but this is an example of the use of metaphor to explain a word that is sometimes presented as very complicated in a fashion that we hope makes it less complicated.",
        "Got it.",
        "Okay, we're talking with Felice Frankel and George Whitesides about their new book, \"\"No Small Matter: Science on the Nanoscale,\"\" and we're taking your calls at 1-800-989-8255.",
        "That's 1-800-989-TALK.",
        "And let's take a call now and go to Wilson in Oakland, California.",
        "Wilson, you're on the air.",
        "Hi, a couple of questions.",
        "One: Has the CERN collider examined their data well enough so far so that they know whether there is or is not the possibility that they've discovered the Higgs boson?",
        "And the second question is: Is there anything smaller?",
        "I mean, is there any evidence or data or theory even that there could be anything smaller than (unintelligible) scale?"

        "Wow, so you're talking about maybe pico-scales.",
        "George Whitesides, what about that?",
        "I mean, maybe the Higgs boson isn't really the topic of this book, but...",
        "The Higgs boson is, of course, not my thing.",
        "There's a nice distinction between chemists, which are concerned, who are concerned with reality that you can knock or taste or feel, and physicists who cease to be interested at about that point.",
        "But the it's going to take a while for CERN to figure out what they're seeing, if in fact they're seeing something interesting, and then it'll take even longer for them to go through the statistics because it's a tough job they're after right now.",
        "And then the answer to the second question is I have no clue.",
        "I certainly don't.",
        "Okay, well, but actually, now that we've talked about CERN, I call your attention to also back to our Web site.",
        "There's a photograph there's an image which is called Nuclear Reactions that is based on an original black and white photo, and I suspect it's particles being spewed out from some sort of a collision.",
        "Is that what you what were you aiming for there?",
        "It's a lovely picture.",
        "It certainly captures your eye, Felice Frankel.",
        "What were you trying to convey?",
        "The way we approached this was occasionally George would throw out an idea at me: What do you say we talk about this?",
        "And then I would occasionally say: What do you think we talk about this?",
        "Well, George wanted me to somehow represent decay that is going on way, way down at that level.",
        "Now, there are these stunningly beautiful images already out there, in fact made at CERN.",
        "I think - I'm pretty sure this was made at CERN.",
        "And people have seen them, and they're beautiful, and I just decided to borrow that from them, with permission, of course, and invert the colors.",
        "I mean, that's the only difference between what you've already seen and what I've done.",
        "It was one of these insanely silly, easy things to do.",
        "I just didn't want it to look like everything else that we've already seen.",
        "And George, does this reveal something?",
        "I mean, typically, I don't like to ask, you know, scientists to talk about art and artists to talk about science, because they sit in separate worlds, but you're trying to bring them together.",
        "So I feel it's okay to say: Does this art evoke something for you as a scientist?"

        "Exactly the point.",
        "The issue in these pictures and the accompanying text is to try to take things that might seem mysterious and make them not so mysterious.",
        "The reason that I asked Felice to look at this is that we have made a systematic effort in the book to touch at least briefly on most of the issues where nano is an important contributor, and one of those is obviously nuclear power.",
        "It's going to be a key part of our energy future.",
        "How do you see a single particle?",
        "And the answer is that there are these yes.",
        "Okay, I'm sorry.",

        "Okay.",
        "Okay, but we do have to take a short break.",

        "And we were just talking about a picture from CERN of particles and the spray of tracks that they make as two things come together, and that was a real picture.",
        "There's another picture that I wanted to talk, get you guys to talk about, which is a lovely picture of, let's see if I can describe it.",
        "It's like a pyramid that's turned upside-down, more like something between an obelisk and a pyramid, a little narrow pyramid turned upside-down on a base, and it's called \"\"Feeling is Seeing.\"\" Maybe Felice, you can start with what the picture really is, and then George, you can talk a little bit about what it conveys."

        "Good.",
        "That image is a scanning electron micrograph, which means it's using electrons to image it.",
        "It's a scanning electron micrograph of an AFM tip, atomic-force microscopic tip.",
        "I know there's a lot of large words there, but in the end, what we're seeing is a sensor.",
        "That tip is sensing the forces between a particular surface that may be underneath it and the force itself on the tip.",
        "George, do you want to...",
        "George, okay.",
        "So what does that help us what does that help us for?",
        "Why do we need this kind of a microscope?",
        "If you try to see things that are very small with light, you can't do it.",
        "We don't think of light as having a size, but relative to atoms, light is very big.",
        "So the remarkable thing about the nanoworld is that the way that one images very small things is often to feel them, so that what you're looking at in that picture is, in effect, a finger that brushes the top of the surface, but the top of the the tip of the finger is so small that it can feel individual atoms.",
        "Excellent.",
        "And so it represents, remarkably, how the imaging is done in a fundamentally new way in this world.",
        "All right.",

        "So we're talking about strange and unlikely events that work at the nanoworld and not at the large world.",
        "Does that characterize what you're asking?",
        "No, I'm just saying, how can coherence of motion or energy transfer cause that which is improbable to be more probable?",
        "Okay, well, George, do you understand that question well enough to answer it?",
        "Because I clearly didn't.",
        "It's a good and interesting question.",
        "As with many of these sorts of things, it doesn't have an equally clear and interesting answer.",

        "If you drop a ball, it falls down and it lands in a spot.",
        "If you drop an electron, what it does is very complicated, and it depends upon how you look at it.",
        "So the issue with coherence, which is a technical phrase that has to do with the way either different particles interact with one another or a way a particle interacts with itself, is that it can change depending upon the environment.",
        "It can change the probabilities in ways that are sometimes quite unexpected.",
        "So the characteristic about the quantum world is that it does things that are really, really, really strange, and they're not intuitive, and one of the charms of this subject and one of the things we try to explain in the book is how a world which is so counterintuitive at the small scale blends imperceptibly into something that is perfectly intuitive at the large scale, because after all, large things are made of small things.",
