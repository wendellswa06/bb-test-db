        "Good.",
        "I'm just wondering if this book that you're discussing is relative to the lay person?",
        "I'm highly fascinated in this sort of stuff but get very confused with the big words, and I'm not a scientist.",
        "So is it something that anybody can read?",
        "Well, I won't speak for the authors, but I can tell you I figured it out, at least to some extent.",
        "So let's hear what they have to say.",
        "You are certainly aiming for the lay audience, I would presume.",
        "Oh, there's no question about it.",
        "But the term lay audience can also mean scientists as well.",
        "I think you'd be surprised at how many scientists don't quite understand what's going on also at the nanoscale.",
        "I think - the thing is, when you open the book, we both pretty much agree that it is about the pictures that you first look at.",
        "It's laid out for that reason, in a certain way.",
        "But the wonder of it, as far as I'm concerned, is once we grab your attention with one of these images that you really pretty much can recognize for the most part, you want to read the text.",
        "And George, I mean, he's sitting right next to me, and he hates when I do this, but it happens that he knows how to write.",
        "He knows how to write for people like me.",
        "In a way, this really, truly was a collaboration in that he was, I think I don't know if he's going to agree with me or not but he was writing for me because I was asking all of the questions that, Jessica, you will probably ask when you see the pictures, and it is so accessible.",
        "That's what the joy of this is, that we are speaking to anybody interested, and I think, in my opinion, that everybody should be interested not just because it's our book, because it's really cool.",
        "It's cool stuff.",
        "That's nice, cool stuff.",
        "But now, George, first of all, I have two questions.",
        "Were you writing for Felice, and did you capture I mean, is this book, if we go into it, will we learn what the most important things are today in nanotechnology?",
        "Will we get all of the things or most of the things by reading this book?",
        "First, was I writing for Felice?",
        "Absolutely, Felice was the first filter.",
        "If I wrote text, and she said I have no clue of what you're talking about, then there were several interpretations of that, but one was that I had to rewrite.",

        "Right.",
        "Last Friday, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-proclaimed mastermind behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks, will be tried in a civilian court in New York City.",
        "The federal courthouse is just blocks away from where the Twin Towers once stood.",
        "But for Jessica, we've made every effort to take out all the jargon that we can, and if you read it, with luck, what you'll find is two things.",
        "There will be things there, subjects which really can be understood pretty easily, which previously had seemed mysterious, and then there's some other subjects which seem still mysterious, and the reason they seem mysterious is because, in fact, they are mysterious.",
        "One of the charms about this subject is that, at the very small scale, our intuition just doesn't work.",
        "So it's a wonderful, wonderful area because things do things that you would not expect them to be able to do, and you just have to live with that fact.",
        "It's not that you do or don't know physics, it's that nobody understands this in an intuitive sense.",
        "We can do the math, but there's no math.",
        "It's just understanding the phenomenology of it.",
        "But Felice was saying that this is really cool, and it clearly is really cool, but there's a bigger implication here, that this is going beyond cool and interesting and neat to the place where it's going to change the way we live.",
        "It has already changed the place we live in the sense that if you think about what's been the major change in the world that we live in in the last 50 years, I would argue it's the progression from the transistor to the Internet and Google.",
        "And every part of that depends upon quantum mechanics, on small structures, on micro- and nano-fabrication.",
        "That entire assembly of technology leading to the largest single engineering project the human race has ever attempted, which is the Internet, is all dependent upon this tiny stuff called micro- and nano-technology.",
        "And so it's already there.",
        "We've done it.",
        "All right.",
        "We have time for one more quick call.",
        "Let's go to Chris(ph) in Columbia, South Carolina.",
        "Chris, you're on the air with SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "Thank you, Dr. Whitesides and Ms. Frankel, we're coming up, the month after next, to the 20th anniversary of the Eigler-Schweizer experiment, the publication of the experiment, and as long as we're talking about science and art in nanotechnology, I wonder if you could tell the listeners a little bit about the Eigler-Schweizer experiment, what it showed visually and what that reminds us about relations between science and art in nanotechnology.",

        "Please.",
        "I'll do it.",
        "Okay.",
        "So in November of 1989, Donald Eigler at IBM Almaden and Erhard Schweizer, a visiting scientist, reduced the chamber of their scanning, tunneling microscope to four degrees Kelvin, and it doesn't get much colder than that.",
        "They dosed a nickel surface with a series of xenon atoms and made an STM image of that, and then with their STM tip, they lined up 35 xenon atoms to spell out the logo of their company, IBM, spelled out in xenon atoms.",
        "And it's a remarkable experiment in showing how instruments like the scanning tunneling microscope and the atomic force microscope can control matter at the level of atoms.",
        "We can move atoms around where we want them, at least if we have the skills of people like Eigler and Schweitzer.",
        "Okay.",
        "Chris, let me - let them...",
        "And then that image was then enhanced with color and shading and tilting the perspective and so on to take a simple gray tone micrograph from an STM and turn it into a very, very famous blue, three-dimensional picture.",
        "Okay.",
        "It sounds like our guests have figured out which of these - which is the picture.",
        "Let's see what they have to say about it.",
        "Well, I will say, you know, another one of those images from Don's lab was the quantum corral, which is also similar - you're probably familiar with a similar technique where they place the atoms around in a corral.",
        "And I want to quickly get to the point.",
        "You discuss this connection between art and science and how they colored it.",
        "As it turns out, we, who are very interested in how to represent ideas in science, we talk about how that - those colors, in fact, might misinform the way we should look at that image.",
        "They did color it with turquoise and red, for example, and the issue is whether or not we're looking at what we're supposed to be looking at.",
        "So here's an example of a grayscale image that was colored.",
        "And I've - I'm not convinced that the colored image, in fact, does represent what - or at least communicates what we want it to communicate.",
        "So - and when they did it with the IBM, that - I always get a kick out of the research labs showing off their logos in all kinds of weird ways.",
        "But Don is very interested in the intersection of art and science, and I commend him for it.",
        "But I - I'm not convinced that some of those colors really work."

        "The image, for the listeners, looks like a series of multicolored ice cream cones upside down.",

        "They're sort of fuzzies - fuzzy, roughly spherical clouds, little puff balls of stuff.",
