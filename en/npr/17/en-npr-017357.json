        "Well, let's explain, to begin with, what is the difference between a civil trial in a federal court and a military trial?",
        "I think that's really important, also because what we have now and what we didn't have before the Bush administration, really, are two different options here for prosecuting detainees who have been in Guantanamo Bay.",
        "There was always military court marshal, but the Bush administration invented a new military commission system, which has been reformed and refined under the Obama administration and has yet to fully operate under those new rules.",
        "What you can see in a federal court is what would be familiar to anybody who's - that has seen trials or experienced that.",
        "In a military commission, the rules are a little bit different.",
        "What can be introduced as hearsay and other evidence is not the same standard, not the same high-bar standard as you would have to meet in federal court.",
        "And by and large, does a defendant have more privileges in a civilian court?",
        "Absolutely, and more protections.",
        "And I think that this is an issue that's really sort of helped fuel some of the controversy that you discussed early on, in that it is not totally clear why some of the detainees are going to federal court and others are going to be tried in a military commission.",
        "As you said, when Holder made the announcement, he also said there would be five detainees who would go before a military commission, and we don't even know where that commission will take place.",
        "And Holder hasn't explained the discrepancy?",
        "He hasn't.",
        "He said that, you know, that he wanted to see, you know, the five specific 9/11 conspirators in federal court.",
        "But what is not known is who else among the detainees at Guantanamo will be charged in federal court.",
        "Will any other detainees be charged in federal court?",
        "Will any other detainees be charged in military court, and on what basis?",
        "It's just simply not clear, and the administration has yet to clarify that.",
        "And what about the location?",
        "Why New York?"

        "That's a good question.",
        "You know, they could have gone to - they could have gone to Virginia.",
        "They could have gone to D.C.",
        "They could have gone to two different courts inside New York, but I think that the administration really wanted the symbolism of it.",
        "They wanted, as Holder said, to have Khalid Sheikh Mohammed on trial, you know, just steps from where the Twin Towers once stood.",
        "I think they felt that that was truly bringing him to justice for the crimes that he is charged with.",
        "You mentioned Alexandria, Virginia.",
        "That, of course, is where Zaccarias Moussoui was tried, you know, a high-profile terrorism case in civilian court.",
        "How much of a precedent is that?",
        "That's interesting.",
        "I think that some people in the Obama administration are already pointing to that as precedent, and I think that's a bit under challenge.",
        "I have heard people inside the Justice Department note that even under the Bush administration, you know, hundreds of people were convicted in federal courts on terrorism-related trials, and, of course, you know, Moussoui is a perfect example.",
        "I think what's different in the Moussoui case and - compared to those who are coming from Guantanamo is that those coming from Guantanamo were picked up on the battlefield.",
        "They were arrested by soldiers, sometimes by foreign forces, by intelligence services.",
        "Some of them were held in CIA black sites for years and then transferred to Guantanamo.",
        "So it's a little bit of a different case.",
        "I don't think there has been a case quite like this that has come before federal court.",
        "So I'm not sure that the Moussoui case - it's certainly a case of a terror suspect getting a fair trial, but it's a - he's a different suspect and a different case because he was not ever sent to Guantanamo, and he was arrested on U.S.",
        "soil.",
        "And now, of course, the other thing the location in New York brings up is the possibility of finding an unbiased jury in that jury pool.",
        "What sort of precedent are people looking to there?",
        "Yeah, that's an interesting question, and I have heard people wonder, you know, can you really find an unbiased jury anywhere in the United States on the events of September 11th?",
        "You know, I'm not really sure that you can.",
        "Attorney General Eric Holder testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday and told them we need not cower in the face of this enemy.",
        "Our institutions are strong.",
        "Our infrastructure is ready.",
        "Our resolve is firm, and our people are ready.",
        "I think that, you know, one of the things that people are really talking about in New York, too, is not just the unbiased jury pool, but also the security issues, you know, New Yorkers who go down to do jury duty in the same courthouse, and what will life be like in New York, you know, during a trial like this?",
        "And I know that Holder and Senator Schumer of New York have already said that they expect to pay back New York the massive amounts of money it will cost the city for protection and police overtime.",
        "Well, of course, the other thing about New York is that it's a jury pool that has historically been more hesitant to assign the death penalty.",
        "That's one of the reasons Moussoui was moved to Alexandria."

        "Absolutely.",
        "And you saw that the administration chose not to seek the death penalty in the other case in which a detainee was sent from Guantanamo to New York a little bit earlier, who - the suspect is accused of conspiring in the attacks on the U.S.",
        "embassies in East Africa in 1998.",
        "The administration - in fact, a former administration sought the death penalty for suspects who were convicted of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and sought the death penalty and did not get it from the jury.",
        "There's also some concern that even short of getting a life-in-prison sentence instead of death penalty that a civilian jury might actually acquit.",
        "Is that on anyone's radar screen?",
        "You know, when you go to trial, you certainly always have that possibility, but I don't think that that's a serious possibility.",
        "And in this case, the Justice Department has made it clear that they are certainly more than willing to take that risk.",

        "Can you hear me?",
        "Yes, we can.",
        "Yes.",
        "First of all, I would like to - my comment is I 100 percent support the attorney general's decision to bring these people to New York because it clearly - it will demonstrate not only to ourselves but also to the rest of the world that we, as Americans, not only do we speak of these very basic principles of freedom and justice and due process, but we trust them enough that we can follow through.",
        "You know, we are not schizophrenic - on one hand, we proclaim them, but then we try these people in some dark corner.",
        "But if this men, these terrorists are brought here and conspicuously tried, I think if nothing else, but it upholds our principles before the world.",
        "Misaguyo, thanks for your call.",
        "He brings up a point that several supporters of this decision have, that we should have the courage of our convictions and have faith in our Justice Department and not try to rig the outcome by hiding it behind an untested military tribunal."

        "Absolutely.",
        "And that's an issue.",
        "And I think that, you know, in some respects, you know, you really do see a division here - even among the families, and certainly politically - about whether or not this is the best course of action.",
        "But that is absolutely the way the administration is portraying it.",
        "Well, the political aspects is something that's been interesting to watch because it has fallen along party lines in a way that might not have been expected, with more Republicans criticizing the decision both about the civilian court and the New York location and more Democrats supporting it.",
        "What do you think is going on there?",
        "Oh, I think there's a couple issues.",
        "I think a lot of this is a fight from the previous administration.",
        "I think that the Republicans are very eager to hold onto and strengthen the idea and the legitimacy of military commissions, which the Bush administration began.",
        "And I think also that there is - you know, there is a concern in the mind of maybe not necessarily all Republicans, but certainly a lot of conservatives, as well, that going ahead with a trial like this in federal court is really asking for a trial of some of the Bush administration's most controversial policies, such as waterboarding.",
        "Remember, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was one of the detainees in CIA custody for several years who was waterboarded 183 times.",
        "Now, Attorney General Holder has said that waterboarding is torture, and the president seems to agree with that.",
        "So there - I think there's a fear that putting him on trial and allowing that waterboarding history and the history of the CIA sites and his detention, that what it will really do is facilitate a discussion in the trial of the Bush administration's policies.",
        "You're there in New York.",
        "What is your sense of whether this controversy is just getting started or whether the sort of worst of it will blow over, and then the drama of the actual trial begins?",
        "I think that's such a good question.",
        "You know, we did see this sort of early flare-up in Washington this week, and I think that the White House was pretty happy that the president was out of town while this was all going on.",
        "You know, if a trial takes -you know, if it takes as much as two years to get this trial going, I think, you know, the mood will shift, you know, possibly several times.",
        "I think the families, you know, the feelings of the families will change, the feelings of the city will change, you know, possibly several times over.",
        "But I do think that it could come back quite dramatically if we do see a trial in the next two years, and I also think it could be interesting, you know, what the politics of it are then.",
        "Remember, if it takes place in 2012, well, that's an election year, and we could see a whole different dynamic to a trial going forward then.",
