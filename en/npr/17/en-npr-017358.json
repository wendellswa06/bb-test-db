        "The immediate reaction of the administration and many of his defenders was to say wink, wink, nudge, nudge, we're not really committed to the rule of law.",

        "We know that we want a fair trial, but we want a certain hanging.",

        "And so, you know, they're downplaying the fact that they're now giving this defendant the rights of every single American when it comes to a federal court, and it's going to create huge problems.",

        "So you support the civilian trial in New York City.",

        "interest to portray him as a criminal, which is precisely the way in which he prefers not to be portrayed, which is why he had demanded, absurdly, to be tried by a military commission.",
        "He wants to portray himself to his own people and the world as a warrior captured on the field of battle, fighting bravely as a soldier against enemy armies.",

        "The reality here, the background of this is that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, in the original plans for 9/11, he was to be on the only plane that landed.",
        "He was going to kill all the males aboard, and then he wanted to make a speech, a dramatic speech that would allow him to explain his philosophy.",
        "And now he will get that chance.",
        "Yeah, you know, I'm not against the civilian trial in general, but I think having it in New York kind of ends up making this almost a witch-trial type of scenario where I think, you know, just constant protests on either side may come to pass, and I'd - you know, I might even say having it in Upstate New York, like in Albany, or if you want to keep it kind of within the state.",
        "But I think having it in New York City kind of is going to create a very heated kind of situation that may, you know, may lead to other attacks - it may not, but may lead to, you know, infighting within our own country.",
        "Spencer, thanks for your call.",

        "The upcoming civilian trials in New York can be seen as the same opportunity to show the world about the wrongness of the terrorist tactic of targeting civilians that's happened on 9/11.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "That's what I wrote yesterday in the Times.",
        "I think that's a very powerful point, which is why, you know, the media attention to this works in the U.S.",

        "I think, you know, this is not unlike Nuremberg but it's also not unlike the 1961 trial in Jerusalem of Adolf Eichmann, which really underscored for the world of both the banality of the evil that engineered the Holocaust as a practical matter and the tremendous human cost, because victims were actually shown in the media.",

        "And I think that's very important, especially for the broader Muslim audience that will be paying close attention to this trial.",
        "There's already a lot of evidence that Muslims around the world are beginning to see that killing innocent civilians is not the right away to defend even the most legitimate Muslim interests.",
        "And I think this trial, which will showcase the horrors inflicted on New York City, on 3,000 innocent people, will reinforce those growing views.",
        "And that can't but help us in the future.",
        "I think that represents a very deep misunderstanding of al-Qaida, which is a organization that's organized throughout the world right now, unlike the Nazi Party, for example, in the aftermath of World War II.",
        "Almost every homeland security expert I talked to in preparing my column said that this would be useful to al-Qaida for propaganda, recruitment and fundraising.",
        "I realize that America and much of the world would be repulsed by this, but that doesn't make the prospect less useful for radical-seeking heroes and martyrs.",
        "As 9/11 showed, it only takes a few.",
        "The reality here is that al-Qaida, given their methods in attacks across the world, loves to send - use violence to send dramatic public messages.",
        "It likes to mark events and anniversaries with violent events.",

        "At the end of the day, this is the trial of a man and he - regardless of anybody's political view - is entitled to his day in court, and it should be no more than that.",
        "So for the prosecutor to be guilty of grandstanding by picking the most emotionally charged sight that he can for the trial is just as perverse as a terrorist attempting to draw attention to their cause or their movement by picking an emotionally charged date for a terrible event.",
        "So we should take the high road here.",
        "We should try this man and give him his day in court as -without grandstanding, without trying to use the stage to make a political statement, because our political statement should be that our system without any additional help works.",

        "This is a - you know, it makes no sense at all, and that raises all sorts of prosecutorial challenges.",
        "Because when federal prosecutors, who I've talked on this issue, pull together their case, they do it knowing the rules of evidence.",
