        "To many Cubans, Luis Posada Carriles is what Osama bin Laden is to most Americans--a terrorist of the highest order.",
        "That's why the Bush administration finds itself in a precarious position in its proclaimed war against terrorism.",
        "Posada is a former CIA operative.",
        "He faces accusations that he orchestrated a 1976 bombing of a Cuban airliner that killed 73 people.",
        "Cubana Airlines Flight 455, which originated in Venezuela, had just lifted off from Barbados when it exploded in midair.",
        "Now Venezuela wants Posada extradited from the United States.",
        "Posada was arrested here on Tuesday by US immigration officials.",
        "With us on the line from Havana is Peter Kornbluh, who directs the Cuba Documentation Project at the National Security Archive at George Washington University.",
        "Thanks for joining us, Peter.",
        "Mr.",
        "PETER KORNBLUH (George Washington University); It's a pleasure to talk to you from Havana, Cuba.",
        "So before we talk about Posada, how are Cubans reacting to his arrest and the talk of extradition?",
        "You know, one would have expected that the Cubans would have been delighted with his arrest, but they're very angry that with his arrest, the Bush administration has made it clear that they don't plan to extradite him to Venezuela.",
        "He sounds like a character out of a spy novel--he worked with the CIA.",
        "How closely allied is he with the US government vs. how much he was?",
        "Is the US government ready to cut all ties to him?",
        "That's - I think, that's a good point.",
        "It's still very - we're still very new at all of this.",
        "And I think - and it's true, we do have Oprah and Barack - President Obama - and Tiger Woods, and we've come a long way.",
        "And again, I'll go back to what we've been saying for some time now - we've come a long way, but there's still a long way to go.",
        "Let's get some callers on the line.",
        "Our guest, Dawn Turner Trice of the Chicago Tribune, and Talk of the Nation.",

        "James on the line with us from San Antonio.",
        "Well, we know from the declassified documents that my project at the National Security Archive has been able to obtain and post on our Web site that Luis Posada had a long relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency.",
        "I have said, and will say again, that he is essentially one of the foremost Frankensteins created by the CIA.",
        "They recruited him in the early 1960s, they trained him in demolitions and sabotage, they gave him equipment which included, by the way, explosives, and they let him go out into the world with these talents and to wreak havoc, as he has.",
        "So he is a dangerous man.",
        "And the United States has this long association with him, which, you know, even makes it more difficult for the Cubans or, frankly, anybody else to be confident that he could be handled judicially in the United States with any fairness.",
        "What do you think the ramifications are for the US if the US chooses to release him to another country that will let him go, given that the US is so stringent in declaring that other countries must support the US war on terrorism?"

        "You know, President Bush has repeatedly said that any country that harbors a terrorist is essentially supporting terrorism.",
        "And that was what the United States was doing for the last six or seven weeks when Posada was clearly in Florida, and US Homeland Security and the FBI was not making any attempt to find him.",
        "But now really the credibility of George Bush's campaign on international terrorism is at stake.",
        "And the question is what they're going to do with him.",
        "And if they send him to a country where he is going to be released and to continue his own campaign of violence, then obviously we have, in the face of the world, undermined the credibility of our efforts to wage a war against international terrorism.",

        "Thanks so much.",
        "Thank you so much.",
        "What was once Black History Week started in 1926 amid widespread segregation and discrimination, when lynching remained all too common and perceptions of inferiority obscured the contributions of African-Americans.",
        "A great deal has changed over the past 80 years, and in a column for the Chicago Tribune earlier this month, Dawn Turner Trice asked, is Black History Month still needed?",
        "Dawn Turner Trice writes the Exploring Race column for the Chicago Tribune.",
        "We've spoken with her several times over the past year.",

        "There's a conversation at our Web site, too.",
        "That's at npr.org, just click on Talk of the Nation.",
        "And a fellow columnist, Cynthia Tucker, raised a similar question in her column in the Atlanta Journal Constitution and said that Black History Month now seems quaint, jarring and anachronistic.",
        "The nation of Tiger Woods, Oprah and Barack Obama, she added, no longer needs a Black History Month.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And, well - and I understand that point of view.",
        "And every year that question is asked, do we need a Black History Month?",
        "Is it relevant?",
        "And this year, with the historic inauguration of Barack Obama, it was a question that we really - I think we gave little more weight to.",
        "And - but I do think - and I've heard from many readers who have said that African-American history should be merged with American history, because it cheapens one or both to segregate one from the other.",
        "So, there's a lot of conversation regarding this.",
        "But I think that one of the things that's key is that we, as a country, still aren't all that well-versed in black history.",
        "There are groups of people - and maybe conservatives mostly - often make simplistic references to Martin Luther King's comments about color blind society.",
        "And they forget or don't realize that King also vehemently opposed the Vietnam War for moral reasons, but thought that money and other - that money and other money should be redirected or redistributed to deal with black poverty.",
        "So, I think that we often miss the nuances and the complications of black history, and we still have a lot to learn."

        "But these are readers who are often disturbed by the idea that there is still an N-double-A-CP, which, by the way, celebrates its 100th anniversary of its founding today.",
