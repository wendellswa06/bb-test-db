        "Indeed, it's not, and one of the challenges for the president has been that those images, when they're beamed back to Americans, can tell a very different story.",
        "He--the president spoke about challenges that he says remain in Iraq, but he, as he rarely does, did not speak directly to the suicide bombing that you spoke of or any other recent bloodshed itself in the country.",
        "How about numbers in another respect, that would be bringing home the extra US soldiers the US had sent in for the election, and maybe more?",
        "Yeah, you know, Alex, he didn't announce anything new.",
        "The Pentagon had spoken about bringing some troops home, but it was clear the president today wanted the words `troops coming home' to come out of his mouth.",
        "He mentioned that the number of US brigades might drop from 17 to 15 this year.",
        "He said additional US forces who were there for the election last month are coming home and that troops are even going to drop below the 138,000 baseline that has been in Iraq for some time now.",
        "And he mentioned troop levels, US troops levels, in Afghanistan, too.",
        "He did, as--he did speak about Afghanistan as well, and he said that in Afghanistan NATO forces as well as Afghan forces are taking a much bigger role and the troops could--US troops could come down to about 16,500 down from 19,000 this year.",
        "Again, the Pentagon had already talked about that, but the president wanted to say those numbers himself.",
        "Vice President Cheney was there with Mr. Bush at the Pentagon today, and he, too, will be speaking about Iraq today.",
        "He will.",
        "He's going to be over at The Heritage Foundation in Washington, speaking to a conservative organization, and this is a place where Cheney is often very forthright about what's on his mind, and he's going to be talking about several issues that could present some real challenges for the White House in coming weeks, including the Patriot Act, the anti-terrorism law that the president wants Congress to renew, as well as the big controversy over the domestic wiretapping program that the president authorized several years ago.",
        "So the president talking about troop levels; Cheney over at The Heritage Foundation confronting critics.",

        "Thank you, David.",
        "My pleasure, Alex."
