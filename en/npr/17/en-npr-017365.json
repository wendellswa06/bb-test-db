        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Here's a question from Amanda(ph) via our blog.",
        "So, how much lower than asking price on average should you offer as a potential first time homebuyer?",
        "I'm seeing homes still listed quite high and they're just sitting there.",
        "I'd like to make an offer.",
        "How low can I go?",
        "I get that question a lot and there is no percentage that you can apply, certainly not nationwide.",
        "What you have to do is a little bit of homework.",
        "You have to really research - and an agent should help you do this.",
        "Research the actual sales price of recent homes that was sold recently, and that's very important…",

        "…nearby.",
        "Yes.",
        "And you can always, you know, negotiate.",
        "You can underbid that a little bit and see what happens.",
        "You can't raise your price after your first offer so, you know, get in there and negotiate, but it would be awfully handy to have such a percentage, but there is none.",
        "There's no rule of thumb there.",
        "But, in other words, you should not look at that asking price and fear that you can't go below it.",
        "No, you shouldn't, but you - who knows, you may run across that unusual seller who actually did try to price it to move.",
        "So, you have to see how reasonable that starting point was and then, really, think about your own bottom line.",
        "What are you willing to really pay for that house and don't go above it, because they'll be something else.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Our guest is Elizabeth Razzi, the real estate columnist for The Washington Post and author of \"\"The Fearless Home Seller.",

        "So, I think it opens the door a lot more people.",
        "It does.",
        "And especially the way lenders are right now, they've tightened way up on making those low and no down payment mortgages.",
        "And so, buyers now have to come up with that old fashioned thing, the down payment…",
        "Yeah.",
        "…which is always been the most difficult thing for buyers to come up with.",
        "And it's still 10 to 20 percent?",

        "A big key is credit.",
        "If you can demonstrate that you have good credit, you can get a little bit of a lower down payment.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So it's not necessarily a price thing.",
        "It could be that this house is a little bit idiosyncratic, you know?",
        "If it's a little bit of an oddball house, and I can't tell from here if it is, that will make it's market smaller in good times or bad times.",
