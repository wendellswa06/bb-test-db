        "Good.",
        "My question is two parts.",
        "You know, I have a dog and I take him for a walk.",
        "And this probably sounds extreme, but you know dogs like to check out the markings left behind by other dogs, so is there any need for concern there?",
        "And also, has there been any cases of where this may be showing signs of jumping from dogs to cats?",
        "And I can take my answer from the radio.",
        "All right, Harold.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Doctor?",
        "Thank you, Harold.",
        "Those are two very good questions.",
        "Dogs that are just out on a walk around their neighborhood and doing their usual doggie business and sniffing around aren't in a high-risk group for exposure to the canine influenza virus.",
        "As a matter of fact, I think that's a low-risk activity.",
        "With regard to infection of cats, I can sign you up to be on our team because we thought about that a few months ago.",
        "As you know or probably heard, respiratory infections are the number-one problem with cats, particularly those cats in shelters.",
        "We have done some testing on a very limited number of cats in the shelter facilities and have not found any evidence of influenza virus infection in them.",
        "So in terms of walking your dog not being a high-risk activity, is dogs being next to each other or touching other dogs, is that where it's spread?",
        "It's very similar to how an infectious disease spreads in people, particularly in school-age children when they're at school in classrooms with 30 to 50 other students.",
        "The common theme is to have a lot of people or a lot of dogs all together in close quarters under one roof.",
        "Are there any symptoms you should watch for in your dog?",
        "Yes, there are.",
        "The flu virus is just one of many bacteria or other viral agents that can cause a respiratory disease, generally referred to as kennel cough.",
        "And nearly every dog owner recognizes the term `kennel cough.",
        "The influenza virus--the most common sign is a cough.",
        "This can persist from one to four weeks.",
        "Some dogs may even have a cough that nags on for six weeks.",
        "Some of those dogs do develop a runny nose, and then others will develop the pneumonia syndrome, which is characterized by a high fever, sometimes as high as 105 degrees Fahrenheit.",
        "The dog is very tired, lethargic, won't eat and has rapid, shallow, labored breathing.",
        "And that--get your dog to the vet."

        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, of course, if you have a healthy dog, the vet might be a place where he or she picks up the virus.",
        "That's true, and that's one of the points I think that's very good with all of you all participating in getting the word out to dog owners and veterinarians this week.",
        "The more we can educate the veterinary medical community and dog owners, the more precautions that veterinary facilities will take when they have a dog coming in with a respiratory infection.",
        "And they can isolate that dog so that that dog is not a source of infection to other dogs at the clinic that day.",
        "Is word getting out to the vets now, do you think?",
        "Yes.",
        "It is getting out the veterinarians if I can kind of gauge based on the number of phone calls I get a day and e-mails, but it still needs to be an ongoing process on our part to be sure that we keep supplying veterinarians with the most up-to-date information.",

        "We understand.",
        "And I just want to ensure, one, when I take him to the vet, is there anything that I could do to possibly keep him away from any of the carriers or wipe down the table?",
        "And two, what are the symptoms of this?",
        "OK, good question.",
        "Number one, veterinarians, I think, with their heightened awareness of the existence of the canine influenza virus in the dog community now and by virtue of its contagious nature are taking lots of precautions over and above what they normally do.",
        "They always clean an exam room in between dogs and the staff usually wash their hands.",
        "I think what's going to happen now is that if the receptionist at the vet clinic gets a call from a client and says my dog has a cough, I think what will happen at that clinic to ensure that your pug doesn't get sick half an hour later when you come in is that sick dog will be handled in a manner where it will it not come in contact with common areas that other dogs will be at."

        "Yes.",
        "And I'm very interested in keeping tabs on the ability of this virus to infect cats because cats are not that different from dogs.",
        "Should people watch out for that in their cats now?",
        "There have been instances where kennel workers working with dogs who do have flu infection have actually taken something home anyway so that their own pet dogs became sick with the flu.",
        "And this was all confirmed by testing and not just supposition.",
        "So we have (technical difficulties) people can be a source of infection from dog to dog if they handle a sick dog and then do not follow proper hygiene measures before they handle a dog that is not sick.",
        "So wash your hands, maybe use some of those alcohol-based sanitizers, things like that?",

        "Yeah.",

        "Yes, we do need a vaccine for this.",
        "And we have someone that's been working on the vaccine now for probably close to six months.",
        "Unfortunately, it takes two to three years to show or demonstrate the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing the disease that it's designed to prevent as well as that it's a safe product to administer to the dog.",
        "So there's some regulatory hurdles that every new biologic product, including vaccines for dogs and cats and other companion animals, must pass before it can be sold to the public.",

        "Now the canine virus is very closely related to the equine influenza virus, so we can make some extrapolation there.",
        "In addition, the canine virus and the equine virus are not very closely related to human influenza viruses or avian influenza viruses at all.",

        "Oh.",
        "And so it may have been there for a long time and (technical difficulties) because we have not learned in veterinary school that (technical difficulties) virus is a pathogen for dogs."
