        "And then he told me in an interview a couple of years ago, he said, you know, but then, when I moved to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, I stopped thinking that those people down there, the president and the vice president, were dictators, and started thinking that the Congress was irresponsible.",
        "Why are those 535 people acting that way?",
        "So your perspective changes.",
        "He always had a totally down-to-earth sense of humor about himself.",
        "He also was just down-to-earth in every kind of way, especially about his family.",
        "The fact that many of those elected president or not elected when he came to the presidency, his children openly disagreed with him.",
        "He joked about how he was absolutely beaten down by his wife on the subject of the Equal Rights Amendment and got a lot of hate for it outside of the household from politicians, but nothing like as much as he would have gotten inside the House if he had not supported the Equal Rights Amendment.",
        "He was very proud of Betty Ford.",
        "She had a tough time, and you have to remember that when she talked about her breast cancer was at a time when people barely mentioned the word cancer in public, and then, to talk about her addiction, really, unheard of.",
        "And then, to do something about it for thousands of people, in founding the Betty Ford Center in which she was very involved and her daughter Susan now is, President Ford was so proud of her, and proud of his family.",
        "I mean, all the things that you think of in a husband, a dad, a granddad, in the most down-to-earth, average sort of way - that was Gerry Ford.",
        "Joining us today, also, is Bob Greene, a presidential historian at Cazenovia College, and a biographer of Gerald Ford.",
        "He's with us by phone from Syracuse, New York, and it's nice to speak with you today.",
        "Neal, thank you for having me.",
        "And Cokie talking about how grounded Gerald Ford was, well, he was a man very much, of Grand Rapids, Michigan.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "He was Midwestern through and through.",
        "And that was part of what Cokie was talking about in terms of how genuine an individual he was.",
        "Of the presidents who I've interviewed in my work, this man came across as being the most grounded of any of them, and sense of humor - his sense of humor was very well known to his staff, as was his wife's, you know pushing him into the pool fully-clothed in front of the Washington Press Corps.",
        "But - and he genuinely enjoyed the job.",
        "One of the things that, in terms of - you asked Cokie about his growth in the job, he came in with a legislative mindset - very open, very open-door, to his detriment, with a spokes-to-a-wheel(ph) policy.",
        "And yet, as we grew into the job, he also grew with an affection for the job, I believe."

        "I asked him, at one point in time, whether at the end, he liked it and he didn't answer.",
        "He just sat and smiled at me.",
        "I fully believe that he enjoyed being president and it showed.",
        "There was no chest-pounding, chest-beating malaise about him.",
        "Gerald Ford was elected 13 times to the House of Representatives by the voters in and around Grand Rapids.",
        "He declined opportunities to run for the United States Senate.",
        "He declined opportunities to run for governor of Michigan.",
        "When the crisis came up, Spiro Agnew resigned the office of vice president after pleading, nolo contendere, famously.",
        "Why did Richard Nixon pick Gerald Ford, and why did Gerald Ford take the job?",
        "The one overriding reason for Nixon choosing him was his confirmability.",
        "Gerry Ford was liked and respected on both sides of the aisle, and in the first test of the 25th Amendment, Nixon was reasonably well-assured that he would be confirmed.",
        "He was going to go through a difficult confirmation process.",
        "And the questions were pointed, at one point in time, in the questioning, Ford was asked about visits that he made to the psychotherapist, and that made for a mild flap at the moment.",
        "But he was confirmed easily.",
        "He was not Nixon's first choice.",
        "Nixon wanted John Connelly, former governor of Texas, to be his Vice President.",
        "It's a good thing he didn't get him because almost immediately after Ford was confirmed, John Connelly was embroiled in a scandal of his own, with milk problems down in Texas.",
        "Why did Gerry Ford take it?",
        "Duty was huge.",
        "And it was duty to party and to nation almost in equal measures.",
        "When he was asked by members of both sides of the aisle - Tip O'Neill, Barry Goldwater and others - to do the job, he didn't feel that he could say no.",
        "He also had in his mind, I think he compartmentalized himself in the early days and maybe Cokie would know whether or not this speculation is actually true.",
        "I think he convinced himself that it was going to be over, that Nixon was going to somehow make it before the Smoking Gun conversation came out and that he wasn't going to have to be president.",
        "He could put it in his time and retire because he told Betty he was going to retire in 1976, and that he would be done with this and he wouldn't have to be president.",
        "So I think it was maybe less of a risk than he thought it was going to be.",
        "Does that sound right, Cokie?",
        "I think - well, I certainly think that question of duty is paramount, that anybody who has given as much of his life to the public as Gerry Ford did does not deny a call to service particularly in such a difficult time.",
        "And he was keenly aware of how difficult the time was.",
        "And the truth is, the job he really wanted was to be speaker of the House.",
        "Speaker of the House, you know."

        "So - and boy, did that turn out to be true.",

        "So I think that all of those calculations were going on, but I think absolutely paramount is that call to service.",
        "And he felt it, I'm sure, until last night.",
        "Let me ask you, Bob Greene - as you look back on the life of Gerald Ford, a lot of what he accomplished, he accomplished after he left the presidency.",
        "I think that there is some truth to that, but I also think that that kind of sells sort his presidency, which has become marginalized in the history textbooks - both he and President Carter's - to a page and a half in between Nixon and Reagan.",
        "There was a great deal accomplished during his presidency as well.",
        "He was an extraordinarily, vital former president in an age where former presidents were now taking more of a front-page role in American life.",
        "It was not just sitting back and going to the farm at Gettysburg, for example, as Eisenhower did; or going back to Texas as Johnson did.",

        "He's a major player in the 1980 presidential election.",
        "He almost gets nominated vice president.",

        "And he talked to the people of Greece about what had happened in America with the succession of Gerald Ford.",

        "Now, it never occurred to us that such a thing might happen because we are so used to this constitutional balance of powers.",
