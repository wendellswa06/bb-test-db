        "Good.",
        "I grew up in a rural farming community north of Grand Rapids, where Gerald Ford was from.",
        "And in 1957, he met with my grandfather, Harry Chase(ph), who was a founding fruit farmer of the apple - of an apple packing house.",
        "And I have a lovely photo of Gerald Ford holding this large, red, delicious apple, looking at it with a big smile and looking over at my grandfather admiring this apple.",
        "And, as you know, growing up, and then with him becoming the president, I took such pride in having a president from our local area but also having some kind of a relationship, if you will, because of my grandfather.",

        "I think if we look at the first month of the Ford presidency, we see that there was a pivot going on.",
        "Let me explain.",
        "And this really had to do with the changing complexion of the Republican Party.",
        "Ford was a centrist and he followed Nixon, a centrist, into office.",
        "And he had a number of decisions to make right away.",
        "The first really was what to do about America's global posture and he kept Henry Kissinger, who was, as we all know, a realist in foreign policy.",
        "He had another very significant decision to make, which was who to make his own vice president, as he had been made vice president under Nixon.",
        "And he chose the most centrist of the Republicans who were available, Nelson Rockefeller.",
        "It's interesting to note that Donald Rumsfeld was a dark horse in that race and that George H.",
        "W.",
        "Bush campaigned very aggressively.",
        "The first trip that he took outside of Washington was to Chicago to speak with the veterans of foreign wars.",
        "And he said to them that he thought that draft resistors and draft deserters needed to be welcomed home somehow.",
        "And he asked for a kind of a limited amnesty.",
        "I think this was an act of extraordinary political courage.",
        "He told reporters afterwards that he thought it would have been cowardly for him to go to a handpicked audience.",
        "He reached out to African-Americans.",
        "He reached out to women.",
        "He was determined, I think, to take the country towards the center, the healing center.",
        "And in the process, he was then called on to deal with Nixon, who left him really with an, you know, the thankless task of deciding what to do.",
        "And when he pardoned Nixon, he was suddenly confronted with something that a sitting president - certainly a Republican sitting president - had never been confronted with at all, which was an intra-party challenge.",
        "The right wing of the Republican Party galvanized around Ronald Reagan, who was then the lame duck governor of California.",

        "(Singing) I love me.",
        "I love me enough for the both of us.",
        "And suddenly, all of the moves towards the center that Ford had attempted were left behind as he tried to fend off this challenge from the Republican right.",
        "Of course, he brought in Rumsfeld as his chief of staff two weeks after the pardon.",
        "And Rumsfeld brought in his then 33-year-old former deputy from his White House days, Dick Cheney.",
        "And the rest of the Ford presidency was - it can be seen, I think, at this point as an effort by Ford to try to fend off a challenge from the right wing of the Republican Party.",
        "Now - and there was also the question of America's position in the world in the wake of Vietnam.",
        "There was a tremendous fear about the Vietnam syndrome, that the United States would be reluctant in the future to get involved in a war in a distant country.",
        "And so finally, you know, 30 years later in the presidency of George W.",
        "Bush, we find Rumsfeld and Cheney still very much at the center of our strategic decision-making and leading us into a war that looks in many ways like Vietnam.",
        "So it's - I think as we take stock of where we are now, it's important to go back to that moment in history and see what Ford was trying to do and then what his administration eventually did do in respect to both presidential power and the assertion of American might around the world.",
        "And when we now read those comments of Gerald Ford, talking about reestablishing confidence in the White House and the executive after the disasters of Vietnam and Watergate, that again is a theme that we've heard from more recent days.",
        "Well, it comes back again, sure.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Cokie?",
        "I'm sorry.",
        "Well, he's interesting about that though.",
        "First of all, I would argue that Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney were different people then than they are now.",
        "Donald Rumsfeld was this attractive young congressman from Michigan who was very much seen as a centrist.",
        "And Dick Cheney, when he was - even when he was in Congress from Wyoming, even though his voting record was very conservative, he was considered a great pragmatist in the caucus of the Republican Party.",
        "And so, you know, they have evolved as well.",
        "But Ford in my last interview with him was very interesting about how, you know, power does shift back and forth between the presidency and the Congress.",
        "That the balance of powers in the Constitution is not equal at any given time or perfect.",
        "And he talked about how during World War II, the president was all powerful whereas during the civil war the Congress held much more of the power."

        "He said when I was in the White House we faced one enemy - the USSR.",
        "It was a formidable enemy but we knew their capabilities and they pretty well knew ours.",

        "So he says they have - this president and his successors have a much more dangerous challenge.",
        "I think Cokie is right about that.",
        "But I also think that the difference between the Ford administration and the axis between Rumsfeld, and Cheney, and the Bush administration, and that axis now is that besides circumstances and the geopolitical shape of the world being different then, Rumsfeld and Cheney were novices.",
        "They - neither one of them was extremely well prepared for the position that he would hold in that administration.",
        "They - it was, sort of, a dry run for them and that when they returned, I think, both were determined to use the instruments of power that were granted to them in a way that they weren't able to use them back in 1974 to 1976.",
        "I actually think that they're, I mean, this is - we're not here to talk about Rumsfeld and Cheney - but I do think the big difference was their time in the private sector and that that really reshaped their thinking in all kinds of ways and that that never affected Gerry Ford.",

        "But for the most part it was an effort that was put together very quickly.",
        "And my first assignment, ironically enough, was to service as the secretary to that transition team.",

        "So I spent my first 16 days in government helping to write the report that the transition team submitted to then President Ford as to how he got to organize his White House staff."
