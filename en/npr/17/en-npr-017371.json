        "Well, obviously, you were there in a - at fairly junior capacity.",
        "I wonder though, what was it like to work for Gerald Ford?",
        "He was an enormously attractive human being and very pleasant to be around.",
        "As you point out, I was 20 years - so years younger than everybody in the room.",
        "And yet when he would come into the room he would often make a beeline for me and shake my hand and thanked me very much.",
        "And I was always grateful that he remembered my name and showed a considerable amount of attention to me.",
        "And he was not someone who was self-absorbed in any way.",
        "He was very comfortable around people and liked the given thrust of debate.",
        "Some people assumed that presidents are principally surrounded by people who think very much like they do and are very much like they are, since, after all, they get to select them.",
        "But in Gerald Ford's case, he love to hear the cut and thrust of debate in front of him and he encouraged a good deal of this by the questions that he posed and that he asked.",
        "So he was intellectually a very interesting and exciting place to be, in terms of serving as a witness to fascinating set of events.",
        "Cokie Roberts, we continually hear the phrase these days about politicians wondering if they're comfortable within their own skin.",
        "That seems to be a phrase that should have been designed for Gerald Ford.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Not only comfortable within his own skin, comfortable with his family, able to let his wife and children disagree with him in public and take it in good humor, and incredibly kind, as Roger's just said, you know, making a beeline for a kid in the room.",
        "That's a lovely thing to do.",
        "I tell you, my father and he had become very close friends.",
        "So when he was - they were in Congress together for what would have been - it would have been more than 20 years and they - for 25 years.",
        "And they had gone to China together on this historic trip.",
        "The President Nixon had gone to China, as you know, to make the opening to China and then the majority and minority leaders of the Senate went.",
        "Both having been, ironically, born in China as children of missionaries and there's a House of Representatives got its nose out of joint.",
        "So organized a mission for the House majority and minority leaders.",
        "And so the majority leader at that time was my father, Hale Boggs, and the minority leader, Gerald Ford, and they went with their wives and became even closer friends and that was in the spring of 1972.",
        "In that fall, my father's plane disappeared and Gerry Ford was the first person on the doorstep and just stayed there throughout the search and always just there being kind to the family and especially to my mother.",
        "Roger Porter, thanks very much for being with us today.",
        "We appreciate your time.",
        "Your calls about Gerald Ford when we return."

        "It never went to his head that he was president.",

        "And some of President Ford's critics later came to change their mind about him.",
        "Here's Senator Ted Kennedy, a critic of the pardon of Richard Nixon at that time, speaking here on NPR's DAY TO DAY with Noah Adams.",
        "Gerry Ford understood that you can work with your opposition, you can stay true to your principles and you can get something done and the country wins and the people who are involved in it win.",
        "That isn't something that we have seen in recent times.",
        "That's why many of us who were fortunate enough to have worked with the President Ford have a high regard, respect for him."

        "Senator Kennedy at one time presented Gerald Ford with a Profile in Courage award for his decision to pardon Richard Nixon, a decision that cost Gerald Ford, as we mentioned, politically, Cokie Roberts, and personally, too.",
        "Yes, I think that's right because I asked him if he had any idea the firestorm that it was going to create.",
        "And he said I anticipated a lot of it but then I got a lot more criticism than I did anticipate.",
        "And the idea that he had struck a deal with Richard Nixon really struck at him.",
        "He considered himself so aboveboard and just ready to tell, you know, the truth at any time that the idea that he had a secret deal offended him.",
        "He did go up to the Capitol, of course, against the advice of his staff to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on the question of whether there had been a deal.",
        "And he said I'm going to go testify because I have nothing to hide.",
        "And he felt that that did help considerably in tamping down the criticism in Congress but certainly not in the public as a whole.",
        "And, of course, as you heard earlier he was getting it from (unintelligible), he was getting it from both sides.",
        "If he only tried harder, if he only reached out more, they would eventually fall at his feet and agree to his request.",
        "There's just very little evidence to suggest that's the case.",
        "Film critic Kenneth Turan says it's all deserved.",
        "The Democrats were terribly opposed to the pardon as were the majority of the American people.",
        "And inside the Republican Party there was a lot of upset that he was not more friendly to President Nixon.",
        "So he got this challenge from future president, Ronald Reagan, and we now know that in looking back that anytime a sitting president is challenged in a primary he loses in the general election.",
        "And so I think that all of that was something of a surprise to him.",
        "But to his credit, he continued to say, right up until the very end, that it was the right thing to do.",
        "I think that if he wants to be remembered for something it is as a healer.",

        "I do want to say though, in talking about him and Carter - because the question came up, you know, how would he be different - and one of the reasons I think that he wouldn't answer that question were it put to him was that I don't he would want to in anyway denigrate President Carter.",
        "They became such good friends in later years, and have worked on so many projects together and have really felt strongly that their combined efforts could make a tremendous difference.",
