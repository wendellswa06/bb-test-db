        "So now it's just turned to the east, and it's going to start doing its lawnmower pattern.",
        "What makes the drone valuable to farmers is the camera on board.",
        "It snaps a high-resolution photo every two seconds.",
        "From there, Agribotix stitches the images together, sniffing out problem spots in the process.",

        "He grows 2,000 acres of wheat and corn near the Colorado-Nebraska border.",
        "Can you look at areas of disease concern, insect concern, so now you can be more proactive and treat smaller areas and not treat the entire field?",
        "Salvador and about 50 other farmers got an earful from Rory Paul, CEO of Volt Aerial Robotics, a St. Louis-based drone startup.",
        "We really don't know what they're good for.",
        "We've got a few ideas where they could really benefit agriculture, the majority of which are still theoretical.",
        "Theoretical because commercial drone use is still widely banned in the U.S.",
        "Companies can apply for exemptions from the Federal Aviation Administration, but the requirements to get that exemption can be costly, like requiring drone operators to hold a private pilot's license.",
        "These small drones that are almost priced to be expensive toys are not reliable, and that's a concern of the FAA.",
        "Eric Frew studies drones at the University of Colorado-Boulder.",

        "Putting a large flying machine in the hands of someone who's inexperienced can cause big problems."
