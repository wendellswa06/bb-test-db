        "There are different points of view, and they don't necessarily track along political lines.",
        "One of the biggest fears about this authorization is that it could be used to justify the use of force in situations that are not really that linked to September 11 attacks, which is the thing that, of course, sparked this authorization.",
        "And finally, Danielle, Secretary Clinton, as we heard earlier, said she would like to see this authorization updated.",
        "Is she saying she wants what President Obama has been asking for, which is a new authorization for the use of military force?",

        "And that authorization would have been in addition to this 2001 one.",
        "It wouldn't have replaced it exactly.",
        "It would have supplemented it, and it would have put a few limits on it.",
        "For example, a time limit on how long the fight could go.",
        "Now, as for why they want something new, there are a couple of arguments.",
        "One is the argument that you want Congress and the president to both be behind the use of force.",
        "The other - I spoke to Benjamin Wittes.",
        "He's from the Brookings Institution today.",
        "And not everyone would agree with him on this, of course, but what he says is that yes, the administration does have a plausible legal basis for fighting ISIS under this AUMF from 2001.",
        "However, he said it's not the cleanest legal argument.",
        "It's reasonable to see why they would want something a bit more explicit.",
