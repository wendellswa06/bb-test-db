        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "It's both time to look at what the effect these measures are having and will have, and also time to be prepared to further action if needed.",

        "Again, Ben May.",
        "If you look at all of the comments from various ECB members over recent weeks, it pretty much guarantees that they'll do something.",
        "If they did nothing, that would be a major surprise to markets and have some quite nasty consequences.",
        "If nothing else, today's report drives home the point that the threat of higher inflation is a distant one.",
        "That means European officials have more room to experiment, to look for ways to bring back the kind of growth that has eluded the region for so long.",

        "So as we developed this picture and it became obvious that we were fighting an insurgent enemy mixed into a civil population that was suspicious of us anyway as outsiders - and that was true in both Afghanistan and Iraq - it really brought up the second point, which is what is the U.S.",

        "It's very, very difficult to take even the great troops that we have and send them into a village to try and sort out which of the males there - the young males - might be insurgents, who might be just people living in the area, who might potentially be government supporters, when you don't speak the language and you really don't understand what's going on in that village very well.",
