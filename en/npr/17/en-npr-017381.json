        "Considering that one of the advisors to Donald Trump now is Roger Ailes, the architect of much of what came out of Fox News in opinion, his son-in-law, as you said, owns the New York Observer, an opinion newspaper, basically, would a trump Channel take on Fox News?",
        "Well, I think it's important also to remember that Trump brought onboard to lead his campaign Steve Bannon, who had been the CEO of Breitbart the website and family of websites itself.",
        "I think that what they would try to do, were they to do this, would be to essentially go to the right or the alt-right of Fox News to outflank a Fox among conservatives with some, you know, nationalistic and populist rhetoric as well.",
        "You could easily see Sean Hannity defecting from Fox News.",
        "And you could see them trying to divert some of that.",
        "This is tough to do, however, if you think about positioning yourself in the cable TV world.",

        "It's still existing, but barely.",
        "It's hanging on there by its fingernails.",
        "It was supposed to outflank Fox on the right.",
        "There's no reason to know that Trump, even with that name recognition, would be able to establish a successful rival to Fox on the right in cable news.",

        "Can you tell us more about this weapon?",
        "Well, Audie, the technical name is the GBU-43/B, the Massive Ordinance Air Blast, and it gives it the initials for the nickname.",
        "It was developed during the second Iraq war but never used.",
        "It's about 22,000 pounds, roughly 30 feet long.",
        "And it's too big for a bomber, so what they have to do is put it in a cargo plane, a C-130, and then it goes off the ramp."

        "I was there two years ago.",

        "So we have given them total authorization, and that's what they're doing.",
        "And frankly, that's why they've been so successful lately.",
        "So Tom, any sense of what kind of damage was done as a result and maybe what kind of difference this will make to the fight against ISIS?",
        "Well, no sense yet whether it was successful in getting these ISIS fighters in their tunnels and caves.",
        "Now, the U.S.",
        "says ISIS grew to about 2,000 fighters over the past two years.",
        "They've reduced that number they say to about 800 with airstrikes and assaults by American special operators and Afghan commandos.",
        "Now, it's important to note that back in 2001, the U.S.",
        "used something similar on several occasions.",
        "That was a 15,000-pound bomb nicknamed the daisy cutter to go after the Taliban and al-Qaida.",
        "People I've talked with said they were a few miles away when it dropped.",
        "You could feel the blast.",
        "The last time they used that bomb was in December 2001 to go after a guy named Osama bin Laden and his leadership.",
        "Of course that didn't work, and they just ran into Pakistan.",
        "Now, what does using this size weapon now mean for the outlook for the war in Afghanistan?",
        "Not much.",
        "This is still a stubborn fight against ISIS, and Americans are on the front lines here.",
        "And this area, by the way, is right near where Army Staff Sergeant Mark De Alencar of Edgewood, Md., was killed last weekend.",
        "But of course there's a larger war against the Taliban who have gained territory over the past year.",
        "And the U.S.",
        "general there says that war is at a stalemate, and he's asked for more troops - several thousand more.",
        "And the national security adviser, General H.R.",
        "McMaster, is heading over there to talk about that with commanders in Kabul - no word yet on whether the Pentagon will approve those additional troops."
