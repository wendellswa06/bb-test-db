        "What we did was look at replacement rates, which is how much savings and wealth a person will have to be able to replace their pre-retirement income.",
        "Most financial planners recommend being able to replace 70 to 100 percent.",
        "And the typical early boomer has acquired enough savings and wealth to replace between 70 and 80 percent of their income once they leave the labor market.",
        "So they're right on target.",
        "They're right on target.",
        "The typical late boomer will replace about 60 percent, which is a little bit insecure.",

        "And they also took the biggest hit to their home equity in terms of percentage loss.",
        "So as a group, they definitely got hit.",
        "But even before the recession, there were signs that they were not on track to sort of exceed the wealth and the savings of the group that came immediately before them.",
        "Aside from the great recession, let's talk about the retirement system itself and where that might be playing into this lack of retirement funding for Gen X.",
        "How much of a role does the 401(k) system play in all this?",
        "That's a great question.",
        "What we know from the data is that less than half of Americans have access to a 401(k) through their employer, and a very small percentage of them try to get retirement plans on their own through an IRA.",
        "So for the group that is in the stock market, they've been able to - certainly, they took a hit during the recession, but they've also been able to take advantage of some of the recovery that has occurred since.",
        "For people who are not engaged in any kind of retirement planning whatsoever, unless some dramatic change happens in terms of their savings rates and their ability to acquire wealth, there is going to be a substantive portion of the Gen X group that will not have a secure retirement."

        "Five years later into the mid '90s, 2000s and now, you're finding people who have a lump of money and their Social Security.",
        "And that lump, on average, is about $70,000 for people now just retiring.",

        "And they're also told that they may live until they're 92.",
        "Teresa, if the pension system didn't work because there were promises made that couldn't be kept - companies that essentially did not do what they promised their workers they would do - and now the 401(k) system is not working because it counts too much on us to be wise and prudent with our money, what kind of system should we have?"
