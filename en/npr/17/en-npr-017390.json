        "I think one of the things that really hits me in your language is that it seems simple but you have such a way with image.",
        "Oh, thanks.",
        "You know, honestly, so much of this stuff happens on the fly.",
        "And for me, one of the deepest pleasures is going into my little writing shed day after day and, like, OK, today, I have to write that scene where Robin makes a decision."

        "But then if you're allowed to replace one item a day for seven years with an item that you liked better, after that seven years, that place would have you all over it in ways that you couldn't have anticipate at the beginning.",
        "So likewise, in a story, if you're doing hundreds of drafts and each time you're micro-exerting your taste, that thing is going to start to look like more and more and more like you.",
        "In fact, I feel like my stories are much more indicative of me than this guy here talking to you or me on even my best day as a person.",
