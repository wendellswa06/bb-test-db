        "As helpful as the new HPV test is, the American Cancer Society recommends waiting until women are 30 or older before adding it to the Pap smear.",

        "The charges are going to go back and forth, but it is something that the president certainly wanted to set the record straight on at that event, and he will at every event."

        "In my view, he never made that switch, and that's the flaw.",

        "I think the big problem was we had a collapse of a housing bubble.",
        "That destroyed somewhere between 1.2 to 1.5 trillion in annual demand - that's annual.",
        "Now, we had a stimulus that's billed as 700 or $800 billion.",
        "That was over a two- to three-year period.",
        "In fact, some of that's still being spent out today; it'll be spent out over this decade.",
        "In terms of annual demand - 2009 and 2010 - that was about 300 billion.",
        "Three hundred billion is not enough to replace 1.2 to 1.5 trillion in demand.",
        "That's basic arithmetic.",
        "And the points Doug's talking about, I don't think you're going to find a lot of businesses who could tell you with a straight face they would have been hiring workers, they would have been investing left and right, but they're worried come 2014 they might have to pay a fine or pay health care for their workers.",

        "We know that now.",
        "That wasn't always the case.",
        "You need 60 votes.",
        "He had to whittle away much of that stimulus in order to get anything through Congress.",
        "And some of what he whittled away was support for public programs that would have created more jobs.",
        "He had 60 votes in the Senate.",
        "He had 60 votes in the Senate in 2009.",
        "He had it right up to the 2010 election.",
        "That's how they did the Dodd-Frank.",
        "I mean, the Affordable Care Act went through, and it was only the Scott Brown special election that changed that dynamic.",
        "So I don't have a lot of sympathy for the view that he had to work with Republicans because, in fact, the majority of the time, we had mixed government.",
        "And so it's not fair for, I think, the defenders of the president to uniformly blame Republicans.",
