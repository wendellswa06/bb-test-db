        "You know, with the PlayStation 2 and older game systems, there were a lot of different publishers being able to publish games at 40, $50 that were, like, B titles.",
        "You know, they weren't as good as the big games.",
        "But once you got through all the really big, good games, you know, you still had gaming time left in your day and you'd go out and you'd buy - because you really had no other choice - these's 30, 40, $50 games.",

        "And so that, I think, is why you're seeing these declines.",
        "And what's important to also remember here is the declines in videogame industry sales are for physical, packaged goods.",
