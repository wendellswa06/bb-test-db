        "Renee, there was a report just issued by a joint Afghan international agency here that estimated more than 600 attacks a month around the country, around 4,000 people killed in the fighting this year alone, the overwhelming majority of those dead being Afghans.",
        "And many of the advances that have been made in the first years since the Taliban was overthrown, such as building schools and building highways, they're being reversed by this fighting.",
        "The new highway south to Kandahar has become so dangerous that most foreigners and government officials won't drive it because the Taliban openly operates on stretches of that highway and attacks government convoys.",

        "The film is set in Jerusalem's Hebrew University and deals with the implacable rivalry between two scholars of the Talmud, the complex and sacred text of the Jewish religious tradition.",
        "These competitive scholars, the misanthropic Eliezer and the gregarious Uriel, also just happen to be father and son.",
        "It is the gift, however, of writer-director Joseph Cedar to make the rivalries of this esoteric world fertile ground for such involving themes as the price of ambition, the need for recognition and the tension between fathers and sons.",
        "Eliezer, the father, is a philologist, a close textual researcher into language.",
        "He spent more than 30 years painstakingly analyzing different versions of the Talmud only to be beaten to publication by another scholar.",
        "This disappointment has turned Eliezer into a cantankerous contrarian who is difficult with everyone, even unbending Israeli security guards.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"\"FOOTNOTES\"\")",
        "Eliezer is a fussy minimalist, son Uriel is a born schmoozer who writes expansively and conceptually on what the Talmud might mean without worrying overly much about the specific words, an approach that is anathema to his father.",
        "Footnote\"\" kicks into gear when Eliezer, of all people, wins the highly coveted Israel Prize, the country's top academic honor.",
        "What happens next intertwines comedy and tragedy in a way that feels classically Jewish and completely new.",
        "Footnote\"\" does more than ask the provocative question - what is more important than truth?",
        "It attempts to answer it as well."

        "You know, the Iraqis would often give their children names intended to ward off the evil eye.",
        "So one common name that he remarked upon was the Arabic word mudloom(ph), which literally means to be oppressed.",
        "And so every day, from then on, it was a sort of running joke which one of us - given our sort of respective obligations to file stories or dodge bullets - would race to see who could claim the title of mudloom first.",
        "But he'd see these little details in ways that quite frankly, the rest of us, even with the benefit of translators - it was sort of like taking a picture and photocopying it.",
        "You'd lose all the detail and nuance.",
        "He - I just - I find his writing stunning and re-reading it is no less so, you know.",
        "He's looking down, in one article, at the body of a 14-year-old who's just been killed, and writes: With a cotton swab dipped in water, he ran his hand across Daif's olive corpse, dead for three hours but still glowing with life.",
        "He blotted the rose-red shrapnel wounds on the soft skin of his right arm.",
        "And his father, later in the article, describes his own son as like a flower.",
        "The son became, in Anthony Shadid's writing, an olive tree, a rose.",
        "And there's a broader metaphor here; that in Marjayoun, the town where he rebuilt his ancestral home, it once used to be the land of wonderful olive trees.",
        "It seems as if he is also sort of conjuring up the lost beauty of the landscape.",
        "Well, tell us about that, when Anthony announced he was taking a year-long leave from the Washington Post, and he's going to go back to this abandoned house of his great-grandfather, and fix it up.",
        "You know, he was Anthony, and I had no idea the sweep of history, you know, that would come together in this memoir.",
        "I shouldn't have doubted that he would build a house, but he'd build an even grander book."

        "He's obsessing with these beautiful tiles, actually, but they're the floor tiles.",
        "But he's lost in them.",
        "When I read that - to me, you know, it's a mosaic of the new world he's building in much the same way that those stories of people formed the mosaic of his professional body of work.",
        "Well, he made stories out of those tiles, too.",
        "He gave them names.",
