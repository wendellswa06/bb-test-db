        "Then there were other things that had, really, nothing to do with Asperger's, that were just being a better husband - encouraging her interests; using my words - which was, essentially, Kristen's speech-therapist way of telling me: You have to talk.",
        "You have to come and talk to me when things are bothering you.",
        "So, you know, there was some overlap.",

        "and all their Western powers, really, the only country that has dealt with them has been China.",
