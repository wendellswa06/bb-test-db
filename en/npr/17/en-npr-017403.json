        "That's what came out of it.",
        "Yes, it could have been done better, and I was the boss, so I always took the blame for it.",

        "Also, I really benefited from some doctors and nurses as they went home and took these wonderful notes down, wrote diary entries, even spoke into tape recorders.",
        "One nurse I interviewed at the very end of my process had a wonderful Reagan story.",
        "You know, Reagan's recovering the next day.",
        "He survives.",
        "He's in the recovery room all night.",
        "And so his aides come in and the aides say, well, Mr. President, just want to let you know that the guy who did it is crazy, but he's from a good family.",
        "And Reagan goes, hmm, well, I was kind of hoping it'd be the KGB.",
        "And there's a pause and Reagan says, no, I don't think so.",
        "He wouldn't have missed then.",
        "And a nurse, Maureen McCann, now Maureen O'Brien(ph), she went home and jotted that whole thing down.",
        "That whole day for her, it was historic.",
        "I also really benefited from this guy, Jerry Parr, who happened to have the best memory of this day of anyone.",

        "Actually, that's one of the problems that the movement is facing.",
        "And the other one is that the United States has lost the moral high ground, that under the Bush administration, there have been many human rights violations committed by Americans.",
