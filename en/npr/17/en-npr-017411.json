        "That, as David Simon, who created \"\"The Wire\"\" is in the film and he has a marvelous way of thinking about this.",

        "Because a program of law enforcement alone is not enough.",
        "Well, Nixon is kind of complex, kind of fascinating.",
        "And yes, he declared a war on drugs and was really the first modern day tough-on-crime candidate.",
        "And as such, he proved his success for a politician of running a tough on crime campaign.",
        "And yet, though he declared a war on drugs, privately, his policy was that he spent two-thirds of his drug budget on treatment rather than criminal justice.",
        "This means that on the treatment of addicts, we must go parallel...",
        "And yet, when the 1972 election approaches, even though he knows the treatment is working better, he recognizes that talking tough on crime gets you elected.",
        "And that forges for decades that we've now been experiencing this American model where politicians understand that it is successful to talk tough on crime, even though that may be misguided and terribly destructive to the goals of the country.",
        "And they also know that not doing so by now is considered a form of political suicide.",
        "Let's go back to the criminalization of drugs because the film - as the film points out, back in the 19th century and the early 20th century drug use today that is illegal - opium and cocaine and marijuana - back then was not.",
        "How did these drugs become thought of in the way we think of them now?",
        "Sure.",
        "Well, once upon a time, those people who used opium and people who used it ever excessively were seen sort of sympathetically as though it were a public health concern.",
        "But then something happened that teaches us a great deal, and that was that all of a sudden, laws began to be passed outlawing opium.",
        "But they weren't laws all across the country.",
        "They were only laws in California and only for one specific way of using opium, namely smoking it and why?",
        "Well, it had nothing to do with smoking opium.",
        "It had to do with who was smoking opium, and that was the Chinese.",
        "And the Chinese had come to America and were, of course, seen as taking American jobs and a threat to the labor force."

        "The one thing I could never have imagined would be that the most farsighted and deeply introspective critics of the drug war would be people on the inside.",

        "Well, immediately, it comes out of all the money needed for corrections.",
        "So somebody who's running a facility and wanting to make it a better place that's effective at, say, reducing recidivism sees that the political winds don't blow that way, that what happens is that politicians don't run smart on crime.",
        "They run tough on crime because it's in their short-term interest, and as Mike Carpenter taught me and others, it's ultimately in the short-term profit interest of a wide range of corporate and other actors who profit and benefit from the system being the way it does and not looking critically at itself.",
        "In one of your previous films, \"\"Why We Fight,\"\" it suggests that what Eisenhower described as a military industrial complex, it was called the defense industry, in some ways, stands in the way of serious reform when it comes to the amount of money we spend on defense.",
        "And I wonder if it's the same with the industry that depends on drug laws.",

        "Should he speak to schoolchildren?",
        "The suggestion that socialism is his real agenda.",

        "And now, has this been around all year, since President Obama was elected or inaugurated, or is there something really different about recent days?",
        "Well, there was an undercurrent, but in recent days the episode with Congressman Joe Wilson of South Carolina shouting out, You lie, as Obama was speaking to the joint session has really exacerbated that anxiety, and it's led to this notion that there is disrespect, even condescension, in the way that Obama is being treated as compared to any other president of the United States.",
        "And it's also then, I think, led to lots of discussion of whether or not there's a greater chance of Obama being physically attacked, assaulted.",
        "This was heightened, of course, by people who were bringing guns to some of the August and other tea party events, you know, to express opposition to President Obama's policies.",
        "Now, this view is opposite in many ways of what conservatives - and how they see it.",
        "You know, they've been saying all along that President Obama escapes a lot of criticism and scrutiny precisely because he's the first black president.",

        "I mean, he's been portrayed as the media darling, treated as the so-called, quote, \"\"messiah,\"\" by so many in the press, and therefore in the opinion of many conservatives, not properly scrutinized, that many of his policies and actions have simply been accepted.",
        "And now the conservative argument is that they're being censured, that any criticism of President Obama is being treated as evidence of racism without any evidence of such.",

        "He's been out raising money, riding a wave of anti-Obama feeling.",
