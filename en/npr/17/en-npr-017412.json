        "I understand these rules are somewhat complicated.",
        "Can you lay out the basics for us?",
        "What we do here at the Jockey Club is we have an approval process whereby the owners of the Thoroughbreds will submit the names to us, and we enter those names into a computer system and run them through a check of the phonetics of the name.",
        "The phonetics because...",
        "Yeah.",
        "You don't want two Thoroughbreds out there racing at the same time with very similar-sounding names.",
        "You know, as an example, there's a very prominent racehorse from several years back named Easy Goer, spelled E-A-S-Y, as you might imagine, and you wouldn't want to allow the name Eazy, spelled E-A-Z-Y.",

        "And, you know, some people may think a name is clever, and if they were able to slip the name by, we have seen instances in the past where the horse could get all the way to the racetrack, be ready to race, and could perhaps even be owned by a different owner, and we've seen cases where the name caused the stewards at the racetrack to actually scratch the horse.",
