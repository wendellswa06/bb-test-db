        "I find that's not true.",
        "In my conversations with people in the White House their mood is fine.",

        "But within the White House I don't detect any upsurge in disarray or down attitudes or infighting.",
        "So I think a lot of this is just - by and large, it's either a couple of people they were unhappy with, but mostly it's just an accumulation of circumstance, not a sign of anything deeper.",
        "Well, let me ask you both about another challenge the president's facing, and of course, the economy would be front and center.",
        "We had new unemployment numbers out today showing the economy still really struggling to create jobs.",
        "This new report showing the economy lost 95,000 jobs in September.",
        "Not a very encouraging picture for the president.",
        "And that's the last unemployment report we're going to have before the elections next month.",
        "What does this mean for members of Congress out trying to figure out how to spin this on the campaign trail?",
        "I think that it's very clear that you needed more stimulus, particularly in the form of help to state and local governments.",
        "They're in fiscal crisis.",
        "They are laying off people and in many cases they're also raising taxes.",
        "This is not a good thing to do for the economy.",
        "And so I think what you're going to see is people saying, ah, Obama's stimulus didn't work in campaign terms.",
        "The stimulus wasn't big enough, but it actually did a lot for us as far as it went.",
        "And what's really hurting us now are the anti-stimulative policies as things like aids to state and local governments get blocked by the Republicans in Congress.",

        "The Chamber denies it.",
        "What should we make of it?",
        "The problem is there's no way of knowing whether or not the Chamber is telling to truth, or whether it is technically telling the truth but foreign money coming in through memberships from foreign entities is sort of indirectly mixed in.",
        "And I think this becomes a big deal.",
        "There is an enormous amount of outside advertising financed by wealthy conservatives and now, thanks to the terrible Citizens United decision, corporations - I was down in Danville, Virginia, Tom Perriello's district - and you look at the morning shows, and it was just bombarded with ads.",

        "Well, let's be clear.",
        "You know, the core problem in Somalia is the lack of a government.",
        "You know, there was a government for a very brief period, from June 2006 to December 2006.",
        "And the - essentially, the Bush administration decided that because that government called itself the Union of Islamic Courts, that they needed to be ousted, they were extremists.",
        "And so there began a series of air strikes back in December '06, which has further destabilized the situation in Somalia.",
        "Destabilized the political crisis and also destabilized the economy.",
        "There have been food riots in Somalia as in many other countries around the world.",
        "So what you have is - on top of a political crisis and an economic crisis, you now have this issue of piracy.",
        "But clearly, there were no pirates in that six-month period when Somalia had a government.",
        "And what is needed now is not for China, nor the U.S., nor the European Union, nor any other country to go forward with either naval assaults or, potential now, under new UN resolution.",
        "You know, going on the land to pursue this terrorist, so air strikes could potentially happen in Somalia now.",
        "What is needed is not this further militarization of the Somali situation but essentially, going at the root cause here, working with Somalis to really be able to put in place to help Somalis put in place a government that they see as credible.",
        "Not as occupiers or proxies for external forces, whether the U.S.",
        "or the Ethiopia.",
        "But a government that Somalis believe represents their interest can help put together, not only a political resolution, but an economic resolution that meets the needs of the people.",
        "I don't know if China or any other nation is really listening to that point of view, Emira, to be quite honest with you.",
        "And in fact, that piracy has not only - it has spread south from the Gulf of Aden going down towards Kenya on the eastern coast of the Indian Ocean.",
        "That seems to be a widening problem, doesn't it?",
        "But Tony, once you have a government that can assert it sovereignty, control its territorial borders, that is the opportunity to actually address these issues.",
        "And we have to remember, there are also international measures.",
        "You have - you know, international policing, Interpol, and other mechanism through which there can be greater policing with this piracy is an issue of organized crime.",
        "Right?",
        "So we have to deal with it as an issue of organized crime, and not insist that the solution is to bring in, whether Chinese, or America, or other navies, and armies, and militaries to further destabilize the Somali crisis.",
        "Well, there certainly is a great deal of news coming out of Africa keeping you very busy.",
