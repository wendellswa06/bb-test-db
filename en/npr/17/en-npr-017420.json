        "Tom Bowman, I know you've got responsibilities to file for another program here on this network, so we appreciate your time today.",
        "Thanks very much.",
        "Okay, thanks, Neal.",
        "Tom Bowman, NPR Pentagon correspondent, with us here in Studio 3A.",
        "We turn now to Dexter Filkins, a staff writer for the New Yorker.",
        "He's been covering the war in Afghanistan for years and wrote about his latest visit to that country in the magazine last month in a piece titled \"\"After America: Will Civil War Hit Afghanistan When the U.S.",
        "Leaves?\"\" And he joins us now from our bureau in New York.",
        "Nice to have you back on the program.",
        "Hi.",
        "And I wonder, one of the conclusions you came to in your piece was indeed that it is both the Taliban and the Pakistani intelligence forces, services, that are infiltrating people into the Afghan army.",
        "They are, and there is a lot of evidence of that.",
        "But I think - I mean, I think we should be clear, or at least as clear as we can be, about what we think we know about what's happening in these - what they call green-on-blue attacks.",
        "You know, this is a public relations disaster, I mean among other things, for both the Afghan government and the U.S.",
        "military, and they don't know what to say about it.",
        "I mean, what can you say about it?",
        "And - but the evidence that they - the evidence that the U.S.",
        "military has been able to gather itself, they've investigated every one of these, and we now have 40 dead Americans this year, or 40 NATO dead this year in green-on-blue attacks, is that these attacks are not - only a small percentage of these attacks are due to Taliban infiltration, that the overwhelming majority of these, 90 percent are due to sort of personal reasons, you know, angry Afghans, insulted Afghans.",
        "And in many ways that's more troubling.",
        "I mean, that's a more - you know, it's one thing if you say, well, it's just the bad guys are getting in.",
        "You can stop that.",
        "But what happens when it's, you know, the country you're trying to help?",
        "And that's what's so worrisome about this, that the overwhelming majority of these attacks are being carried out not by the Taliban, by just ordinary Afghans who are signing up for the army and the police.",
        "And, in fact, the conclusion that you come to is the infiltration by the Pakistani intelligence services in the Taliban is not necessarily for right now, not necessarily for tactical attacks on American soldiers, but for the future, when Americans leave."

        "Yeah, I mean, look, the ISI - that's the Pakistani intelligence agency - the Inter-Services Intelligence in the Taliban.",
        "Look, they're a malevolent force in Afghanistan.",
        "There's no question about it.",
        "They do a lot of bad stuff that hurts the American and the NATO effort there, and they're not good people.",
        "But right - I mean the question is - and I think - the question I tried to address in my piece and what I tried to show is what happens when the Americans are gone, and that day is coming very quickly.",
        "We're due to stop fighting there at the end of 2014, all combat troops out.",
        "So some number will remain that hasn't been decided yet, you know, probably for many, many years after, maybe 10,000 Americans, maybe 15, maybe more.",
        "But what's happening now, and I think this is what - you know, whether it was infiltration or the militias or anything, the Afghans are getting ready for that day, and they're kind of making the calculations in their minds, and they're kind of lining up, and it's changing the politics, and you can see that.",
        "And you describe the various forces that participated in the Afghan civil war that largely broke down, yes, to some degree, ideological or religious but mostly along ethnic lines, the various groups that we've learned more about these past 11 years, and that indeed the various militias of those various ethnic groups are pulling themselves together and preparing for the day when an unresolved war is resumed.",
        "That's basically it.",
        "I mean, if you remember - I mean, the history here is really - I mean, it's very, very interesting, but it's just very instructive.",
        "So, I mean everything - you know, everything starts in 1979.",
        "It's a long time ago, but it's very, very relevant.",
        "It's kind of an unbroken chain.",
        "The Soviet Union, then intact, invaded Afghanistan.",
        "They were there for 10 years.",
        "They lost tens of thousands of men.",
        "They failed.",
        "They left in 1989.",
        "And they had built an army of their own.",
        "They were essentially - they tried to do essentially what we are trying to do right now, which is to get out but to leave a functioning state, an Afghan state that can stand on its own.",
        "And basically what happened - it's fascinating when you look at this period - the Soviet Union built a pretty good Afghan army.",
        "It was very tough and very resilient, and they fought very well, and they held their own.",
        "But what happened was the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.",
        "And so the Afghan army collapsed.",
        "They stopped getting paid, the ammunition stopped coming in.",
        "The Afghan army collapsed right after that.",
        "You had a long and terrible Afghan civil war which really lasted, remarkably - it brings us to the present day - the civil war really lasted until 9/11.",
        "That's basically what happened.",
        "The Taliban were one of the factions in the civil war.",
        "They controlled about 90 percent of the country.",
        "And - but the situation in the country, I mean I was there then, was so anarchic and so chaotic, and there was no functioning state, that basically al-Qaeda was able to kind of enter that space and plan the attacks.",
        "And so I think what everybody - nobody wants a civil war.",
        "Everybody wants to get out of Afghanistan, of course, and - but no one wants to leave a situation that might start to look like 2001 again.",
        "And so that's the worry."
