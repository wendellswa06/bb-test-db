        "Hi, you're on the air.",
        "Hey, I just - a little background on me, I actually served in Afghanistan last year and got home in February of this year, and I served in the Kandahar area, and it was basically our job to train an Afghan SWAT force, it's a PRC, a provincial response company, in the Kandahar area.",
        "And so what was that unit like?",
        "It was like for your guest there, he was talking about an Afghan, we actually had one that it was - out of all of them, there's one that I would trust with my life, Shahab(ph).",
        "And it was very - like, talking to him through an interpreter, it was very difficult to hear his story, just about how much he cares about his country and - but the lack of support that he gets from the people that are around him, the people that he's in charge, the people who are in charge of the PRC in Kandahar.",
        "And also when it comes to...",
        "The PRC is the Provincial Reconstruction Council?",
        "It was a provincial response company.",
        "OK.",
        "Basically what happens there is if there's an attack in the city, it's - it was our job to go with them as first responders."

        "And so one guy who really had it together, but the majority?",
        "Yeah, yeah, it's - just basically talking to him, it was kind of very difficult to hear how much he loved his country but the lack of support - just as your guest said - that he gets from the people that he leads and also the people that are in charge of him.",
        "And so how would you gauge the abilities of that unit by the time he left?",
        "It was difficult.",
        "Another thing that was - when it comes to what works and what doesn't, is the lack of consistency of American units that come in.",
        "Because we worked with a Canadian Special Forces unit that was training them first, and then we came in and took over from them.",
        "And the way that they handled things was, basically, just give them food, give them fuel, give them water, just give them everything so the Afghans were reliant on them.",
        "And then we came in, and we took that away and made them self-reliant.",
        "We, you know, showed them the way you have to go through the MOI, the Ministry of Interior, in order to get that food, water and fuel.",
        "And then the unit that took over from us went back to, well, you know, it's kind of difficult going through the Afghan government, so here's water, here's fuel, here's food.",
        "So I mean, when it comes to what works and what doesn't, like there has to be a consistency of them - consistency of leadership from the NATO troops to them to help create a self-sustainable source.",
        "Dexter, it's interesting, again going back to your piece, you wrote about a policy of forcing the Afghan troops and police, more and more, to, well, perhaps a bit of a patronizing characterization, to grow up, to stop acting like teenagers.",
        "Kind of, yeah.",
        "I think that was - I mean, that's precisely the way the colonel put it.",
        "And it's actually not - it does sound patronizing, but it's pretty accurate.",
        "And I - you know, I think what's troubling about all this stuff, you know, like the conversation that the speaker just - that we just had, you know, we're at year 11 here.",
        "I mean, we've been doing this for 11 years.",
        "And it's still not there yet.",
        "You know, it's like the training wheels are still on, you know, and it's like when's it going to work.",
        "And I don't know.",
        "And I think it's not clear that it's going to.",
        "And I think what's troubling, you know, when you're there, and you see this, and you can see that we're leaving, I mean we are leaving.",
        "You know, when I got there, I was in Eastern Afghanistan, I got to an American base in Paktika that they literally were bulldozing as I got there.",
        "We're pulling out.",
        "We're pulling out whether it works or not.",
        "You know, so, you know, I hope it works, you know, but we're taking off."

        "And so what happens if it doesn't work a year from now?",

        "What happens then?",
        "Because I think if you look at the situation now, and it's hard to predict the future, but if you look ahead, it's pretty troubling.",

        "You said earlier that in - at 9/11, 10 percent of the country was still not in Taliban hands.",
        "That was in the control of the Tajiks.",
        "Ahmad Shah Massoud was the commander then, killed just before 9/11.",
        "And that - you wrote in your piece the Tajiks are alarmed at the prospect that the Taliban would come back, either as part of a negotiated agreement, as part of a peace deal, or that they would make huge military gains after the United States and NATO troops leave and are preparing for the day when they can resume their militias, build up their own forces again and retreat to the Punjab(ph).",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I - that, you know, it's a paradox, and it's really hard.",
        "On one hand, the United States is pushing very hard to make some kind of deal with the Taliban.",
        "I mean, it may not work, but they're pushing very hard to kind of, you know, make some kind of arrangement.",
        "And that might be a really significant deal.",
        "I mean, it could be something like you bring the Taliban into the government or part of the government, you know, in the east or the south or whatever, and they stop fighting.",
        "And that sounds really good, right?",
        "But then you have the northern part of the country, where basically the minorities are, the Tajiks and the Uzbeks, Hazaras.",
        "They hear something like that, and they say absolutely no way.",
        "You make a deal with the Taliban, and we fight.",
        "And that's the hard part.",
        "So on one hand, you try to make a deal, and on the other hand, you've got half a country saying, no, absolutely no way.",
        "We're not taking a deal.",
        "And so it's hard.",
        "It's really hard right now, and that's what they're trying to finesse.",
        "But these groups like the Tajiks that you mentioned and the Hazaras, I mean, this is, you know, half the country, basically.",
        "They were scarred by this civil war.",
        "They were scarred by their treatment under the Taliban.",
        "I mean, a lot of these groups were massacred.",
        "And they're not going to let it happen again.",
        "And so that's, you know, it's like once burned, you know, and so they're getting ready.",
        "And that's the tricky part here that we're trying to finesse as we leave."

        "I would say almost all the patrolling should be done by Afghans.",
        "Secondly, we can pull back to our bases and focus on this idea of training local policemen or giving them the equipment they need, and we should set a time limit much sooner than the end of 2014, because I just don't see the point of having a couple of hundred more U.S.",
