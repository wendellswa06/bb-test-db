        "They looked at that 1994 study that showed a 50 percent reduction in flu incidents and noticed that the vaccine was much less effective in older people.",
        "They looked at studies comparing people who decided to get vaccinated to those who didn't, and figured that fewer of the vaccinated people died because they were healthier in the first place, healthy enough to go out and get a vaccine.",

        "She says her analysis doesn't rule out an effect, but it certainly does not show a big one.",
        "Still, the CDC's David Shay said the 1994 study that took a group of people and gave half of them a placebo and half of them have a vaccine is solid enough evidence that the flu vaccine is very effective.",
        "That's our one piece of gold standard evidence in people in this age group.",
