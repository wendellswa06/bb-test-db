        "It always brings risks.",

        "It's pretty much what the Taser was designed for.",

        "Well, it certainly changes the confrontation.",
        "There are studies showing the overall, Tasers do reduce injuries because it prevents officers from going hands-on.",
        "And sometimes officers need to go hands-on.",
        "And that risk is part of the job.",
        "The shame is that when someone gets tased and they - you know, they land on concrete; they lose their teeth.",

        "And I think they need to be much more - the use of Taser has to be much more strictly confined to places where suspects are threats.",
        "So is it a training issue?",
        "I mean, how do you measure how effective these things can be in actually reducing the number of police shootings?",
        "Because Chicago - we're talking about - Chicago is the reason for this conversation.",
        "In 2010, that police department expanded the use of Tasers, and there was not an immediate decrease in police shootings.",
        "No, and I may be unaware of some other studies out there.",
        "But I - generally, I don't think you do see a reduction in lethal use of force with Tasers.",
        "It becomes an additional use of force, most often.",

        "So you can lower shootings.",
        "You can lower police-involved shootings without resorting to Taser use.",
        "And New York City has shown that very well.",

        "It's always going to be tough.",
        "And nothing is ever going to be perfect.",
        "And that's important to say because the job does have a lot of variabilities (ph).",

        "So it very much then becomes a question of how they deal with them when those situations arise.",
        "May I ask for your professional opinion about the mayor's decision in Chicago?",

        "There may be similarities, but there is no rhyme or reason to what will work or what won't work because each offender is released with their own specific issues.",
        "For instance, someone who has been convicted for assault, like Melissa stated, may not be assertive in their jobs so it's because their victim may be seeking revenge.",
        "We tend to forget about the unresolved issues that offenders, you know, leave behind when they are incarcerated.",

        "If someone might not be assertive in their job search because the person they assaulted is seeking revenge.",
        "Do you mean in a gang related kind of way or what are you talking about?",
        "It can be in a gang related way, but it also can be, like, if someone was convicted for a robbery and there was a victim in the home at the time of the robbery, somebody may want to get personal revenge or seek some kind of personal justice on the individual.",
        "I mean, it's like some people - some, for instance, someone who's convicted of a sexual crime, they may want to get some kind of revenge for the assault of their daughter, for their mother or their niece or something like that.",
        "So, they may not be as assertive looking for a job because they fear there's going to be some, kind of, reprisal while they are out in the community."
