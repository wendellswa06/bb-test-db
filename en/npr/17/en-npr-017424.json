        "Yeah.",
        "Before I go back to the specifics of, you know, what agencies do for reentry, Jason, when you counsel someone who might have done a terrible wrong and finds that they are in a position where they might be facing reprisal, how do you counsel them to lead their life knowing that they committed the crime but also knowing that they might face vigilante justice?",
        "I just tell them to do what they feel is needed in their good.",
        "I can't give them any kind of personal counsel because I don't really ask them about their crimes.",
        "I just ask them how can I help them.",
        "I don't, you know, indulge in what happened and what made them do things like that.",
        "I just try to help them where they are.",
        "They offer the information that they want to give me and I just go from that and let them know what happened with me and my personal journey to reentry.",
        "So I never, you know, really go into depth about the crime they committed or why they did what they did.",
        "So, we just go from where they're at and move forward.",
        "Melissa, you know, Jason raises some complicated questions which is that people - all of us are in this world with baggage that we have accumulated overtime.",
        "But if you've committed a crime, if you are incarcerated, you have some direct ties to this question of responsibility, retribution, repentance, those big concepts that drive us on a moral level.",
        "So give me a perspective on what programs do and don't offer, you know, in terms of whether some of them are strictly like job placements, some of them are really dealing with the, you know, the broader issues - emotional and social issues.",
        "How do these things play out a cross program?",
        "Well, I think there's two types of programs you'll find there are comprehensive programs and then there are specific, you know, subject area programs.",
        "So there are programs that just focus on job placement.",
        "You can walk into the door.",
        "You can say I need a job and they actually act like a temp agency and try and find you a job.",
        "They may or may not address some of the other issues you may have in terms of just knowing how to be on time, knowing how to use the bus system.",
        "And then you have comprehensive programs which oftentimes have a very stringent intake process to really assess what are your health care needs, what are your family support needs, what are your employment needs, and they then work with you to get, you know, possibly, vocational rehabilitation.",
        "They work with you to have counseling with your family.",
        "They then even work with you to be in a drug treatment program, or recognizing a significant amount of folks - one in six, in fact, are mentally ill - they may just begin to provide you with some medical treatment that you may need.",
        "Effort is it.",
        "Effort, good.",

        "I think it definitely has an impact.",
        "I mean, again, I think we can be naive.",
        "We must recognize - while I certainly am a strong proponent of individual responsibility, we must recognize that the system is broken.",
        "And that when you look at urban communities where majority of folks are coming out of their communities and going into prison, the challenges and the lack of scaffolding and support that exist is oftentimes impetus or catalyst for them to enter into the world of crime.",
        "And so it's not going to be any different for folks who, you know, let's say, we've gone to college.",
        "If he come back and there's no support, there's no support.",
        "We've also must not be naive.",
        "There is an element of structural racism here that is certainly played into the fact that there are higher numbers of African-American males who were just disenfranchised, period, whether they can't get a job or they may find themselves in prison.",

        "Jason, when you listen to Melissa talk about these issues of structural inequality, you know, do you even approach some of those issues when you talk to the young men in your program, or is it more like - is it more on the practical side, look, this is what you need to do to get a job.",
        "What's the structure of your program?",
        "I definitely give them both sides (unintelligible) like structural racism is there, but there has to be a personal commitment to overcome.",
        "You can't just totally depend on the system.",
        "That system was broken, like Melissa stated, before, and more than likely it's going to be broken when you try and enter back into it.",
        "So, there has to be some level of perseverance on the individual in order for them to overcome.",
        "So, I give them both sides.",
        "I let them know, like, hey, we haven't evolved enough to say that racism doesn't exist.",
        "I mean, it's there and you have to deal with it, and you have to meet it on his terms.",
        "But you have to be ready to handle that conflict when it arrives.",
        "You can't get off of your square because it is there.",
        "So, I give them both.",
        "I give them both sides.",
        "I mean, I try and give them everything they need.",
        "I'm not going to sugarcoat anything when I'm talking to them because they see things.",
        "You know, a lot - some of them are mentally impaired, but most of them do understand that something isn't right, but they just don't know how to channel their energy into doing what is right.",
        "Now, you talk about how you speak to the gentlemen in your program from your own personal experience, and you spent 20 months in prison on three felony convictions.",
        "When you came home, how motivated were you or how able were you to jump right back into the saddle and try to get your life right?",
        "I was extremely motivated.",
        "I went in as a different kind of individual.",
        "Most people don't go into the system with a high school diploma.",
        "You know, I graduated from high school, and most people that are incarcerated are seeking their GED or some of them maybe going for college classes, but most don't have high school diploma.",
        "So, I went in with a little bit of education and I had guidance early in life.",
        "I really couldn't accept it because it was coming from my mother who was trying to raise me to be a man, and I just couldn't hear the message.",
        "But I have some good values that were instilled in me, so when I was released I was ready to hit the ground running.",

        "So when I got out on own work release, which was six months, I knew that I was going to get a job.",
        "And I got a job in five days.",
        "And then I became supervisor, and I, you know, constantly elevated myself, but I know when they open them doors for me that I was going to do some things that most people are not doing, and that's having a successful reentry.",
        "Melissa, when you look at this broad array of programs, there's the federal level.",
        "And in 2004, President Bush announced a prisoner reentry initiative.",
        "It was dealing with about 30 faith-based and community institutions that received grants totaling about $25 million.",
        "Do you have any sense of whether this has had an impact, you know, symbolically or in real terms in changing peoples lives?",
        "I mean, we haven't heard much about it since it was announced.",

        "I mean, you certainly - the day after, I think you could not pick up a paper or have a conversation at the water cooler.",
        "People are not talking about reentry.",
        "I think it scratched the surface, and in some cases allowed people to start talking about the fact that at least somebody in somebody else's family has been in the system.",
        "So, I think symbolically, it was important.",
        "I think the numbers, however, speak for themselves.",
        "It was an initiative that was $25 million.",
        "However, we spend over $100 million a day just on supervision.",
        "So when you look at PRI, when you look at the Second Chance Act that's going to authorize possibly about 400 million, there's still an extreme inequity in terms of how much money we're putting toward the problem.",
        "When economics allow greater opportunity, greater jobs they've created during incarceration and we don't balance that for reentry, it's a real challenge.",
        "So, I would say at the end, it's been symbolic.",
        "We haven't really seen the results yet.",
        "You still find many groups struggling to be able to find and maybe able to make ends meet.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And is it fair to say that she gets a little bit obsessed in terms of trying to establish her father's identity, if I - can I put it that way?",
        "Oh, what a wonderful problem that would be.",
        "I think there's a couple of strategies to take.",
        "One is to begin to funnel some money just into community and economic development - to begin to look at communities and the structures that exists or don't exists; to begin to have some prevention programs that are actually effective; looking at unemployment range, looking at access to health care, looking at family support.",
        "So, that's the first strategy.",
        "I think the second strategy is recognizing the people that are going to make mistakes.",
        "They're being willing to look at alternatives to incarceration.",
        "There are many programs in New York and San Francisco that have had outstanding results by looking at other options, whether it be reentry courts, you know, community service, employment, you know, counseling and monitoring that have actually diverted people from going to prison, where indeed it's not a positive experience, and in many cases changes peoples lives, and makes them even worst, and puts them at a very different state of mind where they're hopeless and struggle to get out.",
        "And then, I think the third piece is recognizing that some people do have to go to prison, but eventually, they are going to get out.",
        "And begin to really support comprehensive programs.",
        "I think that Jason said it best, no one is the same.",
        "And so you must have programs that can afford to offer individualized attention and support that people can indeed be successful."

        "Jason, I'd throw the same question at you with a particular focus on what kind of got us started in the first place, this whole question of early release.",

        "So knowing that given the financial issues in America today, some prisoners might be released ahead of schedule, some will serve out their full sentences.",
        "What would you do with an unlimited amount of money to really try to address this problem?",
        "Well, I would definitely put it in housing and jobs, first and foremost, because most people don't want to hire someone with felony convictions.",
        "You know, they're judging people by the worst thing that they've don.",
        "They're not looking at the individual.",
        "They're looking at what's on the paper.",
        "So, I would definitely have some job placement.",

        "And they don't want someone who has a felony conviction.",
        "They think you did a crime, you're going to always do that specific crime.",
        "So, definitely in the housing and jobs, and also like Melissa stated, there has to be some individual one-on-one help.",
        "It's not really in the form of hand-holding, but actually sitting them down and say, hey, you can have a bright future if you do one, two, and three.",
        "You have to talk to them just the way they are.",
        "And with housing and jobs and then put in all the other pieces together, ex-offenders can get a sense of accomplishment, and start feeling better about themselves.",
        "And actually do the things that they need to do.",
        "So, early release could be good for some, but harmful for others, depending on the individual.",
        "If an individual has a structure already in place of community support and accountability, not just to the Department of Corrections, or to agencies that have to supervise them, they can actually see their future, and actually know that people are with them ready to, you know, help them take the next steps.",
