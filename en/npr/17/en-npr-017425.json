        "And this is more anecdotal, but a lot of bad police-involved shootings we've seen recently first involved the misuse of a Taser because once you attempt to use a Taser and it doesn't achieve the desired effect, I think officers get a little freaked out, quite frankly, and then are much more willing to use lethal force.",

        "These shopping carts will be equipped with a screen that carries ads.",
        "And there will be promotions that can be aimed specifically at a shopper's particular buying habits.",

        "Well, the software giant Microsoft is behind this venture.",

        "The companies say that shoppers will be able to log onto a Web site and type in their grocery list and it will be link to the loyalty card that you use for your particular supermarket.",
        "And when you arrive at the store, you swipe your card through a slot on the cart, up pops your shopping list.",
        "And then as you put groceries in your cart, the gizmo keeps a running tally of how much you're spending.",
        "It can also help you locate particular items.",
        "And let's say you're heading into the cereal isle, for example.",
        "It can alert you to a special two for one offer for corn flakes or something.",
        "And a lot of that will be based on your past grocery purchases, which are, of course, recorded when you use your loyalty card."

        "But, of course, the reality is we take the facts that we know, and then we fill in all the blanks.",

        "But may I ask, did a publisher or an agent say to you, look, this is too mature a story for the YA audience, but it's hard to get adults to read about middle schoolers, so what demographic are you going for here anyway?",
        "My answer to that would be, I'm going for all readers.",
        "I actually - when I was growing up, and maybe when you were growing up, too, YA was not a category that existed.",
        "There were books about young people.",
        "There were books about older people.",
        "And there were children's books that were frankly written for children.",
        "But, otherwise, books were just for people.",
        "This is a book that is as much for a parent as a child, is as much for a teenager as a grandmother or a grandfather.",
        "It's a book about what it's like to be alive and be human, I hope.",
        "For me, at least, and for the people - everyone around me that I know - these years are so formative and so central to who we become and how we interact with other people as adults in the world - that to see them as something only of interest to teenagers or adolescents themselves - I think that's just missing so much of reality.",
        "I often say to friends - I say, you know, if you're - when you're dealing with somebody and finding it hard, just think of them in middle school.",
        "Just think, you know?",
        "Ah.",
        "Ah.",
        "And if you just actually picture somebody in middle school, and you sort of project back to their 12 or 13-year-old self, so much about people's behavior is explained."
