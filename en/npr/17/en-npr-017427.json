        "Exchange their initial consonant sounds.",

        "Thanks for having me back.",
        "And is the humanitarian aim to protect civilians anything more than a fig leaf to win a Security Council resolution when the leaders of Britain, France and the United States all say, Gadhafi must go?",
        "You know, President Obama, as long ago as the campaign for president, said he believed it was appropriate to use military force to protect civilians who are being slaughtered by their own government.",
        "So he, at least, is being entirely consistent with the position he's taken over time.",
        "But there's certainly a lot of people - both in international law and philosophers who think about just war - who are concerned that even when you start with the best of intentions and you're trying to protect civilians like those clearly being slaughtered in Libya, you end up in a war that simply grows and grows and grows, because war moves in unpredictable directions, and you can't tell what's going to end up happening.",
        "The president said - the Security Council Resolution 1973 specifically excludes ground forces.",
        "The president said he will not send ground troops into Libya.",

        "And I get the sense that you feel that to be lacking in current American policy.",
        "I think, to some extent, it has been because there's this notion that to deal with America is to deal with this kind of pristine place.",
        "And therefore, we're not going to talk to people who, in some respects, don't share our values.",
        "And when you don't talk to someone who doesn't share our values, you're probably not going to be talking to the people who really are responsible for the mess.",
        "Well, is that change because America considers it distasteful or is it a change of priorities from the top that this won't be how we approach the problems of the present day?",
        "I think, to some extent, there was a hope that very distasteful Bashar al-Assad would go quickly in the way the others went quickly in the Arab Spring.",

        "And then when you don't get to point X or when something goes awry, and it often does, then people say, well, why are we talking to these terrible people.",
        "So it's a very tough proposition.",
        "You write that from 1990 to 1992, the State Department opened 20 new embassies around the world in places with almost no infrastructure.",
        "And it's hard to read that without wondering whether the influence of U.S.",

        "And how would you compare that sort of flood-the-zone moment of American diplomacy to the present day?",
        "Today, think it's much more focused on very, very tough issues, but tough issues involving war and peace.",
        "And when you have these kind of war and peace moments, where you lead is with your military.",
        "And again, we have the world's finest military.",
        "But to lead with a military and not with a civilian component, I think, has downstream consequences.",
        "At so many moments in your career, you have gone to tackle these seemingly unsolvable problems.",
        "And in some cases, like the former Yugoslavia, you solve them.",

        "You go in and you throw yourself into it.",
        "And you say, I'm going to do the best I can.",
        "And if at the end of the game you lose, it's not because you didn't try.",
        "But I'd like to also mention the fact that as you go into something with North Koreans, there are other goals in mind.",
        "For example, we had a deteriorating relationship with South Korea.",
        "That is people didn't believe we were serious about negotiation, and our reputation was being hurt by that.",
        "In going into negotiation with the North Koreans, I think we overcame that presumption among many South Koreans.",
        "So you go in with a number of objectives, some of which are clear to the press and to everybody, some of which appear more secondary."
