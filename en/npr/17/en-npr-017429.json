        "I mean, we have troops on the ground there but we weren't necessarily at war with Somalia.",
        "That's just my perspective.",
        "And my second comment is that I feel like, you know, I think the times have changed such that the attitude now seems very critical of Barack Obama, and I think some of it is understandable.",
        "But I do feel that a lot of it is unfair.",
        "I think this is a very opportune time to beat up on the president.",

        "But when you attack another sovereign country, that's war, and it's hard to call it anything else.",

        "It's a much smaller war.",
        "It may in the long run be more manageable.",
        "We certainly hope so.",

        "You take your lumps.",
        "I myself think this war in Libya is defensible.",
        "I think there is a justification for it, and I would like to see the president make a stronger case for this war.",
        "But if people disagree with that, if people think this war is not justifiable, then it doesn't matter who the president is and he's got to take his lumps.",
