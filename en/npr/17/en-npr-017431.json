        "It really is.",
        "We see a lot of responders that get into trouble because they haven't been educated on swift water or flood rescue.",
        "And not only does it take education, but it takes the proper equipment if they're going to go into that situation.",
        "Well, most of these guys are firefighters, and they're wearing firefighters equipment.",
        "Yeah, and that's really a problem.",
        "One of the things that we've made it a - we've been doing this for 30 years plus and - is that get out of your turnout clothes.",
        "Think about those heavy materials that are supposed to protect you from flame.",
        "But once they are saturated with water, they're not going to help you as far as a floatation device of any type.",
        "So we really preach having personal protective equipment, and that's having a PFD, having the right helmet, having the proper footwear, because you don't know what's in that water once you're starting to dredge(ph) into it.",
        "It's, like you said, murky.",
        "You can't see the bottom.",
        "You can't see - you know, is there a barbwire down there?",
        "Is there glass and rocks and those type of things?",
        "So having the proper equipment to do the job, and then having the training so that you know how to read a river.",
        "I always say that, you know, the river in China is exactly the same as the river in the United States.",
        "So once you know the rules of it, they're all the same.",
        "You know, you said a PFD.",
        "What's that?",
        "Personal flotation device, I'm sorry.",
        "Okay.",
        "And that's just basically giving that person some flotation if he is swept away.",
        "Now, obviously, if a first responder sees somebody stranded in their car, they're going to try to walk out there and - obviously, if the water is moving fast enough to pull away a car, it's going to be moving fast enough to pull away a person.",
        "Right.",
        "And that's where most of our - we - what it does is it adds to the victim count, is what we talk about.",
        "Not only do you have somebody on the top of a car, but now you've got a rescuer in the water also.",
        "So courses like ours, which is the swiftwater rescue (technical difficulties) it's imperative that the fireman, if they are going to attempt to do a rescue, have all the tools that they need to make sure that they don't create more problems for - and have more victims in the water."

        "And we think it's a major problem because they're going to put more people in danger because they don't have the boating experience, and yet they're trying to get out in the water with the boats.",
        "So the gear is a problem, but so is that.",
        "We'd also like to see whitewater - swiftwater rescue people able to get involved in situations like the Little Missouri River flooding, where that entire campground got wiped out.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It was two days into it before they let the whitewater boaters on the water, and they participated in the rescue at that point.",

        "Well, Kim...",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Kim, I would suggest that the agency having jurisdiction or whatever the fire department is that's nearer where you work on the river -we've had very good success by holding classes where we bring those firemen and those people that are working in the river environment every day together, so that they realize what their skills that are out there.",
        "We always say that the firemen usually have the great rope skills.",
        "They know how to set up the Z-rigs and all of those things to make the rescue.",
        "But they don't have the skills in the water like the people that are in there every day.",
        "So...",
        "That's right.",
        "...by (technical difficulties) class together, Kim, that brings those two elements together, then if you have a disaster like the park that you were talking about, there's a familiarity there, and they know that they actually have more assets that they can pull upon to make that rescue happen and to help the people in need."

        "If one enters a flooded area despite a nearby sign saying Do Not Enter While Flooded, the driver is responsible for the cost of the rescue.",
        "The benefit of this law is that it gets people talking and thinking about how - just how much they don't understand about driving through flooded roads.",
        "Is that a law, Mike Turnbull, that you know about?",
        "Well, I do.",
        "And I know that Texas has the same type of law, so that - and it helps educate.",
        "I mean, anytime you talk about laws and fines and those types of things, people pay attention.",
        "So I think that's a great law, and I think that more municipalities should adopt that.",
        "And the whole thing is that if we can educate - you know, you spend $1 to educate, it cost $300 to train a rescuer.",
        "So that's a statistic that we talk about.",
