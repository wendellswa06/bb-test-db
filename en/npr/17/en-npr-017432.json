        "Mike Turnbull, if if you do mess up and find yourself in this situation, and as I understand it, as soon as the water rises up high enough to hit your muffler, your car is going to stall out pretty quickly thereafter -what should you do?",

        "And usually the batteries will keep providing power so that you can roll the windows down, because the first thing we need to do is try to get out of the vehicle, whether it's getting on top of it or, if it is going to start to roll, get away from the vehicle.",
        "So if possible, if the car does settle and it feels fairly stable, get on the top of the car.",
        "Get to the highest point.",
        "That's our instinct, and that is a good way to do it.",
        "And stay on the upstream side of the car, because if you - if you're thinking about it, if you're on the downstream side, what that's going to tend to do with that current pushing it, it's going to cause that car to roll easier.",
        "Right.",
        "So that is your lifeline.",
        "If you're standing on top of that car and - stay there if you can if the car is going to be stable.",
        "If it is going to roll, get away from it.",
        "Get as far away as you can.",
        "And we teach a swimming position, which is your feet downstream and do basically backstrokes.",
        "That's to keep your feet from going down and catching on - remember, I said the stuff that's underneath the water that you can't see.",
        "So - and then, if you - it is safe, turn over and swim aggressively, try to get to shore.",
        "Okay.",
        "So you do have some time once that car starts to move.",
        "Let's get one last call in.",

        "All right, folks, before we get into those topics, I wanted to briefly -Walter, let me start with you - talk about what we heard from Russell Simmons, and I know you know Russell personally, as well.",
        "The impassioned move that Russell has taken on for social change is interesting, also to look at where the hip-hop community is, because I do think, as I tried to get him to address, that they're stuck in the middle.",
        "The idea of wanting social change, wanting to be a movement for that, but also falling back on some of misogynistic and also materialistic views of that, if we use it as a collective, a monolith, if you will.",
        "I think you're right, and I think their intent is honorable.",
        "I think the problem that they're having is that they have yet to own up to some of the negativity within their community.",
        "I mean, I think it's important for them to take this step in terms of being more politicized, but they have to address issues of how they treat women, how they record their music, the lyrics they use.",
        "And it's not a matter of policing, I think it's an accountability measure.",
        "Because yes, art certainly has certain boundaries and we can accept the fact that artists should have some license to express themselves, and we certainly want to respect everyone's First Amendment rights; but if you're going to start talking about creating a political movement, I think you have to have a set of values that everyone agrees to in order to move forward.",
        "I think there are some artists who are clearly responsible in the type of language they use.",
        "There are others that are clearly not, and I think if they are really going to create a mass movement, they've got to address the issue of what are the bottom-line values that we want to rally around in order to make an impact, and really see the lives of the people that we care about improved.",
        "And, Pedro, what I loved about Russell's answer, and believe me we've had many discussions publicly and privately about this, very heated sometimes, but the idea that - he did bring up an interesting point, and that is perhaps we're holding the hip-hop community to more accountability than we do others, including the government.",
        "I thought his answer was interesting about the country being more gangster than those in the hip-hop community.",
        "Well, I think that's a clever response, but it doesn't, I think, eliminate the question of what is their responsibility as artists to the community that they attempt to represent."
