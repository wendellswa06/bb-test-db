        "It's just a horrible corporation.",
        "They - you see their footprints in Iraq, but also in New Orleans.",

        "At that time, their stock was about $20; now their stock is about $70.",

        "There was a lot of talk, but very little movement until now.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's - well, its not surprising when you consider its not just Halliburton, it's also the oil companies that are so closely connected to this administration.",
        "And what we've seen over the course of the years that - since Bush has been elected is several major corporations - including Enron - that were involved in very shady, corrupt practices now are being exposed for what they are.",
        "And the administration is not being held accountable for its connections.",
        "The fact that Dick Cheney was the former CEO of Halliburton rarely comes out, particularly given these sweetheart deals.",
