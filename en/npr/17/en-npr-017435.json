        "Hi, Rachel.",
        "So, what do you we know about this most recent security breach at Neiman Marcus?",
        "What type of data was taken?",
        "Well, we don't know a lot.",
        "What we do is that the banks that issue credit cards, some of them started seeing some funky charges that they trace back to cards that had all been used at Neiman Marcus.",
        "And they got notified in the middle of December by their credit card processor that something wasn't right.",
        "They're still trying to figure that out and they really didn't have too many details to share about how broad this is, how many cards may be affected, how the bad guys got in, that kind of stuff.",
        "This Neiman Marcus breach comes on the heels of this major security breach at Target, where potentially millions of Americans were affected.",
        "Are these happening more often or are we just hearing about them more?",
        "Yeah, I think it's fair to say we're just hearing about them more.",
        "My sense in talking to folks in the financial industry, I'm surprised that many of them are a bit nonchalant and some of them have told me, you know, I don't know why everybody is so upset about these.",
        "You know, these things happen all the time and they never get reported.",
        "Well, if people really know how many there were, nobody would feel comfortable using their cards anywhere.",
        "And I think that the industry as a whole doesn't like talking about these things for that very reason.",
        "So, what is the latest on the investigation into what happened at Target?",
        "Now, 45 Republicans in your conference voted with the Democrats to support this bill.",
        "In the Senate, you've got Republicans outwardly hammering on President Bush for vetoing it.",
        "What are you doing to keep your party together?",
        "It may be too soon to say what the best is, but you can go to sites like IPodder.org and PodcastAlley.com and Podcast.net, and just start listening.",
        "And you'll find some good stuff and some bad stuff.",
        "There's a podcasting priest in Europe who I heard from the Vatican while the pope was getting sicker and sicker.",
        "There's a friend of mine named Fred Wilson who's a venture capitalist in New York, who just loves this stuff, who created a podcast with this three kids and wife all introducing music.",
        "There's a lot of podcasting families out there.",
        "There's another family that podcasts movie reviews together.",
        "What it is about this new medium, it's all a matter of your own individual taste.",

        "It's not as if you have to look at all Web pages.",

        "Well, because that's where we have the greatest opportunity to get members of Congress to change their minds.",
        "We need to appeal to them in many different ways.",
        "But one way to appeal to them is to say to their constituents - here's the information and we hope your member of Congress will vote the right way.",
