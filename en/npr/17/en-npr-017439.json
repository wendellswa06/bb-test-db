        "But John Turturro, who wrote and directed \"\"Fading Gigolo\"\" in addition to starring in it, has conceived the promised menage a trois as a kind of delirious anticlimax, one he builds to with more nuanced stories about Murray's domestic situation with an African-American mom and four kids, about a Jewish neighborhood watch group that works with Brooklyn police and rabbinical courts and about a Hasidic widow, who brings all these threads together and becomes the innocent heart of \"\"Fading Gigolo\"\" when Murray introduces her to Fioravante, not for sex, but because widowhood has pulled her so utterly away from the world.",
        "Woody Allen reportedly had a hand in helping Turturro refine the script, and together, they've succeeded in keeping the mood light even as the filmmaker is gently tugging the plot in other directions, to look at loneliness and longing and heartbreak, things that, if you think about it, are just what you'd expect to find in a film about a gigolo, though, perhaps not a film with as much charm and sweetness as \"\"Fading Gigolo.\"\" I'm Bob Mondello.",

        "What part of the island do you think is most vulnerable?",
        "Well, to be honest, based on the track of this storm, if it does go directly over us, flash flooding is going to be a major problem.",
        "We have - the entire center of the island is mountainous and, therefore, what would happen is extreme rainfall will cause severe flash flooding.",
        "The other area of concern is storm surges.",
        "For a Category 5 hurricane will have very powerful storm surges and, therefore, coastal communities will be threatened, hotel - the hotel industry maybe particularly vulnerable, our agriculture industry also could be severely impacted."

        "But within an hour, the case had collapsed and the judge dismissed all charges.",
        "This is a little bit of context here, 3-years-ago the administration came up with the system called the Combatant Status Review Tribunal, CSRT, and essentially what they did was that they determined if detainee at Guantanamo was deemed an enemy combatant, and if they were, that meant that the administration could hold them here, they could charge them whatever.",

        "In associate, that is not what Omar Khadr is or any of the others 400 - approximately 400 detainees is still here, they're just enemy combatants.",

        "He said it just won't wash.",
        "It's a law now.",
        "Congress has passed it, all charges dropped.",
        "And Omar Khadr was 15 when he was arrested but he's been at Guantanamo for five years, what was his reaction?",
        "He had absolutely no reaction at all.",
        "And in fact, he had no reaction through the whole trial, even though it was very short.",
        "He would not stand up when the judge came in, he - you know, it's hard to read but he looks slightly belligerent.",
        "He wouldn't look at his one American lawyer down at the end of the table.",
        "He - you know, there was just no way reaction from him whatsoever.",
        "And what does this mean for military tribunals, are they likely to continue?",
        "Well, we structure our community--we recognize that different senior policymakers have different responsibilities and different issues.",
        "It's so early - after this ruling today that it's a - one would presume that, yes they are, but some alterations are probably going to have to beat down, and one of the first alterations is probably to this process, to determine if their enemy combatants.",
        "In other words, that chief defense lawyer said, the administration will probably have to go back, rewrite the rules for those so it will containing the word unlawful in them and then go back and charge all the approximately 400 detainees for them to do process again, and impact that word and do it unlawful, and in this process can go ahead.",
        "Having said that, the prosecution said that they would like 72-hours to consider whether they will appeal this ruling.",
        "And just to make it even more complicated, there's not they can appeal it too because there is no appeals courts for these type of tribunals in place yet.",
        "This is just the way that these trials go down here in Guantanamo."
