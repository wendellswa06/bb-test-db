        "Well, tell me about the timing.",
        "Was it just the right timing in your life to write a book like this or would - did it have anything to do with the changes we're going through now?",
        "Well, it has to do with changes absolutely, both in the publishing industry, which is opening up and becoming more positively oriented to communicating information, both fiction and nonfiction using the comics medium, as well as I think changes in our society, challenges we're facing as far as scientific development and trying to reach out to get more people to understand science, in general, and in particular specific subjects like genetics which are going to have an increasingly - playing an increasingly large role in all our lives.",
        "The series on the books, the well-illustrated books on things work, were they influential on the drawings at all or the text or the narration?",
        "No, I don't think specifically.",
        "I mean, we're - both I Kevin and Zander are aware of those books, but there were other text - other - we should say other visual points of previous stories that I would get had a much larger impact on us.",
        "What offered - were the biggest hurdles, the biggest problems you had in tackling some of the material?",
        "When you're dealing with Iraq, for example, Secretary Rice's issues in Iraq are not identical to Don Rumsfeld's.",

        "And they also contribute to national intelligence activities.",

        "And if they're not functioning well, then it's very, very hard for John Negroponte to support the president.",
        "And I think that's what we've seen play out is the feeling that the CIA was not working as well as people wanted under Mr. Goss, so therefore he stepped down.",
        "And now they're sending in Negroponte's deputy to get the place up again.",
        "Well, what happens when you've got the CIA coming up with, as what happened before the Iraq war, a very different picture of weapons of mass destruction than, let's say, what the Pentagon found?",
        "Well, you know, part of the problem here is that we're not in the truth business in intelligence.",
        "We're dealing with approximate reality.",
        "And one of the reasons we have all of these agencies is that we recognize that it's very unlikely for one group of analysts to get the right answer all the time."
