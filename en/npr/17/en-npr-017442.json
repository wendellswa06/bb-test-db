        "And my hunch is that how you respond to this medium, comics as a learning tool, has a lot to do with whether or not you learn visually.",
        "I think and also a lot of people do learn that way, and my hunch is that will be the people that do learn that way will respond the strongest, the most positively to this type of a format.",

        "And my dad worked with Hal Foster doing the original \"\"Prince Valiant,\"\" et cetera, as an illustrator.",

        "Well, Hal Foster certainly was one of the - oh my gosh, he's - it's hard to imagine more than a handful of people in the comics medium there is more importance than he did.",
        "He kind of defined the adventure strip starting back, who in \"\"Tarzan\"\" even before \"\"Prince Valiant\"\" in 1929, we all stand in his large foot falls.",
        "But yeah, yeah, he was not only a great storyteller, he knew how to ground his stories in enough reality that the reader could accept what was happening when he would get to the more fantastic elements.",
        "And that's an important feature for storytelling of any type I think and does translate, I think, and what we try to do in \"\"The Stuff of Life\"\" in putting a narrative framework around the story to kind of draw the reader in and using that fictional framework to actually teach hard science to the reader.",

        "Have you got any reactions so far?",
        "The reaction so far has been through individuals who've been sent advance copies, and knock on wood, it's all been positive.",
        "I'm still waiting to get responses from, you know, the common Joe out there on the street who doesn't have necessarily a background or a specific interest in genetics and finding out if there's enough in this book to pull them in, to intrigue them."

        "Turning left here, it kind of gives you kind of an overview, off to the left, of the eastern half of the Grand Canyon.",
        "They figure these, how these two airliners collided at 21,000 feet, I think it was estimated to be like a 35-second freefall for both aircrafts, so it was quite a long time to be falling out of the sky.",
        "You can still see pieces of the aircraft glinting in the morning sun, pools of aluminum melted into the rock.",
        "But he says there's been a lot of improvement in airline safety in the past half-century, in fact much of it the result of this crash."
