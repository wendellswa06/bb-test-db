        "A lot of the equipment we're using in this airplane today was, the technology was developed through this particular accident that occurred in '56.",

        "He explains that back at the time of the crash, pilots were operating on rules written in the late '20s.",
        "They could choose to follow air traffic controls, or go off on their own.",
        "They had the option of going on visual flight rules and just going off the airways, pretty much on a straight line to where they wanted to go, which most airliners did to save time and fuel and everything else, and at that point it was just their responsibility to see and be seen.",
        "By the late '50s, Driscoll says those rules were antiquated.",
        "Planes were faster, and there were a lot more of them in the post-war years.",
        "In the Reader's Digest, for example, that was on sale the day of the crash, there was an article in there about traffic jam in the sky, talking about how there were so many airplanes and so many near misses, many per day, that something needed to be done.",
        "There were Presidential commissions, Congressional committees, a five-year plan to expand radar coverage, nothing that was going to happen fast.",

        "It caused them to realize that maybe the old Civil Aeronautics Administration was not doing what it was really intended to do, which is maintain the safety of aviation, and partly as a result of this accident, the passage of the Federal Aviation Act led to the creation of the Federal Aviation Administration.",
        "The new FAA, Waldock says, was given more autonomy and more funding.",
        "It also passed important new regulations.",
        "Pilots now fly where air traffic controllers tell them to fly.",
        "Dan Driscoll says the changes have relegated crashes like what occurred 50 years ago to the history books."
