        "Hmm.",
        "And in fact earthworms, you know, by making holes in the soil, accelerate the movement of water through the soil.",
        "And so in a certain way that's good, and it stimulates infiltration of water into the soil, but it also stimulates leeching of water through the soil profile and into the groundwater.",
        "So sometimes we might find actually more water-quality problems in gardens or in agricultural systems because earthworms are accelerating the way water and nutrients move through the system."

        "But so many forests - forests pretty much north of the glacial boundary, for the most part have no earthworms.",
        "So if you think about the glacial boundary runs from, say, central New Jersey across the middle of Pennsylvania and through Ohio and then to the West.",
        "Fifteen thousand years ago, all that area was covered by glaciers.",
        "And the glaciers - the hypothesis is that the glaciers killed the earthworms and eliminated all the native species of earthworms.",
        "And so when we go out now, we see large areas of the northern forest have no earthworms.",
        "And instead they have these very thick organic layers, organic forest floors that you mentioned before, and we have a lot of ideas about the importance of that organic layer in forest soils.",
        "It protects the soil from erosion.",
        "It's where the roots of trees grow.",
        "We have lots of valuable plants, say spring beauty and trillium and trout lily.",
        "They're all rooted in the forest floor.",
        "And there are lots of animals that live in the forest floor, in particular salamanders and a series of beetles and insects.",
        "And so for many years we studied these northern forest soils.",
        "We studied these organic horizons and the biodiversity associated with those, but then people started to notice that patches of the northern forest were colonized by earthworm species from Europe and from Asia, and they noticed that the forest floor would disappear.",
        "In a period of maybe three to five years, it would go from this thick organic carpet, and then all of a sudden that would be gone and you would have just bare mineral soil at the surface.",
        "And so people became very concerned about the loss of these ecosystem services that come from these forest soils.",
        "You mean all the leaves and the organic matter we walk on and trudge through happily through the forest would be sort of, like, missing?",
        "Yes!",
        "And again, people, you know, people probably don't pay enough attention to the soil, but enough people do that they noticed that this was a change.",
        "And then instead of seeing this carpet that you could pick up, you'd have a couple of leaves and then a lot of earthworm casts and then pretty much some bare soil.",
        "So people became concerned about are our forest soils going to be eroding, which is a huge problem in forests.",
        "And they also became concerned about the loss of some unique biodiversity in terms of these spring ephemeral plants.",
        "This time of year, people go out in the woods and they're all excited to see the trillium or the trout lily or the spring beauty bloom, and earthworms can be very tough on those.",
        "And then there are a variety of other ecosystem services that the soil provides related to - like, we hope that our forests are pulling carbon dioxide out of the air and then storing that carbon dioxide in the soil.",
        "And if the earthworms are churning up the soil, they're taking a lot of that carbon and putting it back in the atmosphere, and so there's an ecosystem service that is decreased by earthworms."
