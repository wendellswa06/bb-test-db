        "Wow.",
        "And we also want our forest to pull nitrogen out of the air and keep that nitrogen out of the groundwater or out of estuaries, and we have active research now to determine, if we have this earthworm invasion, does that also reduce that nitrogen ecosystem service.",
        "When you say an earthworm invasion, you're basically saying, if I hear you correctly, they're recovering from the last ice age.",
        "But so one of the most interesting findings from our work has been that, yes, the earthworms take those leaves and they mix some of it in with the soil, but they also eat a lot of those leaves and convert it to carbon dioxide and send it back to the atmosphere.",
        "Well that's a very good question because there are native species of earthworms in North America, but we don't see them.",
        "Rather, what we see are these European and Asian species.",
        "Even if you go south of the glacial boundary into areas where there are native North American species, for the most part those have been replaced by bigger, more aggressive European and Asian species.",
        "So wait, let me just stop you.",
        "So here in Central Park in New York, when I walk through the park and it's certainly a glacial - it was covered, as you all know, in the glacier, these are all non-native earthworms?",
        "They are, and some of them have been there for a long time.",
        "And actually some of the earliest work on earthworm invasions was done not in Central Park but in the Bronx in Van Cortlandt Park.",
        "Sure.",
        "There was a student at Rutgers who now works for the Forest Service, Rich Pouyat, who was doing his dissertation research on forests along an urban to rural gradient.",
        "And these were forests that were very similar, in similar trees, similar soils, but the forests in the city had extraordinary densities of earthworms in them.",
        "And so then he began to raise these questions about, well this is really changing the way these forests function.",
        "And some of these earthworms have been there for a long time.",
        "So the common nightcrawler, Lumbricus terrestris, which we probably all grew up with, that is a European species never found as a native species in North America."

        "Who brought these earthworms from Europe?",
        "Probably they came with settlers who brought plants that they wanted to grow, and also probably came in the ballast of ships, like many invasive species.",
        "When we have ships, you need something to balance the weight.",
        "But don't they drown in the water, earthworms?",
        "They come out in the water.",
        "Well, they do drown.",
        "They do drown in the water, so sometimes they used soil as ballast just to create weight.",
        "So let's just fill the hold of the ship with some dirt, and there were worms in there.",
        "So let me see if I understand this.",
        "You're not concerned about the foreign earthworms that were brought over.",

        "And based on what people know about their native range, they shouldn't be moving up into northern New York and in Minnesota and other places like that where we see them.",
        "And it is possible that if we're having warmer climate, that it is facilitating the invasion of these species, but they probably would be colonizing these soils.",

        "Peter?",
        "That's a great question, and it's actually one of our main research topics is exactly on the effects that earthworms have on organic matter or humus in the soil.",
        "I do have to mention, our work has been very generously funded by the National Science Foundation.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "And so what we've seen in these forests that are invaded by earthworms, they have less humus than forests without earthworms because it's almost like tilling the soil.",
        "You're mixing the organic matter, you're stimulating the microorganisms that are degrading the organic matter.",
        "And so we found that in the forests invaded by earthworms, they were losing - 25 percent of the organic matter in the surface soil was reduced.",
        "Dr.",

        "Pesticides have been known to kill earthworms accidentally in many settings.",
        "But there are many side effects of using pesticides, and I would suggest that probably we're not going to be applying pesticides to remove earthworms from forest soil.",
        "Could we bring in predators like robins or birds?",
        "So in - that's our current focus - one of the focuses of our current research is earthworms and their predation by salamanders, who are actually a very charismatic predator in the forest floor.",
        "Mostly, and this is I think common thinking in invasive-species management -it's very difficult to remove invasive species once they're well established from a system.",
        "It's hard to remove them without dramatic side effects.",
        "So we focus much more on preventing their spread.",
        "And there has been some really excellent work, in particular the group in Minnesota, this Minnesota Worm Watch group, which has been basically education and outreach to get people to be more careful with earthworms."
