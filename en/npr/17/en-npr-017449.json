        "I went briefly to acting school in England, Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Arts, and I noticed a lot of my friends going off to the Watney(ph) Rep and Leeds and wherever.",
        "However, having returned here and moved to Hollywood, I found myself stymied.",
        "I did all right with commercials and that sort of thing, but I think as far as developing a quality of acting, America just does not have it.",

        "In considering all these actors who do perform so wonderfully, it seems to me that English actors frequently value the word, the sentence, the context and manage to convey the precision of understanding and the value of those words and their meanings.",
        "And this enhances the acting and the reception by audiences here in America as much as anywhere else.",
        "That's one of the points you make in your piece, Jonathan Last.",
        "Certainly.",
        "And not just lack of opportunity, but lack of also the imperative to embrace those opportunities.",
        "The American, you know, dramatic industries are very much largely geared towards television in film, where over in England, actors and young actors are pushed and encouraged to embrace the stage.",
        "And many of the, you know, the top British actors that we were talking about are really stage actors who find time to do film work and TV work on the side, and those industries are also very different.",
        "Over in Britain, you have TV series which don't have that golden carrot of syndication hanging in front of them, pushing them to get to 100 episodes.",
        "You don't have $120-million movies that have to be big tent-pole science-fiction movies that'll play well across the globe in order to make enough money to sustain the studio.",
        "And so what you have is you get entertainments which are more geared towards writers, more geared towards actors, more geared towards human emotions, and these I think are all good things and things which help actors and writers and all the people who are really in it for the art and not just the ICM contracts.",

        "Absolutely.",

        "My comment is that it seems to me that in England or in the U.K., actors, are chosen on how well they act, whereas in the United States, they're chosen on how they look.",

        "They're beautiful, but that shouldn't matter, whether you're a good actor or not.",
        "And my question is at what stage of the process do people who are plain looking but could be good actors get eliminated?",

        "The commercialism aspect of Hollywood, you know, where we're constantly selling something - we're selling a magazine cover.",
        "We're selling an appearance on Regis and Kathy Lee, which is now no longer Kathy Lee - Regis and Kelly.",
        "There is so much commercialism to it and so much of an imperative to open big - you know, you've got to have a - you can't have movies which even grow over the course of weeks as they way they used to.",
        "You now have to have that big opening weekend, otherwise you're pushed out of screens, and you're doomed to DVD rentals.",
        "There's so much of that that it really does push to have people who are bankable people who are immediately attractive, and you don't get to have the great characters.",
        "I think, actually, Kathy Lee never left that show, just the same way McNeal never left Lehrer.",
