        "So we've got this new census data; white folks make up less than 50 percent of the population in America's 100 biggest cities for the first time in history, and the changes have been fueled by immigration and higher birth rates among African Americans and Hispanics.",
        "Do you think that this is a move towards the right direction of diversity for America?",
