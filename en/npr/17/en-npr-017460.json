        "Yeah, that's a big consideration, like, I always relish the opportunity to avoid having to wear a tails coat or a jacket just because it's restricting the - you know, playing bass is fairly physical, and so if I'm given the opportunity just to wear a button-down shirt and some jeans, I'm all for that.",
        "And I understand that you recently lost a lot of weight and that that affected the way you were dressing on casual Fridays?",

        "Yeah.",
        "What was the footwear you had issues with?",
        "I take some - I mean, unfortunately, I take some of my fashion cues - well, not unfortunately - but I take some of my fashion cues from my three-year-old, and so we do have matching Crocs and things like that that we will wear.",

        "And just quickly before we take a call, David, what was it like to have a stylist telling you what you should wear and what you shouldn't wear?",
        "Was it hard to let go of your old clothes?",
        "No.",
        "I mean, I definitely tried to be open-minded.",

        "I'm getting contacts with the musicians is great, but I guess I wonder what your fashion guy thinks about the idea of essentially marketing the orchestra.",
        "And maybe that's a little off topic but…",
        "I think it's also the part of it.",

        "You know, honestly, as long as the concert and the music and the artistic presentation is at the center of what we're doing, I'm very open to kind of exploring different ways to present that I think our organization is kind of positioned itself in a way to kind of be at the forefront of new ways of exploring those kind of things.",
