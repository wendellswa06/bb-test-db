        "And, you know, also, you know, when it comes to spending money or doing something like that, I have no problem spending $200 on bass strings, but seeing how much these jeans cost and how much the shirt cost and just the general price of fashion - I always think of it in terms of what would that get me in terms of instrumental equipment before I'm thinking about how I look, so that's - that's kind of my perspective on that.",
