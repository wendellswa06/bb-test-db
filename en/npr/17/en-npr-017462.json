        "Hi.",
        "Thank you.",
        "So how many people are we talking about?",
        "Well, the initial agreement is specifically for 110 Afghan nationals who are held at Guantanamo Bay.",
        "There are about another 350 Afghan nationals who are at Bagram, actually in Afghanistan, who likely will be transferred sometime over the next six months.",
        "The rest of the group--the Yemeni and the Saudi Arabian nationals--that discussion is still in progress, but we're talking about a total of about 360, 370 detainees.",
        "And so that is almost all of the people who are there.",
        "Well, it's a very large percentage.",
        "It would be about 70 percent of the population, which would leave about 150 or so actually in Guantanamo Bay.",
        "Now the military is expecting to hold some of these people for a very long time.",
        "They're preparing essentially for what would be considered long-term detentions in the United States.",

        "And do the countries have any choice in terms of taking them back or is the Bush administration just going to say, `Here, take them now and do with them what you will'?",
        "No, these are certainly a part of some intense negotiations.",
        "The arrangement with Afghanistan came only after President Karzai was really demanding that these Afghan nationals be sent back to Afghanistan, so that that government can detain them and deal with them.",
        "These discussions are centered both around the detention of these people so that they don't get back out on the battlefield, which is really the top concern of the United States.",
        "But secondly, the United States--they need the assurances essentially that these people will be watched after, they will be detained, they will be kept from the battlefield and that they will not be tortured.",
        "Well, I understand Afghanistan doesn't even have a prison yet to hold them.",
        "Josh, the practice of holding detainees indefinitely at Guantanamo has been criticized, as well as the conditions under which they've been kept.",
        "Was that the reason why the Bush administration has come up with this arrangement with Afghanistan and is pursuing a similar agreement with Saudi Arabia and Yemen?",
        "There has been a lot of pressure, both domestically and internationally about what is going on at Guantanamo Bay.",
        "I visited there not long ago, just a few weeks ago.",
        "It's a very professionally run facility.",
        "A lot of the concerns that people have stretch back a number of years when the facility was not as professional, not as sturdy and not really as much of a prison facility as it is today.",
        "There are a number of concerns about their treatment, a number of concerns about the legal status of those who are there.",
        "As you know, lawyers have been fighting the detention of some of the people who are held there in US federal courts.",
        "That has really delayed the prosecutorial process there.",
        "No one has actually been prosecuted for a crime who is being held there.",
        "These are all things that factor in.",
        "The United States has said for a very long time, however, that they do not want to be the world's jailer.",
        "The US officials don't want these people there indefinitely.",
        "They want them to go back to their home countries under the watchful eye of coalition partners."

        "And yet I scored pretty strong on associating positive terms with whites and negative terms with blacks.",
        "That is, the way the test works is you, in the first step, you sort black and white faces by European-American or African-American - is the two categories -easy to do.",
        "Then you associate positive words and negative words with two different categories, good and bad, and that's easy to do.",
        "Then, in the third part of the test, they lump African-American/good and European-American/bad, and you have to then sort a sequence of black and white faces or good and bad words into those categories.",
        "And that takes a little bit longer.",
        "You can tell it's slower because it's slightly more cognitively complex.",
        "But then the fourth part of the test is the real part of the test.",
        "That is, they flip the categories such that you have European-American/good and African-American/bad.",
        "That goes noticeably faster, at least it did for me.",
        "In fact, it turns out for three-quarters of all whites and Asians, sorting names and positive words with European American/good and African-American/bad is much faster than African-American/good and European-American/bad.",
        "I mean, I noticed it just taking the test.",
        "I could tell I was much faster sorting good words with European-American, and I found it very disturbing.",
