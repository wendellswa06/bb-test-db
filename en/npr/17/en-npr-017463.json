        "I felt that I had the strength to lead this fight in such a tormented time of our history.",

        "(Speaking French).",
        "I will assemble a new team,\"\" he said in this speech last year, \"\"and promise to listen to everyone for what is needed for a better France.\"\" Sarkozy lost his 2012 bid for re-election to current Socialist President Francois Hollande, who is now facing record-low popularity ratings.",
        "As leader of the center-right Republicans of France, Sarkozy has been an outspoken critic of Hollande.",
        "Brice Teinturier is with the the French polling institute.",
        "(Speaking French).",
        "His campaign could just be a repeat of his 2011 campaign,\"\" he says, \"\"about identity and immigration issues, which undeniably worry the French.",
        "If that's it, he will only perpetuate the Nicolas Sarkozy the French know.\"\" For both Hollande's Socialists and Sarkozy's Republicans, the shared enemy is certain - Marine Le Pen's ultra-conservative, extreme right National Front, which after recent terror attacks in France is only gaining in popularity.",

        "And this week the winners of this year's prizes in physiology or medicine, physics and chemistry were announced.",
        "Recognized this year are scientists who showed that a bacterium--not stress, not stress--causes ulcers; scientists who explained how a laser works and used that information to make very precise optical measurements; scientists who discovered a more efficient way to synthesize some chemical compounds found in things as diverse as medicines, plastics, state-of-the-art baseball bats--I worked in baseball there somehow.",

        "That is, you can purposely go slower when you're sorting good words with European-American/good, for example.",
        "But if you're just trying to honestly take the test and do the best you can, three-quarters of whites and Asians have that association, and even half of African-Americans have that association: European-American/good, African-American/bad.",
        "So, although we have, I think, an evolutionary tendency to sort people into within-group, out-group, culture is so powerful, particularly in America, that is has driven even members of minority groups to associate good and bad with these same groupings that everybody else does.",

        "You go on to note that the Harvard test also demonstrates we prefer old to young, thin to fat, straight to gay, and such associations as family females and career males, liberal-arts females and science males.",
        "Such associations bubble just below the surface, inhibited by cultural restraints but susceptible to eruption under extreme inebriation or duress.",

        "I think, you know, if we're honest with ourselves, what do we talk about when we're just amongst our friends.",
        "And so, for example, a lot of my white conservative friends, they do complain about affirmative action or blacks have unfair advantages here or there.",
        "Now, none of us would ever say this publicly, but a lot of those associations are there in a negative way, and I think when we - I think it's a little bit disingenuous to jump all over people like Michael Richards or Mel Gibson and act like we're shocked, like we can't believe anybody would think that.",
        "Well, we know people think it.",
        "What's shocking is anybody would say it, but again, under extreme duress, losing your temper, alcohol, something like that, it does come out.",
        "And I think rather than berating these guys, we should take a deeper look at our culture and say why is that?",
        "Why are those associations - 50 years after the civil rights movement - why do we still have those associations?",
        "It's kind of upsetting in a way, but on another hand, it's a good excuse to look at it again.",

        "If the venom spewed by both Michael Richards and Mel Gibson does not necessarily make them racist, what actually does make someone a racist?",

        "In other words, are only clan members racists and everyone else just careless with language?",
        "I've always believed that a person's words and deeds were a reflection of their hearts, whether high on drugs, drunk on alcohol or, as in this case, being heckled by rude men who happened to be black.",
        "Am I naive?",
        "That's a good point.",
        "What's not clear from the implicit association test is whether people that hold these, act out on those thoughts.",
        "I mean, again, what I'm claiming, what I'm arguing, is that most of us have these implicit associations of black and white, and good and bad.",
        "But 99 percent of the time, most of us never express it, and our behaviors don't reflect it, and we all just get along, as Rodney King said.",
        "Most of the time it works just fine.",
        "But subtly, it's still there - what this test is tapping into is some new research on consciousness and unconsciousness.",
        "That is, most of our conscious processing goes on at a very superficial level.",
        "Whereas most of what we're thinking about, and processing of information, goes on at a subconscious level, that you're not even aware of it.",
        "That is, feelings and thought you have about members of the opposite sex or political associations or social attitudes, that we're not really aware of what we're actually thinking, and occasionally it leaks out.",
        "And it's that - that's hard to tap into.",
        "I mean, ever since Freud, we've been trying to tap into this unconscious.",
        "And what this test is - the implicit association test - is it's trying to tap into it.",
        "I should say, parenthetically, it's not without its critics.",
        "It's not clear that just because I'm faster at associating European-American with good words means that I think negatively about African-Americans.",
        "It may just be that I think more positively about European-Americans, and I think positively about everybody.",
        "So it's not clear that the association test - what exactly it's tapping, other than there are these unconscious associations.",
        "We'll put a link to that test up on our Web site.",
        "It should be there in a couple of hours, and you can try it yourself.",

        "And I think the differentiation for me, personally -being a young, white, Jewish woman living in the heart of Oakland, California -is there are very defined opinions that I have on, say, illegal immigrants coming in from Mexico versus black, versus the Asian culture here.",
        "But being racist, for me personally, is not an issue.",
        "I think I definitely have my opinions that could be considered prejudiced, but definitely not racist.",
        "Yeah, it's a good distinction to make between prejudice and racism, and whether we act on those subtle, unconscious, implicit associations that we have.",
        "I mean, as long as you don't act on it, I suppose - socially or economically or politically - it doesn't really matter.",
        "But in fact, the concern is that those subtle associations do come out, even when you're not aware of it.",
