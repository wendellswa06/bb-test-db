        "There's been no ISIS penetration of CIA or the U.S.",

        "They haven't recruited spies inside of CIA or NSA.",
        "The Russians, on the other hand, have.",

        "In an apparent reversal of policy, the Federal Communications Commission said on Tuesday, that profanity is sometimes acceptable on the airwaves - if it's uttered in what the FCC deems a news program.",
        "Its original ruling in March involved a contestant on the CBS program Survivor who used a vulgar term to describe another contestant.",
        "That came during an interview on the CBS News Early Show.",
        "At the time, the commission found the incident breached standards of decency.",
        "A court sent the case back to the FCC, which then reversed itself.",
        "The commission also dismissed complaints against an episode of NYPD Blue on ABC but upheld rulings against Fox TV, much of which seems to raise more questions than answers.",
        "Joining us now to help explain what this means for broadcasters and for listeners and viewers is FCC Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein.",
        "Commissioner, nice to have you back on the program.",
        "Thanks for having me back.",
        "And could you help us decipher this weeks rulings?",
        "What can be said on the air and what can't?",
        "Well, I have to admit that it's not all that clear from this decision.",
        "I actually dissented in part, and I didn't agree with some of the reasoning in it because I don't think it makes it that clear."

        "Let's take the example of the news show that you talked about.",
        "On the one hand, the initial decision was that this certain word, that begins with bull, was not appropriate.",
        "It was illegal because it was indecent and profane, and then the decision was reversed because oh, we suddenly realized it was on a news show.",
        "But the first time around, the decision actually said that it was shocking particular during a morning news interview.",
        "The second time around, they said it's not because it's news.",
        "Now wait a minute.",
        "I think that's a bit stretching of the definition of news to say that a cross-promotion of the Survivor show on CBS, which also aired that morning show, is somehow news.",
        "It's as if we can create a reality program, an artificial world if you will, and somehow news that takes place in that artificial world is considered news for purposes of the FCC.",

        "Work by Ayelet Fishbach at the University of Chicago, along with Yanping Tu and Alex Shaw, show that when you buy gifts for close friends, you often think of the other person and yourself as a unit.",
        "So you often end up buying gifts that benefit the both of you and not just the other person.",

        "Wait a minute.",
        "Her husband buys a coffee machine, she doesn't drink coffee at all, but somehow he thought that this was a loving gift to her.",
        "So here's the thing, David.",
        "When we see such behavior, we often assume the person's just being selfish.",
        "But in a series of experiments, Fishbach and her colleagues show this is not the case.",

        "Now...",
        "Clearly I would give the hour-long massage to my wife.",
        "Well, but in this case, the point to keep in mind is that collectively, you're getting an hour and 15 minutes of massage, which is more than an hour's worth of massage.",
        "What Fishbach and her colleagues are finding is that regardless of who gets the hour and who gets the 15 minutes, people will choose this option when they're thinking about getting a gift like this for a loved one because they say in some cases, my loved one might give up 15 minutes so I get an extra half hour.",
        "In other cases, they say, I might give up 15 minutes so my loved one can get a half hour.",
        "Either way, the unit comes out ahead.",
        "The partnership is like maybe you'll sacrifice for me, maybe I'll sacrifice for you, but the greater good is benefiting.",

        "(Laughter) I think that's right, David.",
        "I think one of the implications of this work is that you have to be cautious about the kind of gifts you buy, especially because this kind of gift-giving can spring from the best of intentions.",
        "Here's Fishbach again.",
        "It might useful to be aware that by thinking about the total benefit, by thinking what we get from the gift, you are not really mainly thinking about yourself.",
        "So to say it in other words, I would say beware of selfish gifts.",
        "The other thing to bear in mind, David, is if this ever happens to you and your wife and your wife gives you the 15-minute massage and keeps the hour-long massage for herself, you might want to say this actually springs from love and not from selfishness.",
        "So when I gave my wife a Pittsburgh Steelers jersey - and I'm the Steelers fan, not her - she might have thought that it was generous on my part, not selfish.",
