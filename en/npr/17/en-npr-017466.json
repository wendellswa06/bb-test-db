        "You can look at it as a wave but you can also look at it as a particle, as a photon.",
        "And the mathematics that explained the behavior of photons wasn't very well explained.",
        "And, in fact, people were making things using the quantum properties of light, such as lasers, before they really understood all about it.",
        "And so really that's--the other part this award went to John Hall at the University of Colorado, and he's also at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, and Theodor Hansch at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics outside of Munich.",
        "And they used some of these quantum optical properties of lasers to develop techniques for measuring, as you said, very precise measurements of things...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...like distances and speeds or differences in speeds of things.",
        "And why is it important that we know these very precise things?",
        "Well, you know, again, the practical applications--you know, we reporters are always hammering on Nobel Prize winners to say, `What's this going to be useful for?'",
        "Right.",
        "And they scratched their heads a little bit on this one.",
        "Presumably, it will be very useful for a better understanding, for example, of things inside the atom, where you want to get precise measurements.",
        "But the Nobel Committee suggested that one of the things that might be useful is--let's say you're going on an intergalactic voyage and you want to know exactly if you're headed in the right direction.",
        "Well, if you're off by a few millimeters right here around the orbit of Earth, that can translate into being--missing your target by millions of miles...",
        "Right.",
        "...when you get there, right, because of, you know, the fantastic differences.",
        "These little differences in angle make a big difference.",
        "So presumably, if you can measure something very accurately, you'll get to where you want to be going in an intergalactic trip.",
        "Or, you know, global positioning satellites...",
        "Right."

        "Tell us about the chemistry prize.",
        "Well, chemistry went to three people.",
        "This was Yves Chauvin, who is retired from the French Petroleum Institute, and then two Americans, Robert Grubbs and Richard Schrock.",
        "Grubbs is at Caltech and Schrock is at MIT in Cambridge.",
        "And basically, yes, I think you said in your introduction they found a way of making a reaction take place that nobody thought would really actually take place.",
        "And I'm going to say the name of the reaction--it's olefin metathesis--and then I'm not going to say that again either because, like quantum optics, it's a little bit, as they used to say, beyond the scope of this course.",

        "Right.",
        "Something.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But basically, once again, so here we go.",
        "Carbon molecules form bonds with other molecules but they also form bonds with themselves, and these are sometimes known as carbon-carbon double bonds.",
        "And there can be molecules hanging off either end of one of these carbon-carbon double bonds, and you sometimes want them to change places because when they change places, the molecule develops different personality, different physical characteristics.",
        "And it was thought that it was too hard to get these things to metathesize, or change places, but Yves Chauvin discovered that you could under the right circumstances.",
        "And it was one of those observations that kind of got overlooked for a number of years...",
        "Yeah.",
        "Right."

        "...Harold Varmus or somebody like that...",
        "Right.",
        "But, well, you know, it varies.",
        "But then again, how many of them got their inspiration driving down--what was it, Route 1 in--I mean...",
        "...and then it was sort of rediscovered.",
        "And first Schrock and then apparently, more importantly, Grubbs found other things that would catalyze this reaction, make it go more efficiently, more smoothly, and it has really, they say, revolutionized organic synthesis 'cause you can make lots and lots of compounds without a lot of energy; you can do it at room temperature in a very convenient way for organic chemists.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And once again, one of the winners is using this method to make new material for baseball bats, bringing baseball into this.",
        "Well, yeah, I--again, so--well, so I was interviewing--in one of these amazing things--so Robert Grubbs, you know--the question somebody just asked me from Caltech, how did I find him, because--actually, I didn't, my editor, Alison Richards, was helping me track down people right after the prize was announced, and she got a number, a home number, from Grubbs, who lives in South Pasadena, I think, and called there.",
        "And apparently his son answered the phone and his son said, `He's in New Zealand.",
        "And so he gave her the number in New Zealand.",
        "So I call him in New Zealand and he was, of course, very pleased and flattered and we had a little conversation.",
        "And I said to him, `OK, now that you've explained this to me, can you give me a specific example?",
        "And he said, `Well, there are pharmaceuticals and there are new materials.",
        "And I said, `Well, like, what kind of new materials?",
        "And he said, `Well, it's not a very important part, but it's a baseball bat.",
        "And I said, `Oh, great.",
        "Tell me more about that,' because now we're in a place that I understand, you know what I mean?",
        "Right.",
        "We've come down from organic chemistry synthesis to baseball which, as you know, I'm a little better at.",
        "So he said it turns out that this company that he formed, called Materia, is working with a company that makes baseball bats, and it's a new kind of hardening thing so the bat won't shatter, and they've got some other things that they're putting into the handle to make it more resilient.",
        "So it's just an interesting thing.",
        "But these are the examples of the kind of compounds that you might have made before but you might not have, and now you can fairly easily.",
