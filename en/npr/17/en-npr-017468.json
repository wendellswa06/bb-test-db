        "How are they technically defined in this context?",
        "Well, there isn't a set legal definition here.",
        "This is more of a label.",
        "It's sort of political marketing.",
        "Both sides use this phrase.",
        "It generally describes places where the local officials are perceived to be shielding people who are in the country illegally.",
        "In practice, that can mean everything from the very street level, where cops are just told not to ask people about their immigration status, all the way up to official policies at the county jails, where they refuse to honor requests from the federal immigration authorities to hold people who are suspected of being in the country illegally.",
        "Those are called detainer requests.",
        "And that's what was at issue in Miami-Dade.",
        "The jail there had stopped honoring those requests a few years ago.",
        "Now the mayor there told them to go back and honor those requests and hold those people until federal authorities can come get them.",
        "So when we look at what kind of definition of sanctuary city the Trump administration is planning to use, do you think that that's it - failure to honor detainer requests?",
        "It might go beyond that.",
        "This executive order gives the Secretary of Homeland Security the discretion to designate which jurisdictions are sanctuaries.",
        "And the order focuses on this 1996 federal law which forbids local officials from putting gag orders on jails and on police departments when it comes to people's immigration status.",
        "Basically, the law says you can't hide information you have about people's immigration status.",
        "The Trump administration seems to think a lot of places are clearly violating that law, but some legal experts I've talked to say that's going to be hard to prove because a lot of these places are purposely not collecting that information about immigration status.",
        "So if that's the case, they can't be accused of withholding that information."

        "And instead of revisiting that and reconsidering that, we go back to the court and ask them to let us review these other decisions that came up years later because we weren't sure we got them right.",
        "So I'm not sure that we're doing our job and properly giving the guidance that we need to give to broadcasters and reviewing our own precedents.",
        "All of these cases build on that Golden Globe case, and yet we haven't even bothered to give them the decency of responding to them on their petition for reconsideration.",
        "This comes in a larger context.",
        "I mean, broadcasters are appealing to the FCC and in other venues, too, to say, you know, give us some clear rules here.",

        "Well, is there some fear of lawsuits from broadcasters going on here?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think a lot of this has to do with litigation strategy as opposed to a serious effort to come to grips with what the limits of the First Amendment are.",
        "We are only taking those cases we think we can win on, we're somehow avoiding this Golden Globe case, which is the basis of everything else.",
        "And then rather than coming to grips with, you know, the use of the language in the Early Show, we say oh, I guess a little cross-promotion here is a news show.",
        "So we didn't think about that before.",
        "As a matter of fact, before, we said that because it's news, it's even more shocking, and now we say there's a news exemption.",
        "Don't get me wrong, I think there should be a news exemption.",
        "I think we should be giving more deference to true, legitimate news.",

        "Obviously, you're not going to get something, you know, 10 laws in stone that are going to satisfy everybody, but clarity would seem to be really at issue here.",

        "It's not so easy to draw these lines.",
        "We always say that the context matters.",
        "Some people criticize us, I think appropriately so, for not really caring about context, but look at the CBS example.",
        "I mean, we say that the context is this is a news show, which is a perfectly legitimate kind of contextual question to ask, saying that you can use language.",
        "For example, a precedent from the FCC: John Gotti used some very colorful language once.",
        "On ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, as it happened.",
        "That's right.",
