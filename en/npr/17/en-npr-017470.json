        "National security adviser Susan Rice said cyber hacking is an economic and national security concern to the U.S.",

        "He'll also likely press Xi about his handling of China's economy, the second-largest in the world.",

        "Barry Friedman's a constitutional law scholar at NYU.",
        "He specializes in policing.",
        "And he says the feds can't require local cops to do this because federal and local authorities operate in what he calls different spheres.",
        "Each is free to go about its business in its own sphere, not interfering with the other.",
        "And it's kind of a noninterference rule that we have, which, again, doesn't mean that there isn't cooperation.",
        "There's very often cooperation, but the cooperation is voluntary.",
        "And I should note here that this is really very American.",
        "In other Western countries, national governments have a lot more power to compel cooperation from the local police, and cops often do help with immigration enforcement.",
        "In our system, the president's leverage is really just money.",
        "And that's why the Trump administration is threatening to cut funding.",
        "Federal funding comes to cities in so many different ways.",
        "When we talk about cutting off funding to a sanctuary city, what kind of money is at stake here?",
        "Well, we really don't know yet.",
        "There's another legal problem here for the Trump administration.",
        "The courts have generally found that the federal government can't just penalize, can't be coercive to local cities and states when it comes to withdrawing money.",
        "They can't use it as a bludgeon.",
        "So what the Trump administration may do is be more targeted - say, cut money related to this, say, for police programs or for courts - that kind of thing."

        "And there, a slight majority - 52 percent - said they thought that local police should have an active role in helping to identify people who are in the country illegally.",
        "But really what they want is flexibility.",
        "When I talk to cops even in some of the sanctuary cities, they say they don't want to be dragooned into enforcing federal immigration law, but they also still want to keep the option of calling in immigration enforcement on people who are serious offenders or violent criminals.",
        "So what they're worried about now is that with this line in the sand being drawn between their cities and the Trump administration, they may lose that flexibility.",
