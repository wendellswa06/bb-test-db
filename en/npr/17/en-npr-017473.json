        "And it actually said, celebrating 25 years of open European borders.",
        "So they got on this train, believing it was going to Germany, and it only went about 20 miles to the West.",

        "Yeah, It did.",
        "It stopped in the middle of nowhere, and they've been sitting here all day long in these cramped train cars in the heat and now in the darkness.",
        "And even though you've described the train, I'm assuming it was still a Hungarian train.",
        "This was a Hungarian decision to stop at the town.",
        "It was a Hungarian train, and the Hungarian passengers - I wasn't here yet - were taken off this train and allowed to board other trains.",
        "But the migrants were then told they were being taken to a camp, and that's when they rebelled.",
        "One father even laid on the tracks, and he said, I will not go.",
        "He was arrested and then, they were allowed to go back into the train, and they've been sitting here all day.",
        "And they refuse to get off.",
        "As you said, though, you can actually see these people inside the train that's standing still at the station.",

        "There's got to be some relief from the temperature, but I don't - at one point, the police brought out water, and they threw it back.",
        "The man said - the man who came out - he said it could have been drugged.",
        "Water has been brought out again by some NGO workers, some humanitarian workers, but they haven't had much to eat.",
        "And what did the Hungarian authorities say about all this?",
        "So, Robert, today, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, spoke, And he said that Europe had no plan to deal with these migrants, but he was not going to let them come marching through Europe.",
        "He said they've threatened the Christian roots of Europe.",
        "And you know, Hungary has built this razor-wire fence on its border with Serbia.",
        "He said he would extend that fence and even send the Army down to the border to keep these migrants from coming in.",
        "Yet, it's very confusing because he doesn't want to seem to let them leave Hungary, either."
