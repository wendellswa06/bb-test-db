        "They are the most diverse generation to date.",

        "So in Las Vegas, I met a number of people who were living at home.",

        "They were helping provide financially for their parents as well, and it was a community lifestyle.",
        "And I think that's kind of normal for a lot of immigrant families, both the Asian and Latino.",

        "Under the Minsk peace plan though, Ukraine won't regain control of its border with Russia until the end of the year at the earliest, and that's only if all sides implement the agreement.",
        "Zannier is hoping that at least the OSCE can keep an eye on the border in the meantime.",

        "So we'll - at least we'll be able to see better what is going on there.",
        "He says the peace plan reached in Minsk also left some ambiguity when it came to the railway hub of Debaltseve, where Ukrainian troops suffered a humiliating defeat after the cease-fire went into effect.",
        "Zannier calls that a clear violation of the cease-fire by the separatists and says it's hard to tell where the conflict goes from here."
