        "And I can barely lift it myself.",
        "On top of that, most patients who stay in hospitals are sicker than they were 20 years ago.",
        "That's because hospitals are treating as many people as they can in outpatient clinics.",
        "And they're saving inpatient beds for more serious cases.",
