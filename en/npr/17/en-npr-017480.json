        "The Iranian leadership is not really rational.",
        "They're crazy.",
        "They can't be deterred.",
        "And the problem with that is, it simply does not conform with the record of this regime's behavior.",
        "This regime, like many other regimes, is overwhelmingly concerned with preserving their power and their existence in this world - not in some after-life driven by a religious ideology.",
        "The more sophisticated form of the argument that you hear more from policy analysts rather than politicians is that no, the Iranian regime is not a bunch of crazies, but the mere possession of a nuclear weapon would affect their behavior.",

        "Anytime any state that did not have nuclear weapons acquires them, it is a blow against the global nonproliferation regime.",
        "But there are a couple of historical factors we ought to keep in mind.",
        "One is, ever since President John Kennedy - news back during his presidency, about how we could have as many as 25 nuclear-weapon states by the 1970s, many of the estimates of the pace of nuclear proliferation - just like estimates of the pace of the Iranian program - have been overestimates.",
        "Another thing to bear in mind is, given the sorts of rivalries that you mentioned in the Persian Gulf region, and given the oil resources that countries like Saudi Arabia have, the question arises: Why haven't they already taken that step?",
        "You conclude that - and I'm just quoting here - it's not clear that any of this, any of these problems we've been discussing, would cause substantial and direct damage to U.S.",
        "interests.",
        "But then there is the question: Would an Iranian bomb prove to be an existential threat to Israel - which is what Israeli officials say.",
        "Some Israeli officials say that.",
        "Other explicitly deny it.",
        "In fact, a former head of Mossad, Efrain Halevy, and the current head of the service, Tamir Pardo, according to reports, have explicitly denied that it would oppose an existential threat to Israel.",
        "And it's easy to see why.",
        "Israel will maintain overwhelming military superiority against Iran, and it would be absolutely suicidal for any Iranian leader to do the nightmare thing of heaving a nuke at Tel Aviv."

        "The economic consequences are literally incalculable, but no doubt would be immense.",
        "And then there are hosts of other consequences.",
        "Internally, in Iran, this would no doubt lead the Iranians to make that decision they don't seem to have made yet, which is to move full speed ahead and try to make a bomb.",

        "Why do you think that there are so many people across the political spectrum who are willing to entertain the thought of military action here?",
        "Number one: The Iranian regime is a loathsome regime, but that evades the issue of what difference a nuclear weapon would make.",
        "I think the fact that we're hearing a surge of commentary and debate about this has much less to do with anything the Iranians are doing in their program.",
