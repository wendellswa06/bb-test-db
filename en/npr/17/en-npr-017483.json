        "Walking through the refrigerated warehouse, he points out crates upon crates of Arla's Lurpac(ph) brand butter, wrapped in gold foil with a small red and white Danish flag in the corner of the label.",
        "Larnsen says before the cartoon controversy, this butter used to make up 60 percent of the entire market in the Persian Gulf.",

        "Fin Hansen(ph) is the managing director of Arla's international operation.",
        "He says until now being a Danish company operating in the Middle East was a good thing.",
        "Took us 40 years to build up to this position, but with this amazing force, I call it a tsunami of consumer boycott, it only took us five days to be removed from all the shops in the region.",
        "Our business has come to a total standstill.",
        "Despite the drastic impact on a handful of exports firms like Arla, economists say the overall impact of the boycott on the Danish economy will be small.",

        "We have now lost that.",
        "Sidenfadden says the cartoon controversy has exploded in large part because of a growing anti-Islamic xenophobia in Denmark reflected in stricter immigration laws and tougher citizenship requirements that he says target Muslims.",
        "After the cartoons were initially published, a group of 11 ambassadors to Denmark, from mostly Muslim countries, asked for a meeting with the Prime Minister, who declined.",
        "After that a group of Islamic clerics distributed the cartoons throughout Muslim countries, characterizing Denmark as an enemy of Islam and sparking violent protests.",
        "Sidenfadden says that could have been prevented.",

        "Soren Saunderguard(ph) is a spokesman for the Danish People's Party, the parliamentary partner of the current government.",
        "He defends the illustrations of Muhammad, and says the current controversy reflects a more systemic cultural threat.",
        "We believe that this is not about 12 cartoons in a Danish paper.",
        "We believe this is about a fight against an Islamic-dominated Muslim world and against our natural liberty and freedom values.",
        "The Danish public has been in a state of shock over the controversy and the global response.",
        "And while many say the decision to print the cartoons was a mistake, the attacks on Danish embassies and hate speech against Danes has made them feel like the real victims of the crisis.",
