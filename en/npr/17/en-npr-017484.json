        "Well, I think it needs to be reformed, but these provisions that expire every year are simply part of the fiscal fraud that the Congress is perpetrating on the American people.",
        "We have the tax code booby trap with provisions that expire every year or every other year even though when we get to the midnight hour of expiration, like we did this week, there's a panic move to extend them one more time and another time and another time.",

        "Yeah.",

        "First of all, I thought that comment was exceedingly cynical and inappropriate and almost shameless, really.",
        "And secondly, if that's what the political class of people who inhabit Washington these days, and he's, you know, emblematic of that, if that's the way they think, our country is in very bad trouble because that is just a form of political hardball that unfortunately has become par for the course.",
        "So, should all loopholes, all of these credits and so on just be eliminated, and should we have standard percentage rates or progressive percentage rates for our tax system?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, you know, every 10 or 15 or 20 years, we try to have a purge of all these loopholes, and we did have a big reform in 1986.",
        "And a lot of the loopholes were closed, and that made for a better tax system.",
        "But now, here we are 25 years later and all of the loopholes have cropped up again and re-insinuated themselves into the tax code, so we're going to have to have another House cleaning.",
        "But, you know, I think beyond that, we are going to need another source of revenue in this country, not just the income tax.",
        "If we try to obtain from the income tax the higher revenue we need to get our fiscal house in order, it's going to only encourage the lobby forces and the interest groups to try to come through the backdoor with loopholes to reduce the impact of higher rates.",
        "So I think we need some kind of consumption tax, and frankly, we should put a transaction tax on Wall Street as well.",
        "We could generate significant amounts of revenue with no harm to the economy because essentially in the stock market today, a lot of the trading is just two computer systems trading with each other.",
        "A lot of people say they back tax reform.",
        "President Obama has started to talk about this, saying that next year, he hopes to start to tackle this problem.",
        "Why is it so hard to achieve?",
        "It's hard to achieve because the general taxpayer is busy every day taking care of his own needs, his family, his job.",
        "And he doesn't have time to lobby for a broad tax base and reasonable rates.",
        "On the other hand, every special interest group has an economic interest in raising money through some kind of political action committee or education fund and then lobby for targeted, narrowly focused, sometimes even obscure language that they get either into the tax code on Capitol Hill or into the regulation.",
        "So there's a kind of an asymmetry of democracy, which there is no clean answer to.",
        "So until we really change the role of money in politics, I don't know that we'll ever address the question you raised.",
        "That's David Stockman.",
        "He was the director of the White House Budget Office under president Ronald Reagan and is widely credited as the architect of Reaganomics.",
