        "He said he didn't think the number of feigned fouls or injuries is on the rise, but he says their importance is.",
        "Soccer, in particular, in this World Cup, with less than 2.3 goals scored per game, players are looking for that extra edge, and as a consequence, players are hitting the ground, whether it be in the penalty area where the referee has to award a penalty kick or, what we call, in the red zone or danger zone, an area around the - about 30 to 35 yards out from the goal mouth where a set play or free kick 30 percent of the time leads to a goal."

        "The second thing you look at as a referee is the score.",
        "If the score's 0-0 or 1-0 and your team is losing, what will happen?",
        "Players will try to simulate fouls in order to get the referee to blow his whistle.",
        "A third factor is the ball.",
        "Often times, Debbie, the attacker will have the ball and he'll push the ball too far in front of him, which means that the ball is going to end up going out of bounds or a defenders going to win the ball on the other side.",
        "And when the attacker sees that, the attacker thinks, hey, I'm not going to get the ball.",
        "I might as will hit the ground myself, try to get a free kick or penalty kick because the end result is going to be negative in the first place.",
        "And then the fourth item, often times, we as referees look for is the attacker's feet.",
        "And you'll often times look at the replays, see the attacker will bring his feet together or drag the toes in the turf in order to facilitate their going to the ground.",
        "And then finally you'll see the forward or the attacker fall on the ground.",
        "And as they hit the ground what's the first thing they do?",

        "On more than 100 occasions when signing a bill into law, President Bush has also issued a statement explaining how he interprets that new law.",
        "Typically, the statement includes the line: The executive branch shall construe such provisions in a manner consistent with the president's constitutional authority.",
        "For example, the president recently included such a line when he signed the bill containing a ban on torture of detainees and prisoners in the war on terrorism.",

        "The Supreme Court could wind up ruling on the constitutional elements of these questions, so the interpretation and significance of signing statements has become an issue in the confirmation battle over Judge Samuel Alito.",
