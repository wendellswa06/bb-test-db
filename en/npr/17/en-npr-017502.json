        "John Calambokidis is a research biologist in Washington.",

        "Right now, the gray whale population is healthy.",
        "It's recovered to 27,000 since whalers hunted them nearly to extinction.",
        "Calambokidis says it's starting to look like that's as many as the whales' habitat can support.",
        "He says when the whales were feeding in the Arctic last summer, it looks like it may have been a bad year for their prey.",
        "Researchers are looking at whether the whale deaths are a natural result of more animals competing for food in a limited area or if it could relate to climate change - things like warming ocean temperatures and less sea ice in the whale's feeding grounds.",
        "Michael Milstein, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says his agency is paying closer attention to annual summer surveys of the gray whales' feeding patterns.",
        "The scientists that do those surveys are going back through their records and trying to understand if there was something unusual about when and where the whales were feeding.",
        "Scientists can also get useful data from dead whales if they wash up on shore, like this one near Anchorage.",
        "Burek, the veterinary pathologist, has finally gotten under the layer of blubber and into the whale's abdomen, which is swollen with gas and liquid.",
