        "Can you reconstruct blood vessels this way?",
        "Well, actually, the Yale University has started to - a clinical trial approved by the FDA using tissue (unintelligible) in children.",
        "So the answer would be yes.",
        "And just to understand more completely, this is a - the trachea is - it has a microfiber backbone to it, on top of which you have permeated with stem cells.",
        "And the stem cells have been coaxed into becoming tracheal cells?",
        "Exactly.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And then they have now totally covered and taken over on top of this structure of plastic?",
        "They have now become sort of a living organism?",
        "Yes, sir.",
        "Wow.",
        "And you did this all - it all happened within just a matter of a few weeks?",
        "Well, usually - again, depending on the degree of difficulty of the three dimensional aspect of the tissue, you can produce a trachea, for instance, just the tube, in two days.",
        "And a bifurcated trachea in 10 days.",
        "So now - then you need two days for getting the cells, reseeding the grafts, or in two weeks you have an entire trachea.",
        "And perhaps you might extend your work further, because you deal in this and possibly into the lungs.",
        "Well, ideally, yes.",
        "But to me my dream would be another one.",
        "It would be rather than replacing the lung or replacing the heart, you use cell therapy to treat these organs before they ultimately do not work anymore.",
        "so rather than doing a transplantation, just when we have the first signs of insufficiency, whether to treat these organs with the patient's stem cells, probably targeting the defect that they have, so prolonging and extending their life."

        "So if you have untreatable tumors, for example, within the patient, you might be able to instead of putting a new part in put the stem cells in and they would grow to replace that?",
        "Well, I don't think that this is so easy.",
        "We first need to be very cautious to identify so-called cancer stem cells, because within the cancer you have cells that do proliferate forever and have many of the aspects of undifferentiated and ever proliferating stem cells.",
        "So whether we could target these cells to block the growth and eventually treat cancer, this is very, very early.",
        "So what makes your technique so revolutionary?",
        "Well, the fact that, first of all, in six months we've had three - we were able to treat 31 and 30 years respectively, young gentlemen that had a tumor of the trachea and they're still alive.",
        "So the revolution is there, because there wouldn't be any other treatment options.",
        "And the second revolution is that (unintelligible) is too much, but a new thing is that we were able to – we saw in the blood of the patient's stem cells that as soon as the (unintelligible) transplant, were already expressing the profile of respiratory cells.",
        "So they were recruited from the preferred(ph) and went home to the site of the transplant to make the cells of the trachea.",
