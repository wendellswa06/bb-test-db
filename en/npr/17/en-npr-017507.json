        "Prosecutors believed this was evidence the dogs had been bred to fight.",
        "Beth Wictum says that makes sense.",
        "Essentially, by breeding these dogs, they're creating a subpopulation, almost a new breed.",
        "Wictum directs the Forensic Lab at University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine.",
        "Just as with Labradors, they may try and concentrate certain aspects of pointing or retrieving, there are behavioral traits that they're trying to concentrate within this subpopulation.",
        "Working with the ASPCA, Wictum is compiling a database called the Canine Combined DNA Index System.",
        "So far, it includes about 400 samples taken from inside the cheeks of fighting dogs, including those seized in the Missouri raids.",
        "It's designed to help law enforcement go after not just the fight operators, but the breeders, as well.",
        "Tim Rickey says that's where the money is.",
        "For most of these dog fighters, you know, it all comes down to trying to create a champion and then to breed that champion.",
        "I mean, you can get anywhere from five to $20,000 for a puppy from a champion bloodline.",
        "And genetic proof of that bloodline could go a long way in court, he says.",
        "It could help convince a jury that a suspected breeder is supplying dog-fighting rings across the country.",
        "Still, the dog-fighting database makes some people very nervous.",
        "For example, Ledy VanKavage."

        "If DNA was the be-all and end-all, all of Secretariats' foals would be champions, you know, and win the Triple Crown.",

        "Each dog, like each person, is an individual and should be judged on their own character.",

        "And clearly with wins in Texas, Ohio and Rhode Island, good night for Senator Clinton, but can the campaign really claim the momentum has shifted in its favor, or did Senator Clinton just fight off defeat for now?",
        "I think what Senator Clinton has claimed and will claim is that as voters in three very different, very important states took a good look at their choices for president, they decided that she would be the strongest nominee.",
        "And we go on from here to other states, including Pennsylvania, where once again hundreds of delegates will be at stake.",
        "You mentioned hundreds of delegates in Pennsylvania, but even with these victories last night, Obama still maintains a lead in that all-important delegate count.",

        "There are millions of Democrats who are going to be looking at this election, not just Pennsylvania - Indiana, North Carolina, Nebraska, West Virginia, Oregon - these are states that we want to carry in the fall.",
