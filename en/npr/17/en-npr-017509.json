        "And I think that underscore something that's quite unusual about this Republican primary race compared to any and either party I can think of over the last almost 50 years.",
        "And what I mean is we have a contrast in the party between a candidate whose main argument is his alleged electability, that is, Mitt Romney who says he's governed in a Democratic state, et cetera, et cetera, and a candidate, a series of candidates, whose main appeal is that they reflect what the party and it's most conservative members really stand for.",
