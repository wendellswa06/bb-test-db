        "On Friday, the man who oversaw Argentina's Dirty War died.",
        "Jorge Rafael Videla was 87 and in prison for his role in thousands of brutal killings and kidnappings in the 1970s.",
        "Many were sent to concentration camps and never heard from again.",
        "Others survived.",
        "Alicia Partnoy is an Argentine poet and one of the women imprisoned at a place called The Little School.",
        "She was eventually released and has written about her experiences in a memoir, an account submitted as evidence to Argentina's Truth Commission.",
        "So after all these years, how will the death of Videla impact those how were wronged by him?",
        "If you've lived under an oppressive power, how did you react when they died?",

        "Thank you.",
        "Thanks for having me here.",
        "Can you start off by sharing your thoughts and emotions when you heard this news of Videla's death on Friday?",
        "I heard - I first read an email from a friend who was with me in jail, a survivor, and she said Videla died.",
        "He did not repent.",
        "I - people ask me if I have - I feel joy.",
        "I think joy is too much of an emotion for someone who was such a destructive entity.",
        "We feel relief.",
        "Sometimes when other genocide perpetrators, other people who are involved in killings of my friends or the torture at the Little School died, we felt outrage, because they died without justice.",
        "But with Videla, at least the worst - he was in jail.",
        "He had been condemned.",
        "So there is a feeling of relief, if you wish, and justice was on its way on several causes, also in several other trials, aside from him.",
        "But he didn't go through nearly what you did.",
        "I mean, you said justice was on its way, but could anything make you feel redeemed?",
        "It's been my struggle all these years, first, to remember, first, to bring the disappeared - the memory of the disappeared ones back into the history of our country, and second, justice.",
        "I mean, it's not - I had a book that is called, \"\"Revenge of the Apple,\"\" but our revenge is to see the - our power as a sweetness, as something that overcomes the destruction that they wanted to establish.",
        "So that is - and especially in the cases of the children, the disappeared children, and those came to haunt him at the very end.",
        "And we should remind the listeners, there were hundreds of babies, right, babies and small children taken and...",
        "Taken or born in the concentration camps, about 500, and maybe more.",
        "And so the grandmothers (unintelligible) mothers of those children had organized for all these decades since 1976.",
        "He ruled from '76 to '78.",
        "But then there were other juntas, and he facilitated that happening.",
        "And so the recent trials and last year where he was condemned for the disappearance, what's we call the systematic plan to rob, to disappear, to kidnap babies from the distance.",
        "Now, can you take us back to your experience?",
        "You were a student activist in 1977.",
        "Taken from your home, what happened?"

        "He told journalists many years later, disappearing people was pragmatic, that, quote, Argentinean society would not have tolerated firing squads.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, he said that.",
        "And he also said that the church provided him with good services (unintelligible) because they consulted with the Catholic Church because that's their religion, the official religion in the country.",
        "And they said, what do we do with the disappeared?",
        "What do we do?",
        "And they found out - and this is what - so he implicated the church in these interviews.",
        "I mean he implicated a bunch of people because he didn't - he felt he was conducting a duty by eliminating the dissidents.",
        "So he says, oh, it's, you know, let's find a solution so the population doesn't get too upset about these disappearing - disappeared people being, you know, killed, like you said.",
        "So they throw people from planes into the ocean.",
