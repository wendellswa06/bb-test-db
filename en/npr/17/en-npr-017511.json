        "So you have to be tough.",
        "As a scientist with a Kenya Wildlife Service, Kasiki monitored lions in Tsavo for 16 years.",
        "He says Tsavo toughness is a matter of testosterone.",
        "So I think some research have been done in Tsavo that suggests that the Tsavo lions may have much higher levels of testosterone than lions elsewhere.",
        "So I think that makes them a little bit more aggressive than lions elsewhere.",
        "Now, it's hard to say for sure how many man-eaters there were in Tsavo back then and why they behaved the way they did.",
        "Colonel Patterson, in his 1907 book \"\"The Man Eaters of Tsavo,\"\" wrote that he killed two relatively young male lions, and the man-eating pretty much stopped.",

        "I believe what happened is that the parent female, the mom for those two lions, somehow or other, or for some reason or another, caught on to taking people on a regular basis.",
        "And now it happens the lioness teaches the kids how and what to hunt, and people became a natural part of the menu.",
        "But Samuel Kasiki of the Kenya Wildlife Service has a different take altogether.",
        "He says the man-eating lions of Tsavo were probably in need of a good dentist.",
        "The reason they were eating people is because they had bad teeth.",
        "And if you have a bad tooth, you are not able to kill strong and fast-moving prey.",
        "So human beings (unintelligible) to be much slower prey, which they preferred.",
        "And if bad teeth aren't enough misfortune, plenty of male Tsavo lions were and are bald.",

        "Fifty years ago, Maschal says, he probably would have been a hunting enthusiast, like Colonel Patterson.",

        "Because that's what everyone did.",
        "My attitude at this stage of my life, having worked with these animals, and I go, what could promote somebody to pick up a rifle - I mean you can be a complete and cretin and be an excellent shot - and stand back 50 meters, 100 meters, 300 meters, and kill something so beautiful?",
        "It's just destruction.",
        "Hunting is now against the law in Kenya, but tensions between human and beast still run high.",
        "An estimated 3,000 lions are in the country but that number is apparently dropping as humans move deeper and deeper into lion territory.",
        "Perhaps the greater lesson of stories like the man-eating lions of Tsavo is that when two or more species compete for the same resources, neither comes away unscathed."
