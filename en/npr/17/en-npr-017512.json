        "In one of the things - well, we are still trying, you know, discussing and then try to find out exactly what he was charged for and when, because (unintelligible) amnesty at several times.",
        "Whether I was thinking - at first I was looking for information on the death of Rios - I mean the death - the trial for Rios Montt, who was recently the dictator from Guatemala who was recently condemned for genocide, and is the first case that is being condemned for genocide.",
        "And I said that cannot be.",
        "I'm sure Videla was condemned for genocide.",
        "And it's not competition, but it's like, well - but he was condemned for crimes against humanity and those crimes don't prescribe(ph).",
        "So we were discussing the details and just go on, go on with the trials, go on with the justice.",
        "Will you continue to write about this - now, is that part of your process of making this a small place in your mind as you said earlier?",
        "I have been writing.",
        "Yes, I do write - and poetry too, but I wasn't thinking of bringing those things to share with you today.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "But our main struggle now is to find the children, to find the children, to find those - and he died with that secret.",
        "So that was one of our biggest grievances with these people when they die, they die in silence and they never tell us what they did to these children, what they did to those bodies.",
        "He does not repent but he does not give information, and many of them - and most of them are not in these trials that they called trials for the truth.",
        "We, the survivors, are the ones telling the truth, but he never opened their mouth and tell us what they did.",
        "So, yeah.",
        "Well, thank you so very much.",
        "Alicia Partnoy is an Argentinean poet and activist.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF 911 CALL)",
        "Cleveland 911.",
        "Do you need...?",
        "Well, Gonzales is in danger because Sampson did not intend to point a finger at him.",
        "What he intended to do, the way he sounded all through the hearing which I listened to, he sounded like he wanted to fall on his sword for the administration and the boss.",
        "But he ended up saying things that directly pointed a finger at Gonzales.",
        "Gonzales' time has come and gone.",
        "It's about time for him to go.",
        "He is not going to ever be on the Supreme Court, which is where he thought he was headed one time.",
        "He has gone as far as he can with the loyalty to Bush from where he started.",
        "And it's really sort of sad that with something that was perfectly legal, getting rid of attorneys, which administrations do, they managed to bungle it so terribly and keep telling lies about it and making these statements.",
        "Karl Rove, I think, is still sort of insulated.",
        "It would depend on whether he came to testify or whether - himself and ended up pointing the finger at himself.",
        "But so long as he is over there in the White House, Bush is protecting him.",
        "I don't think they've yet gotten the goods on Rove, but the goods are there on Gonzales and I think it's time for him to go.",
        "So how do you see the clock ticking down for Gonzales, Joe?",
        "Well, I think that Gonzales is really in a very, very difficult position.",
        "I mean, when the White House spokeswoman yesterday said that it's up to the attorney general to kind of explain some of these things rather than the White House coming to his defense in a much stronger way, it reminded me of another period in somewhat recent American history, the Watergate period, when another official was left, quote, \"\"twisting in the wind.",
        "So I think that Gonzales is now in a very tough situation with the Democrats calling for his ouster, with some Republicans at least expressing dismay at his performance in terms of how he has related with Congress on this issue, with the White House offering what seems like something less than an enthusiastic backing of him, with editorials coming out calling for his dismissal.",
        "You know, I think that if I were an insurance salesman selling insurance on his longevity that it would probably be an insurance deal I would not offer."

        "So, Bob Meadows, what would you imagine the conversation to be between Sampson and Gonzales today if he were to call him on the phone?",
        "Would it just be mea culpas all over the place?",
        "Well, yes.",
        "Sampson will probably be saying, you know what, I thought that I was trying to fall on my sword but I guess I actually skewered you with it.",
        "And Alberto Gonzales's response would probably something I can't actually express on NPR at this moment or any time.",
        "Yeah, It's really an astonishing thing because, as Mary said, Sampson was trying to deflect criticism from Gonzales.",
        "He really seemed to be trying to do that, but then he just blurted out, oh yeah, by the way, not only was he involved, Harriet Miers was too.",
        "Oops, oh.",
        "He probably was just thinking of Scooter Libby.",

        "Well, let me direct this one more question to the three of you before we go on to our next topic.",
        "And it's this.",
        "Washington loves scandals in a twisted sort of way.",
        "How does this one compare?",
        "Well, you know, Bush has had two very bad attorney generals.",
        "Ashcroft was terrible, but he managed to not do anything like this that simply gave an opening to be attacked.",
        "As far as scandals are concerned, there have been, you know, worse scandals in - the page on the Hill, the pages and Foley and all that stuff.",
        "We've had had, you know, much worse scandals.",
        "But in terms of the bumbling about…",
        "That's it.",
        "…and in terms of this being the attorney general of the United States, who was supposed to be the chief law enforcement officer.",
        "And if you can't trust the law enforcement officer to tell you the truth, who else can you trust?",
        "And then it's tragic because it's Gonzales, and here is the first Latino attorney general but owes everything to Bush from beginning to end and is being loyal and is bumbling about like this.",
        "So it's not a scandal on the level of the page or the Monica Lewinsky or any other things that we've had here, but it gets worse and worse the longer he stays and the more conflicting stories they tell.",
        "He probably should just leave so that the whole thing can die down.",
        "You probably are…"

        "You know, Tony, I think one thing that people don't learn from previous scandals is don't cover up.",
        "Don't cover up.",
        "And these conflicting stories that have come out from the Justice Department, while they may or may not have been intended as a cover up, that's the way they are perceived.",
        "And so while I agree with Mary there have been far worse scandals, you do have the situation where there appears to have been a cover up or there certainly have been incomplete and contradictory statements.",
        "And that's what can get you in the end.",
        "Even if the, you know, the original offense, if that's what it is, isn't quite so serious.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I would suppose, Bob, that the timing - there's never a good time for a scandal but this timing was really bad, wasn't it?",

        "Okay, we're going to stay inside the Beltway for topic number two.",
        "Just like their counterparts in the House, Senate Democrats ignored President Bush's veto threats and passed their own version of an Iraq war spending bill that is tied to a deadline for troop withdrawal by the 31st of March of next year.",
        "The vote, mostly along party lines, 51 to 47, sort of a pay-to-play plan, and puts congressional Democrats squarely at odds with the White House for the first time really in this president's tenure.",
        "So, Joe, this bill was said to be a compromise, but Bush clearly doesn't see it that way and vows not to bend.",
        "Bottom line this for us: What's at stake for the president here?",
        "Well, I think from his point of view what's at stake is the degree to which he can continue to prosecute this war as fully and as unfettered perhaps as he would like.",
        "And he also sees this timetable as - that the House is firmer requirement than the Senate, which is a goal for withdrawal.",
        "And they - another point, they have to come together and kind of bridge that gap.",
        "But he sees this as something that would really be detrimental to the United States and he feels that the American people would not stand for it.",
        "However, the elections in November indicate that the American people are totally fed up with this war.",
        "They elected a Democratic Congress that is proceeding to move against the war in terms of calling for troop withdrawal.",
        "And so to some extent it's a test of wills for the hearts and minds of the American people.",
        "And, right now, certainly the polls indicate that the American people are totally fed up with this war.",
        "And so I think that Mr. Bush is probably on the losing end of this on the public relations battle but he still has the veto power.",
        "Well, Mary, the Democrats have taken what an analysis in the New York Times yesterday called a rare unifying position with regard to foreign policy, specifically where the war is concerned.",
        "Without the power to override a promised veto, what's their countermove?",
        "Well, the way this is going to turn out will depend on whether the public accepts the Bush administration's spin.",
        "If the administration succeeds with its spin, that this is like the shutdown of the government when Clinton was president and that the Democrats are claiming - don't want to fund the troops and the troops are suffering, if the public accepts that spin and doesn't understand that the bills have money in it - there is money there for the troops, it's just that there are some requirements - then the Democrats might be pushed to try to back off a little bit or make some kind of adjustments.",
        "But also, the Democrats are going to have trouble coming up with a final bill because you've the people on the left, the anti-war people who are not happy really with - with the lack of a real goal in the Senate bill and who went along holding their noses with the House bill, and then you have the Blue Dogs and the conservatives in the Democratic Party who are uneasy about whether the public accepts the spin about the troops.",
        "It's going to take a little magic on the part of Pelosi and her crew and Reid and the others to come up with a bill.",
        "But after that, it will depend on what spin the public accepts.",
        "The money is there for the troops."
