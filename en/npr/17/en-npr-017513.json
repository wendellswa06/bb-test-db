        "It comes from a different time, but the time that it comes from was a time when this kind of racism was pervade to the American people.",
        "And the fact that 115,000 people are anxious to see it - I hope that they're not, you know, 115,000 people who don't - either don't know any history or who think this is wonderful.",
        "Despite the fact that it is racist, I don't mind if it's shown, if there's some explanation that goes along with it, because it is part of our history and it should be shown and people should be told that this is part of the history and this is the way folks looked at things and looked at black people and characterized them in this period.",
