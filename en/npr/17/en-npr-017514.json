        "And a lot of people would try to say, you know, they just need to let it go, and they were never - they were always resolute that there would be, you know, an ending to this that they would find their daughter.",
        "Have we heard anything from the family members today?",
        "I have not personally.",
        "From what I've heard from some of the people who are close with them and have had contact with them, they really just want to spend some time with these family members.",
        "The family members also need to be interviewed by the police so that they can, you know, get the really vital information they need to make a case and get as much of it as they can quickly.",
        "However, police are also - they said that they're really taking care in the way that they interview these women, you know, with understanding they've been through great traumas, and they don't want to push them too hard.",
        "They want to give them a little bit of time, as well, with their families first to celebrate this momentous, you know, occasion.",
        "Amazing occasion.",
        "The third woman, though, Michelle Knight, 20 at the time that she went missing, but she was never reported missing.",
        "She was, as I understand it, believed to have been a runaway.",
        "Yeah, I mean, I do believe that her family did, you know, report her missing at some point, but her story is quite different.",
        "You know, she was an adult when she went missing.",
        "So the case didn't, you know, really get nearly as much attention as the other two, and was never really in any way publicly connected to them.",
        "My colleague here at the Plain Dealer Leila Atassi, has spoken to many of her family members who are really trying to find a way to reach her.",
        "They themselves haven't even been able to get a hold of detectives to reach out to her because they're kind of scattered.",
        "They live in different states now.",
        "And they, you know, they said that in their own ways, over the years, they would try to come back to the neighborhoods and canvas and ask about her, but it sounds like they didn't really have a lot of hope that they would see her again.",
        "Now back in 2004, and this is after Michelle Knight had vanished and after Amanda Berry had vanished, police visited the home where eventually they were found.",
        "Yeah, and that was, you know, on a completely separate case, you know, involving a report of a child possibly left on a school bus and not dropped off at home.",
        "You know, Ariel Castro, the man who's been arrested along with his brothers, was a Cleveland Schools bus driver for a number of years.",

        "And so it wasn't like there was a huge investigation or a reason for them to attempt to get into this house.",

        "You know, the uncle of Gina DeJesus, you know, owned a music club where people would come and dance, and Ariel Castro apparently would come play in bands in this club.",
        "And he knew the family at least tangentially, if not even a little bit more.",
        "You know, some people said that when Gina went missing that Ariel Castro and members of his family helped canvas, helped raise money to look for her and to pay for flyers.",

        "With rape, there was a young child, a six-year-old child.",

        "Do we know who the father is?",
        "We do know, according to Cleveland police, that Amanda Berry is the mother of the child.",
        "They did not talk about who the father could be or possible was.",
        "They said that they were really going to wait until they were able to hear the stories from these young ladies before they started putting the information out there.",
        "And they also really caution people who are getting, you know, information from, you know, anonymous sources or people who say they're family members and putting out some very specific and very upsetting information about maybe how these women were held captive.",
        "And the police and the detectives who have worked on this for years and are close with these families have really cautioned people to be careful."

        "You know, and many people have reported, and we've also reported, that, you know, there was some physical restraint of these women up to a certain point.",
        "From what we've gleaned, it wasn't an exclusively kind of physical restraint of them in the house, but they may have been locked in rooms or chained up at certain times but not completely all the time and they may have had some access to wander around the house.",
        "But there's really no indication that they were able to come and go or leave from the house at all.",
        "Now in 2009, Cleveland Police Department went through a complete review of the way it handled missing person cases, amongst others, because of, well, mistakes were made.",

        "We don't know as much about the investigation involving Michelle Knight yet.",
        "It seems like that was a little less of an intense investigation, possibly because she was an adult when she went missing, and her family members were unsure, you know, whether she was abducted or whether she possibly left on her own.",
