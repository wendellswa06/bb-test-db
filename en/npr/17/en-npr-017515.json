        "There's - rarely do we find a credible witness or a witness that can be helpful.",
        "There's no real crime scene to work on.",
        "So all the things that we depend on as criminal investigators when we're in the field is just absence and that you have to go out there and develop your own leads, your own information and to try to find these children.",
        "That's what then makes it a very, very difficult investigation.",
        "And we're told on TV that the first 24, 48 hours are critical.",
        "Oh absolutely.",
        "You know, I think the last statistics we had was if the child were to be murdered, it would be in the first two to three hours, according to the Washington State study.",
        "But I also want to preface this as saying that not all children that are abducted are murdered, as we've seen here in this instance.",
        "In fact in many cases, abductions of children are custody cases.",
        "Well, you know, yes in some cases, and children go missing for a variety of reasons.",
        "Child custody cases are one, but I wouldn't minimize those because there's an awful lot of emotion tied to those cases and a lot of violence against those children.",
        "But we also have a lot of runaway children and often dismissed as just a behavioral problem, when in fact we see many of these children are running away from a situation, say an abusive home, or maybe even in other cases they're being lured by a predator.",
        "So we don't minimize any missing child case, and we want to remind everyone that we consider all these child endangered, and we've got to get them found and get them returned home as quickly as we can.",
        "And what can you tell us about the demographics of the abducted?",
        "Are they mostly young people, or are they - what can you tell us?",
        "Well, it depends on the type of scenario, but when you have a case like what we had last night, you know, those generally are females, generally the school age.",
        "We said that the children on abductions are most vulnerable, according to our analysis, either going to or coming from school or a school-related event.",
        "You know, it's a time that they're oftentimes alone.",
        "They're walking.",
        "And what we tell parents is that we don't want children frightened to the point that they don't leave home, but empower your kids and tell them it's OK to say no if someone tries to lure them into a car.",
        "It's OK to run.",
        "And if someone grabs them, we urge the children - the parents to tell the children kick, scream, bring as much attention to that situation as they possibly can.",
        "We're talking about missing cases, cases of missing persons.",
        "If you're an investigator who's worked one of those cases, give us a call, 800-989-8255.",

        "And I looked at my job as responsibly to investigate complaints or situations where a child might be in danger or in harm.",
        "And it's real clear to me that we could only do so much, by we I mean authorities through child protection, police and court.",
        "I recall several instances where - in fact this is a remarkable situation where you have stranger abduction and 10 years of confinement.",
        "What we typically were involved in was children who are hurt by family members.",
        "And I can recall a couple situations that might be similar to what you're looking at, where young women who, in Michigan at the time I was working, there was a limbo area of between 17 and 18 where courts did not have authority, and parents really did not have authority through the courts or police, to make that 17-year-old live with them or go to school or do things that we would normally expect of younger children.",
        "That's what he's referring to when he's saying, we had that for 10 years.",
        "And a number of young women would put themselves in dangerous situations.",
        "One I recall was I had worked with a family whose 16-year-old daughter was rebelling, and a mother asked for some assistance because of some things that the stepfather was threatening to do to the child.",
        "And we resolved that somewhat, and then about - some time later, maybe within a year, that child had turned 17.",
        "And the mother was calling me asking for help because the child had run away with her biological father.",
        "And I said, well, there's really not much we could do.",
        "And then she let me know that it wasn't just a father-daughter relationship, that this man, who had been in prison, or not in the child's life, had taken his daughter in a sexual way, also, so, you know, really coerced her emotionally and physically to be subject to him.",
        "We often dealt with young women who would attach themselves to young men, anywhere from 16 to 17 years of age.",
        "I think I heard somebody talking earlier on the radio about somebody living under a bridge.",
        "Yes."

        "We had a young woman who was adopted by very well-to-do, upstanding citizens, the father was a college professor.",

        "The courts tried to deal with it.",
        "By the time she was 17, the courts could no longer have authority over her, and she had attached herself to a young man who - in fact they were living under a bridge, scavenging for food and trying to survive.",
        "I later dealt with that family in a child protection situation where this woman, this young girl and then - or older girl and then young woman, had children with this young man.",
        "And they were neglectful.",
        "There was issues of sexual assault and physical abuse towards the children.",
        "And unfortunately the community has had to deal with not just the harm to that child, the original mother and teenager, but also the harm to her children.",
        "And it's again a very large persistent problem that the community has, really, difficulty grappling with in many ways.",
        "Thanks, John, for the call.",

        "Yes, I had a case that was up in Atlanta some years back.",
        "One of the biggest issues that we bring (technical difficulties) missing person case is, of course, (technical difficulties) child.",
        "We did finally recover a body in the general area.",
        "Of course, it's so decomposed.",
        "What we had to do is try to reconstruct the way that person may have looked at the time.",
        "And, you know, based on bone structure, based on several other factors, and it made really difficult to identify this person, but, fortunately, the reconstruction was good enough to get a decent composite of what that person looked like.",
        "We were able to then go back and check through the cases and match up the DNA and so forth.",
        "But once you finally have that person, you know, identified, well, then you have a whole other issue, and that's trying to figure out, OK, well, who did this?",
        "And I think if there's one thing that if I could, you know, make a suggestion, you know, on the air, we have a major issue with putting sex offenders right back in the community.",
        "If a person goes to their local state and types in the sex offender registry, puts in their address, they would be dumbfounded how many of these people live right within, you know, walking distance of their home.",
        "But I think if there's some new legislation to, you know, put these people behind bars and really keep them back there, we would see missing cases drop significantly.",
        "And I know in states where they take a harder stance against some of the sex offenders instead of just treatment (technical difficulties) we've seemed those numbers drop significantly.",
        "Well, I understand what you're saying.",
        "Of course, not every sex offender reoffends.",
        "But, Robert Lowery, what do you think of that suggestion?",
        "Well, I agree.",
        "I mean, not everyone does reoffend, but we do keep an eye on the ones that - that are out there (unintelligible) there are high rates of recidivism among sex offenders.",
        "But he - this gentleman does bring up another topic that we work on every day here is that remains of children that are found, and they're not been identified.",
        "And right now, we're - we - here at the National Center, we're assisting on over 650 such cases that we believe to be long-term missing children.",
        "Your caller is correct.",
        "It's very difficult to start a homicide investigation on those cases until we can identify those children, put a name to them because that's where that investigation really starts in earnest, so we could track where they've been and the activity and who they may have been with.",
        "But it is a dilemma.",
        "And it's one that we are addressing here at the National Center.",
        "Dave, did you ever find out who did the murder that you're talking about?",
        "The family was - the child's murderer was never identified.",
        "However, there were a couple of people that were picked up in related cases that more than likely that was the killer.",
        "But it's something we may never know.",
        "It's kind of like the Ann Walsh case.",
        "I mean, that is one where there are some pretty good speculation but we're probably never going truly know.",
        "But, you know, that's the tragedy of this is, you know, the gentleman mentioned the recidivism rate is extremely high among sex offenders.",
        "And when we talk about, hey, we keep track of them, well, it depends on what you define as keeping track.",
        "I mean, we know where they live, but we don't have the manpower to be watching a hundred people in one small community at the same time.",
        "And if there's one another message, I guess, I can really get across to parents is watch your kids, never let them out of your sight, you know?",
        "I don't think kids should ride to, you know, school on their bike by themselves or walk to school by themselves, even if it's only a block or, you know, two blocks away.",
        "And in Brega, we saw petrol tanks or gas tanks that were actually on fire and it was unclear if they had been shelled or what, but they were burning."

        "That would reduce the number of missing kids significantly.",
        "But, you know, like I say, I think we definitely need to have some new laws at least structure how many - how we track these folks and whether we should let them out at all depending on the crime.",
