        "I think a lot of it was very calculated.",
        "You know, as I said in the book, Batman is so much an obvious opposite of Superman that it's quite clear that somebody just sat there and broke it all down and put it back together again.",
        "In the opposite way.",
        "Pretty much, you know?",
        "And Superman's a solar hero.",
        "He gets his power from the sun.",
        "So Batman hangs out at night, you know, Superman works alone, and he has no partners.",
        "Batman has a boy partner.",
        "You said that Batman was like The Rolling Stones to Superman's Beatles.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Because then, Batman was cool.",
        "You know, Superman had a boss, and he worked on a job, and the girl across on the other side of the office didn't like him.",
        "Batman has a butler.",
        "He sleeps in all day.",
        "You know, he's surrounded by all these girls in leather who are constantly chasing him and trying to go off with him and or kill him.",
        "So it's kind of - as I said in the book, it's the capitalist superhero versus the socialist superhero.",
        "It's the socialist versus the socialite.",
        "Right.",
        "And I think it's why Batman's been more popular recently, because in our culture, there's, you know, there's much more aspiration to be a billionaire success than it is to be a farm worker or a newspaper reporter.",
        "So we've kind of become the sort of people who would rather have Batman or Iron Man."
