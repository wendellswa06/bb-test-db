        "We asked John Christy.",

        "When they are colder than average, that's a La Nina.",
        "That is actually part of a mechanism that helps to steer the jet stream, which also steers the storms, and therefore you get these repeated storms coming in a particular area and then repeated misses of storms in places like Texas into Mexico.",
        "Now, the story that I'm the most interested in, because it's, you know, something that I remember from my childhood, is tornadoes.",

        "Right, because a lot of Republicans think he's too liberal.",
        "That's right, but depending on who McCain runs against, Obama or Clinton, that will affect how he picks his vice presidential choice.",

        "Which is to say that according to folks inside the McCain campaign, and we should note that McCain's list is at about 20 and it's very loose, but Condi Rice and Joe Lieberman are not considered front-runners in this very early contest and that's because Condi Rice is so tied to the Bush administration.",
        "McCain is trying to get his distance from that, and Joe Lieberman is a very close McCain friend, but you know, when you're a candidate who has issues bringing his own party together, although Joe Lieberman is now an Independent, still he is a Democrat and picking a Democrat to run with you is not something that Republicans would necessary find a great idea.",
        "John McCain was on the Don Imus radio show on Wednesday, and he made a joke.",
        "He said, look, I know this vice president question is very important for me because of my age.",
        "I mean, he meant it as a joke but well - it's not such a joke, is it?",
        "It's not such a joke, and it's clearly something that McCain will be thinking about, and the age question is important because this person who's going to step in needs to be young, and also needs to be someone with national security experience and somebody who can take over on that very important commander-in-chief role, and so that will be very much in their thinking as they put together their final shortlist.",
