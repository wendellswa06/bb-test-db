        "There were heiresses from wealthy families, a great war spy named Sir Paul Dukes.",
        "There were attorneys, and Bernard put on professional grade circuses and vaudeville entertainments that lasted from tea in the afternoon until dawn.",

        "Given that yoga is now a multibillion dollar industry - some call it the yoga industrial complex - do you think Pierre Bernard would be proud of what it has become?",
        "You know, I think he would be divided about it because he believed in the guru-student relationship, which means that you really can't divide yourself a thousand times to turn it into a huge thing.",
        "So I think in some ways, he would be offended by it.",
        "And in other ways, he would have to take some credit for it because here he was in, you know, in San Francisco in 1900, setting down the rules for how yoga would be taught: four-inch-thick, hair mattresses in a room of equitable temperatures.",
        "He was the one who Americanized what he had learned from Hamadi and then taught it to others -who taught it to others, who taught it to others.",
        "And without him, we wouldn't be doing it today, probably.",
        "Well, I think he's a missing link in the great story of how yoga moved from East to West.",

        "There's another issue here and that is that The Washington Post is reporting there's an FBI investigation into public corruption of Eric Massa and that's over large payments out of his campaign and official accounts before he resigned.",
        "But the Ethics Committee investigation deals with the allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct.",
        "But the Ethics Committee has no jurisdiction over former members and Massa is now a former member.",
