        "It's going to depend on whether somebody have - whoever rented the most SUVs and has all the trucks locked up with rentals and can get their people out to the caucuses if there is a snowstorm.",
        "If it's sunny weather, then that's changes the whole dynamic.",
        "So they're not much of the candidates can do right now unless one of them really, really makes a big mistake in the next few days to change what's going to happen.",
        "And I also think, Tony, that unless there's a wipeout in the caucuses, that is somebody really wins big and the other people are just down to nothing and if they come in really close, it won't make that much difference as we go to New Hampshire.",

        "Because, Ron, new television ads by an outside labor-backed organization were aired for the first time yesterday in Iowa.",
        "Now, these ads are apparently aimed at giving John Edwards a boost, even though he and Obama have both complained about such groups which are known as 527s because of the tax code designation that they operate under.",

        "I think when you're right on the cusp of the first caucus in the nation and talking about the Iowa and the Hawkeye State, it all amounts to turnout.",
        "And as Mary eluded, too, a few moments ago, it's going to be very important for the candidates to have the best organization and hope for a very good weather so that they can load up the buses and send people to the different caucus areas so they can cast their ballot.",
        "As it relates to Senator Edwards, John Edwards is in a very unique position right now.",
        "Senator Clinton and Senator Obama are so focused on each other and they seemed to be targeting a lot of their resources towards each other.",
        "John Edwards is in a very unique position because he's just on the cusp of becoming the frontrunner in Iowa and some polls have put him in the lead.",
        "If Clinton and Obama continue to focus on each other and Senator Edwards can get the turnout and he can have positive air experiences - be it some of these campaign ads or positive mailing pieces - and he can get his folks out, he can win and then that will entirely change the dynamic of this race moving forward.",
        "Here's one more thing about the Democrats.",

        "But, Mary, it seems he is a, quote, unquote, \"\"player\"\" in the race of the presidential nomination, especially with fellow Democrats who are blowing up his phone, seeking his endorsement.",
        "He hasn't given one yet, by the way.",
        "How do you explain Sharpton's influence?",
        "Oh, it is absolutely simple to answer this question.",
        "People will think Sharpton shouldn't have any influence because Obama happens to be African-American.",
        "I don't understand that there were black people inside the Kennedy - John Kennedy's administration, but that didn't mean there was no need for Martin Luther King or for any other civil rights people.",
        "I think that until we get to a place where most African-Americans and other people of goodwill believe that race problems are entirely resolved, there will always be a role to play when these events occur like Jena and other kinds of highly publicized events for somebody.",
        "And Al Sharpton happens to have the biggest mouth and the biggest presence and all the rest of it right now, and the candidates know this.",
        "They know what their African-American constituency, you know, people who don't like, you know, Al Sharpton for various reasons, they see the need for some kind of advocate.",
        "So I can see that there's a role for him or for somebody to play despite the fact - even if Obama won the presidency, there'll still be a role for somebody outside, somebody as an advocate, somebody to speak up, to bring pressure to bear.",
        "Well, would you say, Ron, that an endorsement by Al Sharpton is substantive whoever may get it?",
        "I don't know how substantive it is.",
        "I think it's a stamp of a seal of approval from the so-called Black Leadership that Reverend Sharpton provides apparently.",
        "But again, I think that the most influential type of political individual who's African-American these days is someone like Barack Obama, someone like Deval Patrick, the mayor - excuse me - the governor of Massachusetts, someone who's been elected to office and has experience.",
        "But there's no question, looking at that article from the Washington Post today, that for better or worse, Al Sharpton is still a force to be reckoned with.",
        "Interesting.",
        "We'll keep an eye on that.",
        "Let's move on to the GOP and talk about the fact that Mitt Romney, Mike Huckabee competing for the vote of the Christian right with mixed results so far.",
        "Even John McCain is beginning to show life again, albeit in New Hampshire.",
        "Ron, to follow up with you, what's happening with the Republicans in Iowa and how is the Christian vote figuring into these last few days of campaigning there?"

        "Well, I tell you, if you looked at the political conventional wisdom from just a few weeks ago, you would have said, Mike Huckabee has a chance?",
        "Governor Huckabee has been able to galvanize a lot of the evangelical Christian support in Iowa to his advantage and the once seemingly informidable lead held by former Governor Mitt Romney has been - chips down to not only the size of the margin of error, but Governor Huckabee is expected now to win in Iowa.",
        "What this does for the contest, I think, Tony, takes you very, very interestingly enough into the heart of what the Republican Party's future is going to be.",
        "The Republican Party in the past was very much dominated by the Christian coalition and the evangelical Christian part of the base.",
        "But moving forward to New Hampshire, South Carolina, Michigan, states where their influence perhaps is not as great as what it used to be, it'll be interesting to see as Governor Huckabee holds on to win what will mean for Governor Romney and Senator McCain in these other states where the role of the evangelical is not as strong.",
        "If Huckabee wins in Iowa, the money will flow in like crazy for people who support him, who think that he has a shot despite what Ron said, the way they see it.",
        "And there are lots of evangelicals in all of these states.",
        "They may not be sufficient to carry the day in some, and they have - some of them have money.",
        "And so people who support him as an alternative - if he wins Iowa, that's the key.",
        "It's just like if Edwards wins Iowa.",
        "And if he wins Iowa, then he can move on.",
        "But I do think it's amazing, too, that where he's come from to be talked about seriously and now to be ahead.",
        "But I almost must say - must tell you that I predicted weeks ago that McCain was going to come back to life and I see that he has done that.",
        "And I think even if Huckabee wins in Iowa, McCain will probably win in New Hampshire if that happens, and that may cut him off at the pass.",
        "Well, certainly, if the Concord Monitor newspaper in New Hampshire has anything to say about it, Romney will not be winning there.",
        "They are calling him in an editorial that's been widely distributed, a phony who, quote, \"\"must be stopped.\"\" This grazes the tip of the editorial iceberg, doesn't it, Ron?",
        "How much of an - how hurtful is an anti-endorsement like this?",
        "Well, it doesn't help someone like Governor Romney right now.",
        "Governor Romney has long predicated his strategy on winning in Iowa, New Hampshire, Michigan, South Carolina at the early contests.",
        "Senator McCain has shown a remarkable resilience in the last month or so and he's picked up the endorsements of influential papers in Iowa and New Hampshire and around the country.",
        "And these are the sort of things that once folks thought, gosh, does John McCain have a chance?",
        "Well, I think, yeah, maybe he does.",
        "That increases his financial coffers.",
        "That increases his ability to get on the air and influence the process.",
        "And don't forget, Senator McCain won the New Hampshire primary in 2000 and he thoroughly dominated that contest over former Governor George W.",
        "Bush.",
        "And it'll be interesting to see, for those constituents who had such a strong fervor and following for Senator McCain then, whether they come out and vote for him now.",
        "Iowa is a must for Mitt Romney.",
        "New Hampshire is a must for Mitt Romney.",
        "And I think, as Mary and I have discussed, you see an opening with Governor Huckabee in Iowa and Senator McCain in New Hampshire.",
        "It's going to be a very interesting contest that it's going to be very hard to predict at this point.",
        "And keep in mind, too, that Romney has, so far, been using mostly his own money.",
        "He's been spending his own money."
