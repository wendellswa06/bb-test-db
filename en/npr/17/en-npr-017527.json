        "Yeah.",
        "It kind of works like this.",
        "Like, if you get arrested and, you know, you've been picked up and you get brought before a judge, the judge basically has three options.",
        "I mean, this is sort of the basic situation.",
        "He can say, I'm going to release you on your own recognizance; I'm going to trust you to show back up.",
        "I think that you're going to come back in a month, so be here.",
        "And you're free to go.",
        "Or he can say, I'm going to give you bail.",
        "I believe that it's going to - $1,000.",
        "If you give me $1,000, you give the court $1,000 - that you will show back up.",
        "And if you show back up, I'm going to give you your $1,000 back.",
        "A lot of people won't have a thousand dollars, so they'll turn to a bail bondsman to pay it for them.",
        "And they'll pay a nonrefundable fee - usually, a couple hundred dollars to do that.",
        "And then the third option is something called pretrial release, which is sort of a newer, kind of county funded program, where you get out with some sort of supervision - surveillance, ankle bracelets, things like that.",
        "And that fourth option we talked about before - remand.",
        "No bail, you're just going to the",
        "Yeah.",
        "...to the pokey...",
        "And right.",
        "And yeah, and exactly.",
        "If they say, this is a violent offender; we can't have this guy out in the public, you just go back to jail.",
        "And the bail bondsman system has been set up to ensure that people show up at their court day.",
        "Exactly.",
        "It's interesting that the United States is one of only two countries in the world that has commercial bail bondsmen.",
        "Only us and Philippines have this sort of system.",
        "Every other country either uses some form of pre-trial release with supervision, court-monitored type of supervision, or you pay your money to the court and you get your money back when you show up.",
        "So, it's very unique to the United States.",
        "And indeed, you had found some people who are highly critical of the bail bond system, and saying a lot of people saying we could save an awful lot of money by releasing people with ankle bracelets, for example.",
        "Exactly, because the pre-trial release is, you know, it became it sort of came up in the '80s and '90s.",
        "It only cost a couple dollars a day, taxpayer dollars per day.",
        "Jail costs, on average, $60 a day.",
        "In places like New York, it costs $198 a night to house somebody.",
        "So when you're talking about sending somebody out on an ankle bracelet for six bucks a day versus $198, and they have - for all intents and purposes - the same success rate at bringing people back to court, it becomes this question of what's best for taxpayers."

        "That is their number one job, yes.",

        "They meant to show up, but they didn't.",

        "The people think that it's not worth it, and so they end up not going to court.",
        "So we stopped doing bonds that small, but it's so hard for them to A, call somebody because everyone has cell phones, and they can't call them collect; and B, to get someone to just go post all that money because if it's $500, they have to post the whole 500 at the jail.",
