        "If I don't show up in jail, you were saying the judge says, well, you don't have to pay the whole 100 percent, Mr.�Bail Bondsman.",
        "You can pay 5 percent.",
        "In the vast majority of counties in this county, if your bail is $10,000 and you've paid your bondsman $1,000, in theory if you don't show up, you're supposed to that bondsman is supposed to give the court $10,000.",

        "So if you consider that math for a minute, you've paid the bondsman 10 percent of the bond, at least.",
        "And then if you run, the bondsman only owes the county 5 percent.",
        "So it's an awfully good deal for the bail bondsman, and it doesn't provide a whole lot of incentive for them to go find you because they actually have already profited 5 percent.",
        "So they don't really need to go chase you because they've already made money.",

        "The judges post require bonds because they know that people who sit in jail want their cases to move faster.",
        "If you're out of jail, and you're out on bond, you have no incentive to plead guilty, and that's my perspective as both a prosecutor and defense attorney.",
        "Cases move faster when you're in jail.",
        "You want to get the case resolved, and I would just tell you that that's in addition to these other issues that have come up in this great story.",
        "So what you're saying, Kevin, is if you're sitting in jail for a couple of months, you're far more likely to accept a plea agreement with a prosecutor, and plead guilty to something in order to get this resolved and move on?",

        "He has put his finger on what the Justice Department found in their own report, that statistically if you are sitting in jail, you are more likely to plead guilt,y and more likely to get a harsher punishment, than if you are on the outside and you've made your bail, because you have time to fight your case, prepare your case, and show the court that maybe you're a good citizen after all.",
        "So if you're outside for six months, you've gone to rehab, maybe, you've paid restitution to whomever you've offended, you're paying child support, you've got a job and an apartment - no judge wants to put somebody who's contributing to the community in that positive way back in jail or put them you know, they'll say, we'll give you probation.",
        "We want you to do, you know, a whole lot of community service.",
        "Or sometimes you do weekends or something like that.",
        "Exactly, or maybe you can spend your weekends, but we're not going to make you stay.",

        "Jail's horrible, and you just have to wait out that time, and you've lost your job, your apartment, your family ties.",
