        "When people don't show up to court, why aren't we just contacting them?",
        "I managed a DUI court for our county courts for about three years, and one of the things that we noticed about our caseload in that court was that a third of them never would show up to their arraignment, and so we had very similar issues with people not showing up.",
        "What we started doing with our program is when we would find people who didn't show up for arraignments and had warrants issued for them, we would call them, and it was amazing to me the amount of people who would just tell us things like, well, I missed my date, and I was really scared, I didn't know how the courts would react, so I decided to hide, but thank you for calling me, I'll come in now.",
        "And at that point, the judge would drop the warrant for them, and we'd get them into the system.",
        "And I just it's something that I thought that the courts always would have done before I did the program, because I was kind of a layman when it came to the court system, before I started.",
        "But just seeing that the courts don't do something like that just kind of amazed me.",
        "We should point out, California takes DUIs very seriously.",
