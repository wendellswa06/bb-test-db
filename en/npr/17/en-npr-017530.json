        "Just two weeks before my son was killed, he asked me out of the clear blue sky, dad, did you know there were loopholes in the Brady bill?",
        "And then he was killed with a gun that was purchased through one of those loopholes.",
        "You mention the Brady bill - that's the tighter gun control legislation that was passed after the assassination attempt against President Reagan.",
        "Yes, it was 1994 and basically, it put a requirement that a person has to pass a background check in order to buy a gun.",
        "In 2000, we closed the gun sale loophole in Colorado and now we closed the private sale loophole.",
        "And that meant a lot to me to be able to, you know, to respond to what my son said to me."
