        "How do you make the case, though, when it's really handguns that are responsible for the most violence?",
        "It's true that a lot more of gun deaths are with handguns, but I think most people accept that that's part of that basic right.",
        "But when we have people being mowed down with weapons the way that they are in a lot of these mass shootings with assault weapons, that's something that we can get a handle on and not make it easy for deranged people to mow people down like that.",
        "But, you know, a lot of people have been very critical of the assault weapons ban of 1994 saying it actually didn't make much of a difference.",
        "You know, and they especially say that about Columbine, that it was in effect in the case of Columbine.",
        "But the fact is that all of the existing assault weapons were grandfathered in.",
        "So, we didn't take them away from people, so they were still in existence.",
        "When you put this kind of ban in, you're going to have to accept that you're doing it for the long haul.",
        "After the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, there seemed to be some kind of impetus for tighter gun legislation.",
        "There was momentum.",
        "A few months on now, that momentum is changing, seems to be fading.",
        "Is this a familiar pattern to you after Columbine, after the Aurora shooting?",
        "Have you seen this play out before?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "America is known for its amnesia on this issue.",
        "We get shocked and then we go onto the next issue and then we tend to forget about it.",

        "I think they'll be joining with people like myself and victims from Virginia Tech and other shootings.",

        "It can happen to any of us.",
        "And unless we do something, it'll happen to more of us.",
        "I wanted to ask you one last question.",
        "You have a pair of your son Daniel's shoes that you wear when you're speaking about gun control.",
        "It's obviously a powerful statement, but can you articulate why you decided that that was something you wanted to do?",
        "I thought they were very symbolic.",
        "They were the shoes that he was wearing on that terrible day.",
        "We had the same shoe size.",
        "My son was a very shy boy and yet he joined the debate team at Columbine.",
        "And to me it seemed that by wearing his shoes I was stepping into his shoes, the way he stepped forward and was willing to speak in front of people, that I could do the same."

        "Hackers got their full names and full driver's license numbers, which is very personal.",

        "The man at Uber who is in charge of security, his name is Joe Sullivan.",
        "According to a source close to the company, Sullivan covered it up and actually paid the hackers $100,000 to delete the data and keep their mouths shut about it.",
        "OK, this part is heartbreaking to lots of security experts in Silicon Valley who kind of had Sullivan on a pedestal.",
        "They think of him as a role model.",
        "He's a former federal prosecutor, a public servant, and he hid this from regulators."

        "And I think that when you begin to question why things are the way they are, it brings to light the fact that maybe this isn't the most fair activity, maybe this isn't the most equal across-the-board activity, like the way that it's offered to certain groups of people, the way that it's advertised, the way that the issues that are like made important in debate aren't necessarily issues that are going to be important to certain groups of people.",
        "When women aren't ever discussed in debate rounds as people of importance or people who have an impact on what we do, then naturally women aren't going to want to be a part of that activity.",
        "When people of color aren't addressed as people a lot of times in debate, they're merely addressed as numbers, it's naturally going to turn off people of color.",
        "And we have to look not just at the actual activity itself but the way the activity functions sometimes to understand why like I would think that it's a racist activity.",

        "If black people make up 14 to 16 percent of our population, yet we make up 60 to 70 percent of the prison population; if immigration policy is going to disproportionately affect Mexican people or Mexican-Americans, then no, it's not racist at face value, but when you start to look behind the lines, yes, it is a very racist policy.",
        "That's what we're saying with debate, is that no, at face value it's not a very racist thing, but when you start to look behind the lines, saying for example that we're going to solve for racism, it takes on a different connotation when you have two African-Americans debating against.",
