        "Is that going to make attorneys and judges and courts in the future reluctant, just because of that, to take Skype testimony?",
        "Well, I think what's interesting about what happened in the Zimmerman trial is really that there were two technologies that were converging, that made the prankster issue arise.",
        "And that was really the fact that they were using Skype on television, and the user's name was broadcast for everybody to see.",

        "You know, the early hours of the takeover, there was a lot of adrenaline that we all had, all of us young Marines, and despite the adrenaline rush, we were frightened - there's no question about it - and surrendering the embassy to the Iranian government with the expectation that they would do their job under international law and set us free.",
        "Of course, they did anything but that.",
        "But, Scott, those early days of blindfolds and beatings and handcuffs and interrogations were anything but easy.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I did feel that we would be executed a couple of times.",
        "There was the mock execution in February of 1980, about three and a half months after we were captured.",
        "And that was without a doubt the most frightening experience that I have ever lived through and grateful that it ended without a shot being fired.",
        "And it was just another example of the intense desire by the Iranians to definitely let us know who was in charge.",
        "Of course, at one point, your mother, Barbara Timm - who I don't mind saying, is just a great lady - she came to Tehran and got to see you for a few minutes.",
        "She wanted to get you out of there.",
        "And went all the way across to the other side of the world to help her son, or try to, and reportedly the Ayatollah Khomeini was going to let you leave Iran with her.",

        "When it happened to me, of course the Weinstein brothers were relatively unknown.",

        "And every once in a while, if I felt I was in safe enough company, I would sort of shyly whisper, the casting couch is real.",

        "I don't buy that for a minute.",
        "That joke put those five actresses exactly in their place.",
        "It says to those five actresses, you used to have to pretend you were attracted to Harvey Weinstein.",
        "You don't anymore.",
        "And that also, you know - Harvey Weinstein 10, all those actresses zero once again.",
        "Yeah.",
        "How much of a direct result of what happened with Harvey Weinstein was your decision to study what you study in academia, to focus on the sexualization of women in your academic work?",
        "It certainly wasn't a coincidence.",
        "And I have to probably say that the line isn't a solid one but rather a dotted one.",
        "But it is definitely a dotted line because after that experience, I had many occasions in graduate school and in my early career when an older man who refused to comment on my words and instead, you know, says something about how pretty I looked when I was seeing them or a comment on what I'm wearing.",
        "The socially sanctioned right of men to do that began to occur to me as, you know, part of a continuum.",
        "You know, there was my experience with Harvey Weinstein, and then there were these experiences.",
        "And I thought, this is what I want to study.",
        "I want to study what it's like to become a woman in a culture where this is the case.",
        "Wow.",
        "Gwyneth Paltrow has also come forward with her own story about an experience with Harvey Weinstein.",
        "And she said this.",
        "We are at a point in time when women need to send a clear message that this is over, this way of treating women is over.",

        "Oh.",
        "So unfortunately, it's not clear whether tomorrow will be any better, but they'd really like to get back to Florida because that's where they do all the processing on the shuttle and, you know, it's much easier to land there.",
        "And what's the backup plan?",
        "Well, the backup plan, as you said, is to come into the Edwards Air Force Base in California's Mojave Desert.",
        "The weather there has been looking great all week, and there doesn't really seem to be any problem with bringing the shuttle back there.",
        "It's got all the landing facilities they need and that wouldn't be a problem, I shouldn't think.",
        "Well, why didn't they just try for Edwards today?",
        "Well, it's just--that's part of this business of trying to get back to Florida.",
        "I mean, the faster they get back to Florida, the faster they can turn the shuttle around.",
        "And, in fact, if the shuttle program is able to move forward after this, I mean, if they're able to get to a situation where they feel comfortable that they've figured out this foam problem--you remember earlier in this mission, a piece of foam fell off the external tank and they thought they had that all figured out, but it turns out they didn't.",
        "Well, if they get back to flying Atlantis and if they get back to flying Atlantis in September, which they dearly would like to do, they have to get the Discovery ready because the new rules say you have to have another shuttle ready to fly as a rescue mission.",
        "So if they wind up in California tomorrow, then they have to put it on a 747.",
        "They have to fly back to the East Coast.",
        "It adds time.",
        "It adds money.",
        "It's a big mess.",

        "Well, you know, the shuttle program has got a problem because the shuttles are aging.",
        "They spent a lot of this mission--they delivered the cargo that they had to the space station, but they spent a lot of the mission just making sure that the shuttle itself was safe to fly.",
        "So now they're going to have to do that again obviously because they haven't fixed this foam problem.",
        "And so they've got this situation where the shuttle is basically going to serve the space station until it's phased out, and I think that's scheduled for 2010 now.",
        "So it's space station or nothing, it seems right now, for the space shuttle program."
