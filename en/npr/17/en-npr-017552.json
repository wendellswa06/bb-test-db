        "You know, U.S.",
        "officials will try to frame this as a regional issue.",
        "And it is a regional issue in many different ways.",
        "What do you think then is the responsibility borne by those gulf countries - Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states?",
        "Should these countries be stepping up in a way they haven't yet against ISIS?",
        "No, they haven't stepped up in the way ought to.",
        "First of all, there is a history of tacit support to radical elements in Syria and Iraq, encouragement of tribes to resist essential government or to join hands with the extremists that helped actually create ISIS into what it is today.",
        "You know, we had a Camp David meeting, which was about Iran.",
        "We didn't have a Camp David meeting with the Arab governments to get our ducks in a row about ISIS.",
        "And I think part of the blame lies with the administration that has not made this into a priority in its conversation with regional governments, demanding of them certain change on strategy to address the ISIS problem.",
        "What tactically should the U.S.do that's not doing now?",
        "Well, the reality is that we will have to do more of what we did in Tikrit, which is American air cover allowing the Shias to fight.",
        "And the more honest we are about this, the more effective our campaign would be.",
        "So complicated strategic situations like Iraq calls for strange bedfellows.",
        "I don't think the Iranians like being seen in cahoots with the Americans any more than we like being seen in cahoots with them.",
        "Smoking has been on the decline for decades, and today we learn that it hit an all-time low last year.",
        "Just 15 percent of adults smoked cigarettes in 2015, according to a new survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
        "That's down almost 10 percent since 1997.",
        "Dr. Tom Frieden is the director of the CDC.",
        "Welcome to the program.",
        "Great to be here.",
        "So just how big a deal is this?",
        "And how do you explain the decline?",
        "But the reality is we both view ISIS as a mortal danger to our interest.",
        "And we both see that there is no alternative right now to this kind of tacit, unspoken of American-Iranian coordination.",
        "So American airpower does provide support to Shia militias that are armed, backed and trained by Iran's revolutionary guards.",
        "For so long as these Shia militias are the only possible response to ISIS, I don't think we have another option; unless we either wash our hands of Iraq and Syria and say whatever happens, happens.",
        "We don't care.",
        "Or that we say we'll have to do this ourselves.",
        "We actually have to put a lot more troops, money and resources into doing the fighting on the ground.",
        "And I don't think the American public would like that going into an election season.",
        "Nor is the American public actually being made aware of this reality that you don't have the luxury of some magical Iraqi security forces doing this for you.",
        "Vali Nasr is the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.",
        "He joined us in our Washington Studios.",

        "Henry Ford had declared he would never allow his employees to unionize and he meant it.",
        "And he had his own private police force euphemistically called the Ford Service Department.",
        "And the Ford Service Department consisted of a couple a thousand gentlemen, some of which were former prize fighters, some of them had been recruited right out of Jackson prison.",
        "And they provided the muscle, so to speak, on that day.",
        "Thomas Featherstone is an archivist at the Walter Reuther Library at Wayne State University.",
        "He also curated the new exhibit, \"\"No Greater Calling.\"\" He says Reuther and the others were punched, beaten to the ground repeatedly, and then thrown down the steel steps in front of the Ford plant that day.",
        "And it took four more years after this event of real struggle, lawsuits, mass picketing to get a contract with Ford.",
        "Reuther became the president of the union 10 years later, and he helped win things for employees like vacations with pay, medical insurance and grievance procedures.",
        "Caroline Merithew is an American history professor at the University of Dayton.",
        "She says although the UAW is not as powerful today as it was during Reuther's time, that doesn't diminish what he did to raise the living standard of the American middle class."

        "In 1940, Reuther suggested the auto plant should retool to make 500 planes a day, and that's what happened.",
        "The automakers began to manufacture equipment for the war effort and Detroit became the arsenal of democracy.",
        "Reuther also had a strong commitment to social justice, and the UAW actually financed the march to freedom in D.C., where Martin Luther King gave his \"\"I Have a Dream\"\" speech.",

        "He believed it was in the British interest for that to happen.",
        "So he was with his usual suspicion--and also to some extent lack of profound knowledge of the western world--believed that much of this was machination, because Hitler, and this comes as a second element, would be foolish.",
        "It would be very unlikely for Hitler to start a war, a two-front war, when the one-front war is not at all concluded.",
        "Now added to this comes a very important element that some people have known, and that's Stalin had a liking for Hitler.",
        "Stalin greatly admired Hitler.",
        "The odd thing is that his respect and admiration for Hitler appeared in drips and drabs even after the war started, even toward the end of the war, here and there he dropped some quite comfortable remarks about Hitler, or rather he had admired.",
        "And another element connected with this is that Stalin had a great liking and respect for Germans and for Germany.",
        "And that goes back to pretty early in his career.",

        "This was a contingency plan, though an important one.",
        "Then, in December, he orders the definite preparation for a campaign, and then, of course, the last decision is made just a few hours before the invasion begins.",

        "No, they weren't afraid.",
        "And the Napoleonic element did not occur to anyone.",
