        "Yes, I'm so glad you mentioned this.",

        "You conclude that Hitler and National Socialism remain more interesting and more extraordinary than Stalin and Communism.",
        "Why?",
        "Well, this goes, in a way, beyond the province of this book.",
        "But, you must understand, history does not repeat itself, but there were precedents of Stalin in Russia.",
        "Czars, brutal czars, there are some.",
        "History does not repeat itself, so I said.",
        "But in many ways, Stalin was reminiscent of Ivan the Terrible.",
        "Also, the Russians were not a very educated people.",
        "The Russians had not many traditions that were comparable to Western Europe, whereas there is no precedent to Hitler in German history.",
        "I mean, Hitler was, in my opinion, the most revolutionary, most extraordinary figure in the history of the 20th Century.",
        "And he was able to unite, very often for very bad purposes, and to unite and have behind him at least a majority of who--at that time, the Germans--were the most educated people in the world.",
        "That is something extraordinary--much more extraordinary than communism in Russia."

        "Well, if you look over the timeframe of this report, the big spike in violence was in August 2014, which, if you remember, is when ISIS did their big land grab.",
        "They took the city of Mosul and a bunch of other areas.",

        "Yeah.",

        "All the violence by different groups outlined in the report can - I think it can remind us that ISIS is just one of many violent actors in Iraq.",

        "Now, broadening this out, most Americans have been used to seeing images of what's been going on in Iraq, including the CBS reporter coming back with severe injuries from Iraq, but we don't necessarily see a connection between the insurgents in Iraq or al-Qaida and the armed militias of Somalia.",
        "Is it significant that the majority of both groups are, in fact, not only Muslim, but Sunni Muslim?",
        "Well, I don't think it's - we ought to make the assumption that simply because we're dealing with a Sunni-based insurgency in Iraq and Sunni Muslims in Somalia and other parts of Africa, that they necessarily share a common agenda against the United States or against Western interests.",
        "I think that there are quite diverse perspectives within Sunni Islam, and the Somali situation, in particular, needs to be seen in its unique national context.",

        "And once we were out of Somalia, in all honesty, I think there was a desire to close that chapter and move on and make constructive progress in the many other parts of Africa where that progress was possible; and there were many, and we did make a lot of progress.",
        "But that was as much an emotional reaction as anything else, and I think if we had it to do again, I think it would have been wise to get past the trauma and recognized sooner.",
