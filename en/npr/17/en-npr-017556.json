        "Muhammad is without a doubt one of the most important men in human history.",
        "But when it comes to Muhammad's own life, there's not too much we can say with historical certainty.",
        "The details of his life have been debated and manipulated since the birth of Islam in the seventh century.",
        "Kecia Ali's new book, \"\"The Lives Of Muhammad,\"\" examines the different ways his life story has been told from the earliest days of Islam to the present.",
        "Non-Muslims have been writing about Muhammad almost as long as Muslims have.",
        "And the things that they had to say about him were very much shaped by what knowledge they did have - much of it inaccurate - but also by current theological, political, social worries.",
        "So that when paganism was the concern, Muhammad was a pagan idol or a God.",
        "When heresy was a concern, Muhammad was akin to a Christian heretic.",
        "When fraud and imposters were the concern, Muhammad was a fraud.",
        "He was the arch-imposter.",
        "Over the centuries, European Christian accounts of Muhammad in particular, went through a variety stages and depictions.",
        "What begins to happen in the modern era is that European researchers begin to look at Muslim historical chronicles and sources and to merge their scholarly interests with their interest in Christian evangelism.",
        "And those depictions which claim to be historically accurate and based on early Muslim sources then engender a reaction from Muslim geographers.",
        "In the Islamic world, one of the most intense debates seems to be about whether Muhammad was divine or divinely inspired or a man just like any other man.",
        "Can you talk about what's at stake in that debate and if one particular view has prevailed?",
        "Well, I certainly think the view that has prevailed among Muslims has always been that Muhammad is a man.",
        "But the Muslim response to the traditional saying that Muhammad is a man is, yes, but like a ruby among stones, which is to say Muhammad is a man.",
        "But he's a very unusual sort of man.",
        "He's not divine, but he has the divine in him, in the sense that he is divinely inspired.",
        "His character is luminous.",
        "His ability to intercede on behalf of Muslims has historically been a very important part of his persona.",
        "He is the beloved of God.",
        "The way in which he surpasses humanity has historically been very, very important.",
        "I would say it's been down-played somewhat in some modern Muslim biographies.",
        "But that tension has always been present.",
        "And it's interesting how that fits in with, as you note, some of the more ecumenical-minded Western thinkers who would put Muhammad in with that idea of genius - natural genius.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And it's so striking to see the ways in which we move from Muhammad the imposter to Muhammad the genius, where you're unveiling what's real underneath.",
        "And of course this is in keeping with trends in the West to thinking in a different way about the presence of the divine, where it's not revelation from on high, but something innate in the core of the human being or at least certain human beings."

        "We're going to focus on particular norms that we want to see implemented.",
