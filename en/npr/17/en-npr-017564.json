        "I think they might in some of their more honest moments, or off the record.",
        "But some of the blame has to fall on the administration itself, the Obama administration, previous administrations, for not aggressively pursuing some of these nominations, for letting some of these vacancies just remain vacant.",
        "And there's also an incredibly intrusive process to become a nominee.",
        "They want to know a lot about your background, a lot about your finances.",
        "And for some nominees, I think it makes it more difficult for the administration to get nominees for some of these positions.",

        "Clinton was considered supportive of gay rights in the 1990s, though the end result was often messy and much-debated compromises, like the military's \"\"don't ask, don't tell\"\" policy, which has since been repealed.",
        "When President Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, it prevented the federal government from recognizing gay marriages in any way.",
        "Now the former president has written an article for the Washington Post.",
        "He says he only signed the Defense of Marriage Act in order to head off a movement for even stronger measures.",
        "And he says he has come to the conclusion that the Defense of Marriage Act is, quote, \"\"incompatible with our constitution.\"\" Two weeks ago, the Obama administration also took an official stand against that law, calling it a harsh form of discrimination.",
        "And later this month, the Supreme Court hears arguments in a case that challenges the law.",

        "He has defended the NSA's surveillance programs as both legal and vital to security.",
        "I asked if anything about the amassing of millions of Americans' phone records troubles him.",
        "I think any time you accumulate a huge amount of data, the key is what are the safeguards for that data's use?",
        "And frankly, that's true with big Internet providers that have all our information, as well as the government.",
        "The key element here is do you have the checks and balances on how that data would and should be used?",
        "If there's one other thing maybe that I do have some concerns about, I think it would helpful for people throughout the country to hear more about what is and isn't done because there is so much misinformation about this.",
        "So the extent to which it can be declassified I think is helpful for people to understand, as long as they also understand declassifying too much gives the enemy your playbook.",
        "And so it is that fine balance we're all trying to walk here.",
        "There was this question from a Democratic congressman on the Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, who asked, why not just use subpoenas to get the phone logs if there is a suspicious number?",
        "Why go through this huge dragnet of everyone's information if you could do it in a much more targeted way?",

        "Plan B, also called the morning-after pill or emergency contraception, has been available by prescription since 1999.",
        "Plan B is actually two pills.",
        "They contain the same ingredients as birth control pills, and when the pills are taken within 72 hours of sex, they are quite effective in preventing pregnancy.",
        "In 2003, BARR Pharmaceuticals, Plan B's maker, tried to get the FDA to allow Plan B to be sold over the counter.",

        "And now nearly two years into the debate, the FDA has yet to act.",
        "In late August, they announced they had made no decision one way or the other and instead opened a 60-day public comment period.",

        "Can you give us some idea why you feel that way?",
        "Well, because the FDA is charged with approving drugs for use in the United States based on their safety and efficacy.",
        "And this was a drug that had been reviewed by two advisory committees which voted 23-to-4 to approve the drug for use over the counter.",
        "The FDA's own internal staff then reviewed the application and also recommended it for approval.",
        "And after all of that and all of the scientific literature which supports the safety and efficacy of this drug, the FDA then decided not to approve it for over-the-counter use and the only other explanation is that this was a political decision.",
        "The reason that's a sad day is that although in this case both sides in the issue want to trumpet their involvement in the decision, in the usual setting, when drug companies for example are lobbying to have a drug approved or not approved, that will go on in secret.",
        "And we've always assumed that political pressure would not influence the agency, and now we find that it will.",

        "And I did not feel comfortable voting for approval at that time, and encouraged them to gather those data in order to enhance the fund of information that was available.",

        "Only 4.4 percent of the enrollees in the actual use study, which was presented by the sponsor to the FDA and to the committees, were less than 16 years of age, and we were not given any information about the effect on access to medical care of younger women.",
        "What would this do to young women if they chose to use emergency contraception and then elected not to seek routine medical care--they didn't come in for screening for STDs, they did not come in for Pap smears, HPV screening, they didn't come in to receive prescriptions for routine contraception, birth control pills, etc.? And also there was to be no age limitation whatsoever.",
        "We were told both by the sponsor and by the FDA that there would be no age limitation on the purchase of this medication over the counter.",
        "And so I felt that those pieces of information needed to be answered, the data needed to be gathered.",
        "And actually, if you look at the FDA's response to the sponsor, they gave them two options.",
        "One was to gather the data, which I think would've been the most prudent thing to do.",
        "The second thing--option was to change the age of prescription, less than 16 or less than 17.",

        "And that, to me, is an attempt to intimidate women.",

        "So I don't think that it quite makes sense to say in this particular instance we have to worry more about the safety of the drug.",
        "And to further support what Dr. Wood said, the American Academy of Pediatrics has come out with an excellent statement kind of detailing those factors.",
        "Yeah, and I understand that, Vivian, as far as the national organizations that Dr. Wood mentions.",
        "But the fact of the matter is that at the present time in this country, oral contraceptives are prescription items, and therefore that requires the individual to come in for evaluation of underlying medical conditions.",
        "I'm not arguing the safety of levonogestrol or Plan B, but it does require that they come in.",
        "So Dr. Wood says, well, if they went to the pharmacy, they would have to offers some identification.",
        "I'm not involved with those guidelines, but when a patient comes to the office, they offer identification.",
        "So is that restrictive?",
        "Does the fact that we provide medical care and require identification of individuals when they come to the office restrictive for the provision of medical care?",

        "My concern is that a 10-year-old comes in and purchases EC over the counter.",
        "I don't think she's mature enough not only to necessarily know how to take the medication--and if you look at the label comprehension study, fully 70 percent of the low-literacy group did not understand how to take the medicine, even though they got instructions; 33 percent overall.",
