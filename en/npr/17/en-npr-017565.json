        "Certainly a 14-year-old could buy condoms without their parents' permission as well.",
        "None of us thinks that's a good thing; none of us wants sexually active teens who are not responsible to be participating in intercourse.",
        "But the fact is that some do, and you have to ask yourself whether it's better to have a teen-age pregnancy, a teen who's not prepared to handle the demands of childbearing, or whether it's better to prevent it if the person recognizes that that is not what they intend to do, is have a child at this point...",
        "Ira, we actually have some data on that now.",
        "There are at least three studies that answer that question.",
        "Anna Glaser's study, published in Contraception out of Scotland, 16- to 29-year-olds showed no decrease in abortions when emergency contraception was available over the counter.",
        "The study by Tina Raine published in the Journal of the American Medication Association in January of this year showed that there was no decrease in pregnancy rate with advance provision of emergency contraception, and there was also a study that her group did, published in 2000, that showed that the users of emergency contraception used less effective and less consistent contraception overall.",
        "So we do know some of the answers to those questions.",
        "Right.",
        "But that's not--wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.",
        "These studies were designed to show what the effect on use of regular contraception was.",
        "And they unequivocally showed that women were not more promiscuous when they had access to emergency contraception.",
        "They showed there was no increased high-risk sexual behavior when women had access to emergency contraception.",
        "Right.",
        "And they showed that all the other gargoyles that had been raised about this were not true.",
        "They were not powered to detect a difference in pregnancy rate.",
        "And of course they didn't show a difference in pregnancy rate, given the numbers in the study.",
        "But clearly they didn't show an increase in all the awful outcomes that you've proposed, Dr. Hager.",
        "The second thing we need to talk about, which we've not talked about so far, is why emergency contraception should be available over the counter.",
        "The problem is that this is a therapy that's effective if it's taken within the first 72 hours.",
        "The efficacy decreases over time.",
        "So it's much more effective if taken within 24 hours."

        "Secondly, you're going to sit and sit and sit behind people who have been victims of car accidents, people who are in shock and so on.",
