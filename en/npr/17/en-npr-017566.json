        "You know, the science here is unequivocal, and while I agree with Dr. Hager--or Dr. Lewis, rather, that it's important to have all sides represented on advisory committees, Dr. Hager had the opportunity to argue his case vigorously at the advisory committee and was voted 28-to-3--23-to-4 that it--against him.",
        "That's the way the system's supposed to work.",
        "And a final check is provided by the FDA's own staff, and they, too, agreed with that.",
        "So in the absence of any data being produced by the FDA to back their current position, one has to assume that this was a political decision."

        "But I still don't feel like it should be over the counter; not for any kind of moralistic reasons, but I just strongly feel that the reason that I have young women and particularly teen-agers coming to me to have their Pap smears and get the education that they need is that they want oral contraceptives.",
        "They want to talk about these things and talk about Plan B even, and I really feel like if it's over the counter that they will just pick it up and not come to the doctor.",
