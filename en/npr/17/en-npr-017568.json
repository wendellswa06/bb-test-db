        "The stated reasons that President Bush gave for commuting all of Mr. Libby's prison time are somewhat hard to understand and perhaps even harder to justify.",
        "President Bush didn't take issue with Libby's conviction, but he said the sentence of two and a half years was too harsh.",
        "It was well within the federal guidelines, and Berman said among thousands of appeals in recent years...",
        "No federal appellate court has declared a single within guideline sentence to be unreasonably long.",
        "Berman said the president and his surrogates have consistently argued in favor of upholding sentences like Libby's.",
        "So, Berman said, Mr. Bush's actions undermine the notion of equal justice under law, and the American people are left thinking that the president's mercy only falls on his friends inside the Beltway.",
        "This president has pardoned more turkeys at Thanksgiving than he has shown mercy with respect to other offenders in our federal criminal justice system.",
        "That's three pardons, plus the Libby commutation, out of roughly 4,000 applications.",

        "And it is the extraordinary amity that the president exercises when he believes it to be in the best interest of justice.",
        "Since there's nothing Congress can do to change the president's pardon authority, Congressman James Sensenbrenner asked why Democrats called this hearing in the first place.",
        "What's going on here today is more braying at the moon by my friends on the other side of the aisle, who spend more time looking into real or imagined misconduct on the part of the Bush administration rather than doing the job that we were elected to do.",

        "Rich's ex-wife was a big Clinton donor and yesterday the Republicans on the committee used the Rich case as evidence that controversial pardons are a bipartisan phenomenon.",
        "But Democrat Robert Wexler said the Libby case is worse because Libby obstructed an investigation that could have incriminated the very president who commuted his sentence.",
        "Wexler described the commutation as a politically motivated quid pro quo.",
        "To reward Libby for halting further investigation into the White House's failure to protect the confidential identity of a CIA operative.",
        "Other Democrats maintained that because President Bush didn't pardon Libby altogether, Congress can't grant Libby immunity and force him to testify.",
        "During the hearing, the committee chairman announced that he'd just received a letter from the White House saying that once again the president has invoked executive privilege and decided not to give Congress documents and testimony about the commutation."
