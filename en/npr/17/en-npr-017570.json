        "Their goals are really to create a theocratic state in Pakistan.",
        "They want to oust the regime of President Pervez Musharraf, and they want to replace his government with a government that will institute Sharia Law in Pakistan.",

        "That's correct.",

        "Essentially, there is a rising militancy here, groups that are extremists are taking up a lot more space in terms of the public discussion.",
        "And they're actually getting some public sympathies.",
        "They don't have a large following in Pakistan.",
        "They're not a majority by any stretch of the imagination.",
        "But you do see a creeping militancy in the country, and it's come from Afghanistan, moved across the border into the tribal areas of Pakistan first, and now it's even coming to Islamabad, which is a city that really takes pride in the fact that it's quite moderate.",

        "How many students remain holed up there?",

        "The mosque's leader has claimed that he has several thousand students, the numbers have ranged between about 4,000 and 6,000.",
        "But the government has been calling now for the students to surrender.",
        "And we do understand that quite a few of them have taken up the government up on that offer, and we don't know how many are left inside the mosque at this point.",
        "Would you think hundreds or thousands or just dozens?",
        "It's probably a fairly large number still.",
        "I think that the numbers that have surrendered, they're significant, but it doesn't seem to be a majority of the mosque membership that's surrendered at this point.",
        "The government's strategy, essentially, is to break off the really hardcore militants from everyone else.",
        "It's clear that they're preparing for a raid, but obviously, at this point, with so many students inside, it could be a true disaster."
