        "For this summer, for the month of July, the videogame industry saw a 29 percent drop in hardware and software sales from the year before.",
        "Most of that I think is due to just, there not being a lot of blockbuster games this summer.",
        "But we're also seeing plateau-ing and drop in sales of the Nintendo Wii, which up to this point, has been a big juggernaut.",
        "It's still, you know, leading the current generation of consoles but it had a 54 percent drop in Wii console sales from the year before.",
        "So we are starting to see bit of a slowdown - some of that's recession, some of that may be other factors.",
        "But you're talking about a slowdown both in sales of the consoles and also of the games that people would buy for consoles they already own?",
        "That's a very, very important moment in Afghanistan because it's going to show us whether there can be a change of power.",

        "In the Pakistani city of Quetta, it is generally believed that Taliban leadership have taken refuge and that they actually run a sort of leadership group that's commonly called the Quetta shura or the Taliban shura."

        "Yes.",

        "Well, the Pakistanis are well-accustomed to this American agenda and have so far been judged, at least by the United States and its European allies, cooperative on al-Qaida and less cooperative on the Taliban, which has been a source of Pakistani statecraft and strategy in Afghanistan dating back almost a decade now.",
        "And there are elements of the Pakistan military who continue to believe that the Taliban is a useful instrument of Pakistani foreign policy in the region.",
        "Well, the Bush administration does consider Pakistan to be an important ally in its war on terror, but there are a lot of pressures on this alliance, from both sides.",
        "There are, and from the Pakistani point of view, one big question is trust.",
        "Do they really believe that the United States is going to be partner of the Pakistani army and of Pakistan in the long run?",
        "Or is this a short-term alliance, they ask.",
        "What are some of the domestic/political pressures on President Musharraf?",
        "Well, Musharraf has tried to manage politics in Pakistan from the top down.",
        "And it's been a very difficult enterprise, and he hasn't succeeded altogether.",
        "He faces opposition both from the sort of secular left, and at the same time he faces pressure from the religious right, which judges him to be a puppet of American foreign policy in the country and which has increasingly been uncooperative on domestic issues.",
        "Ultimately, what do you expect is going to come out this meeting then?"
