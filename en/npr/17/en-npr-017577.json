        "But Kellman says there is ample evidence that the lessons he learned while trying to force change from the outside never left him.",
        "For instance, when Obama returned to Chicago after law school with an eye toward politics, he used the skills he developed as a community organizer to work as a political operative.",

        "And it's been amazing, it's changed the face of politics forever, but that's out of his organizing experience.",
        "Perhaps a bit of an overstatement.",
        "It's a bit early to suggest that Obama has changed politics forever.",
