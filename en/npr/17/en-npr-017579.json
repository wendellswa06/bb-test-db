        "Obama used similar language earlier this month to describe what he was looking for in a Supreme Court nominee, a quality he summed up as empathy.",
        "Some conservatives have attacked that term as code for judicial activism.",
        "But Mr. Obama defended the idea during a fundraiser Wednesday in Los Angeles.",
        "It's amusing to me to see that word used as an empathy.",
        "But, you know, the idea of empathy is pretty simple, that you're standing in somebody else's shoes and you see through their eyes, that you make connections that you didn't know were there before.",
        "It's likely the president made some connections with Sotomayor whose improbable life story has obvious parallels with his own.",
        "Like Mr. Obama, Sotomayor climbed the Ivy League success ladder after a challenging childhood.",
        "Coming out of the South Bronx, raised by a mom who, a single mom, who worked as a nurse and put her and her brother through Catholic schools, bought the only encyclopedias in the entire neighborhood because she believed in education and the American dream.",
        "In addition to Sotomayor's biography and her legal experience, the president has touted her judicial restraint saying he was looking for a nominee who would interpret the law, not try to legislate from the bench.",
        "Some conservatives are skeptical of that.",
        "But Berkeley professor Gordon Silverstein believes that Sotomayor, while liberal, is unlikely to blaze new trails in social policy.",
        "When you look at her two decades in court service and if you look at both of her previous hearings during Senate confirmation, I don't think she suggests that this is somebody who's got a huge master plan and an aggressive new theory that's going to lead the court in major policy directions.",
        "And Silverstein argues that's a good thing.",
        "For years, he says Liberals have relied too heavily on the courts as an avenue for social change, instead, investing in the hard sometimes messy work of winning battles in the political arena.",
        "Obama's a perfect example of this.",
        "I mean, here's a guy who went to law school because and that's how you save the world.",
        "But I think he realized that if you really want to save the world, you got to do it through the political process.",
        "And so he leaves legal practice and he runs for office and, well, you know the rest of the story.",
        "In his 2006 book \"\"The Audacity of Hope,\"\" Mr. Obama seems to acknowledge the limits of change that can be achieved by judicial fiat.",
        "I wondered if in our reliance on the courts, he wrote, progressives had lost too much faith in democracy.",
        "However limited the president may see the courts role, Mr. Obama did not make his Supreme Court pick lightly.",
        "He sought advice from every member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Republicans as well as Democrats.",
        "And he read reams of background material about Sotomayor and other candidates."

        "Of the four finalists, Sotomayor was the only one Mr. Obama did not already know personally.",
        "Political Advisor, David Axelrod, told the PBS NewsHour they met for the first time in the Oval Office just five days before her nomination was announced.",
        "He met for a little over an hour, but he had a great deal of material about her.",
        "He had read many of her opinions, so he was very familiar with her record by the time that they met.",
        "And then they had a discussion that he described to me - a pretty dense discussion about very arcane points of the law.",
        "Sotomayor actually spent about seven hours inside the White House that day without being spotted by a single news reporter.",
        "The No Drama Obama team managed to keep a tight lid on the selection process, much as they did during the presidential campaign.",
        "News of Sotomayor's nomination didn't leak out until just a couple of hours before the formal East Room announcement.",

        "Moscow has denied involvement, but the fatal poisoning of the former Russian spy follows the very public death of another Putin critic, journalist Anna Politkovskaya.",
        "We asked people in Pushkin Square in the heart of Moscow whether they believed the Kremlin had a role in the former spy's mysterious death.",
        "Unidentified Man #1: (Through translator) It sounds delirious to me.",
        "I do not believe he was poisoned.",
        "It looks like a trick to me.",

        "Voices from Moscow's Pushkin Square.",

        "Let's just start with why so many people - whether they're correct or not in this accusation - have speculated that President Putin had something to do with this poisoning.",
        "I think the speculation is rooted in the fact that there have been so many of these incidents over time.",
        "And also they noticed that his reaction to them is not exactly one of fantastic grief.",
        "The federal government is slated to pick up the tab for a major expansion of Medicaid, but not until 2014.",
        "In the meantime, states have to apply for a special waiver from Washington if they want to make big changes to Medicaid eligibility.",
        "And compared to other states - notably Arizona - the changes New Jersey is seeking are modest.",
        "That's according to Jeffrey Brenner, director of the Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers.",
        "To Governor Christie's credit, he has chosen to innovate and to try and make Medicaid deliver better care at lower cost.",
        "So we need to put this in perspective.",
        "Even with the proposed cuts, Brenner says New Jersey's Medicaid program would still enroll roughly one million people.",
        "But that's little comfort to Crystal Snedden with New Jersey Citizen Action.",
        "She doubts the Christie administration's proposed Medicaid cuts will really save as much money as advertised."
