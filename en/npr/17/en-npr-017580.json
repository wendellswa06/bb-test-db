        "You can pick up newspapers that seemingly are very lively and are filled all kinds of differing points of views.",
        "That's fine, but those newspapers now have absolutely minimal circulation, and similar reporting is not allowed on the medium that everyone sees and everybody listens to, and that's television.",
        "So it's not a communist era elimination of the free press.",
        "It's actually a very clever trumping of the press so that all opposition is kind of sent into the corner where it can quarrel together.",
        "How, then, does the question of President Putin rolling back democracy, if you will - how does that fit in to stories of assassinations and killings?",
        "Well, the larger political context here is that Putin looked at the disaster of the late Yeltsin period and its chaos, its violence - and he decided that his goal as Russian president was, above all, stability."
