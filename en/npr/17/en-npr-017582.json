        "Two years ago, United and Delta Airlines created new discount start-ups to better compete with rivals like JetBlue and Southwest.",
        "United's start-up is called Ted, Delta's is Song.",
        "They were supposed to copy the lighthearted attitude and the lower cost of their competitors, but their parent companies continue to lose money.",
        "Delta just posted a quarterly loss of $388 million; United lost nearly $1 1/2 billion.",
        "That's left many wondering whether these spin-offs are having the intended effect.",
        "Christopher Elliott reports.",

        "You're on a big beautiful airplane.",
        "Song crew members shuffle to this tune while they demonstrate the safety features on the aircraft.",
        "And in that respect, and many others, flying on Song and Ted is dramatically different from taking a flight on their parent airlines.",
        "The planes are newer and there are free in-flight entertainment systems with interactive games and movies.",
        "What we set out to do and I think what we are accomplishing is creating a different personality.",
        "Joanne Smith is Song's president.",
        "She says its personality goes beyond what customers see.",
        "We built our platform on a sustainable low-cost structure.",
        "I mean, that is predominantly done by high productivity on the aircraft.",
        "It is really making the assets--the fixed assets that we have as productive as we can.",
        "But are the changes more than cosmetic?",
        "It's actually very hard to tell how well these units are doing."

        "One can infer that they are at least reasonably satisfied with their performance.",

        "He believes at least one of the airlines amounts to nothing more than smoke and mirrors.",
        "United is trying to convince the world that they have a low-cost entity inside of United Airlines, and all they've done is taken some airplanes, painted them and put--have exactly the same cost and the same fares as before and trying to convince the public that somehow United has lowered its costs.",
        "They haven't.",
        "How about Song?",
        "Boyd says Delta has made more of an effort to change its cost structure and go after new customers.",
        "Song is almost totally separate from the rest of the Delta system.",
        "It doesn't fly mainline Delta passengers.",
        "There's very little interaction.",
        "But even so, there's little evidence that either of these start-ups is contributing to a turnaround at the parent company.",
        "United, which spent $20 million to create a new airline, is flying under bankruptcy protection.",
        "Delta, which invested $60 million in Song, is widely believed to be close to a Chapter 11 filing of its own.",
        "And while no one wants to see that, it might give Delta the flexibility it needs to cut costs and allow the airline to become more like its offspring, Song.",
