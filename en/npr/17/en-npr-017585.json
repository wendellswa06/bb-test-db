        "Some people drink beer to unwind.",
        "Other people drink Sparks.",
        "A few years back, a small company in San Francisco concocted a beverage, malt liquor mixed with caffeine and some of the stimulants found in energy drinks.",
        "They called it Sparks.",
        "MillerCoors bought that company but has since faced opposition from 13 states and the city of San Francisco.",
        "They complained that the ingredients in Sparks often mask feelings of drunkenness and lead to risky behavior.",
        "We're joined now by Julian Green.",
        "He's a spokesperson for MillerCoors.",
        "Welcome to the program.",
        "Thank you for having me today.",
        "So, your company has announced some changes.",
        "What are they?",
        "Basically, under the agreement we've reached with several state attorneys general, we are reformulating the current Sparks product, which means we are taking out the caffeine and other ingredients, including taurine, guarana, ginseng.",
        "Can you tell me a little bit about how this concept got started in the first place?",
        "I kind of envision it as one of those Reese's moments, where, you know, you-stuck-your-chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter type thing.",
        "How do you bring stimulants and alcohol together?",
        "Basically, the interest in this category started to grow based on consumers.",
        "It was consumers that were looking to mix, let's say, caffeinated beverages - the popularity of Red Bull and vodka; you've seen consumers mix Jack Daniels and Coke, Irish Coffee - so, this was already a progressive category that consumers were interested in, and we were just - we wanted to participate in this growth, and we acquired this brand.",
        "Certainly, the market was moving that way.",
        "Now, we should note, Sparks has a higher alcohol content than most traditional beers, and one of the complaints that was raised is that if there's higher alcohol, but also caffeine, that might mask some of the effects of the alcohol, and that could be troublesome and dangerous to younger drinkers.",
        "What's been your response to that?",
        "Here's a point that I want to make clear: the Sparks brand actually is not higher than most beers.",
        "There are several beers in the market place that are six, seven and even eight percent.",
        "So, this notion that Sparks has any higher alcohol than anything else is totally false.",
        "The level of caffeine is in a can of Sparks is lower than your eight- or 16-ounce cup of coffee and some colas in the market place.",
        "So, basically, the caffeine, the guarana and the other ingredients was very nominal.",
        "So, this was not a product where there was enormous amounts of, you know, caffeine and these other ingredients in it.",
        "And again, this particular product was - I must, you know, reinforce - was federally approved.",
        "You know, we abided by all guidelines by federal and state regulators to get this product in the market place.",
        "But you're taking out all the stimulants.",
        "Why are you doing that, then?",
        "Their efforts - successful ones, I would say - to make sure that the chairman of the committees really served the entire caucus, not just whoever manages to be selected chair.",
        "And that's an important change."

        "Katherine Paterson, will you take us back to when you were writing \"\"The Bridge to Terabithia\"\" and why you wanted to write this book?",
        "It grew out of a friendship which my son David had with a little girl named Lisa Hill.",
        "And they were wonderful friends for the second grade.",
        "And the summer after they both turned eight years old, Lisa was struck and killed by lightning.",

        "This terrible thing had happened to your son, but you were also going through a trying time.",
        "Well, I had had surgery for cancer in the spring so the children thought I was going to die and then when Lisa did die, it was a very, very traumatic experience for all of us, and especially for David, because she was his very best friend in the world.",
        "David, what did you think about the book when it first came out?",
        "You had just suffered this lost of your childhood friend and then your mother is writing a book that also deals with the tragic death of a, you know, a young boy's friend.",
        "What did you think?",
        "When the book first came out, I was a little ashamed because here's this notoriety from something that was very personal and painful.",
        "It's like someone saying you have a really cool scar.",
        "Maybe the scar does look cool, but they have absolutely no idea how you got it.",
        "Did the two of you talked about it while Mrs. Paterson was writing the book?",
        "Well, after I've written the first draft, I read it to him because I wanted him to be able to say that he did not want it published, because even if he wasn't Jesse Aarons, I knew all his friends would think he was.",
        "But the only thing he said at that point was that he wanted it to be dedicated to Lisa as well as to him.",
        "So I changed the dedication to reflect that.",
        "The Bridge to Terabithia\"\" is a book of fiction.",
        "People always want to say that I am Jesse Aarons, but in all honesty, Jesse Aarons is my mother.",
        "It - her characters are her fears, her doubts, her hopes.",
        "And so when people say, you know, how close is the book to true life?",
        "Well, you can put as many comparisons as you want, but in the end it's a book my mother wrote."

        "I would hope so.",
