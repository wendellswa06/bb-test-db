        "And so the report, they say, is rigged or various other terms.",
        "The president used a term that we can't repeat on the radio to describe the report.",

        "But how do you proceed on impeachment?",
        "That's their concern because they say the Senate certainly wouldn't convict.",
        "So is it a political folly to move in that direction?",
        "Although, some Democrats saying it's worth it no matter what the Senate would do, I mean, because the important role that they feel they'd play, which really speaks to the moment for Democrats in terms of what to do next.",
        "Is this a good campaign issue?",
        "I mean, are they talking about it on the campaign trail?",
        "They aren't talking about it much on the campaign trail.",
        "Elizabeth Warren did bring it up, said that she thought that they should move to impeachment.",
