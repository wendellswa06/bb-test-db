        "That the other countries of the euro area will not allow that to happen, because they will lend the money needed to rollover the debts, or that the International Monetary Fund will make loans to enable this to occur, or our Fed would make swap agreements with the European Central Bank so that any run on dollar deposits in Europe could be met by loans from the European Central Bank.",
