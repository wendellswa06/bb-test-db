        "It did not win by all, you know, normal measures.",
        "On the other hand, I have to say that I think in these last 15 months Wisconsin's progressives showed that a battle against bankrolled austerity can be bravely waged and the importance of fusing independent movements with electoral politics.",
        "And again, your listeners probably understand how unusual a recall is.",

        "But a recall is unusual.",

        "A recent piece in the Wall Street Journal quoted the head of the Wisconsin teachers union who said a failed recall, quote, spells doom for the future of unions.",
        "I think one of the lessons that comes out of Wisconsin is that the labor movement needs to do a better job in terms of engaging and educating and mobilizing its members about the existential threat it faces.",
        "And I think that progressives - understanding the value of the labor movement.",
        "And after all, let's not forget, it is the labor movement and unions that built the middle class in this country and that were central to closing the inequality gap, which now plagues our politics and economy.",

        "And I wouldn't over-read in Wisconsin.",
        "I do think one of the central problems we face as a country, and the world faces, is that we're entering, you know, a period of scarcity and slow growth, and that will force this country to make big choices."

        "And here it's not just the unions, but it's progressives, I would argue citizens of conscience, will have to face the choice as to whether working and poor people continue to pay the cost for the mess caused by 30 years of failed conservative policies, or will people succeed in sending the bill to those who caused the mess?",
        "And most recently, obviously, the financial crisis, which stripped millions of people of their pensions, of security, of homes, and of the ability to send their kids to college, for example.",
        "These are the big choices we face as a country, and we face as we head into November 2012, which again I think some people today, particularly I would argue the GOP is being cocky, if I might, because they're over-reading the lessons of Wisconsin for November 2012, when exit polls showed, you know, that - you know, even those who voted for Walker, that Obama led, I think it was 52 to 43, leading Romney by significant margins among voters who re-elected Walker.",
        "Well, Katrina Vanden Heuvel, in terms of tactics, though, should unions rue their decision to support a primary candidate who in the end mounted not very much threat at all to Tom Barrett but proved to be a drain of their resources and divisive primary?",
        "Should they not have rallied around the candidate most likely to win?",
        "You know, primaries are vexing, but they're part of our democracy, and I think the labor movement has a larger question to ask itself in terms of not just the labor movement but independents.",
        "In the piece I write with Robert Borosage, which will be at thenation.com tomorrow, you know, the question of how you take elections seriously, in this case a recall, while continuing to organize independent movements and challenge the limits of the debate.",
        "Unions are facing an existential threat because if Mitt Romney becomes president, you will see the rollback of labor rights in ways we have never witnessed because those rights arose in the New Deal period of the '30s.",
        "So how do you balance the fact that you want to be more independent, you want to support candidates who understand the needs of working people in this country and are not tied to a corporate agenda, yet at the same time you have to defend not only your members but the rights of workers to organize?",
        "Part of what's happened in this country, it seems to me, is so many Americans, and this is at work in Wisconsin, don't believe government is on their side.",

        "They increasingly see both parties as compromised.",
        "They have little sense of an alternative and even less sense that anyone is prepared to fight for them.",
        "Progressives must therefore be willing to expose the corruption and compromises of both parties.",
        "This requires not only detailing the threat posed by the right but honesty about the limits of the current choice.",
        "That is right.",
        "I mean, I think we need to call it as it is, and part of what's gone on this country - and again, we saw some of this in Wisconsin with the extraordinary tsunami of outside corporate money, in this case seven to one for Walker.",
        "But both parties are in hoc to big corporate money.",
        "The fight is on to reclaim a politics from that big money and to rebuild the politics where government is on the people's side.",
        "Now, how we do that?",
        "You know, at The Nation we do it through investigation, through exposing, but we also need, and I write in the piece with Robert Borosage, we need to propose a vision of an economy and a society that is appealing and engaging to millions of people."
