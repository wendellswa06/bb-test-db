        "Yeah.",
        "I just want to make a comment about, you know, how the progressives portray the unions in the media.",
        "I mean, they portray them as a wonderful thing, and then you have the conservatives portraying them as a terrible thing.",
        "So I think if progressives want to get more people on board, they have to kind of admit that unions have caused problems for the country.",
        "I mean, I'm from Flint.",
        "I've seen what they've done firsthand and just the mentality they can get when they, you know, continue to grow and start to take advantage, progressives never admit that.",
        "And I think if they do, they'll get more people on their side, and then we can start winning these elections that we have to win.",
        "But until that happens, it's going to be unions are terrible or unions are the best thing in the world.",
        "And if we reach that middle ground, we'll get more people.",
        "You know, I respect your question (unintelligible) on the other hand, to me, over these last 30 years, we've seen a demonization of labor as it's been decimated and its numbers gone down.",
        "I think, sure, there's more democracy that needs to be part of unions.",
        "But I also think that unions need to reach out to a larger progressive movement and community so it's not simply about bread and butter.",
        "But you know, in these times, it's - the demonization of unions doesn't get us very far.",
        "And I'm Lynn Neary.",
        "Sure, there's some problems with pensions in states, but public sector workers are key to rebuilding this country.",
        "And the divide-and-conquer strategy of Scott Walker or, for example, John Kasich, who was repudiated in a referendum in April of this year, I think we need to - I do think unions need to do some education about what they provide in a country which is so heavily rigged toward capital and finance and wealth.",
        "I come back to the central point that labor unions have been key in this country, with all the flaws - you know, all our institutions have flaws.",
        "Chris Hayes, our Washington - former Washington editor, has a book coming out about elites.",
        "Elites have contributed in negative ways to our country at this time.",
        "But if labor unions can speak to how they have built the middle class and can rebuild the middle class in a terrain that is so rigged against working people, I think that outreach is critical.",
        "Ben, thank you very much.",
        "I just want to - Ken had another question.",
        "So thanks very much for the call, Ben.",
        "Katrina, this is kind of a cynical question, but let me just go quickly on this.",
        "I think Tea Party people will tell you that the best thing that could have happened to them was Barack Obama defeating John McCain in 2008.",
        "How does - would it be more difficult for the progressive movement to expand and grow with Obama's second term, given the drones and the expanded surveillance and the things that a lot of progressives are nervous about?",
        "I'm not saying that the progressives would rather have Romney than Obama, but would it be tougher for this wind to grow...",
        "Do they need a Barry Goldwater moment?"

        "I think - no, that's an interesting - I don't take that as a cynical question, Ken.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I mean, I think what happened in the first year of President Obama's time is that too much of the progressive community failed to stand and, you know, hold the administration accountable, for example, for failing to demand - make demands on the banks which took us into this crisis.",
        "I think that there's real understanding - and again, I write about this - that there - if there - it is critical to build an independent movement to push a White House.",
        "Sure.",
        "And I think that the space is there if we have a Democratic House, which I am hoping for, and President Obama in the White House, to push against policies we oppose and to push for policies and ideas we propose, than if you have a Mitt Romney where, as I said earlier, I do think you see clearly already not only repeal but rollback of any checks on, for example, a banking system out of control, a financial system that could well fail again.",
        "But it is always tougher, to be honest, for progressives to mobilize and organize when there is a Democrat in the White House.",
        "But we've learned.",
        "The first year was a year where there was too much that went undone, and that has changed in the last year and a half.",
