        "We know it's a cow, but we really know very little about where it's lived or what it's eaten along the way.",

        "In other countries, they'll put a little computer chip on the cow or give it something like a bar code, and you track the animal from the day it's born to the supermarket, and you know exactly where it's been and who's owned it and what it's eaten.",
