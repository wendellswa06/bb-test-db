        "Good to be with you, Neal.",
        "And the story of George McGovern and Bob Dole working together on a program after their political careers had ended - this was a different era of the United States Senate, a different era across party lines.",
        "But these were people who were frequently at loggerheads.",
        "Sandra, were you, when you had this experience when you went to the polls and you had to file an absentee ballot, did you then go around and talk about it with your friends and your neighbors?",
        "And what kind of conversations did you have about it?",
        "Yes.",
        "And as Robert Dole has written in today's Washington Post, they had quite a good relationship in their later years, even though they had obviously been at loggerheads politically during the prime of their respective political careers.",
        "I think it's also fair to say - and I think this is another point made by Senator Dole - that there was a time when you could be hammer-and-tong with your political opponents on the floor of the Senate and still go out in the evening with them and have a good time, have a little time together.",
        "And there were many, many occasions when they would have each other's families for dinner, even across party lines, and that they had real friendships, genuine friendships - hard as that may be for a lot of people to believe - that were completely apart from their political adversarial moments.",
        "It's interesting to point out that Senator McGovern did try again for the Democratic nomination back in 1984.",
        "It was unsuccessful.",
        "It seems now beyond the realm of possibility that a losing presidential candidate could ever come back and say, let me try it again.",
        "Let me be Adlai Stevenson.",
        "Well, Adlai Stevenson, of course, had lost in 1952, and then was nominated again in 1956 partly because people still like him a great deal and partly because people didn't think they had much chance to beat Dwight Eisenhower in '56, so they might as well go there again.",
        "But there was really different kind of purpose about what George McGovern was doing in 1984.",
        "He was not, at that point, the spear on a - the spearhead of a movement for - in this particular case.",
        "In 1984, he was running against Ronald Reagan's second term, trying to get the nomination that eventually went to Walter Mondale, another northern, Midwestern sort of liberal minister's son sort of fellow, very much like him.",
        "But he did not have, if you will, an organization, a movement behind him as he had had in 1972.",
        "He became the peace candidate, if you will, the beneficiary of all that energy from the '60s.",
        "All that anti-Vietnam war energy came to focus on the rather unlikely person, really, of George McGovern, who was the champion, who was willing to step out and say I am the peace candidate, and who eventually did get that nomination in 1972, but then, of course, was not elected in November of that year."

        "Nevertheless, it was, again, the post-career, post-politician George McGovern who made his peace not just with Richard Nixon, but with the - many of the people who carried out that operation.",
        "Yes.",
        "This does seemed to be a theme for a lot of people who have been at the highest levels of politics and been, in some cases, most unfairly characterized or even destroyed largely by character assassination, in some cases, or by dirty tricks or skullduggery - as in the case of some of the Watergate goings-on in '71 and '72 - making their peace not only with the general idea of what happened to them, but in an almost Gandhi-esque sort of way, going back and forgiving the people who had the dirty hands, the people who actually did it to them, put the knife in their back.",

        "Yeah.",
        "For me, I feel like - I don't think a lot about those who have run and lost, but I do have some expectations for those who have held office.",
        "For example, a couple of things I had mentioned to the former person was, for example, Jimmy Carter, who I think, across the board, is kind of looked at as a - or at least I hear him caused so many talk about as a failed president or a poor president.",
        "I feel like he is a true civil servant, and he has continued after his presidency to do really wonderful things.",
        "And then somebody like Clinton, who I think across the board - or not across the board, for sure, but he gets a lot of praise for how effective a president he was.",
        "And he continues to be in the limelight, but I don't look at him as a real civil servant.",
        "I think he spends a lot of time doing things that build up his image...",
        "Well...",
        "...whereas Jimmy Carter is a servant.",
        "And I wonder if being someone who really is a civil servant makes for an effective president, because - I don't know.",
        "That was kind of my thought.",
        "All right.",
        "Anyway, that's a little outside the ambit of this conversation, at least the way we constructed it.",
        "But, Ron Elving, Jimmy Carter lost to Ronald Reagan in 1980 and has, well, the Carter Center that he developed has played an incredibly important role in many foreign elections, monitoring the fairness and the - of the vote."
