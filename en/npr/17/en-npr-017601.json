        "The big thing, I think, that most cattlemen fear is the fact that information they gather will be used against us in some way, and also that the cost of running a system would be passed on down to us, which, personally, I don't feel that we can bear a whole lot more cost.",
        "The cost is $1.00 or $2.00 per animal for radio transmitter ear tags, thousands of dollars more for feed lots and meatpackers, who would need new equipment to track and maintain records of the animals they receive.",
        "Ronald Bibey says ranchers also worry about just who else would have access to a national database."
