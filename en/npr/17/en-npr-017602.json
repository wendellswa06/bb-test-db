        "The first thing that happened is when I went in, normally, you know, you are registered in the book that they have and they seemed to could not have found my name, first off.",
        "So in light of the fact that my name not being in the book, they told me I had to use the absentee ballot in order to have my vote registered.",
        "So I used the absentee ballot, thinking that would be counted, and then, like I said, come to find out they were saying he didn't have any votes.",
        "Did you feel initially that casting an absentee ballot was going to - did you fear that it was going to put your vote at risk just to cast an absentee ballot as opposed to a regular ballot?",
        "I did, because when I voted the last time, I didn't feel that my vote was counted either.",
        "Now, do you know if the vote actually did count in these revised versions?",
        "Do you have any sense, Sandra, of whether or not your vote counted in the end?",
        "No.",
        "Sam, what about that?",
        "Do you think that her vote was counted in the end?",
        "Well, I think, frankly, that it probably was counted.",
        "It's very important to remember - the Board of Elections keeps reminding us of this - that the count on election night is a very, very unofficial, informal count.",
        "It's done for the inconvenience of the press and obviously by extension to the public.",
        "But then under the law, the Board of Elections conducts its official canvas, which may take weeks.",
        "It involves a count from the back of the machines, which certainly would have corrected those clerical errors in the first count, and then to that they add the absentee ballots and to that they add the affidavit ballots, people probably like Sandra who showed up at the polls and they couldn't find a registration.",
        "But she swore on a ballot that she was in fact entitled to vote and therefore, they gave her an affidavit and it presumably counted.",
        "So again, it doesn't instill much faith in the process, for sure, and it shows how haphazard it can sometimes be.",
        "But it is a reminder that those votes that come out on election night or primary night are unofficial ones."

        "And now all of a sudden, they couldn't find our registration and we had - we were forced basically to use the absentee ballot.",
        "And did people talk about, for example, talking to a city coucil person or did you just say, well, you know, this is too bad and I don't know what to do about it?",

        "We didn't.",

        "And then once we heard that, you know, he had no votes for Harlem, then we then at that point felt that, you know, our initial response was that it wouldn't be counted is what happened.",
        "Sam, we asked the New York City Board of Elections to respond to the story, and a representative said that the issues were for the most part people showing up to the wrong polling place or voters not being properly registered for the primary, some people changing their names and not reporting a name change.",
        "And so looking, you know, from a, you know, a thousand-mile-up perspective, do there need to be some changes, you think, that make things easier for voters to understand how they need to register, whether it's on a party level, whether it's, you know, all of these other issues of name and address?",
        "Is that part of the problem?",
        "Well, I think there are two problems.",
        "One is the public need to be better educated and informed, that's for sure.",
        "And the rules as we've seen with people closely following the contests in many different states this year and the end of last year show there are different rules in different states.",
        "So people may not be familiar with the rules when you have to register, how late you can change parties, before the primary, things like that.",
        "The other problem, as Mayor Bloomberg in New York correctly points out, is that the Board of Elections is about the last vestige of formal patronage left in New York.",
        "It is very much controlled by the Democratic and Republican political organizations, has resisted for any number of reasons anything resembling efficiency or competence.",
        "And you've got a number of officials there trying to do their best against a system that just doesn't generate efficiency and productivity and great competence, frankly.",
        "And I think that's one of the big problems that New York voters have always had to face.",
        "Sandra, if you were going to give some advice to someone who's going to vote either in one of the upcoming primaries or just in the general election in November, what would you say?",
        "Actually, I'm not really sure.",
        "I was going to ask for some advice because I was concerned, like I said, with the fact with my name not being in the book.",
        "Is there something that I need to check, to find out, retrace, you know, in order to find out what went wrong?"

        "And, you know, he'd talk about people like Dazzy Vance and Duke Snider and Jackie Robinson, but then he'd start talking about a guy named Pete Reiser.",

        "And he would get this glazed look in his eye - this sad, faraway look - when he would tell about Pete Reiser.",

        "And I was fairly well-read as a kid on baseball history, but I had never heard of Pete Reiser.",
