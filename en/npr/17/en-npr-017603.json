        "I think that if, you know, we're talking about a few dozen cruise missile strikes over a couple of days, it will not change the sort of balance on the ground militarily in Syria.",
        "Again, the question is what is the president trying to achieve?",
        "He's framing the debate as that this is all about, you know, chemical weapons and a red line.",
        "I guess I want a broader debate, this very big question of what is the American role in the Middle East?",
        "I think that's what the American public is wrestling with.",
        "The answer in terms of a small strike is, you know, we don't want anything to do with it.",
        "The strike is a microcosm of this larger question.",
        "Well, I want to get you to articulate what you see as a larger vision but also maybe with the preface that the president hasn't gotten the support for even what you call this limited action.",
        "Does he really have the wherewithal to articulate a larger vision?",
        "He's trying to present this as sort of a no-cost intervention and that we can, you know, have an impact without risking any American lives.",
        "And I don't think we should, you know, be doing ground invasions.",
        "I think American troops will just make things worse.",
        "But I do feel that there are moderates in the region and there was a missed opportunity to work with the moderates in the Syrian opposition.",
        "You know, we sat back.",
        "We didn't engage.",
        "We sort of, you know, deferred to the Saudis and the Turks and the Qataris, our local allies, to take care of the Syria problem.",
        "And it's been a disaster.",
        "The Turks haven't done much.",
        "The Saudis and Qataris have armed jihadis.",
        "And now you have, at best, a 50-50 opposition with 50 percent being jihadis and 50 percent being more moderate Syrians.",
        "So, I'm on the side of, you know, you can do some strikes if you want to sort of weaken Assad's position but you need a stronger opposition force on the ground.",
        "And I do support a third step, which is you're trying to get Assad and his Russian backers to the bargaining table.",
        "Can there be any kind of political settlement with someone who uses chemical weapons on his own people?",
        "No, and, you know, the hope is that you can talk to the Russians and then the key here is you talk to the Iranians as well.",
        "In any kind of diplomatic settlement, Iran is key.",
        "We have to engage with Iran anyway in terms of their nuclear program.",
        "You're trying to set up this sort of chess board to hopefully get to an agreement where Assad, you know, is pushed aside, the Syrian army remains intact and there's some sort of interim government that does not lead to the complete collapse of the Syrian state.",
        "Would this president, who at least so far, hasn't gotten support for what's been advertised as no boots on the ground, series of strikes that might last a couple of days against a regime that has chemical weapons, have the political cover to open talks with Iran?",
        "In a speech from the Diplomatic Room at the White House, President Trump said Iran is not living up to the spirit of the nuclear deal.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification.",
        "We don't know yet.",
        "The higher-ups are huddling over this right now.",
        "But remember that during the Columbia space shuttle accident, a piece of foam broke off the fuel tank and hit the shuttle's left wing on the way up, and it actually punched a hole.",
        "And when Columbia tried to reenter the atmosphere it broke up.",
        "And that was, you know, a pretty small piece of foam, by sort of human standards, it was about the size of a briefcase.",
        "But remember the shuttle gets going really fast.",
        "It goes from zero to a hundred miles an hour in something like five seconds."

        "So there is a lot of concern about foam.",
        "They've been trying to take off as much foam as possible off the external fuel tank, whatever they think they can get away with not having.",
        "After Columbia, they took off that problem area.",
        "But on the next launch, another piece came off, so they took them a year to fix that; which is why this only the second launch since Columbia, three years ago.",
        "And they need - you know, they do need foam because inside that tank - this is a huge, you know, orange fuel tank; it's like the size of a grain silo or something.",
        "And it has ultra-cold liquid hydrogen and oxygen in it, and so they need to put some insulating foam on the outside.",
        "In particular, so they don't get ice that forms, and that could break off.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So it is - it's worrisome.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And how big is this crack?",
        "It is four to five inches long, and an eighth to a quarter of an inch wide - is what we're hearing.",
        "And it's sort of near the top of the tank, which is the part you would worry about, because it could fall off and fall down, and hit the shuttle.",
        "It's on a liquid oxygen feed-line.",
        "So, a line that carries the liquid oxygen into the tank.",
        "Which is a - you know, a line - you think of something like a power cable.",
        "It's 17 inches wide, this line.",
        "And the foam covers a bracket that holds the line to the tank.",
        "You say that NASA officials are huddling, now.",
        "What are their options?",
        "They could try and fix it on the launch pad.",
        "Apparently, they can bring out the scaffolding and get to this area.",
        "I think it depends if they feel like they understand what caused this.",
        "If they feel like, gee, where did that crack come from, then, you know, then I think all bets are off.",
        "You know, they would definitely want to understand why it was that this happened.",
        "But the crack apparently was not there on Saturday.",
        "And they were trying to launch on Sunday, and they filled the tank with the ultra cold stuff.",
        "And then they had to take the stuff out of the tank.",
        "And then on Sunday the crack was found.",
        "So I think there's some evidence that maybe it was due to the, you know, the change in temperature by loading it with the liquid oxygen, and hydrogen.",
        "Hmm."

        "So, but until they sort that out it's unclear.",
        "Well, they may have to remove the shuttle from the launch pad to fix it?",
        "That is, I think, that is one option.",
        "But, you know, they point out they have had problems with foam on the launch pad before.",
        "For instance, on one earlier launch, there was problem with a woodpecker who was very determined to peck his way into the fuel tank.",
        "And that left quite a number of holes in the foam.",
        "Which is just sort of, you know, the foam is like cork, or, you know, Styrofoam.",

        "President Trump has repeatedly called claims that Russia interfered in the 2016 election fake news, right?",
        "In a statement today, he said in part, it's time we stop the outlandish, partisan attacks, wild and false allegations, farfetched theories which only serve to further the agendas of bad actors like Russia and do nothing to protect the principles of our institutions.",
        "So what do you make of that statement, John?",
        "Well, I don't know if you're aware of this, Kelly, but our president has a bit of an ego, and he thinks that constant references to Russia's involvement or noninvolvement in the election takes away from his victory.",
        "I think it's time to step away from that.",
        "I think this is mostly a good news day for him with a little bit of bad news.",

        "That is very good news for the president, shows no proof of collusion at least with these people.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But I would move away from saying that the Russians didn't try to alter the election or tried to get involved in the election because we now have...",

        "Right.",

        "Students from our high school, from surrounding schools, and even famous athletes in Wisconsin were tweeting hashtag #ZStrong.",
