        "But when houses are in foreclosure, when things are bad on the property front, and incomes are down, you have a very hard time getting those nice, steady streams of revenues.",
        "So states are looking at shortfalls of all sorts, and they're not funding their pensions as fully as they should.",
        "So we've got a lot of kind of smoke and mirrors, and when you blow that smoke away, what you see is that states, and cities, as well, are in a lot more trouble than we'd like them to be in.",
        "And this comes after several years where, OK, besides the gimmicks, they have made cutbacks.",
        "Have they not?",
        "What's been cut?",
        "And that's a problem because this has gone on so long that states have been tightening their budgets.",
        "They've been cutting teachers, cutting all sorts of subsidies for state universities, for example.",
        "There are ways that states have been trying to tighten their budgets.",
        "But we're at the point now where those kinds of choices that you were saying what do we value, where you have to look at things like do we want to continue to have a state park that's open seven days a week, or do you have to start to cut back on those kinds of things.",
        "Do you need to really raise revenues significantly?",
        "Now, maybe you don't want to raise tax rates, but are there things that can be done, fees, you know, everything from a fishing license to fees on the turnpike, I mean, just any number of ways that states can try to raise revenues without calling it a tax increase.",
        "But again, a lot of those things that are easy to do have been done because this has gone on so long.",
        "Well, and then I keep reading about this vicious cycle: You cut back, and that further depresses the economy.",
        "No, they weren't.",
        "But the thing about it is that that's the work that I do, and I didn't know this until I found my family and found out what he did.",
        "So, you know, I work for battered women and children for a long time, and it's just, to me, supremely kind of ironic and uplifting that, you know, he lost his life on his way back to the United States to help marginalized women and children, and that's the same work that I'm doing.",
        "It is amazing how many people I've met over the years since the Titanic discovery that have a connection to the Titanic.",
        "It's quite surprising, that one degree of separation.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Kit, thanks very much for the call."

        "Right.",
        "...April 27, 1865, which is more than the Titanic.",
        "However, the Sultana was a wooden ship, where the remains had faded away from most memories, so is the tragedy.",
        "You also mentioned the Lusitania where 1,198 in 1915, three years after the Titanic.",
        "The Empress of Ireland was Canada's Titanic.",
        "More passengers died on the Empress of Ireland than the Titanic.",

        "I know you have also said that if you could go back and do it again, you would not publicize the location of the wreck.",
        "Yes, and I probably would go into the courts and argue for ownership.",
        "Now, it's interesting.",
        "When I found the Titanic, I went to the courts, and I said, well, can I own the Titanic?",
        "And they said, yes.",
        "It's an abandoned shipwreck.",
        "All you have to do is go down and retrieve one object of saucer or plate or something, come into the courts, and we'll make you the owner.",
        "But we'll make you the owner under one condition, that you remove it from the bottom of the ocean, which is - I was opposed to that.",
        "I wished I'd gone and got that one cup and brought it up and said, I want to turn it into an underwater museum.",
        "I'd rather take people there through the technologies we now have, and I really regret I didn't do that.",

        "Sherry with us from Wilmington in North Carolina.",
        "Hi, Dr. Ballard, I just wanted to say thank you for finding the Titanic because I'm somebody - I was about 25 when you did it.",
        "And up and until then, I was somebody who was convinced that there must have been sabotage involved because how could an unsinkable ship sink on its maiden voyage?",
        "I thought that was just too much of a coincidence.",
        "So thankfully, when you found the Titanic and confirmed it was an iceberg, it was a load off my cynical mind.",

        "And we forget the Titanic had sisters.",
        "Yes.",
        "She had an older sister, the Olympic, which made almost 500 crossings, as she just didn't hit an iceberg.",
        "She had the same steel, the same rivets, the same everything, and she just avoided the icebergs.",
        "And then her second - her other sister was - became the Britannic, which was sunk by the Germans during the Battle at Gallipoli.",
        "And thank goodness, she was a hospital ship, and she was on her way to Gallipoli empty and not on her way back.",
        "That would have been really tragic.",

        "And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And here's an email from Paul in Roseville, Minnesota: I think the reason the Titanic's story resonates with so many, including me, is that at its bottom, the story is straight out of Greek tragedy.",
        "The story of the Titanic is a story of hubris, the unsinkable ship - he uses that phrase again - ultimately struck down by the gods, so to speak, sunk by an iceberg.",
        "It's a powerful myth 2,000 years ago, 100 years ago or today.",
        "Yes.",

        "And I remember your comment that was very interesting to me as a teacher, that it took something like the Titanic to bring attention to ocean exploration, whereas something like the fantastic work they did on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, very little media was there to greet them.",
        "I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies to address the deal's many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear weapons.",
