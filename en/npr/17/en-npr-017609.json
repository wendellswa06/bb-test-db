        "I think it's a little bit early to declare John Roberts the new Anthony Kennedy.",
        "But even before yesterday's decision, everybody widely expected him to be the new swing vote on abortion.",
        "One of the interesting things, I think, is that Chief Justice Roberts may have different concerns motivating him to sort of sit in the middle on abortion.",
        "In part, they're concerns about the Supreme Court's legitimacy and reputation.",
        "There's no reason to think that Chief Justice Roberts is particularly sympathetic to abortion rights claims on the merits.",
        "That said, he may have a concern about the way the court approaches abortion rights cases, especially if it looks as if the court has made a sharp swing to the right when it has a majority of nominees who are both Republican but also who seem committed or at least predicted to overturn Roe v.",
        "Wade.",
        "The biggest concern, I think the single biggest worry that people who really look at these state budgets get to is the infrastructure.",
        "You need roads to break this cycle.",
        "You've got to be able to attract businesses.",
        "And if your roads are full of potholes, if the port in your state is not functioning well, if you're allowing your airports to go downhill, if there's no investment in infrastructure, it makes it very hard to break this cycle and start to grow again.",
        "You know, I was looking at state defaults from the 1840s.",
        "That was a real problem.",
        "There were like eight states that filed for bankruptcy back in the 1840s.",
        "I didn't know there was a recession back then.",
        "Well, yeah, they ran into a little trouble.",
        "They got ahead of themselves on some building projects, and there was a downturn, and they defaulted.",
        "But what really saved them was how fast the country was growing.",
        "The railroads came along.",
        "You know, eventually they were able to work their way out of their problems just because the economy took off.",
        "And in some ways that's sort of what happened with New York City.",
        "You may recall in the 1970s, New York City ran into just a tremendous budget shortfall, and they had to get federal loans to work their way out of it.",
        "Well, New York got onto much better footing once the city turned itself around in terms of getting the economy growing again.",
        "Wall Street started booming, real estate took off, and they were able to get past those problems of the '70s.",
        "By the time you got into the '90s, they were able to get away from that debt-deficit cycle.",
        "So right now that's where states are at.",
        "They need to be investing in schools.",
        "They need to beef up their universities.",
        "They need to improve their transportation systems to attract the businesses of the future.",
        "But it's really hard to do that when your budget deficit is as bad as they are.",
        "All right, we're asking callers what they value and they would be willing to give up.",

        "And I'm willing to pay more, absolutely, for the infrastructure side of things, for the business development side, as well as those essential services that we all consider to be part of our lives for the greater good.",
        "And I'm a small business owner.",
        "I have a hard time with high taxes, but I'm totally disgusted with my former Republican Party for their intransigence on this position that I feel has left us a rather selfish, self-centered and really victim mentality society when it comes to taxes.",
        "We need leadership to articulate a vision, and then I'll give Reagan the benefit of the doubt on this one.",
        "I though President Reagan did a wonderful job mobilizing the nation behind a vision of positive, positive, greater-good sacrifice...",
        "OK, but back to the actual budget, you would be willing to pay more for infrastructure, you said?",
        "Absolutely, and roads and bridges, as well as - I personally am very forward-looking on the whole energy front.",
        "I think the states need to become independent of the national energy scene and develop their own energy policies.",
        "And there's a great return on that.",
        "In the state of Iowa, we have $33 billion that's currently contributing to our state from the largest wind power, as well as other alternative fuels development policies that make a huge difference.",
        "And I'm willing to pay more taxes for this kind of forward thinking.",
        "OK, I think Marilyn Geewax has a question for you.",
        "I just wanted to jump in on this issue of the infrastructure that he brings up, mentioning the word bridges especially.",
        "Right now, interest rates are so low that states could borrow money pretty cheaply to do those things, to fix the bridges.",
        "Exactly.",
        "The day may come when we'll look back on this time and say, oh, my God, I can't believe we didn't do what we could have done at interest rates that were that low."

        "Wow.",
        "All the states have been weathering through these difficult times during the recession, but California got hit harder and earlier than probably any other state in the country.",
        "Give you a couple of numbers to touch on that.",
        "From 2007 to 2009, the state's general fund revenue dropped by 25 percent.",
        "It went from $95 billion down to $71 billion.",
        "And in terms of the number of jobs that we lost during the recession, from the peak to the trough, we lost more than 1.3 million nonfarm jobs.",
        "And as of the first quarter of this year, we're still down about 935,000 jobs.",
        "And according to our latest economic forecast, we won't get back to those pre-recession levels until the fourth quarter of 2015.",
        "So that kind of gives you some idea of the magnitude.",
        "The pre-recession levels of income coming in.",
        "No, the pre-recession levels of nonfarm employment in California.",
        "Oh wow.",
        "So I have, just as a lay listener here, not living in California, I've heard a lot of stories in the past few years about teacher cuts in the public schools.",
        "And I'm not what else they've cut.",

        "About $8 million of it would be in expenditure reductions.",
        "But we've tried to do some - not take a meat-axe approach to it and to be thoughtful, and I'll give you a case in point.",
        "In our Medi-Cal Program - it's California's version of Medicaid - we have a number of Californians who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.",
        "And the problem that we've had is there's been kind of a bifurcated care system that's been more costly and has led to more issues of hospitalization and higher costs of care.",
        "One of the things that's part of the new budget that was adopted is a coordinated care initiative that integrates care for those individuals who are both in Medicare and Medicaid.",
        "And that's going to generate about $600 million in savings, we estimate, in the coming year.",

        "Other tough things that you had to cut, though?",

        "And the governor - the budget is predicated on that measure passing.",
        "So what happens if it doesn't?",

        "That's - well, how could you do that?",

        "State budgets across the country are in crisis, so let's talk for a minute about why that matters.",
        "Here's one big reason: About 15 percent of all workers in the U.S.",
        "draw paychecks from state or local governments.",
        "That is 19 million workers, six times more than the federal government employs.",
        "That's the big picture, but the details are significant too.",
        "For example, state and local governments pay 90 percent of all the money spent on educating kids through the 12th grade.",
        "So when state budgets are maxed out, and cuts are on the table, as they have been for years now, it affects just about everyone, and cuts are unpopular, but so is raising revenue through taxes.",
        "So what do you value that your state provides that you'd be willing to give up or pay more for?",
        "Our number is 800-989-8255.",

        "You said that the governor there just passed a budget that's predicated on some tax increases that will be put to ballot this fall.",
        "What happens if they don't pass?",
        "Well, what happens is that we still have an obligation to have a balanced budget.",
        "So if that measure does not - is not approved by the voters, then the legislature has already pre-approved roughly $6 billion in what are called trigger reductions that would automatically go into effect in January of 2013.",
        "The largest share of those would be in education, nearly $5.4 billion of that $6 billion would come from K-through-12 schools and community colleges.",
        "And to give you an order of magnitude, that would be the equivalent to taking three weeks off of the school year next year.",
        "Wow.",
        "So - and also we're talking about trigger reductions of about $250 million each for the University of California and the California State University system.",
        "So that's the backup plan should the ballot measure not be approved."
