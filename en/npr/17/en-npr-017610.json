        "The things he just enumerated there are such great reminders of why state budgets matter so much.",
        "We've heard a lot in the recent years about the battles in Washington over the federal deficits and the national debt, and that's certainly an incredibly important issue, but states are really where we live.",
        "I mean that's the intersection of our lives and government that he's talking about.",
        "So while I may never see in my lifetime - or I hope I don't - see, you know, guided missiles flying over my house, or I don't see fighter jets, a lot of the spending that happens at the federal level, it's not directly a part of my life.",
        "But the policeman on the beat, that's a part of my life.",
        "Schoolteachers, the things that are - really make a citizenship enjoyable and important, having everything from a community swimming pool to a schoolteacher you trust with your children, those are the things that states and cities are in charge of, and these budgets have not gotten a whole lot of attention, and yet they're really absolutely critical to how we live.",
        "And I think these issues, especially in California, it's come much more to the fore.",
        "I mean I think you folks in California have been more aware of your state budget, but the rest of the states are catching up as everybody struggles with this.",
        "We've got a couple of emails here.",
        "David writes in: I would pay more property tax to support my schools.",
        "I just think they're too afraid to ask and can't seem to put the ask in a good context.",
        "A $100-per-house would - $100 per house would make a dramatic impact on education.",
        "Just tell us what it would mean for teachers, classrooms and so forth.",
        "And I'm not sure where David's writing in from there.",
        "Sara(ph) in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, writes: I worked for the local arts organization in my town for a few years when I was earning my degree in art history.",
        "I loved working with local artists, providing opportunities for them.",
        "When the state of Pennsylvania needed to cut funds for budgeting, although I find the arts incredibly important, I agree with the funding cut to the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts.",
        "So some really tough calls.",
        "H.D.",
        "Palmer, what was something that was discussed and maybe kept in the budget?",
        "Well, there were a number of things that were discussed, and some of the things were not approved, what the legislature was considering, that the governor felt wasn't going to lead to a balanced budget or wasn't going to be a solution that was going to be long-term.",
        "One of the things, to get back to some of the more thoughtful reductions that we're trying to do, is in the public safety area.",
        "We have what's - we're in the second year of what's called realignment, where instead of having low-level offenders be supervised at the state level, they are being transferred to the counties."

        "We're not just sending those inmates to the counties, we're also sending dedicated revenue of about $6 billion this year.",
        "And we think that's going to accomplish three goals.",
        "Number one, it's going to reduce the state's prison population.",
        "We're under a federal court order to reduce our prison population, which had been almost crowded at twice its capacity.",
        "The second thing is we're going to achieve budget savings.",
        "We're going to reduce our corrections budget, which had been growing dramatically, by about a billion dollars on a year-over-year basis.",
        "And the third thing is that as well as having the responsibility of these inmates go to the local level, we're also sending down dollars and programs for related things like mental health services, substance abuse treatment, foster care, that we think taken as a whole is going to make it more likely that these low-level offenders are not as likely to re-offend.",
        "So that's another kind of one of the thoughtful ways that we're trying to approach the necessity of achieving savings (unintelligible).",
        "So you're still looking long-term.",
        "How can we do something today that's going to save money five years from now?",
        "Right, and if you look at the roughly - the solutions that we just adopted in this budget, more than half of them are ongoing, in terms of having a multi-year effect, and that's one of the problems that we had in recent years, is a number of the solutions in the state budget were one-time in nature, or they really weren't realistic.",
        "The budget that was adopted in 2010, for example, assumed that there was going to be $4 billion in assistance coming from Washington, D.C., that clearly was not going to materialize and did not materialize.",
        "So we're trying to move away from those short-term fixes and unrealistic fixes and look for more long-term stability and structural, getting it to a point hopefully in the next few years of structural balance.",

        "So what is the toughest call that you've had to make there as you close your budget?",
        "And maybe give us a sense of what your deficit has been.",
        "Well, when - you may know, a couple years ago Governor Walker was elected and was facing a $3.6 billion deficit.",
        "And that had been a structural deficit that had been well over a billion dollars for well over 10 years.",
        "And so what he was looking for was a way to really focus and attack that deficit without raising taxes.",
        "And what he has done, which other states are looking at, as well as some municipalities and localities, is looking at the personnel side of it regarding contracts, labor contracts, retirement contributions and health insurance premiums.",
        "And he had put in a budget repair bill that had dealt with the collective bargaining laws, which therefore gave municipalities the flexibility regarding requiring employees to make increased contributions to their retirement, as well as increased contributions toward their health insurance premiums.",
        "And by doing that he also reduced the amount of aid that he had put to his - to the localities, by over $800 million, especially with the schools, but again gave those municipalities and localities the flexibility then to work on the contributions from the public employee side.",
        "Right, and we did see how controversial a lot of that was there in Wisconsin.",
        "You mentioned how difficult it is to raise taxes.",
        "I'm wondering: Are there other sources of revenue that you've been able to find, other acceptable ways to bring in money?",
        "Because so many people who look at this problem say it's just hard to do just cutting, you kind of need to bring in more money in some way.",
        "Well, when you look at the state of Wisconsin and, you know, basically how our budget works out, 50 percent of our budget basically goes to assist local governments, and then another 22 percent goes to individuals.",
        "Only roughly 20 percent goes towards operations if you're not counting the university.",
        "So when we're talking about revenues to come in, the majority of our revenues come from taxes.",
        "And so if we're going to be trying to do something that is going to deal with the budget and also deal with revenue, you have taxes and not much else.",
        "You have taxes, which is 50 percent of your revenue.",
        "Your - thirty percent comes from the federal government, and 10 percent comes from program revenue itself.",
        "Excuse me, this is Marilyn Geewax, and I'm wondering: Did you folks do anything like raise, you know, hunting fees or transportation fees of some sort?",
        "There may have been a little bit of what I guess - what I'd call nibbling at the edges.",
        "But even then, when you're talking about total dollar amount, those are just drops in the bucket.",
        "Of that, what you're basically coming down to when we're talking about this, is you're talking about millions of dollars when you have to deal with billions of dollars in deficits so - and I'm - to not be political, what one side of the aisle is looking at is they believe that a structural part of it have to do with looking at it from the employee side, or the public employee side, since the majority of a state budget and a municipal budget deals with paying of workers.",
        "So what the governor and the Republicans looked at was trying to address the issue of retirement, and health insurance benefits, and salaries and do it from that side as opposed to from the revenue of raising fees or taxes."

        "Well, I think this is, first of all, a very important conversation because I think when it comes to spending in our nation, in general, the question of value and priority is really what that question here, and not whether we have the money or not, but what we decide to spend our money on.",
        "That being said, I am someone who think that spending needs to be done wisely, so we shouldn't be spending willy-nilly.",
        "But one thing that's very important that I would be willing to spend as much as it takes to continue it in the state of New York where I live, is Medicaid.",
        "I think we are - we've forgotten that in 2008 right prior to the downturn in the economy, the most important, the most pressing issue during the 2008 elections was health care and the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of Americans who are, to this day, being crushed by the burden of financial care, especially those who would be qualifying for Medicaid where they have very little sources, and that is the one and only resource for them to get access to care.",
        "And if we want to be a country that is going to reduce funding in other places - if we're going to cut arts programs, if we're going to reduce the amount of recreational activities such as opportunities for after school or local pools or community centers - well, then we need to be able to deal with the consequences of that lack of community care, and it comes out in effect that people aren't going to be getting their needs met.",
        "And therefore, those will manifest themselves in physical maladies and the fact that people are not going to be able - they're going to have mental health concerns then.",
        "These are - this is a very vulnerable population.",
        "And in the state of New York, I think that we need to prioritize Medicaid, and I'm willing to spend whatever it takes.",
        "That doesn't mean I'm willing to spend willy-nilly, but I'm willing to spend whatever it takes in order to ensure that members of my community, regardless of their ability to pay or what got them in that circumstances, are taken care of because that is what we should be valuing as a nation.",
