        "Scott Feldt, who do you listen to?",
        "There must - I can only imagine all the lobbying and the concern and everyone worried about their program being cut, and people have different values when it comes to what they'd make a priority of?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And to, basically, refer back to the previous caller, actually, I serve on my local school board.",
        "And so, what's very interesting about when you go from a state budget to a local budget, it's much more personal when you're dealing with a school board budget, because you're talking about children's kids that you meet at the little league games or that you're talking to the parents at the grocery store, and you are - when you make those decisions regarding those budgets - what to cut, what to fund - it has a personal - a truly personal impact that you can see firsthand, which therefore makes it at times very difficult and very challenging and sometimes very rewarding.",
        "As for who we listen to, we have to remember we have, you know, 99 legislators in the assembly and 33 senators in the state Senate, plus you have a whole list of constituency groups.",
        "So what we need to do is not only take them into account, but also just the financial realities, when we talk to our legislature, the fiscal bureau, the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance and the number of these groups that have some financial acumen, as well as, can show you the fiscal trends that have been going on year after year and what can be done to help reverse the trend of deficits and try to bring us back up into surplus.",

        "So, Marilyn, in the moment we have left, the state task force today warned of worse to come unless states kind of change the way they draw - come up their budgets.",
        "What have they recommended?",
        "Really, key thought here, is that there needs to be more honesty, that people really have to look at this in a way that addresses the problem, not just the smoke, the mirrors that cover it up and kicking in to the next year, that it's time for states, cities, to set these priorities.",
        "What are our values?",
        "Do we really want to cut police, or do we want to cut schools, or do we want to cut Medicaid?",
        "We need to actually come up with a list and be much more honest about it.",
        "And that's really the driving thought behind this, is to expose just how serious the problems are and the choices need to be made.",
        "And if we don't, the long-term consequences will be serious.",
        "For example, if a bridge collapses because of lack of maintenance, it will be a lot more expensive to fix it in the future.",
        "They want people to deal with it, honestly, now.",
        "Marilyn Geewax, NPR senior business editor, here in Studio 3A.",
