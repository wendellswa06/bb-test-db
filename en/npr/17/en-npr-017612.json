        "Kelsey, thanks so much for joining us.",
        "Thank you for having me.",
        "Well, it doesn't really seem like we're seeing the flurry of last-minute negotiations and talks that we're used to seeing before a possible shutdown.",
        "Is there a plan out there to prevent this from happening?",
        "There really isn't that we have seen so far.",
        "I have talked to staff for all of the major leaders, and none of them can tell me how this gets fixed.",
        "Republicans in particular say it's almost entirely a conflict between Trump and the Democrats, as we heard earlier this week at the White House.",
        "Basically, there isn't a spending bill that can pass Congress without votes from Democrats in the House and the Senate.",
        "So President Trump has to decide if he'll sign something that will almost certainly involve him losing out on some if not all of his border wall demand.",
        "That's the - really the only way that Democrats are saying there can be a solution.",
        "So, you know, earlier this year, I think people may remember that the Democrats were talking with President Trump about a deal to approve some money for the wall in exchange for legal protections for immigrants who were in the country illegally after being brought here as children - the so-called DREAMers.",
        "Are the Democrats still willing to negotiate on that?",
        "I've been talking to Democrats a lot, and they say that that is definitely off the table.",
        "There's a lot of blame to go around for why that original deal fell through.",
        "But none of the Democrats I've spoken with are willing to even entertain it at this point because things basically have changed.",
        "They think the election was decisive on this in a couple of ways.",
        "One, lots of voters - not just Democrats - say they support protections for those immigrants.",
        "Those are the people who were covered under President Obama's program of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA program.",
        "The other thing is they don't trust President Trump, and they just don't believe that things will actually get resolved here.",
        "And the third and maybe biggest issue here is deals like that rely on having some moderates, particularly in the Senate, who are willing to bridge the gap between Democratic leaders and the rest of their party and the president.",
        "And over in the Senate, most of them lost.",
        "None of them seem remotely interested in betraying their party politics as their very last vote in Congress.",
        "So do the Democrats have all this leverage?",
        "How did that happen?",
        "Yeah.",
        "They still need 60 votes in the Senate, and Republicans don't have 60 senators, so they have to get votes from Democrats.",
        "And traditionally, they've had a hard time passing spending bills on Republican votes alone in the House, too.",
        "And that's really only gotten worse here in December.",
        "A lot of Republicans haven't been around in voting since after the election.",
        "Some people lost and want to go home and be with their families.",
        "And then there are those other people who want other jobs.",
        "Like, think about Kristi Noem, who gets sworn in to be governor of South Dakota next month.",
        "She has to build a whole staff.",
        "And Marsha Blackburn was elected to the Senate, and she also has to do the same thing."

        "The other thing that I think people need to remember is there are the optics of shutting down the government over the holidays when employees will be without a paycheck - lots and lots of government employees.",
        "And Trump has already said he would own all of those consequences.",
        "So is there a way out of this that avoids a partial shutdown next weekend?",
        "Well, one option is a short-term spending bill that would move the negotiations to January.",
        "Or Trump could maybe accept the Democrats' offer.",
        "One thing I've also heard floated is that they could come up with some sort of big package that maybe satisfied other demands from Democrats in exchange for a small amount of border security funding so that Trump can walk away and say he got a little bit of something.",
        "So if this shutdown happens, what does that mean in terms of both services that will be affected and people who will not be getting paid?",
        "Right.",
        "You know, I mentioned that there would be those people who would have to work and maybe not get paid.",
        "And this particular shutdown would really only affect about 25 percent of the government.",
        "And that might seem small, but there's some pretty important agencies involved in that.",
        "There's the Department of Homeland Security.",
        "There's the Security Administration - the people who do the airport screening.",
        "And the national parks are all on the list of places that won't have funding.",
        "So you have essential employees like border agents or people who are doing those checks at the airport.",
        "They would all have to work without a paycheck, and everybody else would be sent home.",
        "So the consumer, although not totally irrelevant in higher ed to be sure, is not as important.",
        "Now, I might add there's other consumers besides students in a major university.",
        "In research universities, there's a research component and so forth.",
        "But by and large, instruction is still the bread and butter of what puts American - the bread and butter of American higher education.",
        "We want to hear from our members of our audience who work at colleges and universities.",
        "Why is the cost of those - education at those four-year institutions so high?",
        "Give us a call, 800-989-8255.",
        "Email us, talk@npr.org.",
        "We'll start with Dennis(ph) and Dennis on the line with us from Rochester, New York.",
        "Yes, I teach science and engineering at a couple of private schools, and I also, along with my wife, put six children through college.",
        "And so we have a firsthand knowledge of the costs having gone up and also why.",
        "And first I'd like to agree with the guest that there's no incentive at all to reduce costs, and I do - and I say that as a comparison with private industry, in which I've seen tremendous cost-cutting over the last two decades."

        "I think a second factor is the physical plants, all the building.",
        "It means that the fixed cost of just keeping the university open has gone up a lot.",
        "I mean, you don't see buildings being torn down.",
        "You just see them being built.",

        "I remember a story, I was talking to a Cornell professor at one time, and he said when he started there, the dean of engineering had two assistants and that when he retired he had 56, there were 56 on the staff.",
        "And, you know, that's the kind of - so I think the amount of administration has gone up as quickly as the cost of tuition, which has gone up, since I was in school, by 3,000 percent.",
        "And I assume that there was some considerable sticker shock between your oldest going to college and your youngest.",
        "Yeah, that's right because there was actually nearly a 20-year difference in their graduation years.",
        "And so yes, it was a substantial increase.",
        "And we actually handled that by having him find the best state universities, which are still a bargain.",
        "And then they go to private universities in grad school, when they, you know, can get teaching assistantships and this kind.",
        "All right.",
        "If you had one idea to reduce the costs, Dennis, what would it be, every time you have to build a new building, you tear down an old one?",
        "Well, I think as long as enrollment is not increasingly, yeah, I think that's a good idea.",
        "But also, I believe that they need to really bring in people who know how to analyze us and, you know, do some benchmarking with private institutions, whether it be companies or whatever, and begin to copy that because, you know, one thing they're not saving money on - or they are saving money on is paying the adjunct faculty.",
        "You know, more than half, maybe even three-quarters, of all humanities courses are taught by adjuncts, and they hardly get paid anything, so - definitely not teacher salaries.",
        "That's as opposed to the tenured professors.",
        "Dennis, thanks very much for the call, and our condolences on your loan payments.",
        "We appreciate it.",
        "He said something very interesting, though, Richard Vedder: As long as they keep the same number of students.",

        "Yes, I made the point in the newspaper story that you referred to or the CNN piece that you referred to that colleges are the only institution I know where prestige, where success is often measured by turning customers away.",
        "We - Harvard is considered a great school because for every student that's admitted, there are about 10 others or more that are not admitted.",
        "And so Harvard flourishes by turning students away, that they're viewed as selective, they're viewed as the elite schools, and they get high rankings, whereas if you were to go talk about Wal-Mart or McDonald's or some company like that, the opposite strategy is at work.",
        "They want all the customers to come.",
        "There's no admissions committee to decide who can shop at Wal-Mart.",
        "Anyone can shop at Wal-Mart who has the dollars, and so there is a real big difference between higher ed and almost every other sector of the economy, including even medical care in this respect.",
        "I wanted to read one paragraph from your CNN.com piece: Once as department chairman, I successfully battle for more faculty members to do the same amount of work, thus lowering productivity.",
        "The result: My faculty evaluated me highly, so I got a nice raise.",
        "Where else do the employees get to decide who their bosses will be or how much they will be paid?",

        "He lost his job because the faculty didn't like him, and so in effect, the employees have a strong control over the employer, which - or over the boss, so to speak, the president.",
        "So the president, in order to maintain job security, has to appease the faculty.",
