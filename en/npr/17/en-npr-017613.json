        "And you've run an institution of higher learning.",
        "How come it seems like nobody tries to make these sorts of economies?",
        "Well, actually, the distinction between sticker price and actual price I think is very important.",

        "And I frankly don't have any problem with Mr. Rockefeller paying full tuition, and I like the idea that working-class kids can come at prices that their parents can afford.",
        "So it's a little simplistic to use the data the way it was used at the opening of the show.",
        "Additionally, I think it's important to recognize that the university of today is not the university of 20 years ago.",
        "They are continuing to be labor-intensive, but there's an extraordinary amount of technology that is now used on universities, and it doesn't come cheap, and it has to constantly be renewed because it becomes obsolescent very quickly.",
        "And university education is one of the last hand-made items we have in today's marketplace.",
        "You take a course in music at many institutions, the faculty-student relationship can be one-on-one.",

        "We get more and more students who come into the university, they're on one kind of medication or another.",
        "This becomes manifest after they're matriculated, we don't know about that before they enroll, and then they need counseling services of one sort or another.",
        "Security services - you can imagine what's gone on on university campuses since the tragedy at Virginia Tech, the first tragedy, now the second, to maintain security, the need to provide daycare programs for the children of faculty, to make it possible for us to recruit women.",
        "The whole sociology of America has changed.",
        "An awful lot of our faculty are now women, and they need to be supported.",
        "We need them as part of the faculty, and they need to be supported in distinctive ways.",
        "So it's a little bit mindless to say the tuition was this 20 years ago, and it's this now, and how come.",
        "We still see students graduating with tremendous student loan debts.",
        "Yes, and when the economy was good - and you surely can't blame the universities for the state of the economy - those students went out and got jobs and paid those debts off.",
        "The reason that we are seeing such a burden now is that the students are graduating and are not finding employment."

        "Well, there's a more meaningful figure.",
        "Forty percent of the students pay the list price, and about 60 percent are discounted, to a greater or lesser extent depending on their ability to pay.",

        "We - it is true the sticker price on higher ed is a bit simplistic as a measure of the cost.",
        "But of course the true cost of higher education to society, it's not just the cost to the students but the total cost that society pays to run the higher education enterprise.",
        "In the mid-'60s, when Steve and I were both young and able to get around a little better than we are now, America spent about one percent of its national output on it's a higher education.",
        "Today it spends between three and three and a half percent.",
        "So even if you look at things in a broader sense, we're spending a lot more.",
        "Now, to be sure, there are more people going to college.",
        "One thing I would take some - I would add a little bit to what Steve said, while it is true the recession has aggravated things and caused some job problems for graduates, there's no question about that, we have gotten to a point in society, I think, where by pushing everyone to go into higher education, to go to four-year schools and so forth, we now have a mismatch between the number of college graduates and the number of jobs of the traditional kind reserved for college students, college graduates - managerial jobs, technical jobs, professional jobs.",
        "And so now we have a world where we have 19,000 parking lot attendants with college degrees in the United States or where nearly one in four airline attendants is a college graduate.",
        "Now, there's nothing wrong with having college graduates among airline attendants, but I'm not sure that that's an absolute - that the education itself necessarily is that critical to perform that kind of vocational undertaking."

        "In 1970, roughly, the federal government spent roughly one billion dollars on student financial aid in higher education.",

        "OK.",
        "Well...",
        "Now, adjusting for inflation, enrollment increases and everything, it isn't that dramatic of an increase, but it - there certainly has not been a lack of public support for American higher education.",

        "But I think the empirical evidence is somewhat different than Cynthia suggests.",

        "In my building, every one's empty because we've already started Christmas break, which will last for several weeks.",

        "We do not use our facilities as fully as we might.",
        "The idea of using the university all year round, 12 months instead of eight, having three, 15-week semesters a year would obviously make our facilities more productive.",
        "And, frankly, it would also give professors a chance to earn more money, if they chose to, by teaching more or alternatively, at the very minimum, provide more jobs for Ph.D.s who are desperately seeking employment and finding it daunting in this contemporary market.",

        "I think, Cynthia, you do know that that's not always the case in every school.",
        "I know, and I think you're generalizing and giving the public the wrong idea because if you're looking at a private school and the research - the Ph.D. schools, the doctoral schools is one thing.",
