        "I'm not going to be able to pursue a Ph.D. because of how much it costs and that I can't get the funding for it, and it just doesn't benefit me to pursue any higher degree because I'm not going to be able to get a job that's going to help pay for my student loans and pay them off because of how expensive it's getting.",
        "So no matter how bad I want to go for a Ph.D., I can't afford it because of the rising costs.",

        "They no longer have tenure, so it makes no sense to teach in the college world, you know?",
