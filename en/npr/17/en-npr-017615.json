        "And so I did that.",
        "And then I heard the voices.",
        "And up in the air - I'm higher than the voices so I kept walking down.",
        "I couldn't see anything until I saw the school bus, and the voices were of people, these early responders out - so it was just incredible, these people that had just responded right away.",
        "I don't know who they were.",
        "I don't know where they came from, but they're pulling these kids out of the back of the bus.",
        "This is the 60 kids who are on this bus.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "And they're pulling them out.",
        "And I could see them lifting them off on the road.",
        "And I looked to my right, and these people are coming towards me to help me.",
        "And I looked to my right, and someone is hurt and he's yelling for help.",
        "And I said that guy is hurt over there, go over there, you got to see him over there.",
        "So they went over there, and I went down to the bus and they had pulled, these people had pulled the majority of the kids out.",
        "We talked last week about the disproportionate number of black men behind bars, nearly 10 percent of young African-American males.",
        "I think, people, at this point, have a pretty good sense of whose war this is.",
        "The critical task for us now is not only stabilizing the situation in Iraq and getting our combat troops out, it's also that we've got al-Qaida as strong as it has been since 9/11, regrouping in Afghanistan and along the Pakistan border.",
        "And then we've got real serious problems there.",
        "And we're not going to be able to tackle those issues, which I think the American people understand, are one of the most prominent threats we face unless we are not entirely bogged down in this mess in Iraq.",

        "You have said that your daughters, because of their economic privilege, should not benefit from affirmative action in the same way that some other people might.",
        "Now, if elected, will you fight to keep affirmative action alive, and if so, to benefit whom?",
        "Oh, I'm a firm believer in affirmative action.",
        "Now, the question that was asked was do I think that my daughters are disadvantaged?",
        "And I said, no because their father is a United States senator, and both their parents are working professionals.",
        "But what I also said is that there is a strong and ongoing intersection between race and class in this country.",
        "That racism is still an issue that has to be battled.",
        "Affirmative action is an important tool, although a limited tool, for us to deal with these issues.",
        "I say limited simply because a large portion of our young people right now never even benefit from affirmative action because they're not graduating from high school.",
        "And unless we do a better job with early childhood education, fixing crumbling schools, investing to make sure that we've got an excellent teacher in front of every classroom, and then making college affordable.",
        "We're not even going to reach the point where our children can benefit from affirmative action.",
        "Let me throw a little curb ball in there.",
        "You know that you've battled this issue of, is Barack Obama black enough, because you had an African father who you did not grow up with?"

        "And you know, the fact that I'm running for president is obviously going to bring up some of this confusion to the surface.",
        "But ordinary people that I meet and talk to each and every day, they are absolutely clear about where I'm coming from and partly that's because I'm very clear about who I am.",

        "And I said, no, not really.",
        "But I think, you know, it's important for me to try this now.",
        "And she said, yeah, I'm not sure I'd want to be president because if I say something wrong in school, you know, I might get in trouble with the teacher.",
        "If you say something wrong, boy, the whole world could get shaken up.",
        "And then so, you know, that's part of the responsibility of being a presidential candidate, and certainly a president is that your words get magnified and count and - but I also think that it's important to make sure that I don't lose my core honesty with myself.",
        "Your daughter calls the secret service the secret people.",
        "You have gotten protection really early.",
        "You don't have to go far in the Internet to find predictions that you could be the target of violence.",
        "How do you weigh the risks of being injured or even killed because you are a black man running for president versus your daughters, your love for your family?"

        "So it's a little more prevalent, if you're an African-American candidate.",
        "But Michelle and I, my wife and I, talked about this before we got into this race - the sacrifices that were involved, being away from the kids, not having as much privacy as we once had.",
        "And our conclusion was that it was worth it because we're in one of these moments where I truly believe we've got an opportunity to reshape the political landscape right now in a way that we haven't had maybe since Ronald Reagan did it for conservatives back in 1980.",
        "I think the country is profoundly ready for change.",
        "They recognize that the war in Iraq has been a failure; that we are struggling under a health care system that doesn't work; that our educational system isn't adequate for making sure that our kids can compete in an international economy.",
        "And so I think there are a lot of disaffected Republicans, there are a lot of independents who could get behind a progressive message, and I think we could also revisit and restore the sense that we've got to take on some of the issues of poverty in this country right now.",
        "But all this is going to require the kind of leadership that has been lacking, and I think it is leadership that I can provide.",

        "This is a critical issue.",

        "A couple of specific things we can do.",
        "The federal government has to make sure that it's fulfilling its financial obligations to states because part of the reason tuition is going up so quickly is because states aren't providing as much support to colleges and universities as they used to because they're strapped trying to pay their Medicaid bills.",
        "Right now, our student loan programs are often funneled through banjs and financial intermediaries like Sallie Mae, and those financial institutions are making $8 billion or more every year in profits off the back of students who are trying to go to school.",
        "And these are - this is just on the government-subsidized loan program.",
        "This - it sets aside the whole private financing of student loans that has become a big racket.",
        "And so what I've said is let's eliminate those subsidies.",
        "Let's stop giving eight billion dollars to companies that don't need it.",
        "Let's take their money and expand the grants which were much more prevalent when I was going to college and don't require young people to take on these enormous debts."
