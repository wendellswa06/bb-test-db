        "I think the turning point probably came around 2006, once the civilian rate, the most sort of comparable civilian rate, according to military demographics, was around 20, and it was actually around 15.3, according to some of the numbers that the Army's been tracking.",
        "And then once 2006, that rate started going up and up and up.",
        "In 2008, it actually exceeded the civilian rate.",
        "So the rate in the Army was worse than the civilian rate.",
        "Right, and we have also, you know, the colonel in here and he will be able to tell you more about how difficult it is to narrow it down when you're talking about an overly young, male population and trying to get those demographics.",

        "The question then is who.",
        "Who are, for the most part, these people who are unfortunately killing themselves?",
        "Right, and that's really the issue that's the heart of the Suicide Prevention Task Force that the Army set up at the end of 2008, early 2009, to start to tackle this problem.",
        "Some of the things that it's been able to I guess discover, most recently a statistic that obviously warrants further investigation, is that 79 percent of these suicides happen within the first three years of service.",
        "So...",
        "So these are young members of the Army.",
        "And is this primarily a battlefield problem, or is this a barracks problem?",
        "Not necessarily.",
        "According to the statistics that we've seen, and according to many of the Army investigations, a lot of these young soldiers have never been deployed."
