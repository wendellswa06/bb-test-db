        "People's reasons are as varied as there are people.",
        "There are, and one of the things that happens is a family will adopt, and then their friends, their community, their other family members, watch that family come together and think, you know, we would like to do this.",
        "Very often, you see families that adopt in clusters of communities or workplaces or neighborhood.",
        "And again, the conversation almost always begins with: Why do you need to go to places like Ethiopia or China or wherever when there are so many kids in this country who need parents?",
        "Well, you know, one of the questions those of us who are adopted also face is who are your real mom and dad.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And people look at you - and with obvious differences of race and nationality, the fact that you are adopted is so apparent.",
        "And it is true.",
        "There are many children in this country who need and deserve to have families.",
        "But I think it's important that we begin to look at the world's children as not them and us but, in fact, that the children are ours and that the borders really disappear, and we look at the needs of the children.",
        "Adoption should be always finding families for children, not children for families.",
        "And sometimes, that family is in another country, but it certainly doesn't diminish the need or the appropriateness of adoption.",
        "And as you mentioned, you were yourself adopted from Korea.",
        "And a lot of people wonder: you were moved from a cultural milieu, you know, a new language, incredibly different places - from your experience, how did it work out?",
        "Well, I have to say that the goal of adoption is not taking a child from one country to another - and in particular, to say that a child is better off leaving a poor country, going to a wealthy country.",
        "It is leaving a situation where they're in an orphanage or an institution or without family, to go to a family.",
        "And that was certainly my experience."

        "One of the things that I would add from your previous guest, when she says that there is no difference in adoption and giving birth, I really support the idea that in terms of the connection, the feeling that you have for your children, whether it's through birth or adoption, that that is the same.",
        "But there are huge differences when it comes to international adoption in terms of a child who leaves their culture, their identity - that's one of the nuances of international adoption, that families who are adopting from another country must be prepared to not only embrace the child but everything about where they've come from.",
        "It is not the fact that you are a Caucasian family that just happens to have adopted a child from another race and culture.",

        "We thought that we would address needs in our county and went to our county family-builders association and were encouraged rather than to adopt, to foster, and were essentially told that there were no children available for us unless we were willing to foster first.",
        "I love - I think fostering is a noble pursuit, but as your speakers have talked about, we were looking to build a family, and we were not willing to build a family at the risk of losing a child.",
        "And they actually encouraged us to adopt internationally at that point.",
        "And that's what we did and have never looked back and regretted it.",
        "It's been an amazing gift to our family.",
        "And did you ask them why?",
        "Well, you know, it's a problem with the way that our foster and our adoption system is set up in this country.",
        "The goal is always reunification with the family, with the birth family, and that's just not something that we were willing to open our hearts to.",
        "It may be something in the future, but at this point, we were looking to add a child to our family as a permanent member of our family.",
        "And how's it working out?",
        "It's working out great.",
        "You know, it really is about building a family.",
        "And I would add that though that was our goal, because our awareness has been raised about situations in Ethiopia that we have become philanthropists, as well.",
        "We have given money in instances that we would not have been aware of had we not had our level of consciousness raised about issues in Africa and Ethiopia.",
        "So through our daughter, we have become philanthropists, even though that wasn't our goal.",
        "I would also add that our daughter came to us with profound ear problems due to chronic ear infections.",
        "And because of the medical care she has received since she's been adopted, she now has perfect hearing.",
        "And I can't imagine what her life would have been like had she stayed in Ethiopia because she would have gone deaf."

        "When do we have kids?",
        "And this seemed, oddly enough, to be a practical solution because there were kids in need of homes, and we felt sort of a connection to Liberia and Liberia's strange past with the United States and kind of felt something, I don't know, in our hearts that we wanted to reach out there.",
        "Why do you say the decision to go with the orphanage may or may not have been a wise decision?",
        "Well, that's - if you read any news about Liberian adoption these days, they've actually shut down adoptions from Liberia.",
        "And it goes back to this whole debate about: are kids being trafficked, are they not.",
        "And there's just a lot of conflicting news out there.",
