        "One of the things that Mrs. Motley was talking about was the importance of who you work with.",
        "You need to be able to know with certainty when you're looking at your child that they came to you because there was no other family available for them.",
        "And so you have to ask questions about how does the child come into care?",
        "What happened with the birth family?",
        "What's the history?",
        "There should be a great deal of transparency.",
        "If you are working with an agency that's hesitating to answer any of those question, that should be a red flag to you.",
        "And one of the things that happens with an agency is that they're required to know the laws, the rules, the regulations, and it's a very complicated process that goes between two countries and cultures and governments and languages.",
        "And when you are the adoptive family, you are also very emotionally involved in this.",
        "And so a professional, competent agency is there to guide you through and actually to protect both the adoptive family, the birth family and the child because the stories of trafficking and inappropriate, unethical adoption, that puts to risk for all children the possibility of inter-country adoption for them as an option to have a family.",
        "And should you worry if the agency, or wherever it is you're dealing with, tries to get you emotionally involved with a child, saying well, well, these are details.",
        "We'll get to those later.",
        "Here, meet this charming, amazing kid.",
        "Should you worry that you're being played?",
        "You should worry.",
        "If it sounds too good to be true, it's probably too good to be true.",
        "And especially in countries that are just developing an adoption program that they're learning the process, the barriers are still to be learned.",
        "That is especially when you need to have an agency that's competent.",
        "Recently, in fact last April 1, The Hague Convention on Inter-Country Adoption was ratified in the U.S.,.",
        "And that is a process that is going to help to protect the process in all countries to be more ethical and protect everyone involved in the process.",

        "We adopted our daughter from Belarus in 1995.",

        "We understand Belarus has closed its doors to international adoption for political reasons.",
        "This saddens us, as we know there are children there in need of homes.",
        "Would your guest expand on this situation with international adoption?",
        "You know, one of the saddest things is that children are used as part of a political process.",
        "And there are a number of countries - for example, Romania is a country that had great need, and adoption was stopped there.",
        "And I doubt that it's going to reopen.",
        "It's one of the reasons why adoption needs to be done very carefully and ethically.",
        "You can't do things in a hurry.",
        "You can't do things that the country's not ready for.",
        "The systems need to be in place to protect children and families.",
        "One of the reasons that it is so expensive to adopt is because of all of the things that have to be processed both in the birth country - the sending country - and the receiving country.",
        "You know, adoption is generational.",
        "It's not only the generation that your child comes into your family - your family tree is altered forever.",
        "And in particular, when you're adopting children of another race and nationality, while those children grow up, they are going to be judged by their packaging.",
        "And when they're with their adopted parents, it is a very different kind of experience than when they're out there on their own.",
        "So that's another responsibility that parents have: to be informed, to be educated - and that the agencies have to make sure that all of those considerations are well taken care of as the adoption takes place.",

        "But, you know - none of us can imagine life without my brother, and thank God for Holt for bringing us all together.",
        "Having said that, I think my parents made the mistake of assuming since they were indifferent to the race issue, everyone else was.",
        "And I don't think that they understood the stress that my brother faced of being the only Asian kid in a predominantly white town, family, everything.",

        "And it isn't that it interferes with - or has anything to do with how much they love their child.",
        "It's the reality for children who grow up to be able to go out into the world, confident, ready to face whatever is going to come their way, and differences of race matter.",
        "And that's what so difficult.",
        "If this had been a bleeding injury, clearly, the Army knows exactly what to do.",

        "But it does matter in terms of how the child is prepared to face, you know, the rest of their lives.",
