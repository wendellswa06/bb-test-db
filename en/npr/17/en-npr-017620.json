        "My mother had already died.",
        "But one of the things that sometimes happens for families, as your previous caller has talked about, is that they look at inter-country adoption as a way to avoid the idea of birth family reappearing or be involved in children's life.",
        "And I have to say that that is changing dramatically.",
        "First of all, I don't think you should be fearful of the birth family because after all, every child comes to their adoptive family having had a birth family.",
        "And that connection to them may or may not be important to the child as they grow up, depending on their own temperament and how they feel.",
        "But the fact is there are increasing numbers of adoptees going back to, in particular, Korea, to Vietnam, and being united with their birth family.",
        "There's also birth families who are coming forward and trying to search for their biological children who were adopted.",
        "So, that same feeling of connection and longing that people have known about for a long time with domestic adoption - is only natural to assume that it's going to be a part of inter-country adoption in the future, and increasingly so.",
        "Hope, thanks for your - thanks very much.",
        "And Susan, we just have a few seconds left with you.",
        "But you look at the statistics, Americans are adopting fewer kids from overseas in the last couple of years, and the trend is downwards.",
        "How come?"

        "And let me ask you: To what extent do you think Army culture is involved both in difficulties in detecting the problems of soldiers who are having difficulties?",
        "Well, we have a term in the Army called being able to see yourself, and as Ms. Tarabay talked a few moments ago, the process that the Army has been going through since the creation of the task force was an ability to see ourselves as it related to this particular issue.",
        "The Army senior leadership, from the secretary on down, has stated on numerous occasions that the continued stress on the force is having corresponding second and third effects.",

        "When you look at the fact that we have studied in this nation homicides, there has never before been a study of any significance and from a national perspective on the issue of suicide.",
        "So it's a fair statement when you ask what the Army is doing, but I would also counter that in addition to that, we have to look at this as a nation at large.",
        "And I know the statistics, and we don't want to get involved in numbers here, but it's got to be alarming if the Army thinks that its rate of suicide is higher than that of the general population.",
        "No question, sir.",
        "This has been an issue that the senior leadership, from the former secretary to the current secretary, has articulated to the military leadership and the civilian people, I assume the civilian leaders, as well, that we have to put our arms around and do a better job at.",

        "I know that also one of the things that we've been looking at with the suicides has been while the number of active-duty soldiers from month to month has been going down, the number of non-active-duty soldiers has been actually going up.",
        "And maybe the colonel can talk about that a bit more.",
        "Well, that's true.",
        "For 2010 through the current timeframe, and I'll give you statistics, somewhere about the 18th of June, the numbers of active-duty soldiers that does include though mobilized Guard and Reserve soldiers has decreased from this point in time last year."

        "But unfortunately, the number of National Guard and Reserve soldiers who are not mobilized, who are active service, has gone up this year.",
        "And I'm asked the question often of why, and it's a legitimate question.",
        "Again, I can find no one, single factor.",
        "The issues related to relationships, the issues related to finances, multiple deployments in some cases, but again as she's Jamie's already mentioned, we have had instances where soldiers had never before deployed and that factor of during any soldier's first term of enlistment and the approximately three-year timeframe, there are increased stressors on those soldiers that do have the potential for causing concern.",
        "I was one of the quotes that was in Jamie's story that really interested me was there was, you know, most of them are young.",
        "Well, the Army's mostly young.",
        "Yes, sir.",

        "Sir, you've answered the question that I get more often than not in terms of the why.",
        "We have no information right now.",
        "What I can tell you on the positive side of that conversation is the Army has partnered with the National Institute of Mental Health that many people consider to be on the preeminent leaders in that particular field of study to look at the issues related to the how and the why, to give us a better perspective.",
        "When I talked again about being able to see ourselves, we recognized in late 2006 and beyond, that we were not able to properly put into context, with effectiveness that was in any way helping to drive down our rate and again, that's a rate that is from the Center for Disease Control, it's a national average, per 100,000 people in the United States.",
        "I would offer again that that rate last published from the CDC was 2006.",
        "Again, I'm not pointing my finger at CDC because they have a very challenging mission in relation to being able to capture that, but as was stated, we have bypassed that rate.",
        "I cannot tell you what the national average has been since that point in time because there's no official data that's come out in that regard."
