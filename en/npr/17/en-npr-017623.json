        "You had to face that when you were with DC General.",
        "What was the biggest problem and concern you had to face?",
        "The biggest concern that we had to face in Washington, DC, was really the question of culture.",
        "The folks who really believed that this public hospital was important for the community, and who really viewed it as more than a hospital, but as a symbol of something that the community had gotten when the community so often feels that it doesn't get very much from the government, that whole political and cultural issue was really a much larger issue than the health-care issue.",
        "Dr.",
        "Walks, isn't that part of the problem, the idea that the lobbying behind these kinds of hospitals, because they substantially service the poor, and those that are not placed in a strong position, as far as Washington is concerned, just have no clout in trying to keep these hospitals open?",
        "There are really many problem but let me just hit one of them that isn't, I think, often mentioned.",
        "We always talk about these hospitals as not having enough money.",
        "And then someone else comes up and says, `Well, no, money isn't the problem.",
        "For example, King-Drew, they say, gets more money per patient than the other hospitals.",
        "The challenge is the money is often lumped together; money used to pay malpractice cases, money used for things other than patient care, supplies and resources are lumped together.",
        "So what you have is a hospital that gets a bunch of money but doesn't get money to buy new equipment, pay for training, those kinds of things.",
        "And so I think clarifying the argument and making sure that when you're talking about dollars for a hospital, you're talking about real dollars for patient care and resources, is the issue, and you're comparing apples to apples.",
        "So there are many political conversations that go on and what gets lost in the argument is: Are the sick people really getting care?",
        "Are we actually getting better health outcome?",
        "That's where I think we should focus these concerns and these questions.",
        "Alan Sager, would you agree with that?",
        "And I guess I would echo what Dr. Walks said, and add to that: Are poor people getting not only care but adequate care?",
        "No, they're not.",
        "One of the problems that Dr. Walks is minimizing is that hospitals matter, for their emergency rooms, for their outpatient departments and for their inpatient care, and for their potential to organize care for large neighborhoods.",
        "As a result of the closing of DC General, there's now only one hospital left in the whole eastern part of the District, and that hospital is in the far corner, and it's been in bankruptcy twice, and it provides dangerous care to many patients.",
        "It has that legacy.",
        "We hope it's getting better.",
        "The--on the other hand, there are many hospitals in the wealthier western part of the district.",
        "In northern St. Louis, there are no hospitals left.",
        "So we have huge expanses that have become health-care wastelands, to a great degree.",
        "Hospitals matter.",
        "We know that in--over the seven decades I've been looking at 1,200 hospitals in 52 cities, we see that race of the people who live around the hospital is one of the two biggest predictors of which hospitals close, and efficiency never predicts survival.",
        "In other words, the more efficient hospitals are actually a little more likely to close.",
        "If in fact they are housed in minority neighborhoods.",
        "Whether or not.",

        "I am focused on health care, and I think we need to be focused on `Is a community healthier?,' `Is a community doing better?,' and if you look at organizations that are extremely reputable, like, for example, The Kellogg Foundation, others, that have looked in Washington, DC, at the health-care status and the availability of health care pre-and-post-to-the-DC General transition, you will not find any reports of people are getting worse care, people can't get the care they need because DC General is closed.",
        "Those stories just don't exist, those assessments just don't exist.",
        "What you find, instead, is doctors and others and people who are doing reports, and patients, actually, saying, `You know, I can get better care.'",

        "Let me not fight with Alan Sager about this.",
        "It's not because the hospital's gone.",
        "It's because there's a comprehensive system of care put into place called the DC HealthCare Alliance.",
        "And so when we talk about hospital closings, I don't agree with the fact that a hospital is critical to organizing care in a community.",
        "What I think is this: Someone has to organize the care in a community.",
        "What you really have to do is look at the fact that hospitals across the board have changed so much in the last 20 years.",
        "You no longer have this issue of the rich hospitals are being paid a lot of money by the insurance companies and the poor hospitals are not getting paid very much.",
        "The reimbursement rates have come down from the insurance companies, and they're now not so different from what you get from Medicare in other places to account for all these changes.",
        "The hospital that was mentioned, Greater Southeast in Washington, DC, the first time it went into bankruptcy actually had over 90 percent of the patients coming in had some kind of coverage--insurance, Medicaid, something like that, but management was a huge issue.",
        "So what I would recommend we do--when we talk about closing hospitals, which I'm not in favor of, I would want us to talk about `How can we put a system of care in place that focuses on efficient spending of the dollars available, but second that to a focus on preventive health care, keeping a population healthy, and stop reimbursing for procedures every time someone is sick, exclusively, and start reimbursing for preventive care and keeping neighborhoods health?",
        "That's how you organize care in a community, not by saying, `We're gonna maintain what's already been there,' when we know those same communities continue to have poor health status, continue to have ...(unintelligible) health care...",
        "Yeah, Dr. Walks, let me stop you there, and ask you this.",
        "I have heard many, many stories--the Los Angeles Times did an extensive series on King-Drew Medical Center, and I've heard many, many stories--horror stories, quite frankly--about public hospitals in many cities, just giving inadequate care, where police have demanded not to be taken to emergency rooms and the like at these hospitals.",
