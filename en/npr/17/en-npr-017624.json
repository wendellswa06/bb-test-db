        "Well, as you noted, we've heard a lot from Comey in the past.",
        "We heard a clip from him talking about these memos in Congress.",
        "And he's been on this book tour talking about a lot of these interactions that he had with the president.",
        "But what these memos do is give us even a closer view, an insider view of these conversations, and conversations not just with the president but with senior White House officials.",
        "But one discussion in particular stood out for me, and that was a conversation that he had that, Comey had with the president about the president's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn.",
        "And Comey relates this anecdote from after the election in which Trump says a foreign leader had called to congratulate him on his win, but Flynn had scheduled the call for several days after this leader first called."

        "So he had concerns about Michael Flynn's judgment issues way back at the time of this conversation.",
        "We should say that leader was Vladimir Putin.",
        "That leader was reportedly Vladimir Putin, but also the fact that Michael Flynn was later fired for lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russians, and the president kept Flynn on his staff for quite some time after he had questions about Flynn's judgment.",
        "So what is the effect of these now revealed memos on the special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation, if anything?",
        "Well, the Justice Department says that when it sent the memos up to the Hill that it had consulted with relevant parties that would have no impact on the investigation.",
        "Republicans, of course, are saying that these are blind with bias, that Comey is not an unbiased observer in all of this.",
        "And the president, of course, tweeted about this last night, saying that the memos show that there was no collusion and no obstruction.",
        "Meanwhile, Andrew McCabe, former No. 2 at the FBI, could be facing criminal charges now?",
        "That's right.",
        "The Justice Department inspector general has asked prosecutors here in Washington to look into whether McCabe should face charges.",
        "Now, referrals like this are not uncommon, and they don't mean that prosecutors will open an investigation.",
        "They could decide to do so or they could decide to drop it."

        "Well, around Chicago there's not nearly as many schools actively participating as did so back on March 14, where there was the first major school-related demonstrations on gun violence.",
        "Some schools in the area are even warning students and parents that there may be some disciplinary action for students who walk out.",
        "There's a student organizer in suburban Naperville who's a bit worried that there's an effort by those who use this day, April 20, 4/20, to celebrate marijuana and push for its legalization, that that might steal some of the thunder of the anti-gun-violence marches here.",
        "But in the city itself, there are several high schools and students at those high schools who plan to walk out.",
        "They're going to meet up at a rally downtown later in the day.",

        "This is Charles Henderson Elementary School in the Englewood neighborhood on the city's South Side.",
        "And these are students who, they do these lockdown drills like everyone else, but a Parkland or a Sandy Hook-like shooting doesn't worry them much because really their everyday reality is much more frightening."
