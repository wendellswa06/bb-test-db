        "And you wrote in that piece, my peers and I, spoiled on the Reagan-era notion of faith in money, stand at the edge of economic despair with few tools for coping other than constant Internet access.",
        "And you questioned, well, the whole enterprise that your parents entered upon to get their children educated and get them ahead.",

        "A group of lawyers says no on both counts.",
        "A proposal organized by Paul Carrington, a professor at Duke University, says Congress should rethink the way the court works, including a call for a kind of term limits for the justices.",

        "What about you?",
        "Should Supreme Court justices face limits on the amount of time they spend on the bench?",

        "Thank you.",
        "So, what is the nature of these limits, term limits, that you're proposing?",
        "Well, they're not strictly term limits.",
        "There is an idea that enough's enough of a Supreme Court justice's career and that particularly as we have improved health care so that people age longer, and as there's been some impulse to appoint people to the Supreme Court at a younger age, the prospect to having people sit on the court for many decades has become a reality.",
        "And so that, I think, was the genesis of the movement, and it's not a very - movement may be too strong a word.",
        "But there are a lot of us around who think that Congress ought to think about that problem, among others that affect the way the Supreme Court operates affect the way we think about the Supreme Court.",
        "Well...",
        "Yeah, go ahead.",

        "Yeah, well, that - and that idea has been - is derived from a series of proposals that have been made over the last half century.",
        "I was on a committee, worked for a committee, some 40 years ago that reported that the federal judicial system didn't work very well because the Supreme Court wasn't doing everything that needed to be done.",
        "And another report came out a few years later done by Paul Freund at Harvard and Alex Bickel at Yale, and they came basically to the same sort of conclusions.",
        "And then there was a third report done by a Senate committee led by Senator Hruska that came to basically the same conclusion, and nothing was done.",
        "Then there was a fourth job done by the Federal Judicial Center that produced no result.",
        "And then a few years ago, there was another committee led by Byron White.",
        "And I will say, I'm pretty confident that Byron White would agree with - Justice White would agree with all four of those proposals that are set forth in the document that we sent off to this judiciary committees and to the vice president and to the attorney general.",
        "Oh, I should say, the other two proposals deal, one, with one justices resigning if they're old or ill or too old...",
        "Yeah.",
        "Too old to be able to perform, and the other, limiting the term of the chief justice.",
        "But what - I mean, what - OK.",
        "So, someone's been there a long time; what's wrong with that?",
        "Well, you know, one thing that's wrong with it, of course, is that they are going to become superannuated, and that sometimes happens.",
        "Another problem with it is that they do become a little bit - tend to become a little bit arrogant about their status and about their power and about their responsibility and maybe a little bit insensitive to the social and political and other considerations that animate other people.",
        "We've had some very good justices who were very old, but the problem only becomes a really serious one when you think about the whole court aging together, because of the status of health care and the youth that are being - and the youth of the people who are being appointed.",
        "If you're going to appoint people at 40 - Clarence Thomas may sit on the court for 50 years, and if you think of the court as being a group of people who are appointed under those circumstances and retained, it becomes a pretty stagnant enterprise.",
        "And not only is it stagnant, but as I say, there's a kind of institutional arrogance associate with that that we think it would be useful to try to qualify and correct a little bit by giving them some sense that their duties are constrained and are limited.",
        "So...",
        "I've - yeah.",
        "Well, is there any - I mean, I'm just wondering, since you mentioned Clarence Thomas, nominated by a conservative or at least a Republican president, is there some political agenda here?",
        "No, not really.",
        "We've - all of the proposals are clued in, in a way that does not affect anybody who's presently sitting on the court.",
        "We're not trying to change the appointments for President Obama; nobody has that ambition.",
        "But we would like to fix it so that every president, every two years, would appoint a Supreme Court justice, who would presumably reflect a little bit the social, political, economic aspirations of the present president and Senate of the United States, and that that would provide a measure of stability and recall for the institution that would be highly desirable.",

        "I mean, if you're picking a new one every two years, do you rotate people off every whatever it is?",
        "Well, yeah, the idea that's proposed this that the nine most recently appointed would be the ones would normally sit, but there are often cases in which we're shorthanded.",
        "And then there's some other duties that Supreme Court justices perform, like making civil - making the rules of procedure and ruling on some kinds of administrative questions that would - we'd leave them in the court for that purpose.",
        "So, they wouldn't - and let me say, a part of the picture here is that ordinarily federal judges do retire after about 20 years, give or take a period of time, because they get to retire at full pay, and federal judges take that offer, for the most part.",

        "It's really not a very hard job.",
        "The number of cases they are deciding and the amount staff support they have make it pretty easy, and Supreme Court justices are partly busy writing books.",
