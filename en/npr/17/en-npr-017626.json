        "If there were term limits imposed on...",
        "Yeah, no - yes, Joshua, I'm curious how you see term limits making that more likely.",
        "Well, maybe if the justice felt compelled to support the ideals of the body that put them into the position.",
        "Hmm.",
        "OK, well, let me ask Paul Carrington what he makes of that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I don't foresee that happening anymore than it already does.",

        "I mean, there - it's a matter of, what kind of cases would you like to write an opinion about, your honor?",
        "That's the issue that supposed for the justices when they select their cases.",
        "And so, I don't know that it would be magnified at all by the fact there was some rotation in the court.",
        "I suppose it is probably true that justices are a little bit loyal to the president who appoints them, but I think we could probably, if we looked for it, find a lot of counter examples to that.",
        "I don't think they're particularly hung up on the president who appointed them.",
        "True.",

        "I'm a developmental psychologist, and one of the things that you know just out of human nature and the aging process is that the 20-year-old doesn't think like a 30-year-old, the 30-year-old doesn't think like a 40-year-old; a 40-year-old doesn't think like 50-year-old.",
        "And the longer they stay on, the more their views naturally change, and it's difficult - I think we need generational diversity.",
        "I think the term limits should be 10 years.",
        "That would provide literal generational diversity and experience.",
        "Of course, there would have to be a minimum on - you know, you wouldn't 20-year-old in a...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I'll start arguments there, but...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And I think that the fact that they can choose what they want to write decisions on is - should be based on specialties or background prior to being appointed as a Supreme Court justice as opposed to, well, you know, what do you think about this?",
        "Maybe we can do a good job here or whatever.",
        "And it was absolutely amazing when you learn that process.",
        "Well, Mary, thanks for that point of view, although I suppose if we did have term limits, a 20-year-old wouldn't be such a scary proposition if it was only for 10 years.",
        "But you're talking longer than 10 years, aren't you, Paul Carrington?",
        "Well, yeah, I - the scheme that our group suggested would lead to terms of about 18 years, give or take a little bit, something on that order, and that is more congruent with the experience elsewhere in the world.",
        "Let me say, one of the wonderful things about Supreme Court is it's unique.",
        "The only body that bears a really - real resemblance in regard to their kind of security and status is the College of Cardinals.",
        "There are no courts anywhere where they have something called life tenure.",
        "Everybody's got an age limit or a term limit of some sort that constraints the exercise of that kind of power.",
        "And I think it make sense that it would be a fairly long term, because you want people to invest their careers, and you don't want them to be thinking that - well, I've got a - I'm going to do this for a little awhile, and then I'm going to sell my services to somebody else, because that would impair their judicial independence, which is a very important feature of the system.",
        "We want justices and judges to be not thinking about their own personal ambitions.",
        "The great, great virtue of the jury system is that juries cannot be bribed or intimidated, and you want judges who can't be bribed or intimidated.",
        "And if you had them in short - in for short time, they would be thinking about, what I'm going to do next, and who's going to take care of me?",
        "Right.",
        "We're talking with Paul Carrington - he's a professor of law at Duke University - about an interesting proposal to change the way the Supreme Court is structured.",
        "You're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "And we have an email here from Nicholas in Iowa, who says, wouldn't this take a constitutional amendment?",
        "And couldn't the Supreme Court interpret the amendment?",
        "Additionally, wouldn't this create a campaign for the Supreme Court, that is, people lobbying themselves for those positions?",
        "What about that?"

        "There's an argument that a constitutional amendment would be needed to impose term limits or some kind of age limit on the court.",
        "Article III of the Constitution does say that the justices shall serve for good behavior.",
        "It doesn't say anything more than that, and so, that certainly leaves some room for defining, and one certainly could - we think our system of saying, you know, sit for 18 years and then you become a senior judge and you're - we use you when you are available and when we have a case for you to decide and you do some other things around the court is still within the limits of good behavior.",
        "Now, there are people who do argue that that provision would require a constitutional amendment, and part of my answer to that is, well, OK, do it.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I don't - if somebody wants to make a constitutional amendment out of it, it could be done, perhaps, although it would be a very hard sell.",

        "Yeah.",
        "The Supreme Court of the United States has never been very good about thinking about the judiciary.",
        "In fact, I've said on other occasions, the only guy in the history of the U.S.",
        "Senate who ever took seriously his responsibility for this set of issues was a guy named Evarts, who got the Judiciary Act of 1891 enacted, which created the United States Courts of Appeals, and he said he'd made a major part of his life to try to reduce the kingly power of United States district judges.",
        "And it's a hard thing to do, and a constitutional amendment would be hard to do as well.",
        "But if, you know, if Congress wants to pass a constitutional amendment, I wouldn't oppose it, but I - depending on what it said.",
        "If we're talking about an 18- or 20-year term or 75-year-old age limit or something of that sort, it's a reasonable thing to do.",
        "The other three proposals we make clearly have no constitutional impediment to them.",
        "The chief justice of the United States does not - is not appointed for good behavior; he's just designated by the president.",
        "Something could be done about providing some kind of rotation in that job, which would make a good deal of sense.",
        "The job is a very different job that anybody envisioned that it would be in the 18th or 19th century.",
        "We've assigned a whole lot of other duties to the chief justice of the United States, and it would make some sense to make that person in some degree accountable to some kind of governmental process for the successes or failures of performance.",
        "Likewise, the selection of the cases, for a long time, the Supreme Court of the United States had no choice; it had to decide all the cases that somebody appealed to them.",
        "And Justice Marshall in his famous opinion in Marbury said, you know, that's why we have to make constitutional laws because we have to decide these cases, we have no choice about it, and therefore, we must decide whether what Congress has done as constitutional.",
        "Right.",
        "So, the idea that's some lower courts might or lower-court judges might be doing some of the selecting and designating some cases that they would have to decide would simply take us back a few decades to a former time.",
        "And it would result in requiring the justices to decide a considerably a larger number of cases.",
        "A few years ago, they were deciding a couple of hundred cases a year, and somehow, because of the selection process, we're down to - one year, last year, it was down below 70.",
