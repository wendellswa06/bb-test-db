        "So after all this drama of the Alito nomination, he was confirmed without - without a lot of trouble, and in the end, the Democrats who opposed him did so primarily because of his conservative ideology.",
        "So what have we learned from this whole process?",
        "Well, I think we've learned a couple of things.",

        "And I think the other thing is what you said about ideology, that there's just no real shorthand for talking about ideology in political terms, and so we had a lot of sort of hand wringing by the Democrats about the state of Alito's heart and whether he was nice, and a lot of sort of chest thumping by the Republicans about his open mind and what a good guy he was and that he came up from an immigrant family.",

        "And watch, Madeleine, for two things.",
        "Watch for subtle changes in the language of restraint, humility.",
        "Watch the court sort of slowly erase the sort of larger than life presence that it's had in the last couple of decades.",
        "And I think the other thing to watch for is watch for the sort of centrality of Anthony Kennedy, who really will become the swing voter on the court.",
        "He's traditionally very conservative, sort of known for voting with the conservatives most often.",
        "But I think he has now become what Sandra Day O'Connor used to be, and it's going to become very, very interesting to watch the ebb and flow of his own jurisprudence over the coming years.",
