        "The vaccines that are licensed currently protect against four different types of HPV - Human Papillomavirus.",
        "One of the vaccines protects against HPV 6 and 11, which cause almost all genital warts, and both of the licensed HPV vaccines protect against HPV 16 and 18, which cause most cervical cancers and other HPV-related cancers.",
        "Now, the vaccines are about 90 to 100 percent effective in preventing infection with the Human Papillomavirus types that are targeted by the vaccines, and similarly they're between 90 and 100 percent effective in preventing pre-cancers that are caused by those HPV types.",
        "So, why do these vaccines, why is it necessary for kids so young to get it?",
        "It's important for kids to get the vaccine before they are exposed to HPV because the vaccines are not effective if they are administered after exposure to the HPV types that they target.",
        "And what's really important to understand about HPV is that it's spread through skin-to-skin genital contact.",
        "It's not spread through bodily fluids, so a young person doesn't have to have sexual intercourse to acquire HPV.",
        "And many young people in the early and mid-teens are experimenting with such behaviors and thus they acquire HPV very early on in the teen years.",
        "So, for example, in a recent study that was done by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 25 percent of the 14- to 19-year-old young women had already acquired HPV.",
        "And we have had presidential candidates raise the issue also of its safety, but what research is there out there about the safety of it?",
        "There's a great deal of research, and both HPV vaccines have been associated with minor side effects.",
        "And those minor side effects are common with all childhood vaccines.",
        "So, those might include redness at the site, swelling and pain.",
        "But no serious side effects have been causally linked to either of these vaccines, either of the two vaccines.",
        "Meaning there may have, some people may have reported some kind of side effects, but that they haven't been factually linked to the vaccine itself.",
        "Exactly, exactly.",
        "So, there are many disorders that may happen during adolescence.",
        "Those might include autoimmune diseases, neurologic diseases and so on.",
        "So, they may develop a disorder after vaccination, but those two occurrences - developing the disorder and being vaccinated - are true, true but unrelated.",
        "So, the disorder's not caused by the vaccine; it just occurs with a temporal relationship to the vaccine.",
        "With HPV being back in the news, what is sort of the buzz in terms of what doctors like yourself are talking about going into this conference?",
        "Many clinicians are concerned about the misleading reports in the media about the safety related to HPV vaccines.",
        "These are some of the safest vaccines ever tested, and they could have a substantial public health impact.",
        "And clinicians worry that parents will be concerned about vaccinating their children and that clinicians will be hesitant to recommend vaccinations.",
        "So, clinicians are quite concerned about these unsubstantiated reports of adverse effects related to the vaccines.",
        "Dr. Jessica Kahn of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.",
        "Thank you so much."

        "But remember that during the Columbia space shuttle accident, a piece of foam broke off the fuel tank and hit the shuttle's left wing on the way up, and it actually punched a hole.",
        "And when Columbia tried to reenter the atmosphere it broke up.",
        "And that was, you know, a pretty small piece of foam, by sort of human standards, it was about the size of a briefcase.",
        "But remember the shuttle gets going really fast.",
        "It goes from zero to a hundred miles an hour in something like five seconds.",
        "So there is a lot of concern about foam.",
        "They've been trying to take off as much foam as possible off the external fuel tank, whatever they think they can get away with not having.",
        "After Columbia, they took off that problem area.",
        "But on the next launch, another piece came off, so they took them a year to fix that; which is why this only the second launch since Columbia, three years ago.",
        "And they need - you know, they do need foam because inside that tank - this is a huge, you know, orange fuel tank; it's like the size of a grain silo or something.",
        "And it has ultra-cold liquid hydrogen and oxygen in it, and so they need to put some insulating foam on the outside.",
        "In particular, so they don't get ice that forms, and that could break off.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So it is - it's worrisome."

        "Yeah.",
        "And how big is this crack?",
        "It is four to five inches long, and an eighth to a quarter of an inch wide - is what we're hearing.",
        "And it's sort of near the top of the tank, which is the part you would worry about, because it could fall off and fall down, and hit the shuttle.",
        "It's on a liquid oxygen feed-line.",
        "So, a line that carries the liquid oxygen into the tank.",
        "Which is a - you know, a line - you think of something like a power cable.",

        "I think it depends if they feel like they understand what caused this.",
        "If they feel like, gee, where did that crack come from, then, you know, then I think all bets are off.",
        "You know, they would definitely want to understand why it was that this happened.",
        "But the crack apparently was not there on Saturday.",
        "And they were trying to launch on Sunday, and they filled the tank with the ultra cold stuff.",
        "And then they had to take the stuff out of the tank.",
        "And then on Sunday the crack was found.",
        "So I think there's some evidence that maybe it was due to the, you know, the change in temperature by loading it with the liquid oxygen, and hydrogen.",
        "Hmm.",
        "So, but until they sort that out it's unclear.",
        "That is, I think, that is one option.",
        "But, you know, they point out they have had problems with foam on the launch pad before.",
        "For instance, on one earlier launch, there was problem with a woodpecker who was very determined to peck his way into the fuel tank.",
        "And that left quite a number of holes in the foam.",
        "Which is just sort of, you know, the foam is like cork, or, you know, Styrofoam.",
        "And it comes off quite easily.",
