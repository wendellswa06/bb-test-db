        "Barney Frank had a wonderful line after it was all over, when people were saying, well, what about all the pork?",
        "He said, you know, if you don't want politics in this process, you really shouldn't be handing it over to 535 politicians to vote on.",

        "They voted for it yesterday.",
        "What forces were at play, aside from the fear that you mentioned, but political forces we recognize in New York, Washington, Chicago, Tennessee, elsewhere that might have helped focus their minds?",
        "Well, you know, Zach Wamp actually said in his speech, the pension funds of Tennessee are upside down.",
        "So, I mean, his constituents were calling him saying, you know, you've got to pass this thing or we have terrible problems.",
        "California was worried about rolling over its commercial paper.",
        "You don't think that had an effect?",
        "But there's two people I want to quickly mention.",
        "One is Warren Buffett who publicly supported the bill and said it could be a good deal for the government.",
        "And there's a lot of congressmen who were influenced by that because they thought if Warren Buffett thinks it's good, then I'm going to vote for it.",

        "The second person is Barack Obama.",
        "Unlike John McCain who made that public spectacle of himself by suspending his campaign to, quote, unquote, \"\"fix the bill,\"\" and then did nothing, Barack Obama actually worked the phones between Monday and Friday and really changed a lot of minds in the Congressional Black Caucus which was largely opposed to the bill on Monday.",

        "He's charged with allowing his men to beat an Iraqi prisoner who later died.",
        "He's Lieutenant Andrew Ledford.",
        "The trial raises also some questions about what the CIA did in Iraq, as NPR's John McChesney reports.",
        "It's unlikely that Lieutenant Ledford would be facing a court-martial if an Iraqi citizen named Manadel al-Jamadi hadn't died while being interrogated by the CIA in the notorious Abu Ghraib prison over a year and a half ago.",
        "Al-Jamadi had been captured by Ledford's Foxtrot SEAL platoon hours earlier and delivered to the CIA.",
        "Photographs of al-Jamadi's iced-down corpse emerged in the Abu Ghraib prison scandal and triggered an investigation into his death.",
        "The SEALs were working closely with the CIA near Baghdad in 2003 as the insurgency began to boil over.",
        "Using CIA intelligence, the SEALs were tasked with killing or capturing what were called high-value targets.",
        "Manadel al-Jamadi was suspected of killing 11 people in the bombing of a Red Cross facility, so in the middle of the night the SEALs broke into his apartment and, after a fierce struggle, cuffed and hooded him and threw him into the back of a Humvee.",
        "Ledford and his men are charged with punching, kicking and beating al-Jamadi with rifles after the capture.",
        "But before capturing al-Jamadi, the SEALs had blown the door off an apartment only to discover they were in the wrong place.",
        "One platoon member, Dan Cerrillo, testified at the court-martial that they'd received faulty intelligence from the CIA, adding a sarcastic `as usual.",
        "Shortly after that remark, Cerrillo, who fought and had subdued al-Jamadi, revealed a bitterness felt by some members of Ledford's platoon.",
        "Saying he was not happy to be in the courtroom, he added about the charges against his platoon, `I don't think this whole thing was right.",
        "Cerrillo testified that on another night he beat a handcuffed prisoner for five minutes, sometimes with heavy force, while working with a CIA interrogator.",
        "He said he was told not to strike the prisoner in the face because it would be hard to turn him in.",
        "Manadel al-Jamadi was delivered to the CIA walking under his own power, and died roughly an hour later in the shower room at Abu Ghraib.",
        "He was in CIA custody as one of the prison's so-called `ghost detainees.",
        "The Associated Press reported that documents show he died while suspended by his wrists with his arms tied behind him.",
        "Lieutenant Ledford is charged with allowing his men to beat al-Jamadi for roughly 20 minutes at a forward operating base before handing him over to the CIA, but none of the government witnesses could verify that Ledford saw the beating or participated in it.",
        "The prosecution presented a sworn statement from Ledford saying that he had punched al-Jamadi in the arm, but the defense claims that Ledford was tricked into that admission during an eight-hour interrogation, during which he was told he might be charged with manslaughter.",
        "The prosecution rested its case yesterday.",
