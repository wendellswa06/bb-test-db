        "And we saw about 100 civilians in the village.",
        "I spoke to several of them, and they were complaining about lack of food, lack of medicine.",
        "But they were happy that the Iraqi army treated them with respect, and they treated them well.",
        "And then you could see in the village, the remnants of ISIS and what they've done - the tunnels, all these punishments for various so-called, like, crimes such as homosexual relations, such as adultery, such as drinking alcohol.",

        "What did you see?",

        "As you look back, do you worry at all that there was an overreaction, and that perhaps you were creating exactly what a terrorist is going for - images of scores of people in a community, afraid and panicked?",
        "I'd be concerned about that if it had been an indefinite sort of thing.",
        "We knew that we couldn't ask people to stay indoors indefinitely.",
        "And we also made the judgment mid-day that we would end this request by the time the house-to-house search in Watertown finished, one way or another; and we did.",
        "So as you get ready for this next marathon, is the idea in your head, sort of as you look for the balance, how much security, how careful to be?",
        "You want to make sure that you're not lending the impression that the terrorists won somehow?",

        "And there will be a lot of law enforcement presence, but not so much as to feel like we have changed the character of the event.",

        "Is that a plausible scenario?",
        "I think - I think you'd only see it briefly.",

        "oil companies, stop drilling so prices will go back up.",

        "The question it comes down to, at what point do they quit drilling so many wells?",
        "If U.S.",
        "oil producers were to cut back on drilling, what would the ripple effect be throughout the economy, not just in that industry but in all the industries that depend on it?",
        "Well, of course, you'd put rigs down, and you have 1,900 rigs operating in the United States.",
        "You cut out jobs, and, you know, states like North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas - right now those states are fully employed.",
        "The economy would suffer with that and you would cut down supply and the price of oil would go up and gasoline price would go up.",

        "producers really have the power to influence price?",
        "Doesn't that power pretty much reside within OPEC?",
        "Well, it's with OPEC as to how much they're going to produce.",
        "If they want the price to go up, they drop supply.",
        "And that historically - the Saudi's - you remember 10 years ago, OPEC had quotas for every country.",
        "But OPEC became the swing producer, so if they wanted the price to stay up, they produced less oil - the Saudi's did.",
        "And if you remember back in '86 when the Reagan administration talked the Saudi's into producing more oil, bringing the price down and breaking the Russians, that's exactly what happened.",
        "They did produce more oil, and Russia had to have oil income, and the price of oil went down to about $10 a barrel.",
