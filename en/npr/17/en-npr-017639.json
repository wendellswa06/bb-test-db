        "This morning, we're remembering novelist Terry Pratchett, who wrote more than 70 books.",
        "He died yesterday at the age of 66, eight years after being diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's.",
        "Pratchett is best known for his series of fantasy novels set in a magical place called the Discworld.",
        "It's populated by witches, wizards and inept police officers.",
        "Plus, one of his most frequent characters was Death.",
        "Pratchett portrayed him as a Grim Reaper, who, on the page, speaks in all capital letters.",
        "In Discworld, Death isn't such a bad guy.",
        "He has a fondness for cats and a fascination for human quirks.",
        "He rarely takes souls out of malice; rather Death is simply providing an essential service.",
        "In the real world, death wasn't far from Pratchett's mind.",
        "After he discovered he had Alzheimer's, he spoke with candor and humor about the disease and how it affected his ability to write and to read.",
        "Our colleague Steve Inskeep interviewed Terry Pratchett four years ago.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)",
        "The difficulty with reading is nothing to do with the eyes really.",
        "It's because the mechanism which allows you to, as it were, read through the page, turn and still find your place doesn't work for me.",
        "It's a bit of a bugger, but it's not that much.",
        "Eventually Pratchett lost his ability to type, so he switched to computer dictation software, which allowed him to keep writing, though he'd found the software had some deficiencies.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)",
        "I have to teach it new words because it's an American product.",
        "Oh.",
        "In its original state, it doesn't have some, like [expletive], for example.",
        "It doesn't have that?",
        "Well, we do have that word in the United States."

        "I'm fully aware.",
        "But I...",
        "But maybe we pronounce it differently here, and that's causing the problem.",
        "Now, Pratchett also became an advocate for legal, physician-assisted suicide.",
        "He said he would prefer to choose when to die before his mental facilities were too far gone.",
        "But he also said he couldn't bear the thought of no longer writing.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)",
        "At the moment, I get about; I write books.",
        "So as far as I'm concerned - as far as I'm concerned - I'm a writer who's writing books and therefore I don't want to die.",
        "You'd miss the end of the book, wouldn't you?",
        "Terry Pratchett's publishers say when death finally arrived naturally, Terry Pratchett was surrounded by his family.",
        "And the post on his Twitter account offered a message marked by both lucidity and wit.",
        "The last post read simply, The End.",

        "In the most publicized case, the court ruled on behalf of a group of white firefighters in New Haven, Connecticut.",
        "By a vote of five to four, the justices said the firefighters wrongly lost out on promotions because of their race when the city sought to discard test results fearing a lawsuit from minority firefighters.",
        "With that ruling, the justices overturned an appeals court decision - a decision that included the woman who may become their new colleague, Justice Sonia Sotomayor.",

        "The problem in New Haven was that when the city gave a new promotion exam, no African-Americans scored high enough to win a promotion to lieutenant or captain.",
        "The Civil Service Board then held hearings, decided the test was flawed and set aside the results so that a new test could be designed.",
        "The city said it voided the tests because under the Civil Rights Act, racially disproportionate test results are suspect.",

        "And today the Supreme Court ruled in their favor.",
        "Writing for the court majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy said that under the Civil Rights Act, fear of a lawsuit is not enough to justify what Kennedy said here was a good-faith but nonetheless impermissible decision to scrap the test based on, quote, \"\"raw racial statistics.\"\" In short, he said all the evidence suggests the city rejected the test because the higher-scoring candidates were white.",
        "A city can only set aside test results, the court said, when there's a strong basis in evidence that the test was either intentionally or unintentionally discriminatory, or that a better test exists that would not produce such racially disproportionate results.",
        "No such evidence exists in this case, the court said.",
        "And because the test was fair and job-related, the city had no good reason to fear losing a lawsuit if it was brought by minorities.",

        "Here is Frank Ricci, the dyslexic white firefighter who studies with flash cards, paid a tutor and scored high on the exam.",
        "I think that this is just proof positive that people should be treated as individuals and not statistics.",
        "And that won out at the Supreme Court today.",
        "Conversely, New Haven Mayor John DeStefano was disappointed.",
        "I have no doubt that we have more to do in this country to ensure a just and civil society that lives up to the promise of America, a promise that in our time, more than ever, demands the protections afforded by robust civil rights laws.",
        "Although today's ruling is a big victory for the white firefighters in New Haven, the decision appeared not to sweep broadly.",
        "And it specifically avoided any suggestion that the provision at issue in the Civil Rights Act is unconstitutional.",
        "University of Virginia Law Professor George Rutherglen says that the thrust of today's ruling is to make it harder to use tests.",
        "Cities and other employers, they now have to be very careful once they settle on a test.",
        "They are going to be almost bound by the results of it.",
        "It will be difficult for them to discard the tests.",
        "Michael Rossman, of the conservative Center for Individual Rights, agrees."

        "I think it will have a broad effect.",
        "Not necessarily based on my feelings that this happens a lot, but that it sets up a set of ground rules for employers in trying to determine how far can they go in making these types of employment decisions, and particularly promotion decisions.",

        "UVa's Rutherglen observes that the city found itself in an extremely rare situation.",

        "John Payton of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, while disappointed in today's ruling, says he thinks such tests will play a smaller and smaller role in the future.",

        "She noted that many departments have created mock fire situations to test for leadership and command qualities, and for knowledge.",
        "In a rare oral defense from the bench, Ginsburg used a rhetorical skewer on her more conservative colleagues.",
        "The white firefighters understandably attract the Court's empathy, she said.",
