        "Rick Potts, a paleoanthropologist who runs the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian, says the role of museums is to safeguard irreplaceable fossils such as Lucy.",
        "In fact, he points out that a 1998 agreement signed by 20 countries, including the U.S.",
        "and Ethiopia, states that hominid fossils should not be moved out of their country of origin except for scientific research.",
        "The deal to bring Lucy to Houston, Potts says, ignored the concerns of scientists who've spent their careers collecting, curating, and studying these types of fossils."

        "Well, the Iranian government has actually made that point.",
        "And it is - you have to question, would they do something that would humiliate the Japanese prime minister on his first trip ever, since the 1979 revolution, to Tehran?",
        "And also, because he was seeing the supreme leader, it's one thing to perhaps humiliate the president of Iran or others - there's a deep division in Iran; but for the Revolutionary Guard to have done something like this that is embarrassing to the supreme leader would be very surprising.",
        "And I think that's one of the reasons there are a lot of questions."
