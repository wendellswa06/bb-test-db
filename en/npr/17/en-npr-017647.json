        "Well, I think at all of them, actually.",
        "So, there were - in 2008, there were 68 three-star restaurants, and in November, I went to the last of those.",
        "And so, until the 2009 season kicks off, I've pretty much been to all of them.",

        "Yes, I think one of my long-term favorites has been a place called Louis Cannes in Monaco.",

        "That's a place with fantastic ingredients.",
        "So you've got a tremendously good local market there.",

        "If you - you see, if you're being paid to go by the New York Times or whatever, you know, then, you know, you can go to somewhere like Masser(ph) in New York and spend, you know, was it - it's $440 before you've even - including service - before you've even had a drink.",

        "And so I'll have, you know, fish and chips or something if it's good, and to me, it's all about whether it's good in its context, you know?",

        "Well, my grandmother, who was in her 90s, was gracious enough and had enough faith and confidence in us to use her house as collateral, and we took out a small 20,000 dollar loan, opened up a 2,000-square-foot restaurant in 1988.",

        "Or do you think it brings you closer together?",
        "How do you feel about all that?",
        "Well, first of all, you know, Gina and I made a pact when she first started working in the restaurant, and this was a sincere pact that, if, in fact, it ever affected our marriage, that we would cease working together.",
        "Because we've always felt like raising our girls, staying married is the most important thing.",
        "I mean, we've often talked about, you know, the divorce rate is 50 percent, but we always said we were going to be that other 50 percent."
