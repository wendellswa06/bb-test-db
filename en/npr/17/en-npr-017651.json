        "Today the unemployment rate for black men is higher than it was in 1968.",
        "We have gone from an economy that thought it was bad to have unemployed people to an economy that thinks it's bad to have inflation.",
        "And so we have carried out policies that have favored fighting inflation over fighting unemployment.",
        "So we would have to return to those policies and the importance of having full employment.",
        "While Dr. King was alive from '64 to '68, the poverty rate for black children plummeted from about 66 percent to 39 percent.",
        "That record of 39 percent stood for 27 years after his assassination.",
        "We didn't lower the poverty rate for black children until after 27 years had passed.",
        "And when you look at what we did to the minimum wage, what we did to unionization, what we did to unemployment, it's not a puzzle why the poverty rate wouldn't fall.",
