        "At the United Nations, the man in charge of emergency relief operations, John Holmes, says this is one area that he's now working on, trying to mount a vaccination campaign and fill the many gaps left by the expelled aid groups.",
        "Holmes is also trying to get a better sense of what President Bashir means by his latest threat — to get rid of all foreign aid groups and Sudanize relief work in the country.",
        "Obviously the idea that we would simply hand over goods at the port to be distributed or monitored without our involvement is not one that would not be acceptable to us.",
        "We need to make sure that our aid is distributed and monitored according to our standards, so it doesn't look very realistic to us as presently expressed.",
        "Activists who held a teleconference about Darfur yesterday say President Bashir seems to be in the mood to escalate his standoff with the West, and they see this is a test not only for the United Nations but for the Obama administration.",
        "John Norris of the Enough Project called on President Obama to lead a concerted diplomatic effort to make it clear to Khartoum that its behavior is unacceptable.",
        "Jerry Fowler, who runs the Save Darfur Coalition, is also waiting to see the White House act.",
        "Why is there a disconnect between how passionately and articulately candidate Obama addressed the issue of Darfur and said that the genocide there is a stain on our souls — and what President Obama is doing and saying now with millions of lives at stake?",
        "We need presidential engagement and we need it now.",
        "State Department spokesman Robert Wood said he expects the administration will name a special envoy for Sudan, but no decision has been made.",

        "If the administration is not ready to appoint the envoy, then there needs to be a temporary owner; someone who is already on board needs to drop what he or she is doing and focus on this crisis, because it's not going to wait.",
        "As for the aid groups, Joel Charny of Refugees International says they should be allowed back to Darfur because of the humanitarian needs and should not be part of any deal-making on the International Criminal Court case against President Bashir.",

        "Being blacklisted in Hollywood means a whole different thing these days.",

        "And in Leonard's case, he can only read a fraction of them.",

        "So you're probably reading between 500 to 1,000 screenplays in a given year.",
        "And maybe none of those will be optioned, right?",
        "That's entirely possible, yes.",

        "Can you tell me the story?",
        "It's the story of several young men, frustrated by the unreasonable expectations that Jane Austen's novels have created in modern romance, find themselves back in time, and the only way to return to their modern day is by seducing Jane Austen.",
        "And that - has that been optioned?",
        "Is that going to be made?",
        "To my knowledge, it remains a currently available script.",

        "Yeah, indeed, I mean, it's somewhat ironic because people would say, well, you know, he's African-American; he's actually literally African-American since his father is African, but it's true.",
        "And I think frankly, though, it shows the maturity of the African-American constituency in the context - well, particularly within, we'll say, in the Democratic Party that the African-American candidate has to ask for their vote and work for their vote just as well as the white candidate - the leading white candidate - in this case being Hillary Rodham Clinton.",

        "What's so interesting here, though, is that the whole question of a so-called identity politics is really being kind of turned - has been turned on its head because, you know, on the one hand, people are looking at this as Barack Obama, a black man seeking black votes and so forth.",
        "But, you know, if you've taken into the factor, as Donna said, the issue of black women, you know, are they supposed to be thinking off - in terms of being black and going for the black man or are they supposed to be taking in terms of being women and going for the woman?",
