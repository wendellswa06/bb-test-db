        "Good morning, David.",
        "All right so we have a confirmation now.",
        "Kavanaugh's on the court.",
        "What are experts, analysts saying about how the court might change with him seated?",
        "Kavanaugh's placement on the court cements a conservative 5-4 majority, probably for years to come.",
        "Whereas Justice Kennedy, the Reagan appointee that Kavanaugh will replace, was pretty conservative himself - but he occasionally sided with the court's liberal wing, most famously in a string of gay rights cases - Kavanaugh is expected to occupy a space well to the right.",
        "So that shifts the center of gravity.",
        "You will now have Chief Justice John Roberts as the tipping-point justice.",
        "The question is how much restraint Roberts displays in the name of the court's institutional integrity.",
        "That will determine whether the shift to the right is gradual or swift.",
        "But a shift it will be.",
        "And we could start finding out really soon.",
        "I mean, October looks to be a busy month for this court.",
        "What's on the docket?",
        "And what should we be looking for?",
        "(As Mother) Coraline, I don't have time for you right now and you still have unpacking to do.",
        "Lots of unpacking.",
        "Well, as Politico notes, one early case is one that our colleague Hansi Lo Wang has covered aggressively.",
        "It concerns the 2020 census and that controversial citizenship question, more particularly whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross should have to answer questions about his role in adding that question.",
        "Critics, who say the question would compromise the accuracy of the headcount, they want to quiz Secretary Ross.",
        "The administration has tried to shield him from questioning.",
        "In the past, Kavanaugh has written that presidents are too important to be distracted by this kind of litigation.",
        "So we'll see if that logic extends to Cabinet secretaries.",
        "There's also a case about whether gays and lesbians should be protected from discrimination in the workplace.",
        "The court has not officially granted a review to that.",
        "That's one that could be on their docket.",
        "Scott, one - a poll that came out last week - actually, it was our poll, NPR's - suggested that Republicans have been very energized by this confirmation battle, maybe closing the energy gap with Democrats, but Democrats also talking about, that a debate like this is going to fire up their base.",
        "Has this confirmation battle changed the dynamic heading into the midterm elections?",
        "It's certainly energized Republicans to match Democrats, who are already pretty excited.",
        "We'll see if that lasts now that Kavanaugh has been seated.",
        "It's possible that, given the geography, this will have a mixed reaction.",
        "It could help Democrats in the suburban districts that will determine control of the House.",
        "And it could also help Republicans in some of the rural red states that will control the fate of the Senate."
