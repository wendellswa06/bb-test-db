        "Wouldn't they have known that getting lawsuits off the books, tactically was wrong?",
        "Yes, without a doubt the executives at Lehman would have known it was wrong and, in fact, each quarter they had to certify to their investors in the SEC, that, in fact, these financials were right.",
        "That was required by Sarbanes-Oxley, and yet they failed to do that.",
        "Clearly it's not a matter of there was an acquirement that they didn't know about.",

        "How common do you think this practice of, I gather, a bank taking some securities off its books temporarily in transactions designed to make the bank's books little bit better for quarterly reporting deadlines?",
        "There was becoming increasing focus in the capital markets on how leveraged up these firms were, how much capital they had to sustain losses, and whether or not competitively they were in as good a shape as their competition.",
        "And while the report, says Lehman had done this since 2001, clearly they ramped up this practice when there became increased focus and attention on their balance sheet, apparently, according to the examiner, just to make things look rosier to their investors than what really existed.",
        "But what they were doing was, this particular technique, was it if the intent were different, is it legal, though - can a company do that sort of thing?",
        "No, I don't think a company can do what they were doing and moreover what they were doing had no real business purpose behind it.",
        "Its only purpose was to create a false fa�ade in these financial statements and a picture that had no connection with reality, whatsoever.",
        "If you were back at the SEC and your people were looking over these statements from Lehman's - that they were filing in those days - would it have been impossible to detect what the true condition of the firm was - or with adequate resources and looking in the right places and asking the right questions - could the SEC have figured out, this is just off, they don't have the money to back up the exposure there?"

        "But when you read the actual descriptions of these things, it seems much more damning - that he was very loose with dispensing opiate drugs like Percocet, not just sleeping aids like Ambien; that he was prescribing for himself or that he was not keeping track of these powerful drugs; that he was drunk while he should have been attending the president; that he was drunk driving.",
        "So - and these are coming from 23 current and former military who worked with Jackson and who approached the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.",
        "They didn't go looking for all these people.",

        "Bush and now President Trump and people on his staff, who say they just cannot believe these charges at all.",

        "And that is really frustrating the senators involved in this.",
        "They are used to unanimously confirming VA nominees.",
        "And the fact that all of this stuff is coming out now, when it could have come out quietly in a background check and never gone public, is really frustrating and depressing people in the veterans space because they don't want to have a nasty, party-line vote where they get...",
