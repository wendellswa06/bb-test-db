        "traffic, as well as others who questioned him at the EPA; a home he rented from a friend whose wife was a lobbyist with business ties before the EPA - got it for a discounted rate; an expansive security detail that accompanied him to personal events like the Rose Bowl and Disneyland; and some $43,000 for a soundproof booth he had installed at the EPA.",

        "He's expected to tout his repeal of those regulations at the EPA that had been put in place by the Obama administration - so targeting Republicans.",
        "But when it comes to those ethics scandals, he's likely to blame others.",
        "His opening statement that went out this morning makes no mention of the scandals, only what he's done at the EPA.",
        "But there's a lot of work going on behind the scenes for him to try and work up some talking points to respond to some of these things.",
        "For example, on those first-class flights, he'll say that changes have already begun, that he's started to fly coach; that the former head of his security detail who'd recommended those measures has taken early retirement.",
        "On those pay raises, we've heard him before blame others for this.",
        "But he hasn't been very specific.",
        "And perhaps the most important work he's been doing in his defense has been before the hearing.",
        "He's been reaching out to Republican members, got in touch with the chairman of both committees.",
        "And he's been telling them, apparently, that their districts had received agency grants to clean up industrial sites known as brownfields as The Washington Post reports.",
        "Wow.",

        "And together, they will meet there before having a highly, highly symbolic banquet dinner with all sorts of menu items with foods from various leaders' - or both those leaders' past lives.",
        "It sounds like every second of this, someone has given thought to the symbolic importance.",
