        "Well, here's the thing.",
        "Tariffs are a tax on imports, which is supposed to make imports more expensive and domestic goods at least relatively more appealing, right?",
        "Why doesn't it work out that way?",
        "For a few reasons.",
        "But for starters, companies and countries can find ways to get around them.",
        "So I spoke to Jared Bernstein.",
        "He's an economist who used to be with the Obama administration.",
        "He's been looking at trade issues for years.",
        "And so one option is to very slightly alter your product to get around the way that the tariff is written.",
        "I remember that - when we put a tariff on Japanese motorcycle engines that were 700 centimeters and the Japanese quickly started making motorcycle engines that were 699 centimeters.",
        "And not only that, but countries can also find ways to assemble their products in another country so that it ends up getting shipped from that second country to the United States, and it avoids the tariff that way.",
        "So, yeah, there are ways to get around them.",
        "All right, so first you can be slick with the production.",
        "The other thing is something called the boomerang effect.",
        "Can you explain that?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It essentially means that the point of a tariff is to hurt another country that you might think is not playing by the rules and trying to send more of their products to the United States and then not let the United States send as many of its products over there, right?",
        "And what ends up happening with the tariff is that you put it in place, and instead of just harming the country that's not playing by the rules, you end up harming yourself.",
        "Take a company like Boeing, right?",
        "It imports Chinese products in order to make airplanes, OK?",
        "But what if China also retaliates?",
        "Well, then you end up in a situation where Boeing ends up importing more expensive products from China, and it has a harder time selling its airplanes back to China.",
        "And so you end up in a situation where the tariff just ends up harming yourself and not the other country you were trying to target.",
        "All right, Cardiff, so what's the alternative to tariffs that would work better?",
        "I mean, what do you do if you feel like a country is being unfair in their trade dealings?",
        "You got a couple of options.",
        "The first one is to actually do nothing about the trade war itself and instead just recognize that the United States benefits from free trade.",
        "It helps the economy grow more.",
        "And so it should just invest a little bit more money in those parts of the country that are hard-hit specifically by trade.",
        "There's a second option, and it has to do with how to offset the effects of what's called currency management or, if you want to be less diplomatic about it, currency manipulation.",
        "And here we're specifically talking about China.",
        "It has to do with the way that China, the Chinese government, buys U.S.",
        "dollars in global currency markets in order to make the dollar more expensive and its own currency, the Chinese yuan, cheaper.",
        "And that has the effect of making Chinese goods cheaper inside of the United States, but it makes it more expensive for American companies to sell goods inside of China."

        "So is there a way to counteract that?",
        "Well, one possibility is that we could essentially do what the Chinese are doing but going in the other direction.",
        "So if the Chinese are buying American dollars to make their currency cheaper, we could buy the Chinese yuan to make the American dollar cheaper.",
        "And in that sense, the United States won't itself be engaging in currency manipulation necessarily.",
        "It'll just be offsetting the currency manipulation that the Chinese have been engaging in for a while.",
        "OK, got it.",
        "Cardiff Garcia, thanks so much.",

        "The agreement is good for seven years, and it involves 10 of the late pop singer's albums.",
        "It covers licensing Jackson's music for films, theater, television, possibly even computer games.",
        "The Jackson estate is guaranteed at least $200 million.",
        "That will go much of the way towards paying off the debt that Jackson accumulated before his death last June.",

        "The word post-racial has been thrown around an awful lot over the past few years.",
        "Some eagerly embraced the term to help explain political and demographic changes taking place in America.",
        "Some dismissed the whole concept, saying it's ridiculous to suggest that America has moved past issues of race.",

        "What does that this term mean?",
        "What is the post-Black era?",
        "Blackness is not necessarily the entirety of who they are.",
        "And it's not that there's some people who are post-black and some are not.",
        "We're in a post-black era, where identity-freedom is infinity and you can be black however you choose.",
        "And as Skip Gates says, if there's 40 million black people, there's 40 million ways of being black.",
        "These concepts of authenticity and legitimacy are vanquished and bankrupt and illegitimate themselves.",
        "But not really vanquished because America seems to ever be engaged in this debate about what it means to be black.",
        "Is someone actually black enough?",
        "I mean, I see there are self-appointed volunteer identity cops who want to talk about this person is not black enough.",

        "But the soul patrol has not gone away.",
        "No...",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "These are ridiculous concepts.",
        "You can form a blackness for yourself and all forms of it are legitimate.",
        "You look at the black experience, as multifaceted as it is, through various different prisms in this book.",
        "But I want to focus on politics and, in particular, the criticism that's being waged at President Barack Obama from the black community.",
        "And before we go on, I want to take a listen to part of President Obama's interview that aired last night on BET."

        "Is the way this is billed and presented, is that not in itself somewhat of a double standard?",
        "I think that it's also - speaks to what I talk about with the complexity of modern black America, is that you would have a black president whom many black people are like, I have questions about this guy; I just don't accept him at face value; I wonder about this guy.",
        "And what's that based on?",
