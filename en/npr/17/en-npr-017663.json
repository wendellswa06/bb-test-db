        "While Bobby was on the field at Yankee Stadium, another Bobby, a rabid 9-year-old fan, was following the drama across the river in Queens.",

        "Like most Yankees' fans, 9-year-old Bobby Costas was cheering for Mantle.",
        "Except for the creepy button eyes, which Coraline's other mother think she should sew on, too, this side of the trap door is pretty cool.",
        "It's brighter, happier, more fun.",

        "Novelist Neil Gauman had something similar in mind for Coraline, who's forever plunging into things, and director Henry Selick delights in making those plunges physical.",
        "The movie's stop-motion work is plenty impressive in 2-D, which is how it's being shown in about half its theaters.",
        "But this is the first stop-motion film to be actually conceived in 3-D, so it's worth finding a theater playing it that way and getting the full effect as Selick pulls the camera back into corners to make rooms loom larger and deeper and, on the far side of that trap door, scarier.",
        "He'll peer up from below at a spinning chandelier dispensing mango milkshakes, and down from on high at scurrying bugs and mice, using wide-angled camera work with a sort of video-gamey feel - which you'd think would seem crazily artificial.",
        "But it doesn't because Selick's placed his real faith not in the gimmickry that \"\"Coraline's\"\" audiences will think they've shown up for, but in the stronger virtues that they'd likely view as old-fashioned - character, and story, and handmade figures, handmade milkshakes, handmade blades of grass, each one moving utterly persuasively as he and his animators tweak it frame by frame.",

        "Deborah, it now appears that Washington's Arab allies are distancing themselves from the Bush administration's stance on this.",

        "One example is Jordan's King Abdullah.",

        "Staunch US supporter, now expressing disappointment with Washington.",
        "Well, in the early days of this conflict, Saudi Arabia made statements calling Hezbollah's actions reckless adventurism.",

        "A powerful Arab state, a Sunni Muslim power, was criticizing an Islamic group, a Shiite Muslim one.",

        "Hezbollah has fought harder, held out longer than anybody expected, including the Israelis.",

        "Here in Damascus, Renee, Saudi trucks are lined up to drive into Lebanon.",
        "The International Committee of the Red Cross organized the large convoy, but the Saudis are in such a hurry to get there, they're breaking away from the organized convoy to take a more direct but a more dangerous route into Beirut.",
        "Well, the US involvement in Iraq of course hasn't helped any of this in terms of the Arab view of America.",
        "Bashing America is a regular feature in this part of the world, but it's taken to another level now by what Arabs are seeing on their television screens.",
        "So the pro-American Arab leaders have to try to cool those tempers.",
        "But the conflict has added new challenges for their support for the US.",
        "Western diplomats here give the Bush administration a failing mark in public diplomacy.",
        "As one said to me, for the first time Washington has a Made in Israel tag stamped on its forehead, and it looks like the US is doing Israel's bidding and has failed to make its own goals clear.",
        "You know, the US Secretary of State's catch phrase about creating a new Middle East, it's discussed all the time here.",
        "For the Bush administration it means promoting democracy, but here it's understood as a code phrase, an Arab Middle East dominated by Israel with American backing.",

        "Earlier this year, the chief judge of the federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Alex Kozinski, retired after The Washington Post detailed allegations that he subjected law clerks and other women to inappropriate comments and behavior.",

        "And, after we started, we wrote a letter.",
        "We got about 700 other law clerks to sign the letter and make some recommendations, and then we began working with these working groups that were trying to address the problem in the judiciary.",

        "But I've heard as well that some law professors and law schools have said, you know, this judge is particularly difficult to work for - which can be coded language for something more culpable.",
        "So, for people who are not familiar with your field, can you talk about what effect that this could have on a young woman's career?",
        "Because you can see that some people might say, well, that's great.",
        "You know, that was an attempt to shield these women from a difficult situation and to sort of protect them.",
        "But there's another side to that.",

        "They're - you used the word demi-gods.",
        "Seems a little strong, but tell me about that.",
        "The point I'm trying to make is that when you come out of law school, and you start working for a judge, this is a judge who might have written opinions that inspired you to become a lawyer.",
        "And this is somebody who is deciding the rights for the most vulnerable people in the country and for the most powerful.",
