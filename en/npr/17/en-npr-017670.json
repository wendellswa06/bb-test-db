        "Then we're going to do, essentially, a flyby at the space station.",
        "Now, something that's important to appreciate is that the space station is actually zooming around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour.",
        "People sort of think it's just sort of up there and stationary, but it's zipping around the Earth at - it actually completes an orbit of the Earth every 19 minutes.",
        "So you can think of this like you're trying to synchronize speed with something that's going 12 times faster than a bullet from an assault rifle.",
        "And we've got to match the space station.",
        "As the space station makes more movements in its orbit, we've got to track those movements exactly.",
        "So we'll do a wide loop around the space station, establish communication - a communication link with the space station, have our docking sensors lock on and then the spacecraft actually plots an approach vector and will go in and pause at various points before finally going into dock with the space station.",
        "And what time into the mission will it actually dock?",
        "There's a little bit of variability there, because it depends on how things are looking and whether we need to upload new software or new navigation vectors.",
        "But it should be around three or four days after launch.",
        "And so mission control, NASA will tell the space station crew they're go for capture, or is that up to you guys?",
        "It's a joint effort.",
        "Both NASA and SpaceX have to get - be green for the docking.",
        "As you say, they'll do a flyby.",
        "Will that mean the astronauts will be looking at the statives(ph) of your space vehicle, the Dragon?",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "They'll see Dragon doing a loop around the space station.",
        "It's a pretty wide loop, so Dragon will still look pretty small from the space station when it's doing that wide loop around the space station.",
        "But I mean, just to visualize things, it's like literally imagine you doing a loop around a bullet that's going 12 times faster than something that came out of an assault rifle.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So it's a dodgy affair."

        "I know.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Right.",
        "Docking in orbit was accomplished in the '60s - I think Gemini 2, whatever.",
        "It was doing - Ed White was involved and some of things.",
        "Anyhow, so are you sort of relearning all the spacey things that astronauts have been doing for years?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, to some degree, what SpaceX has been doing, thus far, is kind of catching up to the state of, you know, the present state of space technology, and now, we're beginning to - I think we're beginning to exceed it.",
        "And in the coming years, we're really going to push the frontier of rocket technology to places that it's never been before.",
        "And so what is the ultimate goal?",
        "Is it to create a substitute cargo ship like this - like the Dragon, or is it also to bring people into space?",
        "Absolutely to bring people.",
        "And in fact, the cargo version of Dragon is very similar to the crew version.",
        "In fact, even the cargo version has windows.",
        "And if you were to stow aboard the Dragon and hide out amongst the cargo, you'd actually have a pleasant flight up to the space station, assuming things go well.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "So no monkeys for you like NASA had.",
        "You just have - you just go up there without any people in it, but could have people if you needed to.",
        "If someone stayed aboard, they'd fine.",
        "So we actually will have some biological cargo.",
        "And in the future, we'll be carrying plants and mice and various experiments to and from the space station.",
        "And it's quite big inside Dragon.",
        "In fact, we've got space for seven astronauts.",
        "And we've been doing advanced work on the crew version of Dragon, which like - that's it very similar to the cargo version, which has a great advantage because we're able to, therefore, prove out the system in cargo without risking human life."

        "So you've got the same human capacity as the space shuttle had, which was...",
        "That's right.",
        "Exactly.",
        "...at the same time.",
        "But we're much cheaper.",
        "So we're about one-eighth the cost of the space shuttle, and I think that - a much safer design because Dragon, when carrying crew, will actually have a launch-escape capability.",
        "So it has a escape rockets to get away from the rocket if there's an emergency.",
        "And being an automatically stable kind of capsule gum-drop shape, it means that the main heat shield will actually orients itself downward even if there's a failure in the flight systems.",
        "And that means that you don't have to worry about it.",
        "If you got a plane, you got to maintain a particular angle of attack.",
        "You've got to worry about whether the various control systems are working properly.",
        "And if there's any flaw in that, then you've got a real problem.",
        "You don't have that issue with Dragon.",
        "And it'll also have a double-layer heat shield and much more robust heat shield as well.",
        "And then the new version of Dragon, the one that will carry crew, actually they're capable of landing propulsively, so landing on thrusters, which I think is pretty cool.",
        "It'll have a parachute back up, though, it's capable of landing on its thrusters.",
