        "I mean, I don't think from my open perspective that this was unexpected.",
        "You know, what's a little shocking is how widespread it's been.",
        "I think there's a lot to suggest that it's purely race.",
        "I mean, one of the things that really points in that direction is an analysis of the voting in the South, where I come from, in the deep South states, where by and large, the votes for McCain/Palin were significantly higher than the Bush votes in earlier in 2004 and 2000.",

        "My question, Erik, is this.",
        "Do you get a sense that these incidents are random or isolated, or are they part of a more organized groundswell of racial intolerance?",
        "Well I think that Mark can speak to the white supremacist movement seeing Obama's election as what they hope is going to be a bonanza for them in terms of recruiting.",
        "We know that one of the most popular white supremacist websites got more than 2,000 new members the day after the election, compared with 91 new members on Election Day, according to an AP count.",
        "And that site was actually offline temporarily on November 5th because of the overwhelming amount of activity it received after Election Day.",
        "So I think that the white supremacist movement is going to try and revitalize itself, but really, we're seeing a few pathetic racists and violent extremists here, and they're lashing out.",

        "Sheila...",

        "He says, `It is also important that the New Orleans area not lose its most skilled workers to jobs in other states.",
        "True, these companies do want to help, but I also wonder how many of them were already looking for skilled workers in their own area and see this as an opportunity to recruit talent from New Orleans.",
        "The real disaster would be if the most talented and skilled workers never do return to rebuild.'",
        "Finally, an e-mail from Mary Medley of Portland, Oregon, brought to our attention the story of another town ravaged by floods over a half century ago.",
        "The town was called Vanport and it was, she wrote, `at the time of the flood, the second-largest city in the state.",
        "It was built during World War II as housing for the shipyard workers.",
        "It was also the most integrated city in the state, possibly the region.",

        "My pleasure.",

        "What was it like before this flood?",
        "Well, Vanport was a unique city.",
        "It was at the time the largest housing project that had ever been built in the United States.",
        "It was built very quickly.",
        "Within one year, they had constructed all the housing, 10,000 units.",
        "The problem was that they had built it on what was a flood plain because in the city of Portland, the housing authority did not want new construction of public housing to compete with private housing.",
        "And particularly they didn't want many of the African-Americans that Henry Kaiser had brought in to work in his shipyard.",
        "So Kaiser went outside the city, bought 650 acres, financed the project—very quick building—with public funds and with kind of cast-off products, a lot of plywood and cheap materials that weren't needed in the war effort.",
        "So it was a pretty rickety thing and it was never meant to last.",
        "It was meant to be taken down at the end of the war.",
        "But there were many people there that didn't have anywhere else to go and the city didn't want in particular the many African-Americans who were living there to come into the city.",
        "So the housing continued in this very rickety situation.",
        "How did the levee break?",
        "What led to the breaking of that levee?",
        "Well, it was actually a railroad bridge, a trestle—not a bridge, a trestle.",
        "And it was really just landfill.",
        "So there was no formal construction of a levee.",
        "On the other sides of the project were more formal dikes, but this was just landfill and so it was very susceptible to seepage.",
        "The Columbia River was 15 feet above normal.",

        "It's the dying gasp of racism among a minority of Americans who just haven't realized that things have changed.",
        "Well you know, you made reference to the Klan, and I'd like to ask you about that, Mark, more specifically.",
        "Because we know that Klan activity was high in the 1950s and '60s, and it seemed to have gone dormant, or at least underground to a certain extent for a while, but is it back now, given Obama's presidency, and to what extent might you expect it to grow?"

        "You know, frankly, I think there's been a lot of hype about a Klan resurgence and comeback, you know, kind of on the shoulders of the Obama win, and I don't think that's happening.",
        "You know, you asked earlier, are all these incidents, you know, some kind of organized or are many of them related to organized activity, and I think the answer is clearly absolutely not.",
        "These are you know, these come from individuals all over the place.",
        "There's nothing to suggest that there's any kind of organization behind these.",
        "These are really, you know, the angry, the kind of raging outbursts of people who feel that somehow the world is being taken from them, that, you know, sort of the country their white Christian forefathers created, you know, they've been robbed of, in some way.",
        "You know, there is Klan activity out there, to return to the kind of second part of your question.",
        "You know, just last Friday we actually won a major case against the Imperial Klans of America up in Kentucky, based on their attack on a 16 year old boy a couple of summers ago, a kid they called a, quote unquote, \"\"illegal spic\"\" and then proceeded to beat him really badly.",
        "Now, you know, that suit will likely put the Imperial Klans of America out of business.",
        "But there are, you know, 33 other named Klan organizations out there.",
        "So you know, the Klan is there, but I have to say, it's very small.",
        "You put all those different groups together, there might be five or perhaps 6,000 Klansmen in America.",
        "And the comparison - and this really goes off something that Erik just said is of the Klan in the 1920's, you know, which reached a membership of almost four million people, was very connected to real political power, actually ran political organizations in states like Indiana.",
        "So you know, I agree that this is a bit of a last gasp, although I don't think it's precisely the darkness before the dawn.",
        "I mean, I don't think that we're not in a post-racial era, that racism is not going away.",
        "Let me jump in to ask this question of the both of you, because I think one of the things that will be instructive about our discussion with regard to this is how the community is reacting to it, and how the reaction of the community to these incidents differs, if it does, than how the community has responded historically to the actions of the Klan.",
        "Erik?",
        "Go ahead.",
        "I think that that's a real big difference, and I think it goes to what Mark just outlined for us about the Jim Crow era, which is that there was an active community support for collective violence against African Americans back in the day.",
        "You had 4,900 African-Americans lynched or legally executed in ten Southern states between 1882 and 1930 alone, compared to just under 600 European Americans.",
        "And today, in 2008, rather than being standard among whites, blatant racism has been more marginalized.",
        "It's not to say average white people don't have their own prejudices and stereotypes, but the dehumanizing bigotry that defined America during the Jim Crow era is now discredited, and the community reaction to these acts of bigotry and violence post -election has been overwhelmingly to denounce the hate and to rally against the bigotry.",
        "Is that your take, Mark?",
        "That is my take.",
        "I think that's exactly right.",
        "I think that, you know, there's just a tremendous difference between, you know, kind of racial extremism in a context in which it really does - or is connected to the believers of real power, and the Klan and similar groups today which are marginalized, very desperate people, very unhappy by and large, and of course, looking at the whole world crashing down around them from their point of view.",
        "So you know, one interesting thing in all of this is, you know, if you look at the Klan of say the 1920s, or even the Klan of the civil rights era, these were groups that were seeking - they were essentially restorationists.",
        "They were, you know, let's get back to the halcyon era, the sort of Garden of Eden when, you know, men were men and women were women and black people knew their place.",
        "You know, today these groups are so marginalized that their ideology has become actually completely revolutionary, in the sense that they despise the American government and everything it stands for.",
        "You know, what they want is a race revolution which will throw, you know, blacks quote unquote, \"\"race mixers,\"\" brown people, Jews and so on out of the country and they make this completely a, you know, sort of Aryan state.",
        "I've got about a minute for this last answer.",
        "I'm going to bring it you, Mark, because I'd like to know if you think there will be a change in the approach of the Justice Department now that an African-American, Eric Holder, is going to become the attorney general in the Obama administration?"
