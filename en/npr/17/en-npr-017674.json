        "Both of them recognize that the troop escalation that began last year, known as the surge, has brought down violence somewhat in Iraq, but they both say that the surge hasn't brought the political reconciliation, that it was the stated goal.",
        "And both of them are saying they have timetables for bringing troops out.",
        "Here's Hillary Clinton at the last Democratic candidates' debate last week in Los Angeles.",
        "I will begin to withdraw troops in 60 days.",
        "I believe that it will take me one to two brigades a month depending how many troops we have there, and that nearly all of them should be out within a year.",
        "Well, how much does Senator Clinton's plan for a pullout differ from Senator Obama's plan?",
        "Well, they're essentially the same in their goal of a quick pullout.",
        "But while Hillary Clinton says when she'll start bringing troops home, she's refused to give a deadline for bringing them all back.",
        "And Obama, on the other hand, has talked about having all combat forces out in 16 months.",
        "And both candidates have talked about leaving behind some kind of residual force.",
        "But the two of them haven't really clashed over what they'll do in the future.",
        "Their fights over Iraq have really been all about the past.",
        "Obama never misses a chance to point out that unlike Clinton who voted in the Senate in October of 2002 to authorize the use of force in Iraq.",
        "He was opposed to the war from the start.",
        "And not spend lots of time talking about.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think I would be the Democrat who would be most effective in going up against a John McCain, or any other Republican, because they all want basically a continuation of George Bush's policies.",
        "Because I will offer a pure contrast, somebody who never supported this war, thought it was a bad idea.",
        "I don't want to just end the war, but I want to end the mindset that got us into war in the first place.",

        "Now, Senator Clinton now says that had she known then what she knows now, she would not have voted to authorize the use of force against Iraq.",
        "But she has stopped short of apologizing.",
        "That's right.",
        "And here's how she defended her vote while debating Obama last week in Los Angeles.",
        "It was a sincere vote, based on my assessment at the time, and what I believed he would do with the authority he was given.",
        "He abused that authority.",
        "He misused that authority.",
        "I warned at the time it was not authority for preemptive war.",
        "Nevertheless, he went ahead and raged one which has led to the position we find ourselves in today.",
        "And here's what Obama had to say about that.",
        "The authorization had the title: an authorization to use military force - U.S.",
        "military force - in Iraq.",
        "I think everybody the day after the vote was taken understood this was a vote potentially to go to war.",
        "I think people were very clear about that.",
        "That...",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE)",
        "An interesting footnote to this, by the way, when the New York Times endorsed Senator Clinton, they pointed out that they urged her to vote against the authorization to go to war in Iraq.",
        "And that was their editorial position, but forgave her on that in light of other things.",
        "On to the Republicans.",
        "John McCain said that U.S.",
        "forces should stay in Iraq as long as they are needed, whether that's a hundred years more or a thousand years more.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think McCain rues the day the U.S.",
        "gave up on Vietnam where he spent 5 years as a prisoner of war.",
        "And for him, Iraq has become a test of American resolve and credibility.",
        "He argues that what Americans can't stand about having troops deployed abroad isn't that the they're there, but that that they're dying there.",
        "And here's McCain yesterday on \"\"Fox News Sunday.",
        "Look, we're in Kuwait next to the war to Iraq.",
        "We're in Turkey.",
        "We're in Bosnia.",
        "We're all over the world.",
        "One of the obligations, unfortunately, of being a great superpower is that we have to take care of the world security.",
        "But we don't have to have casualties because we can succeed in the strategy called the surge which is now, I think, experiencing significant success."

        "You don't want the enemy to understand how long they have wait in the weeds until you're going to be gone.",

        "We'll put in some other benefits as well - life insurance and other features that we decide to pay for.",
        "And the result of that was, the next year, enrollments went up 30 percent.",

        "There are between 100 and 200.",
        "And is there some expectation that that number would rise in anticipation of some sort of transfer of power were Fidel's health to fail?",
        "Well, I think the one reason that this particular step is getting so much attention is that news organizations around the world are very anxious about how they might cover Fidel Castro's death and a transfer of power in Cuba.",
        "Certainly they want a foothold.",
        "So it's unnerving for media organizations around the world to see the Cuban government take these kinds of steps at this time, and that's certainly our concern."
