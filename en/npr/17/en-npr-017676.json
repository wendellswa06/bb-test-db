        "In order to qualify for the plan that was worked out by the Bush administration, a homeowner is going to have to be current on their mortgage and the lender will take a look at their income to decide if they really can't afford to have their interest rate reset, or go up, if you will.",
        "And you asked whether this is a bailout.",
        "Well, the Bush administration has already stressed that this isn't a bailout.",
        "It points out that no government money is being used here.",
        "This is a voluntary remedy agreed to by the mortgage industry.",
        "Well, but for the mortgage industry, the interest rates that they charge are scheduled to reset or go up on these subprime mortgages in the next couple of years, aren't they?",
        "That's right.",
        "The industry estimates as many as two million subprime mortgages are scheduled to go up over the next couple of years, most in the next year and a half.",
        "They could jump from around seven or eight percent to as high as 11 percent; that would be an increase of 30 percent or more in monthly payments when these teaser rates expire.",
        "So, do you - can you tell from what you know about this deal at this point if it's going to be enough to fix the substantial problem we have with mortgage foreclosures in this country?",
        "Well, from the peak we've seen so far, some experts don't think so.",
        "They think the wave of foreclosures that we've been seeing is going to keep growing.",
        "A lot of homeowners are already behind in their payments.",
        "They wouldn't qualify for this program.",
        "And we're already hearing complaints from Democrats on Capitol Hill and in the presidential campaign that this plan just doesn't go far enough.",

        "What's happening on the market at this point?",
        "Well, if they're looking for a fight, they often get it - right?",
        "- because there are groups that come out and clash with them in the streets, which is often what leads to so much of the disarray.",
        "Who are the counterprotesters?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's been causing some big problems on Wall Street, as you know, for many months now.",
        "Well, the stock market opened higher today.",
        "For the most part, anything that might help head off a wider economic crisis is good news for Wall Street, although there is a bit of irony here.",
        "For those investors who've taken what are known as short positions on the mortgage - mortgage industry, essentially they've bet that the problem is going to get worse and financial stocks are going to decline even further.",
        "Well, if this action prevents that from happening, they're going to lose money on the deal if they end up seeing the market stabilize or at least not get as bad as they bet it will.",
        "Okay.",

        "What I'm looking at with regard to the administration getting involved, as well as Secretary Paulson, is not so much this particular plan but the idea that lenders are willing to cooperate with borrowers, with communities.",
        "And so while freezing of interest rates may help a portion of people - I would say probably 20 percent - the bigger ticket here is related to the fact that lenders are now going to be working more closely with those who have seen this coming a long way's out.",
        "And so that's the exciting part of this, for us at least, but we do definitely have some concerns about how this freezing of interest rates is going to affect everybody moving forward, whether it be first-time homebuyers, the general real estate market and the like.",
        "And for people who are calling in that may not be able to be helped out by this plan, what advice do you have for them?",
        "Well, my advice is that there's many options, and freezing of interest rates may be one of many options out there.",
        "And there are difficult options that involve leaving the property, but those would be obviously the last resort a mortgage community is going to look at.",
        "And from our perspective, being an independent adviser, we would want to make sure that we've exhausted all other avenues before we discuss those more difficult decisions of deciding to end the home ownership experience at this time and getting back up into it later on.",
        "I imagine that a lot of homeowners there have heard, you know, these words rate freeze, and they think, oh, phew, I'm going to be okay.",
        "But ultimately, is a rate freeze going to be the best option for everyone?",
        "I think this is what the treasury secretary and the administration is taking a close look at, is that when you talk about freezing interest rates, you need to take into consideration there's three different types of borrowers out there with adjustable rate mortgages: those for whom an adjustable rate mortgage isn't going to affect them whatsoever because they have the income to cover that change in their mortgage payment; those that no matter what happens with that adjustable rate mortgage, they're still not going to be able to pay the mortgage because their income has been diminished; and then the more appropriate group that they're focusing on at this point, are those for whom the freezing of the adjustment is going to work out the best for them - meaning that this five-year term they're speaking about is enough time for them to get squared away on all their other financial issues and then be able to look at this again in five years.",
        "But for others, it's just putting a Band-Aid on a very long-term situation, and that's not the most appropriate option.",
