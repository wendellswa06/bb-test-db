        "Well, it's not entirely clear if you listen to the president.",
        "So President Trump tweeted yesterday that, quote, \"\"this was a meeting to get information on an opponent.\"\" Now, a year ago he said the meeting was primarily to discuss the adoption of Russian children.",

        "Good morning, Tam.",
        "Good morning.",
        "OK, so how is what the president tweeted yesterday, that this was about opposition research, different from what he said about the meeting before?",
        "So in reality, it isn't all that different from a talking point that President Trump and his team settled on a little bit more than a year ago when news of that now-infamous Trump Tower meeting first broke.",
        "But let's go back in time - July 2017.",
        "At first the White House and Donald Trump Jr. claimed that it was just a meeting about adoptions.",
        "That did not hold up for very long because in July 2017 Donald Trump Jr. released an email chain about the meeting.",
        "And in that chain he was offered, quote, \"\"official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia.\"\" And it was described as an offer - as, quote, \"\"part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\"\" So the president was then asked about this, asked about his son's decision to even take the meeting at a press conference with the French president back in July of last year.",

        "Some Iranians say that they should not have to risk being internationally isolated, sanctioned or even a possible military attack.",
        "Other Iranians say that Iran should risk these things if it means that Iran can have nuclear energy.",

        "After Hurricane Katrina hit last August, close to 5,000 children were reported missing.",

        "He's charged with reuniting Katrina victims.",

        "We were able to get that photo aired on national television, and we received a call from the little girl's grandmother who said, `I saved her; she's with me,' but the grandmother didn't know where her daughter, the child's mother, was.",
        "So through that kind of information clearinghouse, what we're doing is trying to link people and reunite their families.",
        "So how many children are still considered missing after the storm?",
        "Well, most of the children are not missing in the traditional sense.",
        "We still have almost 500 cases in which the child was reported to us by a close family member as missing or dislocated.",
        "We have been able to locate and reunite more than 4,500 children with their families, but these remaining nearly 500--we know that some number--we hope a very small number--are children who simply did not survive the storm.",
        "But the vast majority of the ones that remain we are confident are children who are with a parent or a grandparent, but other family members don't know where they are.",
        "So this is more a case of fractured families than of traditionally missing children.",

        "Here's more from NPR's Richard Gonzales.",
        "The National Association of Hispanic Journalists, or NAHJ, issued a statement Thursday saying it will return to Fox News more than $16,000 donated by the network to sponsor its upcoming conference in San Antonio.",
        "The association's president, Hugo Balta, said his group has been in contact with Fox's management to complain about what he considers to be anti-immigrant rhetoric, like when pundits on the conservative network talk about an invasion.",
        "But a recent remark made by Fox News radio host Todd Starnes caused Balta to say enough is enough.",
        "Starnes likened migrants coming to the United States to Nazi Germany invading Western Europe.",
        "That's the straw that broke the camel's back for me and NAHJ.",
        "Balta says Starnes' comments came less than two weeks after the mass shooting in El Paso, where a gunman killed 22 people after publishing a manifesto citing a Hispanic invasion of Texas.",
        "Fox has become a megaphone for disinformation, says Balta."
