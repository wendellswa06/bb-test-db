        "...And push the fire past the containment line.",
        "Here is Cal Fire spokeswoman Tricia Austin talking about that.",

        "Which must be making people in those communities very, very nervous.",
        "How - you said some people have been able to return home, which is great for them, but how are other people coping?",
        "Yeah.",
        "So people are just, you know, terrified about losing their homes.",
        "But specifically these areas where it's burning in Lake County - and there's also the Carr Fire up around the city of Redding - those areas are not particularly wealthy.",
        "And that makes the destruction of these fires all the more devastating.",
        "There's really a lack of affordable housing in those areas.",
        "And so low-income people whose houses get burned down will usually go to wherever they have friends or family they can stay with.",
        "And if that's not in the area, they can miss out on a lot of help from local nonprofits and the government in getting them back into housing in the area where they live.",
        "Well, you mention the Carr Fire, which we've heard a lot about because it was so big.",
        "There's also the Ferguson Fire.",
        "What's the status of those two now?",
        "Yeah.",
        "So the Carr Fire is now 43 percent contained, and it's burned about 160,000 acres.",
        "But now it's mostly burning in mountainous and forested areas where no one's living.",
        "So Redding and many of the surrounding communities have been repopulated.",
        "The Ferguson Fire has always been burning in a fairly unpopulated area, but it's still really large.",
        "It's burned about 89,000 acres and is just 38 percent contained.",
        "And that fire has actually close - forced the closure of the most popular part of Yosemite National Park, Yosemite Valley and some of the surrounding areas.",
        "And park officials said yesterday that that part of the park's going to be closed indefinitely.",
        "Wow, so still a lot to be done.",

        "He's sort of a ringmaster for a wide group of people who seem to want little more than to fight in the streets.",

        "Are they more organized?",
        "Are they?",
        "It's hard to say.",

        "The Unite the Right rally last year led to a lot of identities being released to the public.",
        "It led to lawsuits.",

        "So many groups shut down.",

        "Well, you know, we'd heard that the charges came in these three categories - that he had been loose with prescription drugs, that he had a drinking problem and that he had a toxic work environment.",
        "But when you read the actual descriptions of these things, it seems much more damning - that he was very loose with dispensing opiate drugs like Percocet, not just sleeping aids like Ambien; that he was prescribing for himself or that he was not keeping track of these powerful drugs; that he was drunk while he should have been attending the president; that he was drunk driving.",
        "So - and these are coming from 23 current and former military who worked with Jackson and who approached the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.",
        "They didn't go looking for all these people.",
        "They approached 'cause they were concerned.",
        "And the quotes say that he was one of the worst officers that they ever served with.",

        "Well, yeah, many things you'd think there would be a paper trail on.",
        "What's confusing, really, about this is that whereas you have all of these 23 people who came forward with varying allegations, you have other people who worked with Jackson for years, including President Obama, President George W.",
        "Bush and now President Trump and people on his staff, who say they just cannot believe these charges at all.",
        "So if it weren't 23 different sources, according to Senator Tester on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, it would really be hard to sort of credit these.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, the White House right now is retweeting and putting out there an actual form that Barack Obama signed saying this guy was great, great doctor - trying to validate his character.",
        "It's real cognitive dissonance, but it does seem like they failed to get this stuff in the vetting process.",
        "And that is really frustrating the senators involved in this.",
        "They are used to unanimously confirming VA nominees.",
        "And the fact that all of this stuff is coming out now, when it could have come out quietly in a background check and never gone public, is really frustrating and depressing people in the veterans space because they don't want to have a nasty, party-line vote where they get...",
