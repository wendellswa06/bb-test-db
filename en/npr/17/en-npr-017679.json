        "His opening statement that went out this morning makes no mention of the scandals, only what he's done at the EPA.",
        "But there's a lot of work going on behind the scenes for him to try and work up some talking points to respond to some of these things.",
        "For example, on those first-class flights, he'll say that changes have already begun, that he's started to fly coach; that the former head of his security detail who'd recommended those measures has taken early retirement.",
        "On those pay raises, we've heard him before blame others for this.",
        "But he hasn't been very specific.",
        "And perhaps the most important work he's been doing in his defense has been before the hearing.",
        "He's been reaching out to Republican members, got in touch with the chairman of both committees.",
        "And he's been telling them, apparently, that their districts had received agency grants to clean up industrial sites known as brownfields as The Washington Post reports.",

        "That is true.",
        "However, both sides have been so choreographed in what they're going to be doing tomorrow.",
        "There's a lot of agreement on coming out with some sort of peace framework and some sort of objectives when it comes to improving inter-Korean ties that actually, you know, in this flurry of diplomacy over the past few months, both sides have gotten along quite well.",
        "And so what does the choreography look like?",
