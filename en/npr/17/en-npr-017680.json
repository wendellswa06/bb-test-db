        "The good news is that there were very few deaths.",
        "Only about 15 people died.",
        "Most people were able to get out because the flooding filled into some lower bog areas first before it eventually took over the whole region.",

        "But it's clear that he's a shell of the fighter he used to be.",
        "It's probably fair to say that many who see this fight in person or on Pay-Per-View TV will be watching to see if Tyson pulls a bizarre stunt, like the time he bit off part of an opponent's ear.",

        "Nowadays people are more concerned--even though there isn't a lot of network television, with whatever television is out there, whether it's HBO, Showtime, pay per view, people want to see records.",
        "So managers are more inclined to keep their fighters safe and to develop a glossy record rather than let them develop as a fighter and let the best guys fight the best, which really would draw and attract more fans.",
        "Does it help the fight game when Mike Tyson is still a big name, and--I don't mean to denigrate the guy he's fighting against tonight, but nobody's ever heard of him.",
        "He's regarded as a stiff.",

        "But the problem is that they're an invasive species, and the danger that they cause is really to the ecosystem.",
        "And they're a top predator and, you know, so much has spoken about the importance of top predators in nature shows and their role.",
        "Well, this isn't top predator, it's like an invader who is coming to a system that completely lacks defenses against it.",
        "And so we have very much serious concerns about the potential of that Burmese pythons, and indeed other invasive species, might be causing in the Florida ecosystem.",

        "Where did they start?",
        "Was this just somebody who bought a Burmese python as a pet and let it go?",
        "What is fair to say is that the Burmese pythons and many of the invasive species today have their origin in the pet tree.",
        "Now, that said, it's not like there's a hoard of people running out into the Everglades letting animals go.",
        "In this case, it could've been maybe as few as one or two animals let go in the early 1980s.",
        "If a female has mated and has sperm, she can store her sperm and lay eggs for a number of years.",
        "It would not have taken a lot of animals to cause this problem.",

        "I have to answer - let me answer that in kind of three ways.",
        "First of all, if you were to Google released pythons, you would find that there's a number of locations in the United States, even considerably farther north than Alabama, where people have found pythons that had been released into the wild.",
        "They get to be quite large.",

        "The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission does not have jurisdictions in national parks.",
        "But it would not be unprecedented for the National Park Service to undertake a program of exterminating an invasive species.",

        "Your response to that?",
        "The park service is definitely cooperating with the Python Challenge.",
        "Now, and there are people who are permitted to catch pythons in the park, and they've all been encouraged to catch pythons in the park.",
        "And I hope they do.",
        "I think that in this instance, the caveat is that you can't benefit financially from pythons caught in the park.",
        "So if you do catch a - say, for example, the largest python in Everglades National Park, you couldn't win the award.",
        "Oh, I see, I see.",
        "But that doesn't mean that people can't hunt, the people who have permits, and a number of people do.",
