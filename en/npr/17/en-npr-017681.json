        "And she heard the wriggling though the underbrush and tried to be as quiet as possible.",
        "And the way she tells it, a wrist or arm-size snake fell down out of the trees, and it was in the process of trying to wrap up a squirrel.",
        "And she said it was close enough.",

        "What are you seeing?",
        "So far we're all - you know, of course, one day in for the hunt.",

        "No non-native - no native species were brought in.",

        "One of the things we know, most of the snakes now are caught by people who like to and know how to catch snakes.",
        "I mean, you know, that might seem strange to some people, but there's people that like to do that.",
        "If there's some way we can give them incentives to spend more time hunting, are they going to catch more snakes?",
