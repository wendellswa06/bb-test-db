        "But he talked about how he didn't have that much of a science background, and none of his writers had an extensive science background, and so they were having to go to the Web and Wikipedia in order to get science content.",
        "And he made a statement in that article that he would welcome constructive criticism from knowledgeable sources.",

        "Businesses would not be required to give their employees health insurance, but if a business has more than 50 employees, they would be required to pay the federal government a share of the cost that the federal government is paying to cover those people because workers who don't have coverage would be able to buy health insurance through something called an exchange, where there would be many plans offered.",
        "You could pick and choose the best benefits at what cost you can afford, and the federal subsidies would be circulated through there.",
        "So the employers with over 50 workers would have to pay a penalty if they did not provide insurance.",
