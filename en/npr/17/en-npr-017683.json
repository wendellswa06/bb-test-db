        "When you go back to the days when boxing, as we just mentioned, was the top sport in the country, believe it or not--and I'm almost scared to use this word--but character was attached to boxing.",
        "I mean, it was a noble sport.",
        "These were the noblest of athletes.",
        "Kids would scurry around the neighborhoods to carry their gym bag to the gym.",
        "I mean, they were proud to be around the contender or around the champion or soon-to-be champion.",
        "And I don't think the conduct of a Tyson obviously perpetuates that kind of image.",
        "We're talking about the future and the past of the fight game.",
        "You're welcome to join us: (800) 989-8255, (800) 989-TALK.",
        "Our e-mail address is totn@npr.org.",
        "We're talking with Teddy Atlas, a boxing analyst with ESPN2.",
        "And Natasha.",
        "Natasha's on the phone with us from New Braunfels in Texas.",
        "Yes.",
        "Hi.",
        "How are you?",
        "Very well, thanks.",
        "Great.",
        "I wanted to talk a little bit about \"\"The Contender.\"\" I really thought that that show--it was hosted by Sly Stallone and Sugar Ray Leonard.",
        "I thought that that show would bring new life to boxing.",
        "They had middleweight boxers; they were nationally ranked.",
        "I just really thought that that would be a good thing to bring life back into the boxing game.",
        "And NBC's decided to cancel it.",
        "And I think it's a real shame.",
        "That was one of two boxing reality programs that was on TV.",
        "And, Teddy Atlas, both of them bombed.",
        "Well, the first one really bombed.",
        "The Fox one was poorly conceived and really poorly navigated by the people involved, to be quite frank with you.",
        "It had Oscar de la Hoya attached to it, as far as their marquee name and their host.",
        "But that didn't even, you know, get to the second round.",
        "But \"\"The Contender\"\" was done better.",
        "It had a better production value, I believe, for whatever my humble opinion is worth.",
        "But it was done by Mark Burnett and the DreamWorks people.",
        "And of course Sylvester Stallone, as just mentioned, was involved with it.",
        "It didn't bomb.",
        "I mean, they hit certain numbers, but they didn't hit the demographics, the numbers that--nowadays the magic numbers that you have to hit, of course, go to families, go to women, or go to certain age groups.",
        "And they didn't do high enough in those numbers.",
        "But from what I understand, especially the last episode, they did well enough where they showed they can shop it.",
        "If not NBC, they can shop it to other networks and hope that it will find a place to, of course, come forward again and maybe be up there again next year.",
        "But I think one of the problems with it is they were trying so hard to hit across, you know, into other markets outside of just across the market that boxing would attract.",
        "And that's what you have to do on network if you're going to do a reality show that's going to be successful.",
        "And they might have tried too hard.",
        "I mean, reality means reality.",
        "And in some ways, they almost had to put another word to it and say `sometimes reality' because bringing the kids in and bringing the family in--that's not reality in boxing.",
        "You're not going to have the family coming into the locker room, you're not going to see kids crying at ringside.",
        "And I'm not so sure that that brought forward the response that they thought it would bring forward to people watching it."

        "So again, I'm not so sure that's reality television.",
        "I'm not so sure that they didn't miss the boat with not understanding that.",

        "Well, that is on the mark.",
        "That's a guy that understands the boxing situation all the way across the board.",
        "The organizations and therefore parts of boxing are corrupt, quite frankly--WBC, IBF, WBA.",
        "The IBF was found guilty--aside from everybody, what they thought of the corruption and what they perceived as the corruption, it was proven in a federal court of law that the IBF, the head of it, the president at that time, Bob Lee, was caught on videotape taking payoffs to rank fighters; taking pay for ratings, in other words.",
        "So, yeah, it is corrupt, and it's a damn shame that we can't get a national commission.",
        "Well, that's what the Senate Finance Committee says the price of their bill is.",
        "The Congressional Budget Office actually came out with a lower number: $774 billion over 10 years.",
        "Senator McCain has been trying--I've talked to him in the past.",
        "For the last six years I've been advocating, I've been lobbying on my show on ESPN, to try to get a national commission, as the other major sports have, to give us structure, to give us credibility, to give us the things that this person on the e-mail just rightfully talked about.",
        "I think that this sport needs it.",
        "I think that the fans need it, and they deserve it.",
        "And I think that the athletes in this sport deserve it, and that they would beg for it to come--where we could have structure, we could get rid of some of these organizations that rate fighters, nothing to with the merit in the ring, but with the merit of the relationships that these organizations have, the corrupt relationships that they have with different promoters and different managers connected to the sport.",
        "And of course one of the other things that goes along with that problem is bad decisions.",
        "I talk to fans all around the country every time I get on an airplane going to another show.",
        "And one of the things they say is what that e-mailer just said.",
        "We love the sport.",
        "We love when there's a good fight.",
        "There's nothing quite like watching men against men, making choices, making decisions, being put out there in that chamber of truth that we talk about sometimes in that squared circle.",
        "There's nothing quite like it.",
        "But, at the same time, when there's a bad decision; when it's a horrible decision, a tremendously bad decision, it turns away people.",
        "It makes them run for the fences because they start to feel like it's been preordained; that no matter what happens, the wrong thing is going to happen at the end.",
        "And that's, again, corruption in the sport.",
        "And that's lack of structure, as far as anybody being accountable when it comes to judges.",

        "Remind us, how big a deal was boxing in those days?",
        "Well, I don't think you can overstate it.",
        "It was, in this country, certainly--along with baseball, college football, horse racing--the pre-eminent sport.",

        "There were light heavyweight champions from France and Senegal.",
        "So it was truly huge.",

        "There's a moment in the book where it's revealed at some point that Jim Braddock was on relief.",
        "This was the Depression, and this made big headlines.",
        "And all of a sudden a fight that hadn't been all that attractive--reporters start coming up to the Catskills from England to report on this underdog who's suddenly become the man of the masses.",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "I mean, it was one of these remarkable stories that, you know, people really started paying attention to when they found out that Jim Braddock had been on relief, that he had been among the first people in this country really to go on welfare in 1933 because of the dire circumstances he had at home--he couldn't feed, he couldn't shelter his family, he had to farm out his kids.",
        "And like millions of his fellow Americans at that time, he went on relief.",
        "And that's what made him an enormously sympathetic figure to so many people.",
        "It was something that he was ashamed of, something that embarrassed him, but the story broke not through his own doing, not as a marketing ploy, but through other circumstances.",
        "And that really changed the whole nature of what was going on in his fight against Max Baer.",
        "It made it a huge international story.",
        "And boxing was huge at that time.",
        "I mean, to put into a little bit of perspective, think about in 1927 when Gene Tunney fought Jack Dempsey--it was their second fight, a rematch--in Soldier Field in Chicago, for 30 minutes' work plus about 10 minutes sitting in his corner between rounds, Gene Tunney made $990,000 from that fight, which was more than twice what Babe Ruth had made for his 14 major-league seasons to that point combined.",
        "So what happened, Jeremy?",

        "And people cheered for fighters on the basis of where they came from, their ethnicity, their religion, etc. And, you know, when that all kind of started to fade away, when Italians and Jews and Germans in particular and the Irish stopped fighting, they lost a lot of fans.",

        "And it was really rooted in these gyms in the urban villages.",
        "And for all the many, many reasons that the urban villages broke up in the second part of the 20th century, boxing lost its roots.",
        "So one of the things that happened was that trainers were no longer able to impart the same sort of deep knowledge to fighters that they had before.",
        "And boxing has definitely changed.",
        "I mean, I think--and you see it most in the heavyweights, where defense is less valued than it has been before; where, you know, especially in the case of characters like Tyson, I think, just incredible musculature is so valued by audiences and perhaps TV executives that something like being able to slip a punch or block a punch becomes much less--not only less valuable, but people can't even see it anymore.",
        "Here's an e-mail from Michael Sekulich--I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly--in Grand Rapids, Michigan.",
        "`Big boxing matches used to be on network TV.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "And it also depends where you look, for instance.",
        "Yes, it's true that promoters can sort of go for the main chance and set up too many title fights just to get TV money.",
        "On the other hand, it depends where you're looking on TV.",
        "I mean, if you're looking at Tyson/McBride, I think that, you know, your decline story is going to work very well.",
        "But if you look to a different channel and you look in a different place on that same night--Madison Square Garden instead of down in Washington--you see a Puerto Rican fighter named Miguel Cotto who, you know, has the mark of perhaps greatness upon him fighting a guy from Uzbekistan named Mohammad Abdulaev.",
        "Madison Square Garden will be full, the fight will be on TV, and a very large Hispanic audience for boxing will be tuning in.",
        "You know, the Census Bureau tells us that one out of seven Americans is Hispanic.",
