        "And you just don't see a lot of boxing on their mainstream \"\"SportsCenter\"\" program, for example.",
        "No, that's true.",
        "There isn't a lot of coverage of boxing on \"\"SportsCenter.\"\" There is this week--I happen to be hosting our coverage here as we're covering the Tyson/McBride fight.",
        "And that kind of, you know, tells you all you need to know about what's happened, particularly, as Carlo mentioned, the heavyweight division.",
        "The fact that 17 years after Mike Tyson's last big win--I mean, 17 years since he knocked out Michael Spinks in Atlantic City--he is still the biggest draw, the most compelling figure in the heavyweight division.",
        "We're still paying attention to this guy.",
        "And \"\"SportsCenter\"\" is no different.",
        "I mean, I was at the press conference yesterday, the pre-fight press conference for a guy, again, who hasn't held any of the titles in nine years, who's fighting a tomato can at best in Kevin McBride.",
        "There were reporters from all over the world--Sweden, Japan, South America, all over Europe, all over Asia because Mike Tyson fascinates.",
        "And the only reason he continues to fascinate--I shouldn't say the only reason, but the primary reason is because no one has come along in the last 15, 17 years to really replace him as the object, the focus in boxing.",
        "And, you know, you were talking with Carlo about the TV factor.",
        "You know, it can't help a sport when all of the big events are Pay-Per-View events.",
        "I don't think anyone could reasonably suggest that the NFL would have benefited 30 years ago from deciding to put all the Super Bowls on pay per view and limiting the audience to people who've got 45 to $50 to spend to watch the game.",
        "And, you know, there's no way for the sport to grow when you are not exposing it to the people who want to see it.",
        "The hall was brimming with excitement.",
        "Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn attacked Prime Minister May for failing to come up with a Brexit plan that either the European Union or even some in her own Tory party can support.",
        "I think so, although I think it might be a mistake to imagine that the American people are, you know, somehow more compassionate or squeamish than they were a hundred years ago.",
        "I think the case of Ali is really interesting.",
        "This is the danger of putting the whole sport's fortunes and popularity on one person, is that, you know, as much as that attachment to him helped the sport to become more popular in the '60s, exactly seeing what had happened to him later on encouraged people who were already inclined to turn away to turn away.",
        "There are certainly plenty of witty, interesting characters in boxing who one could look to now.",
        "And I think in a way it's too bad that since everything was placed on Ali, everyone can now turn to him and say, `See?",
        "This is what happens in boxing.",
        "So I'm not going to listen to, say, Bernard Hopkins, who's a fascinating character around now.",

        "No problem.",

        "Yeah, and I remember that I felt Lennox manhandled him...",
        "He did.",
        "...and the decision was unfair.",
        "And Don King was involved in promoting that fight, and since then I've never seen another fight.",
        "I've completely lost interest in the sport.",
        "I think that a lot of the fights are predetermined, they're rigged, or there's a general understanding of what the outcome's gonna be.",
        "And I'd like your comments on that.",
        "Well, I have to say that I think one thing we have to bear in mind--and I'm sure Carlo will agree--is that in terms of fixing fights, the sport was more corrupt in the 1920s and 1930s than it is today.",
        "I think it's very rare that we get what you would really call a `fixed fight.",
        "That being said, there are outcomes that are essentially fixed, because we have so many guys fighting people they shouldn't be fighting, who shouldn't be ranked as highly as they're ranked.",
        "And in the case of the fight you're specifically referring to, that was a fraud.",
        "Jean Williams, who was the notorious judge in that fight, who saw it entirely in Evander Holyfield's favor, was basically on Don King's payroll, and that was a disgrace and there was a New York state Senate investigation, etc. But the sport hasn't essentially cleaned itself up.",
        "There are people who were at that fight, distinguished people such as Dave Anderson--I disagree with him--who thought that Holyfield did win the fight.",
        "I think that's easily a minority view.",
        "But there is a problem.",
        "I think the real problem with corruption--I know you were discussing this with Teddy Atlas earlier in the show, though--is the whole idea that people are ranked where they shouldn't be ranked, that we don't get the fights we want.",
        "I mean, it is to boxing's eternal discredit that in the 1990s, when there were four really compelling heavyweights in Holyfield, Tyson, Riddick Bowe and Lennox Lewis, that Mike Tyson never fought Riddick Bowe, that Riddick Bowe never fought Lennox Lewis as a pro, and that when Lewis and Tyson met and when--that they were over the hill.",
        "I mean, the fact that those guys never ended up getting into the ring to fight each other is disgraceful.",
        "And I think that's another thing that turns off fight fans such as yourself.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I have to say, though, that Muhammad Ali is still one of my all-time favorite athletes ever.",
        "I think there are a lot of people who would echo that line.",
        "Thanks very much for the phone call.",
        "We're talking with Carlo Rotella, Boston College, and Jeremy Schaap of ESPN.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And let me ask you both about the future of the boxing game.",
        "Teddy Atlas did mention the idea that's been floating around for a long time, and it's been brooded even in Congress--of the idea of one national commission, one set of championships, one group to police and market and promote the sport and try to develop it.",
        "Carlo Rotella, is this a fantasy?"

        "Well, I'm not sure that it is a fantasy.",
        "I suppose it's remotely possible.",
        "But let's assume that happens.",
        "Boxing is still not going to be what it was.",
        "It's still basically an esoteric TV spectacle put on by a few thousand people who know how to do it.",
        "It's not part of the fabric of neighborhood life in the way it used to be.",
        "So let's say you get all those reforms in place.",
        "Boxing will definitely be better.",
        "I don't know that people will be flocking to boxing matches, even so.",
        "We've been talking about all the things that turn people off.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Let's say, for example--a few weeks ago, if you'd seen the fight between Diego Corrales and Jose Luis Castillo, a lightweight fight--so not heavyweights, not, you know, people who speak only English and not big, you know, media names--the opposite of Tyson--if you'd seen that fight, even somebody who didn't like boxing, a person would have been so compelled by that fight, I think, that that person would have gone on to see other fights.",
        "And if Tyson and Holyfield had managed to have a fight that good, I think they would have converted a generation of sports fans to boxing.",
        "So, you know, I think that people are in such a hurry to say what turns them off about boxing and to paint a picture of decline; if you look elsewhere, if you look at the little guys, you look especially at Hispanic boxers, eastern European boxers, Asian boxers--I mean, just think about China.",
        "If boxing is the sport of the industrial working class, you know, China could have a great renaissance in boxing coming in the next century.",
        "It's not necessarily all gloom and doom and decline.",
        "Jeremy Schaap?",

        "And so, I never like these moments.",
        "Well, I certainly think it can't hurt.",
        "I mean, the sport is in such a bad state right now that it needs reform.",
        "The sanctioning organizations are, I think, hopelessly corrupt.",
        "They have absolutely no credibility.",
        "The promoters have never had the best interest of the sport in the long term--that's never one of their concerns.",
        "It needs some reform.",
        "But I'm not sure how much can be done.",
        "At the end of the day, you know, you create some kind of an organizing body that--I don't know what control it would exert.",
        "And I agree with Carlo that there are a lot of great things out there in boxing, and there are ways to get people excited about it.",
        "And, you know, I saw some great fights in the last year, covering them for ESPN.",
        "I'm sure Carlo would agree Tony Margarito is one of those guys who's really compelling and exciting, and he had a fight a month ago against a guy named Kermit Cintron, you know, a Mexican guy vs. a Puerto Rican guy, and there was so much about that fight that was compelling.",
        "And the thing that interests me about boxing, working at ESPN where we cover all sports--and I've made a conscious decision to spend more time doing boxing than NFL or baseball or anything else--is that it's the last sport where winning really matters, where so much is at stake every time a guy steps into the ring.",
        "And that's just not the case in the other sports anymore.",
        "I mean, you know, a guy like Phil Mickelson or Tiger Woods or Ernie Els, they could go the rest of their life without winning anything, and it won't make any difference.",
        "For the fighters, you know, it matters financially, it matters in terms of their pride; it matters because if you lose, you get hurt, and that's what's still compelling about boxing.",
        "There's nothing else that I think equals that."
