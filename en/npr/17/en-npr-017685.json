        "Well, it is - it actually, according to the Congressional Budget Office, it actually will cut the deficit by - I've got to look at my paper - by $49 billion, and that's because of the savings that they get from restructuring the system, as I explained.",
        "I mean, there are many more things than we can go into here that are done, and by covering everyone, you eliminate a lot of the duplication and waste that's in the system.",
        "Well, who's going to pay for it?",
        "Well, there are three basic sources.",
        "There will be an excise tax on so-called Cadillac plans.",
        "These are insurance plans that have premiums of over $20,000 a year.",
        "I believe in this bill, it's $21,000 is the limit.",
        "These would be plans that some unions have negotiated with, you know, major manufacturers.",
        "Sometimes it's people in the individual market who have to buy their own policy, and they pay a lot.",
        "So there was an early proposal to tax individuals who had these plans, but the plan here is to actually tax the insurance companies.",
        "There are fees on drug makers.",
        "There are fees on medical-device makers, and there are fees on clinical laboratories, and that adds up to $20, $30 billion, just off the top of my head.",
        "Okay, now we have to concede that radio may not be the best medium for such a detail-rich analysis.",
        "You may want to go to npr.org to find out a little bit more.",
        "If you want to immerse yourself in details in terms of the budget analysis, go to cbo.org…",
        "That's cbo.gov.",
        "…cbo.gov, excuse me on that.",
        "But finally, we've mentioned the public option was left out, but there is something else in its place.",
        "Yes, that's co-ops.",
        "These are insurance companies that are run by the premium-holders themselves.",
        "The experience has been in a few limited places, Minnesota's the one that comes to my mind, because they're run by the premium-holders, they're able to keep - they have been able to keep the cost of the premiums somewhat lower than other places.",
        "But the Congressional Budget Office, which you mentioned, doesn't think much of these and doesn't think they'll save any money at all.",
        "Here's an email question from Anthony(ph) in San Francisco.",
        "I heard yesterday the Baucus plan does not deal with the pre-existing condition problem until 2013.",
        "Is this true?",
        "If so, it seems like one of the most important problems with health insurance now is being shuffled off until later.",
        "Well, I can look through the paper here.",
        "I'm not sure there are so many dates, and it's true that much of this does not kick in for four or five or even six years.",
        "I will look that up as we sit here and get a better answer."

        "Well, for people who make up to about $66,000 a year, a family of four, there would be subsidies, especially when the cost is over 13 percent of your income.",

        "That's been the experience.",

        "You're right, the pre-existing conditions clause does not take effect until 2013, but there are new high-risk pools that you could sign up for until then if you have a pre-existing disease like diabetes or cancer, and that might give you a lower premium.",
        "All right, Joe Neel, thank you very much for being with us today."

        "He's not necessary known, I think, or has a reputation in Washington as a stark ideologue, but there's two issues.",
