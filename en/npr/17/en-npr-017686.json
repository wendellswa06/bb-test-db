        "And as we compare this to what the president had to say to the joint session of Congress last week, these accord pretty closely.",
        "Yeah, it seems remarkably similar.",
        "The mandate is there.",
        "You have the exchange there.",
        "You have the insurance reforms in terms of pre-existing conditions and the so-called rescission.",
        "And then of course, again I'd say the most important figure is that CBO figure, which says this would be deficit neutral or better if - of course, the CBO also stipulated, they said if it's followed to a T, and our experience with government is that often the government doesn't follow things to a T.",
        "Well this may die eventually a death of 1,000 amendments, but in any case, Christopher Hayes, that's the Senate Finance Committee and maybe the United States Senate.",
        "There are an awful lots of Democrats in the House of Representatives who will be unhappy with this measure, too.",
        "Yeah, in fact, today I was just reading about - the president was in College Park, Maryland, discussing health care reform, and when he raised the Baucus bill and mentioned it, the crowd booed.",
        "This is crowd that's made up of sort of liberal Democrats, progressives, the base if you will, and the reason is because of a few of the things that Matt mentioned.",
        "I mean, the lack of a public option has gotten the most attention, but also the subsidies.",
        "There's quite a big difference between the House version of the bill in terms of the generosity of the subsidies and the Senate version.",
        "And the irony is, you know, there's a sort of stereotype of liberals -constantly, you know, the bleeding-heart liberal throwing things at the poor, but actually, it's the middle class that's cut out of the Baucus and included in the subsidy level in the House bill.",
        "So there's a pool of House progressives who said they're not going to vote for a bill without a public option, and the White House has to take that threat seriously, I think.",
        "And Matt Continetti, they do have to take that threat seriously, but you mentioned the name Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, former member of the House of Representatives, of course, and formerly on Bill Clinton's staff, familiar with what happened when the Democrats failed to get health reform through during the Clinton administration.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And you know, you look at the president's popularity.",
        "In a Pew Center poll out today, he's at 55 percent.",
        "And even though the public is relatively split on the merits of the plan, and I know there's five different plans now out there, but let's call it the platonic ideal of the plan, the public is split on support of it.",
        "I think the more important number is that 55 percent.",
        "Look, the bill, whatever bill is voted on in the House, will pass unless 40 Democrats defect from Nancy Pelosi.",
        "And then, of course, if there's no vote in the Senate by October 15, it looks like they're going to go for a reconciliation vote, in which you only need 51 Democrats.",
        "And you know, I think Republicans might be shaking their head more in sorrow than in anger when they - I think the chances of that happening are pretty likely.",
        "Here's an email from Jennifer(ph) in Massachusetts.",
        "I'm confused by Neal's suggestion the Baucus bill is considered the one most likely to get through Congress.",
        "It seems to me everyone except for Baucus is against it, including the rest of the so-called Gang of Six.",
        "Chris Hayes?",
        "Yeah, that's a good point.",
        "I mean, I think the reason that the conventional wisdom is centered around the Baucus bill is because it was going to be the one with the bipartisan support.",
        "I mean, that was the reason that it was going to be the one that was going to be the bill that was going to be the blueprint, and that was it's kind of trump card."

        "Now that it doesn't have that, the question is if they're going to pass it with reconciliation, why would you alienate this massive part of your base for a bill that was modified in all these ways to gain Republican support when that Republican support isn't actually there?",
        "I mean, I don't even mean this on a substantive level, although I think the House bill is substantively better, but just at a basic political level, it's unclear what the benefit accrues in going with something like the Baucus bill if you're not getting the reward of this bipartisan support.",
        "And by reconciliation, he means the parliamentary maneuver the Democrats could invoke, whereby they could gain passage of the bill or much of the bill, anyway, with just a simple majority, 51 votes, not the 60 they would need to avoid a Republican filibuster.",
        "And Matt Continetti, if that's the option they take, well, Chris Hayes has a point.",
        "If the Democrats are going to pass this without Republican votes, why don't they pass the bill they'd like to pass anyway?",
        "I think from the White House's perspective, and here I'm kind of engaging in psychic powers or whatever, but if you're the White House, you see the liberal base of the Democratic Party.",
        "They're going to be with you pretty - you're calculating, anyway, they're going to be with you no matter what, much like conservatives, as much as they whined and moaned about certain elements of the Bush administration - always fell in line with Bush.",
        "Now, you look at the Republicans, if you're Obama and Rahm Emanuel, and you know the Republicans are going to be against you, too.",
        "So you go for that middle of the country, the independents, 43 percent of the electorate, the people who are with Obama, who got him elected in '08 but are now moving in the opposite direction.",
        "These voters are concerned about things like the deficit, which the Baucus bill addresses, and they're also concerned about high prices of premiums, which the Baucus bill tries to address.",
        "I personally don't think it will work, but anyway, politically, you can make that case to the independent voter.",
        "Let's get some callers in on the conversation, Pat(ph) with us from Prescott, Arizona.",
        "Yeah, hi.",
        "As I see it, the Republicans seem to be against the public option, and they want things like tort reform and also the ability to buy insurance policies across state lines.",
        "And I'm - you know, why couldn't there be like sort of a federalist sort of a bipartisanship where you said, okay, well, let states opt out of the public option, and as far as states buying - or buying insurance from different states, why couldn't states do that now?",
        "Like, I live in Arizona.",
        "Why couldn't Arizona pass a law that says hey, we're willing to accept all the rules, you know, or the insurance policies written for Mississippi.",
        "And then you can take Republicans at their word that they want to keep the federal government out of our lives.",
        "And you could say hey, the states can decide whether or not they're going to accept policies from, say, California or Mississippi or whatever, you know?",
        "Well, states have gone ahead with tort…",
        "(Unintelligible) tort reform.",
        "Tort reform, states have gone ahead on their own.",

        "I've read some people suggest that on the Internet.",
        "It's sort of an interesting thing to conceive of.",
        "In terms of the - you know, I mean, if you had a public option in California, for instance, that's a very large risk pool, and if it functioned well, that might work in the kind of laboratory-of-democracy sense to prove to other people that it's not the sort of first step down the slippery slope to socialism.",
        "In terms of selling insurance across state lines, I mean, just to be clear, you know, insurance companies do this.",
        "The issue is whether they abide by the local state's regulation in the market in which they're participating.",
        "And the fear about this selling across state lines is that you essentially create a regulatory race to the bottom.",
        "You end up with some state that is to health insurance what Delaware is to credit cards and corporate governance.",
        "That is to say a state that is the most lax, the least regulated, and all the health care companies, you know, incorporate and opt to use those regulations.",
        "And then you've sort of gutted a lot of the regulatory provisions you're trying to put in the bill.",
        "Matt Continetti?",
        "Well, for better or worse, I mean, people love their credit cards, and it's pretty easy to get one.",
        "And so I think if you transform that metaphor to health insurance, that may actually be a remark in its favor.",
        "I hate to sound like a cynic, though, but I think the problem with federalist solutions is that federal politicians don't get any credit, and so they're less willing to entertain the things that might let these states be laboratories of democracy.",

        "How is the party going to do that?",
        "Well, that's a - that is the big unanswered question.",
