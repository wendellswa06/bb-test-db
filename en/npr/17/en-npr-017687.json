        "And is the real battle, do you think, Christopher Hayes, going to be in reconciliation?",
        "That's going to be when the House passes its measure and the Senate passes its measure, and then they try to marry the two in a single committee to present a bill to both houses that would then go to President Obama.",
        "Right.",
        "So, just so that the listeners aren't confused, conference committee, reconciliation is the - you mean, reconciliation in sort of the general sense of reconciling the two…",

        "The contours of this are identical to the contours over the Recovery Act.",
        "And in that case, you know, the House is able to put in some things that have been taken out by the Senate but largely the bill that came out of conference was tipped towards the Senate.",
        "And the reason was to try to keep those three Republican votes.",
        "One of the questions is, you know, can they get - is - if they're going to do with the reconciliation in which they only need 51 votes, then the center of the gravity, I think, shifts a little bit towards the House.",
        "And so, that's going to play a role into what kind of compromise comes out of conference.",
        "And let me ask you both about timing, both in the short term.",
        "Everybody says if this bill is going to pass it's going to pass this fall.",

        "Right now, the numbers have basically settled.",
        "The public is evenly divided, some polls show a little bit more in favor, some other ones show a little bit more opposed.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And I think that that question is not - you know, in the short term, the White House and the Democratic Party need a political victory.",
        "In the long term, it won't be a political victory for long unless it's not a bill that people like, that provides people with health insurance and end some of the worst kind of insurance industry practices and slows the growth of health care inflation.",
        "So, in the short term, it could be a pyrrhic victory if they pass something this fall and get the bump from that and the bill itself doesn't end up delivering on its promise.",
        "Well, it's going to take - even it is passed, it's going to take some years before a lot of the measures take effect, as we were hearing on the - some of the measures in the bill, at least in the Baucus bill -I think in everybody's bill - don't take effect until after the next presidential election, possibly no coincidence.",
