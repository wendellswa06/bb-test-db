        "He says what do you think?",
        "My mother's a teacher.",
        "But then he goes on this riff of am I in a gang?",
        "And he describes just how closed his world is, and he doesn't really answer the question but he does pose a challenge.",
        "Like, what would you do if you lived where I live?",
        "How would you survive?",
        "I was wondering if that was based on anybody in particular.",
        "It is.",

        "It says everything to other people from the outside, but that is totally not necessarily the truth of who they are.",
        "What do you hope will happen with this piece?",
        "I hope that I will open people's minds and touch their hearts and get them to have real conversation and just very slowly in little one-on-one increments start to talk to people, start to do what that is that they know they could do that could make a difference.",

        "That's a modern Orthodox Jewish congregation here in Washington, D.C., and if you've ever studied the farm workers movement, a name you probably know, Dolores Huerta, one of the earliest members of what became the United Farm Workers.",
        "She was honored for her lifelong activism with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012, and she continues to support a new generation of organizers through her Dolores Huerta Foundation.",
        "One thing we wanted to mention - we taped this conversation on Friday afternoon so that Rabbi Herzfeld could join us, since today is the Jewish Sabbath.",
        "And we called him and Dolores Huerta because we wanted to talk about their role in an American tradition of protest.",
        "This political season has seen a wave of individual activism in a way we have not seen for some time.",
        "And often, the participants are people who say they've never thought of themselves as protesters until now.",
        "One of those people is Rabbi Herzfeld, who told us that as the leader of a congregation he generally avoids partisan politics.",
        "But he made news in Washington, D.C., earlier this week when he disrupted Donald Trump's speech at the AIPAC convention here in D.C.",
        "on Monday.",
        "Rabbi Herzfeld stood up, put on his prayer shawl and shouted this man is wicked, he inspires racists and bigots, don't listen to him.",
        "And he shouted that until he was escorted out by security.",
        "So I started our conversation by asking him how he made the decision to do that.",
        "It was a very difficult thing for me to do, and I knew that not everybody would be pleased.",
        "Even some of my closest friends would be very disappointed with me and upset with me, but I felt a religious imperative to stand up.",

        "They drew up on the blackboard exactly what I had sent them.",
        "Of course this is a chemistry teacher who finds out that he can make a lot more money making methamphetamines using his chemistry knowledge than he can teaching school.",
        "Yes, and he's a very good organic chemist.",
        "He's an excellent organic chemist.",
        "And so he makes excellent meth.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Are you ever fearful that he'll give away the recipe, the real way - does he ever give away the real way to chemically make meth in a lab on the show?",
        "Oh, do they do that?",
        "Are you asking that?",
        "No, they don't.",
        "That was actually one of the concerns of a lot of people, but Vince Gilligan has been very clever.",
        "You know, there are multiple ways to make meth.",
        "And so although his scenes are very accurate, he will sort of (unintelligible) together parts of different syntheses, so that if you just simply followed the one synthesis as it's presented, you wouldn't come out with methamphetamine."
