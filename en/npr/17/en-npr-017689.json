        "So you must be sad to see it going into its last season then?",
        "Yes, you know, it's been a wonderful show, but I really do believe that others will pick up where he's left off in this one aspect.",
        "Do you believe that science is having sort of a rebirth on - in the entertainment industry, on television, perhaps in the movies with science movies and TV shows coming out?",
        "Yeah, I think it perhaps is.",
        "I know that many of the scientists are trying to become more available now as science advisors, and the National Science Foundation is really trying hard to further this.",
        "And you know, there have been even discussions in Congress about what we need is a hit television show that portrays good science.",
        "And that's been said for a long time.",
        "And of course like I mentioned, there are many shows that already fill that, such as \"\"CSI,\"\" but this is the first time that we've had one, I believe, on organic chemistry per se.",
        "I would have never thunk it myself, being - having done so terribly in chemistry in my own lifetime, that a hit show would be based around organic chemistry.",
        "Yeah, well, I say that, you know, it's a lifetime goal trying to teach organic chemistry, to make it easy, and I'm starting to wonder if I'm ever going to achieve it in my lifetime.",
        "But we do try.",
        "Do you use the same teaching methods that he does in front of that classroom?",
        "No, not really.",
        "Of course I'm teaching at the graduate level, and the chemistry that I'm teaching is more difficult.",
        "I'm teaching undergraduate and graduate both, but it's just - it's a little more advanced than what he gets into.",
        "His is really sort of a lower level.",
        "And when you get more to the higher levels, you have to teach more pattern recognition.",
        "It can't possibly be just straight memorization.",
        "I think the key to making it easier is the pattern recognition and, you know, relating just simple rules to be able to absorb the mass amount of material and draw patterns across the material.",
        "That's what will make it easier."

        "And what makes this show interesting to viewers, I guess, is that it deals with the drug world, which a lot of people know a lot about, but it uses that as, so to speak, the catalyst to talk about the science itself...",
        "Yeah, I think that much of the science is so spectacular that to me it seemed to almost become a separate character in the show.",
        "And when I mentioned that to Vince, he said yes, that he thought that was the case.",
        "And so I don't know if he actually intended that from the beginning, but that's the way it's worked out, and I think it's wonderful.",

        "You'd tune in see what he might be talking about, what the science might be in that episode.",

        "Well, we know that if we do not do the protest, then nothing changes.",
        "This is basically the way that you get the attention.",
