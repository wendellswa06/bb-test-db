        "Yeah, I wanted to mention that because I think many people may have forgotten that in September of 1988 - this is in front of the St. Francis Hotel in Union Square, you were badly beaten by San Francisco police during a protest of - then it was candidate President George H.W.",
        "Bush.",
        "I don't think many people kind of associate his candidacy with that kind of, you know, street protest and something that escalated to that degree.",
        "And you were beaten so badly as I recall that you had several broken ribs and that your spleen had to be removed.",
        "How did it get to that point?",
        "What happened?",
        "Well, it was interesting because there was no type of violence at all in the protest until the police moved in and started beating people up.",
        "And - but one of the good things that came out of that particular protest is that they had a change at their practices of the San Francisco Police Department to make sure that future protesters wouldn't get the same type of treatment that we did.",
        "So, you know, something very good came out of that.",
        "And again, many times we know - we go back to the Vietnam War, we go to, you know, women getting the right to vote, the civil rights movement - it was these protests that were able to eventually change laws.",
        "And even when violence is bestowed upon us, you know, by the authorities, do not respond with violence.",
        "And I think that that's of course the way that we have to continue with that type of a mindset, like with Gandhi and Dr. King and Cesar Chavez that we do our protests - we do them peacefully because that way, I believe that we have a spiritual energy that is then invoked and that the people who are the perpetrators of violence that they will be reached by that spiritual energy of gun violence.",
        "And you know, after 20 years of working on a project, a lot of people come to hate the person they're biographing.",
        "It's not an uncommon experience.",
        "And Manning never - his eye never wandered from what he wanted to say about Malcolm.",
        "One more thing I wanted to mention is that - and I hope you don't my mentioning it in this way - is that neither of you, Dolores Huerta, Rabbi Herzfeld - neither of you is a kid, a child, right?",
        "Because I think many people think that the people who engage in these kinds of protests are very young.",
        "One of the things that Donald Trump in particular says, go home to mommy to sort of imply that the only reason you're doing this is because you're immature or you don't - you know, you don't get it or something like that.",
        "So I just - I was curious about that.",
        "And Dolores Huerta, you are continuing to engage in these kinds of protests in your seasoned years - shall I put it that way?",
        "I just wanted to ask you about that.",
        "Does it ever get to be too much, or is there any other final thought you wanted to give us about that?",
        "Well, I just hope that those types of criticisms never keep anybody from protesting.",
        "Yes, I'm going to be 86 years old on April the 10 in just a few more days.",
        "So no, I will never stop protesting as long as I have the energy and the health to be able to do it - si, se puede.",
        "That was activist Dolores Huerta, joining us from Bakersfield, Calif., Rabbi Shmuel Herzfeld here in Washington, D.C.",
        "We want to say again that we recorded this conversation on Friday in advance of the Jewish Sabbath.",
        "We also want to let you know that this network has an ongoing request in to the Trump campaign to talk about this and a number of other issues.",
        "The agency that Margaret Hamburg has been running for the past six years likes to say that it oversees 20 cents of every dollar of consumer spending.",
        "She is leaving the post of commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.",
        "We spoke on this program when she first came to Washington from New York City when she'd been commissioner of health.",
        "That was back in 2009.",
        "Doctor Hamburg, since we spoke at the beginning of your time at FDA, we thought we'd have an exit interview.",
        "Is that OK?",
        "That's great.",
        "Yes - sort of bookends to the experience.",
        "There you are.",
        "Back in 2009, we talked about tobacco, and I didn't ask you then about electronic cigarettes 'cause I don't think I knew about them.",
        "The Centers for Disease Control now says that between 2010 and 2013 the use of e-cigarettes doubled among American adults.",
        "Was the FDA too slow out of the gate on e-cigarettes?",
        "We actually tried to take an action to regulate e- cigarettes shortly after I became commissioner.",
        "We wanted to regulate them as drugs alluded by a device, but we lost that effort in court, and we were told to regulate them using our new authorities in the Tobacco Prevention and Control Act.",
        "And we are in the midst of trying to extend our authority over tobacco products to include e-cigarettes and also other tobacco products - gels and lozenges, hookahs."

        "But it sounds that - in the case of e-cigarettes, say - that the agency has been outraced by the market in this case - that you're playing catch-up with them.",
        "Certainly, e-cigarettes are becoming increasingly prevalent in the marketplace.",
        "I think it's also important, though, to recognize that there's a lot still to be known about e-cigarettes.",
        "We don't know, for example, whether e-cigarettes are a gateway to other significant tobacco use or whether they can be a meaningful tobacco cessation tool.",
        "I want to ask you about the criticism that the group Public Citizen makes of the relationship between the FDA and the drug companies.",
        "They say that the partnership - a partnership that you've praised when it's been efficient - just is not the proper relationship between the regulators and the regulated.",
        "Is there need for reforming that relationship?",
        "In terms of the ability to deliver on the promise of science and the opportunities for new medical product development today, FDA must be a partner with the research community, academia and industry and must make every effort to streamline and modernize our regulatory review systems at the same time that we adhere to established standards for safety and efficacy.",
        "I'm very proud of what we've been...",
        "You're talking about a balance.",
        "You're talking about a balance here...",
        "A balance.",
        "...Which is making sure that unsafe drugs don't reach the market, but also you're saying drugs should reach people in need of those drugs as quickly as possible.",
        "That's right.",
        "We joke at the FDA that there are only two speeds of approval - too fast and too slow.",
        "And people's assessment of is it too fast or is it too slow, I think, depends on the particular circumstance and their particular needs.",
        "Doctor Hamburg, do you assume that one of your successors at FDA as commissioner in the near future will have responsibility for regulating recreational marijuana?",
        "Well, of course we've seen an explosion of marijuana for medical purposes and recreational purposes across the United States.",
        "Our role in terms of oversight of various kinds of drugs, including botanical drugs, really has to do with assessing the product in terms of treatment of a specific medical condition or need."

        "You know, I have not heard discussion of that, but one thing I've learned in my role as FDA commissioner is to be prepared for the unexpected.",
        "Certainly, many of the kinds of products that we're regulating now were products that I had never dreamed of before either during my medical training or even when I took on the mantle of FDA commissioner.",
        "Apart from e-cigarettes, which we talked about, what's an example of something you found yourself surprisingly in charge of regulating in Washington?",
        "Well, for example, it never occurred to me that we would be regulating replacement body parts created by 3-D printers.",
