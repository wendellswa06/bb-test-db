        "How much do you chronologically put into the book?",
        "How many days do you miss?",

        "And was this book the product of the Malcolm X Project?",
        "Yes, it was.",
        "The Malcolm X Project was a multi-dimensional, multiyear project that Manning ran through his offices at Columbia with the help of many, many able and dedicated graduate students and colleagues to assemble data, to assemble documents, video footage, just anywhere they could find something, oral histories, interviews.",
        "The number of people who worked on this project was almost too many to list in the acknowledgements.",
        "Well, let's bring another voice into the conversation, Georgetown University professor and public radio host Michael Eric Dyson, author of, among other books, \"\"Making Malcolm: The Myth and Meaning of Malcolm X.\"\" And he joins us here in Studio 3A.",
        "And always nice to have you on the program.",
        "Always good to be here, Neal, and I echo Wendy's words, that I would rather it have been Manning himself because he was so full of life, so zesty and so brilliant and so conversant with the issues and would have spoken about this.",
        "And let's be real: He would've loved the response this book is getting.",
        "And you know, seeing him on the front page of the New York Times beneath the fold last Saturday, Manning would have loved that, to engage a broader audience and to tell the truth about a complicated figure that he considered to be the greatest in the 20th century."

        "Well, he's clarified both, hasn't he, Manning has done.",
        "Unfortunately a posthumously issued biography but one that he poured his life into.",

        "And he gives us copious evidence for that.",
        "Malcolm exaggerated his extensive hustling itinerary to the degree that he wanted to prove the redemptive power of Elijah Muhammad over a black person's life.",
        "So Malcolm had to say more about what he did and invent a lot of stuff in the streets to prove just how great Elijah was.",
        "So he made himself out to be a much badder man, if you will excuse the expression, than in fact he was.",
        "Yeah, I guess rap doesn't have a corner on that.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Malcolm X was really an inspiration for rap in so many ways they didn't even understand.",
        "So yeah, he exaggerated that itinerary.",
        "He got wrong some things, deliberately perhaps, about his hustling, specifically with an elderly gentleman that in his autobiographical narrative was described as somebody else.",
        "It turns out Malcolm himself was more directly involved in some of that hustling himself, and in regard to sexual favors to a particularly older white gentleman.",
        "And the domestic life of Malcolm X was much more complicated than either the film portrayed or that Malcolm himself referred to.",
        "So Manning Marable has helped de-mythologize some of that.",
        "But also not only does he name the murderer or Malcolm X, and people have focused on that, but he also talked about the NYPD having advance knowledge of the plot to kill Malcolm.",
        "Not only did they not warn him about it, but they bungled the treatment of it and the handling of it after it occurred.",
        "So there's a lot of stuff there.",
        "But most of all, what we see about the meaning of Malcolm X is that in Manning Marable's eyes and now in ours, because of his book, Malcolm X was an extraordinarily complicated figure who was even greater than the mythology made him out to be.",
        "Wendy Wolf, let me ask you: We just heard Michael Eric Dyson refer to some of the information about Malcolm X's personal life.",
        "And there must have been some pause, some discussion.",
        "Do you include - what - how important is it that he had a homosexual affair as a young man?",
        "How important is it that he was unfaithful?",
        "How important are those things?"

        "But he was also coming back from a long trip to Africa, where he'd spent a lot of time with African leaders and learning what actual orthodox Islam was like and learning about its humanism and its international outreach.",
        "Well, that was not something that was particularly appealing to Alex Haley.",
        "So I'm afraid he rather discarded that side and left you with the impression that Malcolm was heading into basically Martin Luther King's embrace.",
        "I don't - we don't know whether that would have happened, but I have my doubts.",
        "And Michael Eric Dyson, one thing that Wendy Wolf just referred to, that trip to Africa, well, everybody who's read the autobiography or seen the movie knows about the hajj and the visit to Saudi Arabia.",
        "This other visit to Africa we didn't know about."
