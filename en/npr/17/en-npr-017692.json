        "He wanted to bring America before the United Nations on the charges of its impulse toward genocide and its racist practices in this nation, and he met seriously with the heads of states.",
        "He was received basically as a head of state, so much so, provoking so much ire that somebody wanted to try him on some obscure rule that forbade Americans to go - then obscure in its application to black people - that forbade Americans to go abroad and argue as if they were representing the American government.",
        "He was that powerful and that, I think, obviously dangerous.",

        "Not at all, and he was doing it before Martin Luther King, Jr. was in a strict sense, right, because Malcolm X stood against the war in Vietnam before Martin Luther King, Jr., who was inspired by his wife and Stokely Carmichael, subsequently Kwame Ture.",
        "But Malcolm X stood tooth-and-nail opposed to the war in Vietnam earlier than most black leaders publicly were able to say.",
        "Malcolm X understood the pan-Africanist impulse behind the freedom struggles of African-American people here.",
        "He wanted to connect them, like Paul Robeson did, like W.E.B.",
        "Du Bois wanted to, to a broader African consciousness.",
        "And he wanted to revive a sense of healthy African identity away from the more viciously narrow politics that he saw operating within the Nation of Islam, where untutored and often uncritical acolytes were willing to perpetuate a legacy of inequality, ironically enough in that particular cloistered religion as well.",

        "The name in some educators' ears rang a bell, but they really couldn't tell you much about him.",
        "Are we seeing the same thing with Malcolm that we saw with Martin Luther King, that as time marches on, the focus is strictly on the civil rights aspect of their lives, and it misses the -maybe the broader base, such as the mention of Vietnam, where I think Malcolm, from what research I've done not only saw this as a racist homeland for himself and his murdered father but as an imperialistic nation, a nation that made money off of exploiting weaker nations.",
        "And those things are never mentioned.",
        "You know, Martin Luther King was killed going to a union rally just a couple days ago, the anniversary, and somehow those things are never, never talked about.",

        "Because to me a homosexual act is inconsequential in his life.",

        "All right, thanks very much, Steven.",
        "I wonder, Wendy Wolf: Do you see, and did Manning Marable see, Alex Haley's book as, in a sense, the start of that process that we just heard about?",
        "Well, I think it was the start of the branding of Malcolm, I would say.",
        "I was just reading a review of the book from England.",

        "I can't remember.",

        "I'd be interested to know what Michael has to say on that.",
        "Yeah, that's exactly right.",
        "When you think about that 1964 address, \"\"The Ballot or the Bullet,\"\" of course, and you think about that great address delivered in Detroit, Michigan, and Malcolm, of course, is in transition from one space to another, there's no question that he was capable, as the caller made quite emphatically, the point, that Malcolm was not only an internationalist but he understood the imperialistic dimensions of America's tentacles stretching out in the world.",
        "And he also saw the global, if you will, solidarity that could be generated not only among African and African-American people but among people who were oppressed.",

        "He had wide vision about people.",

        "He didn't think that it was about African-American people being nonviolent.",

        "And I think that's where Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X certainly diverged, and I think Malcolm X never gave up that particular instance of a specifically rooted African-American response to social injustice.",
        "Social - obviously he saw social injustice in the context of his experience in this country, growing up in this country and the education that he'd given himself, largely, in this country.",
        "Did he, as he became more internationally aware, address issues that he encountered abroad?",

        "Well, yeah, he certainly didn't address the oppression of women in the Arab world.",

        "But he did begin to open up.",
        "Malcolm was known initially to have said that the closest thing to a devil is a woman.",
        "But - and then in conversation with others, he began to grow and mature.",
        "And I think this is what Manning Marable meant, that had Malcolm lived, he certainly would have embraced a much more progressive understanding of the role of gender.",
        "He did address some of the issues you're speaking about internationally.",
        "He embraced certain traditional socialist views, even as he moved beyond the narrow cubbyholes into which he had been consigned.",
        "But I think had he lived, he would have embraced a much more powerful democratic instance of those progressive views and would have been much more self-critical.",
        "The other interesting thing about Malcolm is that Malcolm walks out of school at age 15 and never goes back.",
        "So that's the end of his formal training.",
        "And yet by the end of his life, he's read Gramsci.",
        "He's read Trotsky.",
