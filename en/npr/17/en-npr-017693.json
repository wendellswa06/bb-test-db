        "But he noticed that as they were speaking, Malcolm would doodle on the napkins that he had by his side, and Alex learned to collect those napkins after the interview was over and found on the doodle a lot of things written down that Malcolm X had never spoken during the interview process.",
        "I wanted to say one other thing too, that it's almost a cliche that we hear, but I think - I never have heard the statement spoken before the phrase, spoken before - by any means necessary.",
        "And I think Malcolm X was the first person to ever put that phrase in exactly those words.",
        "Jim, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Yeah, that's a great point.",
        "He is associated with that phrase, as much as Obama is associated with yes, I can, except that that was borrowed from Dolores Huerta and many other people, whereas Malcolm's originality, contrary to the president's, may stand the test of time.",
        "But the important point about the doodles, isn't it an inevitable and unavoidable metaphor that what Manning Marable has done in this book is to gather those doodles, is to gather, to scour the sources across the world, looking for every iota of evidence, every empirical, fact-based assertion about Malcolm X, to really reconstruct them into a powerful narrative that is so elegant?",
        "And that's what he's done in this text as well.",
        "The way I've been thinking about the autobiography, because I've been thinking about it a lot in the last few days, is - and people have said to me, well, do you think we should stop reading the autobiography?",
        "Under no circumstances.",
        "It's a remarkable text, and it is - should be required reading for everyone in America.",
        "But it is a text, and now we have a context in which to read it.",
        "We can see what got left out.",
        "We can read it with open eyes and not as some sacred text from which we should pattern our lives, but as a document of its time and in its place.",
        "Well, I would argue even in the sacred text, you understand the context.",
        "A lot of things were left out, a lot of things were included.",
        "It don't mean you don't believe in Jesus no more.",
        "It just means that you understand that some guy who was a sexist was trying to make Jesus talk like one.",

        "This is - The central irony of Malcolm's career was that his critical powers of observation, so important in fashioning his dynamic public addresses, virtually disappeared in his mundane evaluations of those in his day-to-day personal circle.",
        "Especially in the final years of his life, nearly every individual he trusted would betray that trust.",
        "As late as November 1963, Malcolm did not recognize that the political path he had deliberately chosen would quickly lead to his expulsion from the Nation of Islam.",
        "This was apparent even to Ferguson - the person he's talking about it in the book, in 1963 - I felt eventually he would have to leave the Nation of Islam.",
        "He was just too political.",
        "He was developing too fast.",
        "And, Wendy Wolf, that sense of growing up within an organization, the Nation of Islam, and then finding out that everyone he believed in in that organization was something else.",

        "I mean, he had an intimate relationship with Elijah.",
        "He was a father figure for Malcolm.",
        "He even provided him with a kind of a model.",
        "And then Malcolm discovers that Elijah Muhammad is no icon himself.",
        "He's no model of purity.",
        "He is a kind of sexual predator, though that word wouldn't be used in those days.",
        "He had impregnated his secretaries, including a young woman that Malcolm had been in love with for many years.",
        "And Malcolm struggled with that.",
        "He struggled with trying to disassociate himself from the precepts of the nation that he was coming to see as being limited, but also how to leave Elijah Muhammad and how to make that break.",
        "He was also a son who was growing up to potentially be greater than the father, and that was dangerous to Elijah Muhammad.",
        "And then we get into, Michael Eric Dyson, the controversies - and there will always be controversies - surrounding the assassination of Martin - of Malcolm X.",
        "No doubt about it.",
        "And I think the fact is that Manning's courage in fingering the person who did not serve time in jail is remarkable.",
        "And equally remarkable is his courage to go against the grain and say, look, you know, police forces understood, knew, what was going on, did nothing about it.",
        "And when people express outrage and surprise, I say, look, the FBI knew of credible threats to Martin Luther King Jr.'s life and never spoke to him, never told him, never warned him.",
        "If they didn't do that about Martin Luther King Jr., who was perceived - at least in death, and even then as much more wiling to pacify the broader culture and be much more willing to be non-violent than Malcolm X, what would they do in regard to Malcolm X?"

        "And reading her point of view of meeting him earlier in his life and following him through and then, you know, working with him more later on, it just showed that there was a whole lot more to the story, and that his views changed throughout his life.",
