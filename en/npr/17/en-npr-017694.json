        "Hello.",
        "Good afternoon.",
        "First of all, I want to say that I'm really glad you all are having this discussion.",
        "Malcolm X is one of my personal heroes.",
        "I have the Spike Lee movie.",
        "I've read the autobiography, and I've read another book also about him.",
        "And one of the things that I've noticed is a lot of people will focus - he was very intelligent, very eloquent speaker.",
        "But something I'd like to know, is there anything out there that talks about his personal life, him as a husband and him as a father?",
        "Because that's a side of Malcolm that we just - we really don't hear a lot about.",
        "Wendy Wolf?",
        "Yes.",
        "There's a - there is a certain amount about that in the book.",
        "He was not a perfect father, and he was not a perfect husband.",
        "He - they did not have a Hollywood romance.",
        "It's nice to think of Denzel Washington and Angela Basset and the cozy images of Spike Lee's movie, but I'm afraid that the reality was a little more realistic.",
        "Malcolm spent a lot of time away from home that he was under a lot of pressure.",
        "It was - the Nation of Islam was not a place that was friendly to women.",
        "There were many children.",
        "There were constant money troubles.",
        "Their house was firebombed.",
        "There were death threats.",
        "This was a difficult, difficult life, and neither of them, as Manning portrays it, had perfect records.",
        "But I think they're - I think the relationship that he portrays is a believable and an understandable one.",
        "In 1966, I was a senior in high school, and in order to graduate, we had to give a senior speech.",
        "My senior speech was on the \"\"Black Muslims in America.\"\" Prior to reading that book, I thought there was some way, me, as a white girl, was going to save all the black people.",
        "After reading that book I realized, no, he can do it.",
        "He's got a really good sense of how - whether or not you believe in Muslim-ness, but become a community.",
        "And I'm wondering how that book, if it did in any way, influence - which I have not read the biography.",
        "But just out of reading that book, I had tremendous respect for this man's intelligence and wisdom, like take care of your own, be kind, be smart, be financially - well, apparently, he wasn't - but be financially responsible.",
        "And I'm just curious how that - how your guests see the \"\"Black Muslims in America\"\" book influencing the biography.",
        "I'd like to answer that if I could.",
        "Go ahead, please.",
        "We've talked a lot about Manning Marable as a scholar, but Manning Marable also devoted his life to social justice.",
        "He was a social activist, and that's what drew him to Malcolm X in the first place.",
        "And I think if the only legacy of this book is that it changes the image we have of Malcolm, then it will be incomplete.",
        "I think what Manning would want, most of all, is for people in America today, who still have troubles, where race is still on the table, where violence is an issue, where religion is an issue, to try to understand, through the example of Malcolm, how people can learn and grow and grow towards a kind of humanism.",
        "Manning was one of the most profound advocates of international humanism there was, and I think that that subtext suffuses this project."

        "And in directly response to the woman's question, I think that it's extremely important to see that yeah, it doesn't really betray the sense of panic around Malcolm X when he was as conservative a figure - in the best sense of that word - in terms of morality, in terms of self respect, in terms of responsibility, in terms of all the big themes that the virtuecrats now put out and the Republicans speak of and the Tea Party vaunts and claims to be real to them.",
        "Malcolm X was embodying that.",
        "So why didn't they see a fellow traveler, a person who said, look, it's about our internal self-recognition and our desire to clean up our own communities?",
        "So there was an extremely conservative - one that I would argue with, but certainly an extreme conservatism there that the broader culture should respect in regard to all the things it says it wants to hear from black people.",
        "Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X were certainly arguing those points.",
        "Well, just to extend Mikey's question, though, is it fair to say that that sense of self-sufficiency - no, we don't look to the white man to solve our problems, we can solve our own problems - that that sense comes from Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam?",
        "Oh, there's no question.",
        "And it came before them, as well.",
        "Marcus Garvey talked about it.",
        "Booker T.",
        "Washington spoke about it, Frederick Douglass - any black leader worth his or her salt certainly speaks about the necessity for policing our personal moral boundaries and talking about our own communities and self-help, because without self-help, we'd often have no help at all - Martin Luther King, Jr., the same way.",
        "The difference, of course, is that some leaders have also said that we must talk about the impediments and obstacles in the broader culture that prevent the flourishing of self-help.",
        "Because if you're existing in a culture where you can't even buy a store, where you can't even own anything, where you can't even participate equitably in the broader circle of American democracy, there's no sense about self-help because you've been shutdown from the very beginning.",
        "But once that's solved, there's no question that that's where a lot of black leaders converge, and a lot of people don't acknowledge that.",
        "Mikey, thanks very much for the call.",
        "I'm going to - it may be dangerous asking sort of an open-ended question in this email from Sage(ph) in Portland, Oregon: What do your guests think made Malcolm X tick?",
        "What was the source of his motivation more than anything else?",
        "Michael Eric Dyson, you first.",
        "He was unalterably and, I think, unswervingly devoted to black people.",
        "He loved blackness with a complete devotion and fidelity that are remarkable for their capacity to scare the rest of us.",
        "And I think in the embrace of that love for black people first, and then for vulnerable humanity, he embraced the project of trying to reconstruct America and then world around an image of fairness and justice.",
        "I think that's what motivated him - his rage, his desperate language to oppose American and then global imperialism, and his desire to hook up with others who believed the same that he did.",
        "Wendy Wolf.",
        "I will agree with that.",
        "And I would add to it that he had a curiosity about the world.",
        "He had a - kind of a voracious appetite to engage the world.",
        "And that's what led him to break out of the confines of separatism, and that's what led him to travel the world and to try to bring it into the experience of black America in the early '60s."
