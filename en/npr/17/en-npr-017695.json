        "There were fewer questions raised about, again, what I think was the main point of Peter Orszag's op-ed piece, which is that all the tax cuts ought to lapse in a couple of years.",
        "If not sooner is what Peter Orszag said.",
        "I mean, there's political reality, and then there's the economic.",

        "He did that when he spoke yesterday in Ohio.",
        "What's he talking about there?",
        "Well, actually, the administration has been pushing a package of benefits for small businesses, some of which are tax cuts, ever since the president gave his State of the Union Address, you know, last winter.",
        "And it's cleared the House, but it has yet to get through the Senate.",
        "He has continued to hit on that and say look, if you want to help small businesses, let's pass this very targeted, directed package of benefits for small businesses.",
        "Let's not use that as the excuse for extending the tax cuts, the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.",
        "Republicans and other proponents of extending those sometimes say that that's a way to help small businesses.",
        "The other thing that he did in Ohio yesterday was talk about making permanent the R&D tax credit, which is not just for small businesses.",
        "In fact, most of the beneficiaries of that are big businesses.",
        "He talked about expanding that tax credit, making it easier to apply for and making it permanent.",
        "If those instructions come through, then, so everyone's going to be evacuating, and there will be just traffic jams everywhere.",

        "No, there's no way that they could defend that kind of target against us.",
        "So if we issued such a warning, no choice but to take it down and put it away, and that's really what they should do.",

        "Isn't this some - it sounds as though this is something you think we should do in the next week.",
        "I certainly recommend, and we recommended, that President Bush make it clear to North Korea that that is our intention, that our wish is that they cut it out, return to the negotiating table and let's see if we can work this whole matter out.",
        "But if in the coming weeks - we don't know exactly how long it would take them to prepare this missile for launch - they take it all the way and get it all ready and start counting down, why, we're just not going to let it fly.",
        "We can't allow them to perfect the technology to attack us.",
