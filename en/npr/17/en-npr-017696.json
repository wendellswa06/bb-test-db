        "So there are different levers of tax policy, exactly right.",
        "So there are the rates you pay, and so you might cut those.",
        "For example, if any of the expiring tax rate cuts get extended, that would be basically a tax cut of the rates that people pay on the income that gets taxed.",
        "A tax credit would be something that gives you money back in return for doing something.",
        "The classic example would be we have a child tax credit, which gives folks money through the tax system if they have children.",

        "Like, the spirit of the reason for the charitable deduction is to encourage charitable giving.",
        "If you're worried about a weak economy, the things you want to focus money on are putting money in the pockets of people who are going to spend it, that can provide some short-term support for the economy; and anything you can do to change incentives so that people will, say, bring investment forward or undertake more economic activity when we need it.",

        "How do know - do they work?",
