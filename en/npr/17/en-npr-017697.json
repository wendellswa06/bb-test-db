        "So it varies how they're structured.",
        "But, you know, a typical result for kind of normal consumers is if you give them a tax cut of, you know, $100, they're probably going to spend somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 or $40 of it.",

        "He talked about giving a tax cut to 95 percent of all Americans.",
        "And he got some advice from behavioral economists, who said the best way to get people to spend that money is don't put it in a check that they get in their mailbox but just do it through reduced withholding, and so a little bit of extra money shows up in their paycheck every week or two.",
        "That may have paid off economically in terms of getting people to spend it, but one of the downsides for the administration was almost - maybe 95 percent of the people got a tax cut, hardly anyone knew they got a tax cut."

        "Thank you.",
        "So Donald Marron, this is the argument we're hearing, that why, why give the top earners a tax break.",
        "They're going to put the nuts away in the tree, as Marcus put it.",
        "Right, so there's good evidence that folks who have higher levels of income, if you gave them a tax cut, will spend relatively less of it than folks of lower and moderate income, which is why there's more one of the reasons why, among economists, there's more support for tax cuts that go to lower and moderate incomes.",
        "But to be clear, right, the effect isn't zero.",
        "Right, if you gave a tax cut to someone earning $300,000 a year, they're going to find more money in their paycheck, and they're going to get around to finding some way to spend that as well.",
        "So the effect on the economy isn't zero, and I think that's why you saw in Peter Orszag's recent op-ed where he said, you know, well, if the politics are such that you have to extend for everybody, it'll make sense to include the top people for a couple of years and that at the margin that will have come additional economic benefit.",
        "Scott Horsley, what are you hearing about that how that top earner bracket might contribute to the economy if they got the tax cut extended?",
        "Well, I think there is, as Donald Marron says, a consensus that they would contribute proportionately less to the economy than everybody else, but even among the quote-unquote \"\"middle class\"\" - that is, people making less than a quarter-million dollars a year, the impact is not all that great.",
        "You know, the Congressional Budget Office looked at a lot of different ways that the government could stimulate the economy.",
        "They said extending the Bush-era tax cuts was dead last in terms of its impact on the economy.",
        "If you really wanted to get more bang for the buck, you'd be better off either providing a payroll tax holiday for employers or extending unemployment benefits further than the government already has, or doing direct government spending on roads and bridges and that sort of thing.",
        "So yeah, again, the effect is greater for lower-income people than for high-income people, but the Bush-era tax cuts in general were considered by the CBO, the nonpartisan CBO, to be a pretty inefficient way to stimulate the economy, which in some sense makes it makes sense because, remember, former President Bush proposed these tax cuts as candidate Bush back in 1999, at a time when the government was running a stimulus."
