        "And as you - basically, what happens is the higher the tax rate, the more distortions you get in the economy, the more you discourage people from working and investing, and the more you encourage them to hire good accountants and good lawyers to hide their money, right?",

        "When tax rates are 90 percent, you get a lot of perverse behavior.",
        "And there's a lot of sense to ratchet those back.",
        "And 90 percent, frankly, was probably on the wrong side of the famous Laffer curve.",
        "That was up in a region where you could lower tax rates and probably get more revenue just because you would stop distorting so much economic activity.",
        "But just because that was true at 90 percent, doesn't mean that's true when you get down to 35 or 40 percent, which is where the debate is happening today.",
        "You know, today, in the world - today, we're in a world where if we cut taxes that would clearly reduce the amount of revenue the federal government has.",
        "If we allow them to go up, we'd raise more.",
        "And I think actually the right debate, now, to have, is not so much about the rates, whereas all else equal, it would be good to keep the rates low.",
        "But all the various preferences and incentives and special provisions that our tax code is now laden with, it makes it so complicated.",

        "Yeah, the tax rate is only one piece of the puzzle and doesn't tell you the whole story.",
