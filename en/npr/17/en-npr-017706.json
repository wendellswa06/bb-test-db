        "As I mentioned in the introduction, you spent many years working on a warning system for this country.",
        "Why don't we have one yet?",
        "And what would it take to get one?",
        "We have a prototype system.",
        "The reason it's not yet public is, quite bluntly, the funding hasn't been in place.",
        "And if one wants to be cynical, it's because we have not yet killed at least 2,000 people in an earthquake, which is what led to the development of these systems in other - every other country that has an operating one.",
        "But more directly, we have a prototype.",
        "To turn it into a robust public system, we need several things.",
        "There's a lot of maintenance and telemetry expense and software and support that needs to be in place, and the current budget uncertainties from Washington are affecting our ability to move forward on this.",
        "Aside from the warning system, how do you feel about preparedness?",
        "I mean, we're both in California, right?",
        "A big one's going to come.",
        "Everybody knows it's going to happen at some point.",
        "How prepared are we?",
        "I think we're not nearly as prepared as we could be, but we are much better than we used to be.",
        "There's a lot of energy and excitement.",
        "City of Los Angeles has undertaken major improvements, passed five ordinances in city council unanimously, including mandatory retrofit of the dangerous buildings.",
        "And it's starting to spread to other Southern California cities as well.",
        "And there are several dozen other cities that are reaching out to get help in moving forward with ordinances themselves.",
        "These things happen, we're going to be a lot better off in our next earthquake.",
        "Should an early warning system be part of that?",
        "An early warning system absolutely should be part of it.",
        "For whatever physically it does, it's also a huge psychological benefit that helps people cope with the earthquakes and keeps them in afterwards, which is going to be important for recovery.",

        "Kevin Gover, former assistant secretary for Indian Affairs says that should be no surprise.",
        "The tribes have always had that kind of representation.",
        "What's happened now, though, is they have new political influence they've never had before, and let's face it, it's because they now have some money that they never had before.",
        "And the question is are tribes going to behave the way other special interests do?",
        "Indian tribes, gambling and lobbyists plus skating and sledding controversies as teams line up for the Winter Olympic Games.",

        "For government powerbrokers inside the Beltway, the investigation of lobbyist Jack Abramoff is all about the politicians who may or may not be ensnared in the web of money, lies and bribery.",
        "Across the country, though, Native Americans wonder how this scandal will affect them.",
        "Indian tribes hired Abramoff to lobby on their behalf, and he proceeded to loot a great deal of their money.",
        "In the most egregious case, the case flush Coushatta tribe of Louisiana paid Abramoff more than $30 million to protect their casino revenues from competition across the border in Texas.",
        "At the same time, Abramoff took millions from the Tigua Indian tribe to do just the opposite.",
        "Some wonder how and why the tribes got involved with high-powered influence peddlers in the first place.",
        "Others worry how they could have been taken so easily, and many Native Americans are concerned that stories about corruption and gambling will reflect badly on them all.",
        "Indian casinos bring in nearly $19 billion a year, yet many Native Americans still live in abject poverty with an average per capita income of less than $8,000 per year.",
        "Later in the program NPR's Tom Goldman will join us with a preview of the Winter Olympic Games, but first lobbyists, gambling and Native Americans.",
        "If you have questions about how this scandal affects Native Americans or about the Indian casino business, give us a call.",
        "We'd especially welcome Native Americans with firsthand observations on the affect of casinos.",
        "Our number here in Washington is 800-989-8255.",

        "And I talked to one voter who was protesting the Obama administration's handling of foreclosures.",
        "And the reason why I want to point him out - his name is Pat Driscoll, he's a steelworker from Detroit - is because he actually voted for President Obama in 2008.",

        "I would have hoped that he would have tried to fulfill more of his promises and not hid behind the fact that there was a Republican majority, because people would have supported him had he fought.",

        "But, you know, it is a different election than 2008.",
        "What you hear from delegates, what you hear from Democratic voters, like Matt Hoyle, is exactly what the White House has been saying, which is that they think the president has done a lot.",
        "But that where he's failed is that he hasn't communicated what he has accomplished.",
        "And then that the Republican Party has had the chance to define health care or the stimulus.",

        "Draghi said the crisis has exposed the inadequacy of the financial and economic framework set up for the single currency in 1999.",
        "The European Central Bank, Draghi said, cannot fill the vacuum resulting from the lack of action by national governments.",
        "He urged leaders to come up with a vision of what the euro is going to look like some years from now.",
