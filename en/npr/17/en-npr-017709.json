        "Well, first of all, when it's (unintelligible) pressure, obviously it's compressed, and so it's a little bit more dense.",
        "So it floats relatively slowly at first.",
        "And then as it rises in the water column, it expands and actually begins to rise to the surface more quickly.",
        "But even though we're about 1,000-foot journey, it does have a lot of time to start weathering and breaking down.",
        "That mostly occurs when it reaches the surface.",
        "What do you think it looks like deep inside the ocean where the leak has spread?",
        "Well, what I suspect is happening is that a relatively small fraction of the oil is actually reaching the surface mainly because of the decision, which I think is a misguided one to use dispersants at the wellhead.",
        "You know, I understand that most of the focus has been on the coast, but the fact that the dispersants are being used at the wellhead means that the oil is breaking up; to some degree, it's emulsifying as it rises.",
        "And it's settling out at different layers in the sea.",
        "And some of the heavier fractions are probably staying on the seafloor.",
        "So, certainly, there's potential for it to impact not just the coast, but communities and fishes and invertebrates on the continental shelf.",
        "Could it literally strangle sea life below?",
        "I mean, (unintelligible) of...",
        "Yeah, I mean, particularly some of the things like soft corals and sponges that are actually - you know, sponges are filter feeders and corals have very small polyps, and the polyps can easily get smothered by the oil and die."

        "And so, it essentially doesn't look dissimilar from a normal coral reef, except that the features themselves are geologic rather than are built by the animals.",

        "So, it could take years, but maybe not as many years as the Exxon Valdez because things happen much more slowly in colder climates.",
        "I suppose what's most disturbing about all of this is that the best scientists in the world, including you, simply don't know, they just don't know what will happen."

        "Well, I think it's a mix.",
        "There are people who probably take them fairly seriously, but there's a lot of snickering.",
