        "He thinks record companies should do away with it because nowadays if you own an iPod and you download music from iTunes, that music will only play back on your iPod or a few of your personal computers.",

        "He is saying it doesn't stop music piracy, and you know, despite what the music industry is saying about CDs, he has a point.",
        "There is one company that actually did a little test, and they gave people a file that was locked and, you know, a file that was unlocked, and they sort of checked what people would do with them.",
        "And essentially they discovered that even if a file was locked, people would figure out - all it took was one person, right, to figure out how to break the encryption, the DRM, and it was all over the Internet.",

        "How has the music industry responded to this?",
        "They've said, No way, Jose.",
