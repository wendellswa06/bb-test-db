        "It's a shock then to listen to a new collection of previously unreleased recordings from the end of the 19th century.",
        "It's called the \"\"Actionable Offenses: Indecent Phonograph Recordings from the 1890s.\"\" And it is as lewd and often obscene as anything Howard Stern has to offer.",
        "As the name implies, there's a lot on this collection that we can't play on the radio even today.",

        "We must, by the way, warn listeners that this interview may contain audio that some people would find offensive so you may want to turn on your vacuum cleaner if you get - I'm going to turn mine on.",
        "Well, anyway, these recordings really were indecent and they're from a century ago.",
        "Patrick Feaster, scholars like you knew that they existed?",
        "We knew that they'd been made.",
        "Certainly, there were accounts of them that had passed down to us in newspapers from the time.",
        "But knowing that they survived and hearing actual examples of them, that's pretty new."

        "And David Giovannoni, how were these recordings uncovered?",
        "Well, they were never really lost.",
        "They had been in the archives of the Edison National Historic Site for many years.",
        "They were recently transferred by Jerry Fabris, a curator at the Edison National Historic Site.",
        "And we were able to acquire those transfers and the rights to produce this CD.",
        "They were originally on wax cylinders.",
        "They were digitized, then put on CD.",
        "Right.",
        "I understand that they hadn't been played on the wax cylinders.",
        "The originals hadn't been played for a long time because of fear of destroying them.",
        "Wax cylinders are a very, very fragile medium.",
        "They essentially self-destruct because of chemical properties of the cylinders themselves.",
        "But moreover, when they are played on period equipment with relatively heavy pick-ups - if you will - audio pick-ups, they can be very easily damaged.",
        "So much to the site's credit, they did not play these for years and years and years until the technology was developed to do so with absolute minimum wear or damage being done to the artifacts themselves.",
        "Patrick Feaster, the distribution of these recordings was indeed an actionable offense.",
        "It was illegal under the Comstock law.",

        "Thank goodness for that.",
        "David Giovannoni was co-producer and Patrick Feaster was a writer on \"\"Actionable Offenses: Indecent Phonograph Recordings from the 1890s.\"\" It's from the Archeophone Records label.",

        "Well, one of the things is, if you take tribes like the Coushatta or the Saginaw, I think they were just looking for access to Washington, politicians, and if you look at that, that's a situation where tribes around the country have typically been cut out of that loop.",
        "They haven't been sitting at that table, and I think once you take these tribes that have started to make money, they started using that money to pay for access, and it's something that they never really had the opportunity to do before."

        "Because they didn't have the money and the business until really the Indian casino business started taking off, what, 20 years ago.",
        "Correct.",
        "In seemingly every school history lesson and public dialogue, Indians are portrayed as victims.",
        "Doing Indians accept that they're being portrayed as victims again in this scandal?",
        "You know, I think there's a lot of tribes that don't necessarily see themselves as victims, and again, you're only talking about a handful of tribes that are involved in this lobbying scandal.",
        "You have 560 federally recognized tribes in the country.",
        "The lot of the reaction that I'm hearing from people outside of the scandal, a lot of native people, is that this is just a situation where the scandal should not reflect on them, and they don't feel that there should be criticism for the access that other tribes have had to Washington lobbyists.",
        "But it's not something that reflects the reality for the majority of tribes around the country because half of the tribes in the United States are not operating casinos, and they are not flush with the type of gaming revenue that's making the news these days.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Many Americans, and I think particularly on the east and west coast, seem to think that Native Americans are swimming in casino profits.",
        "What's reality like out there in Montana?",
        "You know, the reality in Montana is what's happening with this whole casino story, and it's been brewing every since the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act pushed tribes into greater prominence, but what the majority of Americans are seeing are tribes such as the Mohicans or the Mashantucket Pequots in Connecticut, where those two tribes alone are bringing in roughly two billion dollars in gaming revenue.",
        "And you look at the California tribes, which are very, very small membership or number-based rancherias basically, but together, collectively, they're bringing in $4.2 billion.",
        "But here in all that space in-between, in states like Montana and North Dakota, South Dakota, you're getting really a different picture.",
        "In Montana alone, tribes, there's seven large-based reservations in this state, and total they've made $16.3 million in the last year, so there's a huge discrepancy in what's happening out there on the gaming front.",
        "In terms of Native Americans, do they regard gambling industry as a net positive for them?",
        "You know, in a lot of these situations, the casinos in Montana are so small that they're not making a tremendous impact.",
        "But, you know, on the other hand, you are creating jobs that weren't there before.",
        "Typically, what you have, you know, you mentioned the, well, let's just talk about the unemployment rate for tribal citizens in Montana.",
        "It's 66 percent.",
        "So anything you can do to bring a few jobs in the community are, you know, very much sought after, and gaming does fulfill that role.",
        "Let's get some callers involved in the conversation.",

        "But my main question really was I thought that maybe in some of the states on the east and west coast, in the smaller tribes, do they actually own their casinos outright?",
        "Because it was my understanding that there was a particular holding company of investors that originally started at the casino that probably made more of the profit and just gave the Indian tribes a cut, per se.",

        "First, bear in mind that there are only about 25, unless I'm mistaken, individuals involved in regulation and monitoring of tribal gambling operations with a budget of $14 million when there are 228 tribes that operate something like 400 casinos in more than 30 states.",
        "The state of New Jersey, by contrast, has a regulatory budget of $70 million and 650 employees for gambling in the city of Atlantic City, New Jersey.",
        "So first, the federal government has a miniscule and utterly incapable regulatory force.",
        "Second more broadly once gambling revenue is passed off the tables of tribal casinos, essentially in most cases they disappear.",

        "The very invisibility of the disposition of gaming revenues on tribal ground has created an enormous trough for the, for lobbyists for lawyers, for all those who feed on gambling revenue generally.",
        "But how tribes choose to spend that money is unregulated.",
        "So, for example, if a tribe wanted to set up a casino in the first place or find some land where that might be possible.",
        "If they have sovereignty, why do they need to get cooperation of the federal government or a federal authority?",
