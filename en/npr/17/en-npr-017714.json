        "And a way of creating some kind of income stream on reservations, at a time when the party in power hoped to reduce federal expenditures.",
        "And this was done using tribal sovereignty to try to get around that state's laws against gambling?",
        "Well, the concept of tribal sovereignty is kind of a protein one that has been frankly invented in recent times and has been expendable or expansible since the 1980s.",
