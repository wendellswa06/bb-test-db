        "You know I do.",
        "But before we go there, there was one pretty serious misstatement that I think has to be cleared up.",
        "Mr. Bordewich indicated that sovereignty was a concept that was dreamed up somehow in the 1980s to justify this and that, including the Indian gaming regulatory act.",
        "I think he said and that's expanded but...",
        "Well it's simply not true.",
        "I mean, Indian sovereignty in the first instance when, when the United States was created, they were mentioned in the constitution on the same level as foreign nations and states.",
        "And so it's not something that was, that was new to American law.",
        "In fact what has been happening, and particularly in the past 25 years is that the sovereignty that the tribes had long enjoyed was being diminished by the Supreme Court in particular, but also by Congress and the federal executive agencies.",
        "Now, should Indian gaming be more closely regulated?",
        "Well, a couple of things.",
        "First of all, don't forget that the states play a large role in the regulation of Indian gaming, pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.",
        "Second the tribes themselves do have very aggressive regulatory programs.",
        "And I've watched some of them in action.",
        "You know their not all as good as they should be.",
        "But I think virtually all of them are much better than Mr. Bordewich gives them credit for.",
        "So I just think it's unfair to say that it's unregulated.",
        "Having said that, I agree with Mr. Bordewich in two respects: First of all, I think the federal government should be more involved.",
        "Not because I favor federal involvement in much of anything frankly.",
        "But because I think it would be good for the Indian gaming industry to have that additional layer of oversight and credibility.",
        "Second, I do think the tribes should be more transparent with their finances.",
        "Because otherwise all these myths arise about every Indian driving a Cadillac, every Indian being rich.",
        "And it simply isn't so.",
        "Indians remain at the bottom of the social economic heap in the United States.",
        "In general, do you think that the income from casinos is being spent wisely?",
        "I do, obviously, not in the case of hiring a lobbyist for $80 million over the course of a couple of years."

        "Well there is that.",
        "But, in general, the changes that you see taking place on the reservations and the changes for the good are in many instances driven by Indian gaming profits.",
        "So, you know, when I see Indian, think of Indian gaming profits, I think of clinics and wellness centers and additions to schools and after school programs, senior citizen centers.",
        "I see a lot of different things than probably many Americans who have been exposed as Jodi Rave, was saying, to the Massouinian Pequods (ph), or the Mohicans or the small California tribes.",
        "Back out here in the middle of the country, where so many Indians are, the picture is much, much different.",
        "And you can really see the changes that Indian gaming is causing on these reservations.",

        "Into the 1900s you know seen as poor and uneducated and drunken people.",
        "And in the year 2000 we're trying to raise above that and develop economies that were strong and gaming was one piece of that.",
        "And unfortunately, you know, some tribes have used their money in a way that maybe not be viewed as wise for the long term of their people, but I hate to see a new stereotype of corruption as affiliated with Indian people because it is a negative stereotype that's unfair and it's unfortunate that that may be the outcome of this scandal.",
        "Kevin Gover, transparency is usually seen as the best antidote to any whiff of corruption.",
        "I agree with that.",
        "And I -- you know what's interesting to me, first of all the Abramoff scandal really broke because Indians on the reservations whose tribes had hired Abramoff began complaining about the amount of money he was being paid.",
        "And so there is at least that going on and I think the tribes should be pleased with themselves that the scandal was brought to light internally before it hit the major newspapers.",
        "So that's a good sign.",
        "But the reality is that too many tribes are far too secretive about their finances.",
        "And we can understand why.",
        "Any secrets, over time so many secrets that the tribes have given up are in the end used against them.",
        "And I understand the reluctance to share information but in an era when the tribes are self determining, when they are self governing it's extremely important to be accountable to their members at least.",
        "And to reveal that sort of financial information.",
        "Jodi Rave, let me ask you one other question and that has to do with, well, working at cross purposes.",
        "These tribes have certainly in the Abramoff case, the one case we know about, where exactly hiring the same person to work against each other, but there's also these allegations of people poaching on other people's land, that sort of thing.",
        "There's no one unified position.",
        "No one unified position as far as Indian country and their position in...?",
