        "And where it's been spent.",
        "And I think that tribes are doing a great disservice, not only to the general public with the lack of transparency, but they're creating internal strife within their own community and they really owe it to themselves to be more accountable.",
        "I think one of the best ways they can do that is to create greater access to their tribal newspapers and perhaps give some sort of, you know, monthly report or give reporters greater access to how they're spending the money.",
