        "Absolutely.",
        "If your house, if you paid 100,000 for your house, You were able to sell it even in foreclosure at 250, there was $150,000 worth of capital gains tax that you had to pay.",
        "Of course, it depended on how long you were in the home.",

        "But if this was something recent, you wouldn't be.",
        "So you would, indeed, have to pay that.",
        "This is a good thing, Farai, but it's not something that's going to affect lots of people.",
        "And so while we celebrate the fact that there is some flexibility in the tax code for homeowners who are disgruntled and who had had a hard time and were being foreclosed on, when we count up the numbers, I would argue that what I'd rather see, especially for people at the bottom, would simply be a rate change, a downward rate change, perhaps more tax credits.",
        "For folk who have children in school - of course, I'm speaking to my constituency - perhaps some tuition credit like the ones that Obama talked about when he was recently in Wisconsin.",
        "So while I think tax payers appreciate every little bit, and there are lots of little things here.",
        "Some forms that weren't made available actually until last week, Wednesday or Thursday, I think the 10th, for people who had education credits to claim and energy tax credits and the child care credits.",
        "So we do see the policy makers certainly and the White House thinking ahead - I would argue, too little for two few at the bottom.",
        "All right, there's also another move that has to do with the Federal Housing Administration.",
        "In states like California and New York, municipal areas in a lot of states, the average price of buying a home makes it hard for people to use Federal Mortgage Programs or Housing Insurance.",
        "Now just through the end of 2008, the Federal Housing Administration will allow borrowers to get up to $729,000 in mortgage money.",
        "That's hundreds of thousands of dollars more than they would have gotten in the past.",
        "So how are these new changes going to work?",
        "Who's it going to help?",
        "Again, who has a $729,000 home?",
        "Well, I think it's fair to say that people in New York City, parts of California, Los Angeles, the Bay area, Chicago, other major markets, should not be subject to the minimums of before, which were around $250,000, you know, what you could buy in New York City for example, for $250,000.",
        "Let's not speculate.",
        "But $729,000 is a pretty high bar.",
        "So, again, I think that this is playing to the middle and not to the bottom.",
        "Certainly, the middle class needs some relief.",
        "This is a good program, but it is not sufficient to bring relief to the folk at the bottom.",
        "To the extent that these tax code modifications are seen as providing some relief in the face of the impending recession and in the weakness of the housing market, again, I say that there are some challenges.",
        "The other challenge, Farai, is to note that probably 30 percent of all white families and half of all African—American families are not owners.",
        "They're renters.",
        "These are people who pay high prices, often subsidizing a mortgage payer, and there's nothing in this code for them.",
        "There are people who, throughout their entire lifetime, are not able to put together the money to own a home.",
        "But they're struggling, too, and there's nothing there for them.",
        "What about the other issues of deducting mortgage insurance for the first time?",
        "That deduction could mean up to $1,000.",
        "Is that going to help people who are more working folks or is that something else that's going to target higher income homeowners?",
        "I think that that's one of the best provisions there, because the private mortgage insurance that is required for people who don't come in with 20 percent often have a very crippling effect on young families, new families with mortgages.",
        "And so this is some very welcome relief.",
        "Again, I think that -there's got to be a renters caucus out there somewhere to help people who are renting.",
        "But this is one of the things that I've seen that I think I feel is, indeed, more broad-based relief and will help some people who are attempting to get into the market now.",
        "As I mentioned earlier in the previous segment, lots of people are holding back from the market because of consumer confidence.",
        "Although $1,000 doesn't seem like a lot of money, when you're buying a house, every little bit helps.",
        "Now there's also been some issues that affect people like these issues that could also stimulate the economy.",
        "One estimate said that the new limits that we're talking about, the new loan limits could result in $300,000 additional home sales and strengthen current home prices by two to three percent.",

        "To the extent that people who don't have federal guarantees still want to get into the market, they face paying higher prices.",

        "So to the extent that the feds will get in and guarantee a higher home price, more loan money, I think that's good.",
