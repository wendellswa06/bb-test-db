        "What happened?",
        "Well, he was, there were only three people in the courtroom other than the participants that day.",
        "The trial wasn't supposed to start, so his daughter, Taniesha Wiggins, was a key witness in the trial, and she had been with the prosecution just that morning practicing her testimony, and they expected her to go on and be a great witness.",
        "And the father, who had not been a participant in this whatsoever, is in the courtroom with her, and she goes to take the stand.",
        "She's really reluctant to even take the oath, so she doesn't, tells the judge she doesn't want to testify.",
        "He finally convinces Taniesha to take the oath, and then she says I wanna talk to my dad, and the judge says okay.",
        "And the father comes out from behind me, goes into the area where the lawyers are, and right behind where the prosecutors sit and about three or four feet in front of me, he tells her the words that you just used at the beginning: Say what I told you to say, I don't remember.",
        "And then they continue to have a few more words that I didn't catch, but it was a whisper that was, you know, loud enough to be clearly heard a few feet away.",
        "And what did the daughter then say in her testimony?",
        "I don't remember, to virtually every question over about a two-hour period.",
        "Even though this was clearly, you know, a remarkable event in her life where a 10-year-old boy is killed standing outside of his school in a shooting between two gangs that had been hunting each other, you know, like one of the most tragic kinds of killings you'd ever hear about, and somehow suddenly all the circumstances became I don't remember.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Now, what has happened since then?",
        "By the way, what happened in the trial?",
        "The two men who were on trial in that killing were both convicted despite six of the witnesses, including Taniesha, not testifying to what they had earlier told police.",
        "Now, after this incident in court, prosecutors thought about charging Devonso Lawson, and first they said, well, maybe he's just trying to protect his daughter.",
        "Then, as this story got around, some other people got pretty excited about it.",
        "Yeah, it seemed that, you know, the day of they kind of wrote it off, and as, I think, the higher-ups in the food chain started thinking about it, it was too obvious to not do something about it.",
        "It was in court.",
        "It was blatant.",
        "It was on the front page of the paper, and then they actually ended up last week arresting him and charging him with trying to get her to perjure herself and intimidating a witness."

        "And has he said anything about why he said what he said?",

        "And it's, you know, it's one of those cases that actually shows that there is a real penalty for people to come forward, and in that case, you know, Tyreese had been, you know, shot twice and then finally, the second time, killed when he said he would testify.",
