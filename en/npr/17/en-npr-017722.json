        "Isn't that typical?",
        "There are really two basic kinds of snitching.",
        "One is what Rayco Saunders was talking about, those who are in the game, those who get caught, those who wanna, who want to get off and cut a deal with prosecutors or police.",
        "The other kind, which is what Mitch Lipka was talking about, is when someone, an innocent kid is shot and killed on the street and no one's willing to talk.",
        "So those aren't quite the same story.",
        "Of course, there's a lot more sympathy for innocent victims, to be honest, than for drug dealers...",

        "Yeah, I can understand that, but isn't -- aren't both types of snitches pretty important to law enforcement?",
        "Well, without a willing witness testimony, you're never going to get convictions, especially in drug crimes, because that's when you don't have a typical victim with you.",
        "When you have assault, you've got a victim, but -- so you need these -- I mean you can call them rats, or snitches, or confidential informants.",
        "But, you know, they're cooperative witnesses, and when they don't talk, nothing happens in court.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "And is there an identifiable trend of more and more people declining to testify, declining to come forward?",
        "I honestly don't think so.",
        "I think this culture has been there.",
        "I mean, it's been part of the gangsta and thug culture for decades, and it has its roots in mob culture.",
        "I mean it's very similar to Omerta and the code of silence you get in the Mafia.",
        "And rappers, you know, know that, and they name themselves after Gotti and things like that.",

        "And if you do, you're considered an outcast.",
        "I had many a friend that have been shot in incidents because they snitched on an officer, and other officers just wouldn't come to their defense.",
        "Now, I'm not with the Stop Snitching, but there's -- that Stop Snitching thing falls in many different areas.",

        "He says people are scared.",
        "It looks like people are scared.",
        "Well, and sometimes there's good reason to be scared.",
        "I mean it's a shame because it often is communities held hostage by very few people.",
        "If everyone snitched, if everyone talks, there's really not much that the bad guys could do.",
        "But on an individual level, there is a risk.",
