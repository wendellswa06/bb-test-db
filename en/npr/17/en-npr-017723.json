        "Dave's with us from Sacramento.",
        "Yes, hi, thanks for taking my call.",
        "Sure.",
        "I'm actually a former narcotics prosecutor and now I prosecute sexual assault and domestic violence cases.",
        "But, you know, my comment is, regarding the value of confidential informants, you know without CIs, we as prosecutors can't get search warrants to go in dope dealers' houses and to help try and clean up neighborhoods.",
        "And we do have, often times, real serious difficulty getting witnesses to come forward in gang cases.",
        "Those are some of the most difficult cases out there.",
        "You know, with respect to what the individual said earlier about Stop Snitching.",
        "The complaint seems to me more appropriately directed toward the D.A., because if the cases of the snitches aren't being dealt with appropriately, then that falls to the D.A.",
        "And your D.A.'s your elected official, so vote with your feet.",
        "One thing, Dave, let me ask you about, and this has been raised in several states on the East Coast, I wonder what the situation is there in California; that if state agencies had a better witness protection program, maybe they could get more witnesses to cooperate.",
        "You know, I don't doubt that that's probably true, but, as is the case with many agencies, find me the money.",
        "I'd be happy to offer witness protection to many of the people, and particularly people in my domestic violence cases who are trying to escape a violent environment.",
        "But they know that they're hooked in enough that they can't get out of these situations.",
        "Is it...",
        "And witness protection has its limits.",
        "And most people don't want it because you have to move.",
        "I mean, you have your neighborhood, your friends, your child care arrangements, so it's usually not an option for most people."

        "Absolutely.",
        "And Dave, I assume it's also sometimes difficult to get testimony in domestic abuse cases as well, and for pretty much the same reason, fear of retaliation.",
        "About 80 to 90 percent of victims in domestic violence cases and sexual assault cases will do what's called a recantation at some point.",
        "They'll give an initial statement to the police officers and then by the time they come to court, the cycle of domestic violence has reached the point where the defendant has apologized, you know, they realize that this is the person who's the caretaker of my children, and I really can't be testifying against this person, because he could potentially go away to prison.",
        "He could be on felony probation, you know, he'll have difficulty now getting jobs.",
        "So, you know, it seems to me that -- and this is from some victim's perspectives, not all, but some -- that, you know, that now is not a good time for me to be, you know, biting the hand that feeds me, essentially.",
        "And it's a horrible, sad situation.",

        "Are you going to prevent arthritis?",
        "Are you going to prevent problems to your knees?",
        "Hi, I'm a teacher and coming from a white middle-class background, I had absolutely no experience with this no snitching campaign.",
        "But as I started to teach, I began noticing kind of a trend amongst my students.",
        "And one day we were giving a lesson on exactly this issue and they were, you know, informing me that this is something that's often talked about in rap lyrics.",
        "And it's sort of a problem that I see perpetuating itself in my school system.",
        "The students, unless they're given some sort of financial contribution or offered some sort of financial incentive, won't come forward.",
        "And they don't feel culpable at all when they're the witness to a crime for not coming forward.",
        "And so it's kind of creating the cycle of violence I think that's in our community, because, you know, here are these rap, you know, rap artists who are, you know, obviously held up as some sort of, you know, symbol of admiration amongst a lot of my students.",
        "And they are, again, perpetuating this idea of not snitching."

        "And these are New York City kids and smart college students, and people often think that you can plead the 5th Amendment.",
        "You can't.",

        "Like, that's what I can't teach my students is that, you know, morally, there is an obligation, and regardless of whether or not anybody ever knows that you've witnessed this crime, if you don't come forward, if you don't help the victim, there's...",
