        "Thank you.",
        "Okay.",
        "After that video came out a couple of years ago in Baltimore, the police department put together their own DVD, designed their own t-shirts to counter the Stop Snitching campaign that said \"\"keep talking.\"\" Often, it seems that police departments when they try to do this it's a little hamfisted.",
        "Has that been effective at all?",
        "Yeah, the production value wasn't that much higher than the Stop Snitching DVD.",
        "So, in their efforts to combat this, what can police departments, prosecutors do?",
        "Well, one thing they can do, which is what they did, they arrested the people in the video.",
        "I mean, that's for starters, because if the people flashing guns and drugs in the video walk free, then, I mean, that sort of makes a shambles of everything.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "So they did go and lock them up.",
        "And just a couple of weeks ago, they locked up Skinny Suge himself, Ronnie Thomas, the guy who made the DVD, which is only a shame because he was working on volume eight of his series, which I was sort of looking forward to.",
        "But, so they got him on various counts.",
        "And he's been arrested before for drugs and handgun possession.",
        "So you can certainly start on that.",
        "And I think, though, this is not very popular.",
        "I think, to some extent, you have to crack down on hip hop artists when they make a point when they don't see something.",
        "The Lil' Kims and the 50 Cents.",
        "I mean, again, you have to get the idea that this is not, you can't choose not to testify.",
        "And there's no--the court system doesn't have much of a carrot to draw people in.",
        "There's no, except for doing the right thing, there's no good reason to go to court.",
        "No really wins in court.",
        "So all they really have is a stick, so they've got to use it occasionally.",
        "Well, Lil' Kim is in prison, I think, as we speak.",
        "But what about that case in Philadelphia?",
        "A father is trying to--well, we don't know exactly what his motive is, but it could be that he's trying to protect his daughter from retaliation.",
        "Five other witnesses didn't testify in that case, either.",
        "He says just say you don't know.",
        "Well, that's the attitude.",
        "I mean, he--that guy--that father's no angel.",
        "I mean, he might be trying to protect his daughter, but he's trying to protect himself.",
        "I mean, again, no one wants to go to court.",
        "Victims don't.",
        "Criminals certainly don't.",
        "I mean, the only people that want to go to court are police officers, because we get paid time and a half for it."
