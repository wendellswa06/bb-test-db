        "Maybe two, three years ago, there was a neighbor here who got a pamphlet about how to recognize radicalization and apparently called the police about the family, and the police came to visit the house.",
        "So people were aware of this.",
        "I also talked to several neighbors who all corroborated this story.",
        "They said sometime back - not sure it was this family still living there at the time - there was actually a black flag with white Arabic writing flying from the house, so - which sounds like an Islamic - Islamist flag to me.",
        "So clearly the people didn't know the family well, but they were a family that people were aware of.",

        "But was Abedi actually known to authorities there?",
        "Yeah, he was, clearly.",
        "And right now what they're saying - police officially are saying, we're trying to - they're trying to determine if he was part of a radical Islamist network.",

        "The intelligence agencies are saying - telling my sources that he was peripheral and not deemed a high risk.",
        "Later on this afternoon, I talked to high-ranking Western government source who said that he had actually recently come back to Manchester from the Middle East.",
        "I believe the thought was he'd actually come from Libya.",
        "In the meantime, is there any suggestion that he had maybe an accomplice?",

        "Our assessment is he did not have the skills to build such a bomb, and the conclusion is there's a bomb maker out there.",

        "Once, about eight people were removed and they were forcibly removed by New Orleans police.",
