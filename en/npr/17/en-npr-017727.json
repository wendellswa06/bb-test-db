        "And Alan Schwartz, is that a direction these lawsuits could eventually take?",
        "Well, I think that the league will get sued whether it changes rules or not because what they chose to do for about three years was to deny the existence of evidence that tied football with permanent brain problems.",
        "So they are on the hook for that whether they like it or not.",
        "I think that they - look, I'm the guy who has been blamed for a lot of this stuff, and the league has made some proactive moves, and they're talking about making more proactive moves.",
        "I do think that - we're talking about this new kick-off rule, where all they're doing is moving it up five yards and giving the kamikaze guys five fewer yards to run - I predict on this show today that in five years there will be no kickoffs as we know them today.",
        "I think it will be a free kick, like a punt, and you will not have guys running 20 yards headlong into each other.",
