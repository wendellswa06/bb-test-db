        "And I would say this, that postgraduate, after school, after I, you know, had lost my sight, the thing about football that people don't understand is - and violent sports is - it can very well carry over into other relationships as far as not everybody but, you know, most of the violent football players, the linebackers and the kickoff guys, they tended to be pushy, bully, not be able to have - you know, they had a lot of anger that would carry over.",
        "And that's not an absolute, but I know that with me, in my heart now, I'm a New Testament Christian, I'm very kind and whatever, but for many years, you know, I was very, you know, gruff and short with people.",
