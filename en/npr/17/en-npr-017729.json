        "Hi.",
        "Nice of you to be with us today.",
        "As you look at - you've seen the effect of repeated injuries and head injuries, not just on yourself but on your teammates and on your rivals as well.",
        "Now that you're out of the game, what do you think about these rule changes?",
        "Can anything be done to mitigate the effects of repeated head injuries without changing the nature of the game?",
        "In my opinion, I don't think that there's a whole lot that you can do to mitigate head-to-head contact.",
        "This is a very physical sport.",
        "You're wearing a helmet for a reason.",
        "And part of the reason is to protect you, but also - it also serves as a weapon or a leverage point that a person uses.",
        "So trying to mitigate head-to-head injuries is going to be very tough to do.",
        "You can try to throw flags and personalize penalties or things like that to try to deter guys from doing it, but at the end of the day, if I'm running the rock(ph) and I get in to a tight squeeze, one of the first things I'm going to do is lower my head and shoulders and get behind my shoulder pads.",
        "And the first thing it's going to hit is going to probably would have been my head at some point.",
        "Your long-term teammate Daryl \"\"Moose\"\" Johnson has agreed to offer his brain for research into the effect of concussions.",
        "He said he's scared that he will have to pay a price for all of those hits, in terms of brain damage and quality of life.",
        "After seeing the evidence - and I'm sure you've read it - do you share those concerns?",
        "Yes, I do.",
        "Yes, I do.",
        "I mean, I do.",
        "I've gone through the process that Daryl has gone through.",
        "Thanks to Daryl, he introduced me to the folks down in Dallas that are doing a lot of the testing right now.",
        "And so I have gone through the tests.",
        "Right now, everything looks to be - and appear to be fine.",
        "But after this and that - what happened with Dave Duerson and some others, yes, it does concerns me.",
        "But, you know, I know that the repercussions may be there, and I'm looking out for them.",
        "We're trying to do everything in my power to alleviate some of those things.",
        "But there's nothing I can do now.",
        "You're right, I played 15 years in the National Football League, three years at the University of Florida, four years in the high school, revered as the (unintelligible) of the lead guy.",
        "And so there is - it's a little too late now.",
        "Do you wish that you had gotten the warnings when you were a young man and just coming into the league, that the players are getting now?",
        "They're much clearer now.",
        "Obviously, there's more evidence now too.",
        "But that those warning had been there when you were coming in?",
        "No, I wish those warnings would have been there, but I don't think it would have changed anything because my love for the game - it is what it is.",
        "And so that's just a decision that a player has to make and a person must make.",
        "But at the end of the day, if you were in the middle of a season and a doctor says you've had too many concussions and too many blows, because it is one of the things that happens on a repeated basis, and you know, as an individual player, whether or not you've been dinged 200 times or not, and how many times you had to shake things off.",
        "You know.",
        "And at some point, it will catch up to you.",
        "We had a coach by the name of Joe Avezzano, who used to say, it catches up to you when it catches up to you.",
        "And he was talking about mistakes or trying to get away with something here one week and get away the same thing in the next week, and it turns into something bigger.",
        "And that's part of the whole process that we're talking about.",
        "When you bump your head on a repeated basis in the same spot, generally you're going to have a problem in that particular area.",
        "Emmitt Smith, we appreciate your taking the time to speak with us today on this issue, and good luck to you.",
        "Thank you."

        "Those at the witness table that day included Richard Muller, a professor of physics at Berkeley, considered by some as a climate skeptic.",
        "When he responded in the affirmative to both those questions, he found himself in the middle of a debate where emotion and politics intersect with science.",
        "So we'd like to hear from scientists today.",

        "They want you to be either a warmist or a skeptic or something like that.",
        "And that tends to make the argument sound like it's a case of law in which you have lawyers arguing both sides.",
        "In fact, scientists need to be properly skeptical, and the debate is never closed.",

        "Well, the public issue has been very much cherry-picked.",
        "I talked about that in my \"\"Physics for Future Presidents\"\" book.",
        "Many of the things - the solid science is actually fairly solid, although we believe we can improve on it and refine it, and that's important.",

        "Are they increasing?",

        "We're no more skeptical than any other scientist should be skeptical.",

        "But by doing it systematically, by going to over 1,000 stations in the United States and documenting them, we now have the data that we need to evaluate how much of an effect these bad sitings have.",
