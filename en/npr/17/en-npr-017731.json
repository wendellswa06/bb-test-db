        "So we were all held for about three hours.",

        "You have no right to hold us.",
        "You know, once Rouhani opened the door to say they couldn't do this anymore, then it gave license young women to berate the Morality Police.",
        "We were all released about three hours later.",
        "And when I left the station, I got a hug from the chief police woman and some fruit juice.",
        "And it turned out I think I was the least confrontational - I didn't speak the language - of anybody, so they were happy when I left.",
        "That's a fascinating snapshot of tensions and new tensions in that society.",
        "It is.",

        "But we've put together a combination of things that's actually made it come together.",
        "With a machine called a quasar, which is a quasi-laser, we can fire light of particular wavelengths over this magnetic fluorescent powder, and it will fluoresce, which makes it stand out from the background.",

        "But Malcolm, being the inquisitive type, decided to go out one day, and he found a couple of feathers lying on the ground, and he picked them up, put his own finger marks onto the feathers and tried dusting them with the various types of powders he's got.",
        "Nothing was happening.",
        "And down the bottom of his case, he had this box of red powder that sat there.",
        "He thought, I'll give that a try.",
        "And, of course, it gave it enough contrast to the sort of shades of gray feathers that he had picked up.",
        "So we're talking about these large birds of prey.",
        "Why are these birds being targeted, and how will this particular technology prevent that?",
        "Well, these have been targeted by probably landowners who are likely to lose some income to their land because birds of prey will take the grouse on pheasants that they've raised upon that land.",
        "And other people will be taking the Peregrine falcon's eggs, which are status symbols in areas like the Middle East, and incubate them.",
        "Or they'll take chicks that have actually been hatched and rear them themselves.",
        "And then, of course, it becomes a lucrative trade.",
        "So there's been over 2,5000 cases since 2006 of birds of prey being taken or killed illegally in the UK alone.",
        "And how do you think this new technology - being able to dust for fingerprints on feathers - do think it'll slow the targeting of these birds?",
        "Well, I hope it does, because, you know, now we're able to actually obtain a fingerprint from the flight feathers of birds of prey.",
        "And even if we can't get a recognizable fingerprint, we can actually focus on the area where we can see a mark where someone has handled that bird.",
        "And that allows the forensic scientists who focus on the area which can lead to a DNA trace, and if we don't get the fingerprints, we can get hopefully the perpetrators by way of their DNA."
