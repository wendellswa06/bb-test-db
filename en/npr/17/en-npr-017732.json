        "And towards the end of that process, I started to interview a bunch of teenagers in Khayelitsha--where Thembi's from--about AIDS, either who were themselves infected or who's family members were--with the idea that maybe, you know, that this sort of was a topic that could probably, could possibly benefit from this kind of treatment that, you know, trying to get someone to tell the story in their own words and maybe be a kind of a new approach to the kind of overwhelming topic of AIDS.",
        "And I just interviewed a bunch of teenagers, and Thembi just kind of completely stood out, really.",

        "Her English was good.",

        "So there was just something about her that I kind of thought maybe, you know, there was potential to kind of tell this story in a way that would kind of impact people in a new way."

        "You know, actually, surprisingly, there were.",

        "She had done these little kind of poster flyers in her community that she'd already kind of encouraged people to get tested without actually coming out as herself HIV positive.",
        "So, really, the year that she recorded I think was kind of a really coming out for her in terms of hiding less and feeling differently about the stigma in her own mind, and actually, to tell you the truth, probably in her township as well.",
        "I think things changed a lot over that year.",
        "Well, and, Thembi, at one point in the story that aired the other night on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, you're wearing a I Have HIV T-shirt, so coming out is not a surprise to anybody anymore.",
        "Yes, it's not a surprise, because even if we are wearing that T-shirt, they don't know whether it's HIV positive or not HIV positive, because most of the people have those T-shirts.",
        "And yet this issue of coming out and telling people you have this dreaded disease, this is very difficult.",
        "Well, it's very difficult because of what people might do and what people might think, because people are very scared of the disease, and they don't believe that--some of them don't believe that it exists.",
        "And some of them, if you have the disease, they think it's contagious.",
