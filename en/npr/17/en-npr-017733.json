        "Mm hmm.",
        "That's an anomaly.",
        "I mean, because it's a fairly well off country, to some extent, there are people who are HIV positive--if they work, if they can afford to pay for their treatment.",
        "There are another estimated 200,000 who can afford to pay for the treatment themselves that are in care.",
