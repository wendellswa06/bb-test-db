        "I'm in the same boat.",
        "At this point, I've been fortunate to have very good medical care, and I only think about it when I have to take the pills, and even then, it's just, you know, I have other pills that I have to take because I'm getting older.",
        "So, you know, it just becomes part of the routine.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hm.",
        "Did you think, though, 20 years ago, Mike, when you were first diagnosed, that you'd be still complaining about the pills 20 years later?",
        "Well, I wasn't thinking about complaining about the pills, but I made the decision when I was diagnosed that I wasn't going to let it kill me.",
        "And I lost my first partner, who died over 11 years ago now.",
        "But we just had different attitudes about it.",
        "And although a good attitude won't necessarily guarantee your survival, a bad attitude, or a hopeless attitude will pretty much guarantee that you won't has been my experience.",

        "Thank you, bye.",
        "Brenda Wilson, let me ask you something.",
        "The story that you broadcast of this woman who was refusing to be tested, this was in a rural area of South Africa, and this had to do a lot with gender politics in the country.",
        "This woman was married and afraid that her husband's family would throw her out and she would have nowhere to go if they found out she was even tested for AIDS.",
        "He - people will remember.",
        "But, in any case, he insisted that Poitier be given equal billing to him, even though he was the star in that picture by Stanley Kramer.",
        "Yes, and I guess it's important to understand that this was 2003, not that long ago, but it was a rural area, and there's some indications that attitudes in rural areas may be somewhat different than they are in a urban setting, where there is increasing awareness, where they do have the positive T-shirt campaigns.",
        "But it was sort of interesting, it wasn't just the woman whom the nurse was trying to test for the virus.",
        "I turned at one point during this process and asked the nurse how she felt about it, and she goes, well, you know, our situation here, even though I'm informed and I know what my risks are, we're just kind of not in charge of that.",
        "So, it is recognized even now.",
        "I mean, 57 percent of the people who are infected in South Africa--or more than half, at least to be safe--are young women, and they're between the ages of 15 and 24.",
        "And they're much more likely in that age group than young men.",
        "And often because their partners are older men.",
        "Not all the time, but often.",
        "Because I think it's much more difficult if you're a young woman, depending on your circumstances.",
        "You have less economic independence, you may be the dependent person in relationship, and I think older men just--it would be difficult for a young woman to negotiate a relationship, to negotiate the use of a condom, even though there seems to be increasing use of condoms there.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Thembi, let me ask you: you got AIDS from one boyfriend, unwittingly, then spread AIDS yourself to your boyfriend, unwittingly.",
        "You did not know you had it at the time.",
        "How do you deal with both the anger of being infected by somebody and the guilt over infecting somebody else."

        "The second question I have for her is, does she blame herself in any way for being HIV positive now?",
        "Well, I would like to give the teenagers an advice like they must change their minds about what they think about HIV and AIDS.",
        "They must not think that it doesn't exist.",
        "It's something that is existing and it is in people's blood and anyone can get it.",
        "So, they must try to learn more about HIV and stop discriminating people.",
        "If you are HIV positive, it doesn't mean you are cursed.",
        "Or maybe it's, you did something wrong.",
        "You didn't do anything wrong.",
        "So, you just have to keep up your, even if you're HIV positive, you just, don't let the disease bring you down.",
        "And Roger's other question, do you hold yourself in any way responsible for contracting HIV?",
        "Well, I hold myself for that because I don't have anyone else to blame but myself.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think I put myself into this situation, so I rely on myself to make it better.",
        "I can't blame other people.",

        "And it truly has moved me and changed me, you know, deeply to know that there are, to see this on a more human level, on a more personal level rather than just talking about AIDS and Africa and what a terrible thing it is.",

        "And you know, these sort of, this project, these diaries depend on a lot of trust and we had a little bit of a breakdown there.",
        "I returned back to South Africa and you know, at that time, usually doing a diary like this, if she, if I knew she had had the baby, then she would have recorded all that.",
        "I think that was one of the reasons Thembi didn't want to tell me.",
        "She didn't want to have to record all that.",
        "Well, I didn't want to tell Joe I was pregnant because I didn't want the baby to be in the story.",
        "I just know, I didn't, well, it seems so complicated.",
        "By that time, I was thinking that because I'm HIV positive, I don't have the right to have the baby.",
        "People are going to think that I'm a killer.",
        "I'm going to kill the baby by infecting it and maybe they will arrest me at the hospital saying why I'm pregnant while I know my status.",
        "But when the doctor told me that there are some things that they can do to prevent the baby from getting infected, to a mother, that's when I got pregnant.",
        "And then I hide it so that Joe could not know because he would say I must record all this pregnancy thing and then when I go to labor I must carry the tape recorder, which I didn't want to do.",
        "Hard enough to carry it in to talk to your father.",
        "I can understand."
