        "And specifically, they asked for our help in characterizing the men who got infected, understanding the circumstances that were associated with those infections and for making prevention recommendations based on our findings.",
        "What we found was that transmission in the prison setting in Georgia wasn't rare, but neither did it appear to be rampant.",
        "And I think some of the things we found may challenge some preconceptions that people have.",
        "For example, among the men who reported sex with other males in prison, the inmates characterized most of that sex as consensual.",
        "I think we see depictions of prison rape sometimes in the popular media, and there's a lot of appropriate concern about prison rape, but according to our data, most of the sex that occurs is characterized as consensual by the inmates.",
        "Very interesting point.",
        "But by consensual, do you mean truly consensual?",
        "Do you mean trading for favors?",
        "Well, you make a great point, which is that the meaning, the context for consent to sex in prison is probably different than it is in other settings.",
        "We asked the men how they characterized sex and they could characterize it as consensual as being in exchange for some commodity like cigarettes, like protection, or candy, or they could characterize it as rape, and they most frequently characterized it as consensual."
