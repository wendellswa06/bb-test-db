        "Although he did study with a very, very famous, actually, avant-garde theater person and leftist theater person from Europe who fled the Nazis named Erwin Piscator.",
        "And he was in an acting class in the '40s with Walter Matthau and Harry Belafonte and a lot of really great actors.",
        "He grew up in the Yiddish theater?",
        "Well, he - I think he actually appeared once on the Yiddish stage as Bernard Schwartz.",
        "I'm not sure of his billing, but I did - a wonderful philanthropist and community leader, a man named Maynard Wishner in Chicago told me this story years ago, that he'd actually seen Tony Curtis - and this would have been right after World War II - when he was just beginning, maybe even before he started his training.",
        "He had to fill in quickly.",
        "They needed somebody to play the young, male lead in a - some, you know, romantic, tear-jerking melodrama on the Yiddish stage in Chicago.",
        "And they put him on the train.",
        "He got up to Chicago, and he didn't really speak that much Yiddish.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But Wishner remembered that when he entered, when Tony Curtis took the stage, he heard throughout the audience, shh, shh.",
        "And Tony Curtis was kind of bugged by it, and he thought people were telling him to be quiet or be - but they were all saying in Yiddish: (Yiddish spoken).",

        "He's just so gorgeous.",

        "So that was Tony Curtis, and that was dynamic of his career, in many ways.",
        "Then went to Hollywood as a contract player for 75 bucks a week.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But - appeared in a bunch of Westerns, once with Jimmy Stewart, but made, I guess, a breakthrough in \"\"The Defiant Ones,\"\" where he and Sidney Poitier starred as escaped convicts - the black man and the white man -shackled together."

        "And in an industry that had to sometimes excise scenes with integrated jazz bands - for example, the Benny Goodman Quartet - before they could run in the South, the idea of a black actor and a white actor portraying characters who were chained together was of enormous symbolic significance in - during the civil rights movement."

        "But when you look at how commonly these risk behaviors were reported among the men, even if there is some underreporting, I think it should challenge us to say how do we take these data and turn them into prevention programs?",
        "And particularly, in this group of men, we know both from the, what they reported in the interviews and from other data, that the men who enter prison, as you mentioned at the, on the introduction, are more likely to be infected with HIV then the general population on their way in.",
        "In this study, of all the men who were infected with HIV in the Georgia prison system, over 90 percent of them had HIV when they came through the door on their way in to prison.",
        "So prisons offer a unique opportunity to intervene with a group of people who have high risk before they come in, may be hard to reach in their communities, and importantly are going back to their communities.",
        "Ninety-seven percent of the men who come into prison will go back out into the communities.",
        "And so we think this is a tremendous opportunity to equip them with the knowledge, the skills, the tools that they need to protect themselves while in prison.",
        "But also, wouldn't it be great to feel like when they went back out into communities that they were equipped with those skills to protect their risk partners in communities?",

        "So Mr. Zack, I want to ask you, how does your organization work with prisoners in San Quentin prison to stop HIV transmission?",
        "Well, for the past 15 years we've been training prisoners to be, at a number of different prisoners, to be peer-health educators.",
        "I think one of the primary obstacles here is that the whole, this whole system is based on mistrust.",
        "So our whole program is based on having peers teach their peers about, whether it be HIV or hepatitis, some of the primary health concerns that the prison population has."
