        "I believe this was a strategic move on his part to separate himself from the president, almost like George Bush ran in 2000 as a different kind of Republican.",
        "So I think this was a good move to tell voters that he's his own person, that he has his own views, his own positions and don't tie him to President Bush.",
        "On the other hand, I think it has everything to do with poll numbers, and he doesn't want to go down a sinking ship.",
        "Well, if President Bush is not going to go campaign for Michael Steele because Michael Steele doesn't want to be too close to him, the president does have a welcome mat extended from Pennsylvania gubernatorial nominee Lynn Swann, again a Republican, a black Republican.",

        "So, Donna Brazile, is Paul Krugman right?",
        "Is that the reason that black Americans, despite the Michael Steeles and the Lynn Swanns, still don't believe that the president is worth their vote?",

        "I think it will come over years of African-Americans hearing from Republican presidents and Republican Congress and Republican governors that African-Americans are wanted, that African-Americans will have a seat at the table to help shape public policy.",
