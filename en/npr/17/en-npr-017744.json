        "You know, I actually used to write a sports television column, so I've gotten paid my entire adult life essentially not to get off of the couch.",
        "And I can't complain.",
        "It's been a pretty good life.",
        "So the events happen, and the magic of it - what seems to make it work as a television event, besides the witty and brilliant commentary - is the cameras underneath the table that show us the whole cards that the players have.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That was the - essentially, poker on TV didn't really exist before 2003.",
        "And then in '03, that technology came aboard which allowed people at home to see what the cards were.",
        "Beforehand, the limited poker on television was very, very difficult to watch because you had no idea what the players had.",
        "You couldn't hear them speaking to each other.",
        "It was difficult to follow.",
        "Even poker players had difficulty following it.",
        "So that was the big breakthrough in terms of being able to watch it on television, being able to see the whole cards.",
        "And we think of the World Series of Poker, most of us think of the main event, which is the one big deal.",
        "But there are a whole bunch of tournaments.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Most people - the World Series of Poker, it's almost like the Olympics where you have different events every day.",
        "So, the World Series of Poker, it's six weeks of different poker events every day, and then the marquee event is the main event where, you know, somebody has a chance to win up to $10 million.",
        "But every day for six weeks in Las Vegas is another one or two different poker events leading up to the main event.",
        "And does this drive you nuts?",
        "I mean, are you doing this all the time now?",
        "Well, it's a different life.",
        "You know, being in a casino 14 or 15 hours a day, seven days a week, is a - pretty much time stops, Neal.",
        "You know, you were mentioning just - your news update, you know, troops - if those Chinese troops were marching into Chicago, we wouldn't know it.",
        "We have no idea what goes on outside the casino.",
        "You pretty much go from casino to casino parking lot, to hotel and back to casino.",
        "So, it's like in a parallel universe and you're surrounded by poker players.",
        "I grew up - my parents used to take our dogs to dog shows and that's, you know, just huge acreage of dogs everywhere you look, and they're barking.",
        "And now I just have huge acreage of poker players everywhere I look and they're barking.",
        "They don't shut up."

        "I figured it'd be a better investment of my $1,500, and I learned a lot - basically, all the mistakes I made last year.",

        "Yes.",

        "I mean, all you're doing is sitting at a table playing poker all day.",
        "But when you start at noon and you play till 2:00 o'clock in the morning, when you are done, you cannot believe how physically and emotionally and mentally draining it is.",
        "And in No Limit Hold'em, where you can push your chips in at any one time, any one mistake takes you out of the tournament.",
        "So you're really on edge for a long time.",
        "And when you're done with that 13, 14-hour stint, all you want to do is collapse.",
        "And then you're supposed to do it again the next day.",
        "Now, this year, you wrote a column.",
        "You entered one of the tournaments, not the main event, but one of the tournaments this year.",
        "Yeah.",

        "So I enter a couple a year, and this year I entered the world Championship of Stud High-Low or Stud Eight, and it cost $10,000.",
        "And it's quite an experience, again, to sit down and do it yourself.",
        "You know, I play poker recreationally, but to sit down in that type of tournament atmosphere and sit down with, you know, Johnny Chan or Doyle Brunson or Phil Hellmuth across from you, there's really nothing like it."
