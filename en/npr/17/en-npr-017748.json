        "Well, I have to say we really - you know, it was a real privilege to make the show.",
        "If I sound bitter, it's only to get a laugh but it really was a privilege to get to make that a very special show.",
        "And I really always felt like there were fans out there that were connecting with it and that would find it later.",

        "And when you have the opportunity to go to a network like HBO or Showtime, it ended up not happening.",
        "Well, actually, it was a little more complicated because we had an opportunity to go to Showtime, but it was at a smaller budget.",
        "And it would have meant a less cast and there were just certain things in it that felt like, well, maybe the show should live on in another way.",
        "Yeah, like a movie."

        "What I wanted to ask is in my observations, the only thing that's come as close to your reference, the tapestry of \"\"Arrested Development.\"\" The only thing that I've seen that layers in multiple jokes so quickly and demands your attention is like \"\"The Simpsons\"\" or the \"\"Family Guy.\"\" You know, these animated things that, you know, allow for that, where you know, they can do something visual as well as the voiceovers.",
        "But \"\"Arrested Development\"\" is the only thing that's as - sharpened as quick and demands that - and I've never seen any other live action comedy that even comes close.",
        "And I wanted to ask you, what is it that allows, you know, the writing of \"\"Arrested Development\"\" to do that, where I've only ever seen cartoons do that?",
        "Well, it's interesting you say that because we - it was one of the models in a way.",

        "But certainly, \"\"The Simpsons\"\" was - and the \"\"Family Guy\"\" is doing that now.",
        "But \"\"The Simpsons\"\" somehow created this reality where they didn't really break the wall and they were very, very dense with their stuff.",
        "And every sign in the background was funny and the addresses were funny, and the phone numbers were funny, and the couch was funny.",
        "I mean, they just looked for it everywhere.",
        "And I think we were the beneficiaries of the fact that the technology had changed to a certain extent.",
        "So when we did the show with HD cameras, HD video cameras, which - it hadn't been a lot comedies that had done that.",
        "A show like \"\"Malcolm in the Middle,\"\" they really did need those scripts a month in advance and they would have cranes and they would elaborately set up their shots.",
        "Whereas we would get to a location at eight o'clock and we'd be shooting at 8:15.",
        "And we used that savings and time to have multiple sets to go a lot of places, to be really gorilla about it, and just to take advantage of every single opportunity.",
        "I mean, I think comedy works best when you get rehearsal time.",
        "I think that's kind of - in a way, that's the big difference between film and television.",
        "In movies, you get to run a scene a lot of times.",
        "And if you look it like a TV movie, sometimes they're not as good because they only get two shots at it.",
        "So we would be able to do a scene 14 or 15 times.",

        "Even though you're doing scenes 14, 15 times.",
        "Yeah, it's funny.",

        "So actually, it was very, very tightly scripted.",
