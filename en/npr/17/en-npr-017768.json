        "Well, we're very impressed and perhaps one of the reasons why we're so popular, we tour here for three months every year, and it's amazing to go into a little pockets, small little towns, and discover, you know, bunches of musicians playing these instruments and we always extend an invitation to local musicians to come and join us, we've been doing this for about 30, 40 years now, to join us at the end of the concert for a little jam session.",
        "And it's been proved, I know on one occasion we got 35 musicians and the promoter nearly went mad because of the insurance situation.",
        "But they all joined us on stage and what a sound.",
        "It was fantastic.",
        "So you don't have to Sting or Van Morrison to join the Chieftains on stage?",

        "But he telephoned and I said well listen, come up and sing a song or two.",
        "So he actually come on and sang about seven or eight songs and it was a great night needless to say.",
        "But Van, you know, his version of \"\"Shenandoah\"\" from 'The Long Journey Home' has to be the best version I think I've ever heard and it's always different.",
        "He puts some little twist into it every now and again.",
        "And a true Irish style, you know, traditional style and this is one of the great things about Van.",
        "He has a new country album, has just come out incidentally so he's following us with our down the old plank road for which incidentally Jeff White from Nashville here, Jeff you might say was the sixth Chieftain and gave us tremendous assistance in discovering some of the tunes and players and putting it all together.",
        "So we always have Jeff with us as much as possible when he's not with Vince Gill or Lyle Lovett."
