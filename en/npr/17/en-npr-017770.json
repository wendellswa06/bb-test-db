        "Mr. Walter Willett, of the Harvard school of Public Health says the study's conclusions didn't surprise him.",
        "The national advice had been that all fat is bad and we should reduce it as much as possible and instead load up on complex carbohydrates.",
        "In fact, there was never really much evidence to support that, and this new study I think really provides three strikes against the idea of the low-fat diet.",

        "It was designed to test different strategies for preventing heart disease, bone thinning osteoporosis, and breast and colorectal cancer.",
        "It made news in 2002 when its findings created doubt that hormone therapy was good for women's overall health.",
        "It again made news last month when final results did not conclusively show that a low-fat diet reduces the risk for heart disease, breast cancer, and colon cancer.",
        "It also did not show whether or not calcium and vitamin D offer protection against broken bones.",
        "Scientific studies are often very complex and murky.",
        "While they may yield valuable data and clues for scientists, the reality is that clear answers may be more elusive.",

        "Today we'll try to clear up some of the confusion about the Women's Health Initiative and try to figure out what we actually do know.",
        "Later, we'll also take a look at how to make sense of scientific data.",

        "Good to be here, Lynn.",
        "Thank you.",
        "First of all, let's just get a little background on the study.",
        "What, it was an extremely ambitious study obviously, what did they set out to do?",
        "What was the main goal of this?",
        "Well, think about when the study started, 15 years ago.",
        "Most medical research at that time was still being done in middle-aged white men, and there wasn't a whole lot known about women's health in general and about some of these interventions in particular, they sort of put things together based on little hints here and there.",
        "And, you're right, this was a really ambitious attempt, let's go, let's look at the whole issue, let's look at women's health, let's look at whether or not these interventions will work.",
        "This is a great way to do it, by getting a lot of women and getting a lot of numbers and then they can sit down and analyze it.",
        "What was unique about the study is they were looking at the women in the Environment--women, you know, living their lives.",
        "They weren't taking 25 women and putting them in a metabolic ward in a hospital where they could weigh what they ate, they would know exactly what was happening with them over three or four weeks.",
        "This was looking at women over a decade and a half, so they were getting a lot, they got a lot of data, they did it in a new way, and, you know, they got to look at a lot of different things at the same time.",
        "And in the end, though, a lot of women seem to feel that all they learned was that they can't tell them anything particularly about low-fat diets or calcium.",
        "I mean, why did that happen?",
        "How did that come about?",
        "Well, as you said, this is how science works.",
        "It's a murky process.",
        "You get a lot of data, you look at it.",
        "The study may be over in terms of gathering the data, it's not over in terms of analyzing it.",
        "Actually, some of these women are going to go on and continue to report in about how they're doing.",
        "So, it's not over.",
        "What they know is that things aren't clear, which is how science works.",
        "They know they need to look for more in certain areas.",
        "They're realizing that certain sub-groups, you know, for example with hormones, it does look like hormones early on in menopause may be a good idea or may not be unhealthy.",
        "It looks like calcium and vitamin D may help older women.",
        "You know, they now have sub-groups to look at, let's see, how is it working in these women vs. those other women?",
        "They have all that data, it's going to take awhile to analyze it.",
        "Maybe you could explain sub-groups a little bit, because in reading about this, I began to understand a little more what these sub-groups are about and why, they weren't the first thing that was reported, which may be why there was confusion.",
        "Maybe you can just explain that.",
        "Well, I wouldn't say I had problems with the study.",
        "I think the study was quite a good one and provided some clear answers to important questions that had been raised over the years.",
        "It's not so surprising that everyone interviewed for this story had glowing things to say on the record about Judge Mukasey.",
        "After all, who wants to slam the man who may soon be the most powerful law enforcement officer in the country?",
        "But the thing is, when the tape recorder was off, and people could presumably be a bit more candid, they still gushed about him.",
        "One civil rights lawyer talked about a colleague who represented accused terrorists in Judge Mukasey's court.",
        "When the colleague died recently, Judge Mukasey delivered a moving speech at the attorney's funeral.",
        "The lawyer who described the scene said it's not often that a judge will develop that kind of a relationship with lawyers.",
        "It says something about him."
