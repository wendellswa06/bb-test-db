        "Last week, Kiley sat, stone-faced, in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee as Missouri Democrat Claire McCaskill read out a letter she got from a Walter Reed outpatient.",
        "We, as injured veterans and those family members who depend on military medical facilities deserve nothing less than the resignation of General Kiley.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, the whole concept of sub-groups is a very contentious one in science, at least among epidemiologists.",
        "The idea is, if you're doing a study and you want to see an effect, you have to design the study for what you want to see.",
        "That way you know how many people you need in each group, you know what data you need to collect.",
        "If, instead, you collect a whole bunch of data and then you go back and look, let's see, we didn't see a big effect in the big group, let's look at different age groups, or let's look at different ethnic groups, or let's look at this or that.",
        "A lot of scientists think that's not a good way to go about it, because, one of the ways they do these, one of the criteria they use, is something called a confidence interval.",
        "And the deal with a confidence interval, or a good statistical number, is there a 95% chance that this is right, meaning is there a 5% percent chance this is wrong?",
        "We'll accept it.",
        "If you measure 100 things, and they all could, five of them are going to be wrong, right off the bat, by your definition.",
        "So, you know, when you're doing something like that you're accepting that there's still some gray area in there and that's a hard thing for scientists and non- scientists to accept.",
        "Right.",
        "So, but in this case, if you look into those sub-groups, as you said, that's where you start seeing the findings that seem to have some significance for the general public, is that a good way to put it?",
        "Well, for certain age groups, but, you know, no one study is ever enough to do anything.",
        "Everything needs to be reproduced.",
        "There are lots of other studies going on, lots of other groups, both in Europe, where they've got excellent data.",
        "The Danes, for example, have, and the people in Iceland have birth to death data on people.",
        "They can now look, let's to go that group, let's see what's happening there, with this group, let's carry it out a little further, let's do a bigger study on this sub-group.",
        "They now, what the Women's Health Initiative has done, in my mind, is said, this is where we need to look further.",
        "All right.",
        "Having said that, there has been some criticism of the way this study was conducted, though, has their not?",
        "Yes, and again, it's, part of it, a big part of it is can you go back and what they call mine the data?",
        "Let's go back and find a connection.",
        "And again, if you look at 100 things, you're going to find something just by chance.",
        "So, can you really look at 100 things, find one thing by chance, and say this is real?",
        "No. But you can look at 100 things, find something by chance and say, let's look at this a little further and see if it was by chance.",
        "Is there, and you can look at it in different ways.",
        "You can say, is there a mechanistic way or physiological reason for this?",
        "That makes it a little more believable.",
        "Is there what they call a dose-response relationship?",
        "In other words, as you get older, the connection gets stronger or the connection gets weaker.",
        "That makes it seem more biologically plausible.",
        "You look at all these things, you do further studies, you have an answer.",
        "Of course, you know, a 15- year study, 700-plus million dollars, people want the answers now."

        "Thanks so much for being with us.",
        "Good afternoon.",
        "I'm happy to be here.",
        "As you've just heard, we've been talking a little bit about some of the criticism that the Women's Health Initiative has faced as it's reported its findings.",
        "What were some of the difficulties of this massive study that you faced?",
        "Well, I think some very good points were made, and I'd like to start out by pointing out that it's important to remember that these are randomized trials.",
        "And they're the only ones that we have in large numbers of, of diverse numbers of people.",
        "In hormone work, in diet work, in calcium work, virtually all the data are either observational, and what we mean by that, is looking at populations, the way they were talking about looking at people from Iceland or the Danes, but there are a lot of ways those data can be confounded.",
        "So, or they can do, there have been a lot of short-term trials, looking not at hard end-points like WHI did.",
        "In other words, deaths, and heart attacks, and cancer rates, but on markers of these things, like, say, looking at cholesterol levels as a potential predictor of heart disease.",
        "So, it's very important for us to realize that this is the biggest, longest study we have and that it has given a lot of valuable information, and as was pointed out, we need to continue to look carefully at this information, to look at it, to see what we can learn.",
        "Now my impression from reading about this is that, you know, scientists understand that there is that valuable data in there.",
        "They're looking into it.",
        "They're looking at the effect on the subgroups, as Joanne mentioned, but there's a whole lot of confusion out there in the public, and a certain level of, I would think, a bit of disgust, saying, oh, you know the health community is always coming out with these studies.",
        "First they tell us one thing, then they tell us another.",
        "Why so much confusion and isn't that a problem for future studies?",
        "I think the confusion is because it's hard for non-scientists to understand the difference between the kinds of studies that are reported.",
        "Now, it seems all of science is reported in the press and people only read the headlines and those tend to be simple one-liners that really don't explain carefully what really was found and not found.",
        "So, they'll look at a headliner one day from a study of 20 women, as Joanne pointed out, compared to this study, which has thousands of women, and they aren't able to make the distinction.",
        "So, I can understand why people are confused, and we need to learn as scientists and researchers to get messages, craft messages, and get them out.",
        "And a program like this is a great opportunity.",
        "But weren't there also some problems with, I have read about some problems with the way some of the studies were conducted just in the fact that, for instance, some of the women, there were a lot of women involved in these three studies, some of them involved in all three studies, and that some of these women dropped out, or had a hard time, for instance keeping up, the low- fat diet they were supposed to keep up with, and that this caused some problems for the research.",
        "Your concerns though, did you have any concerns about what the impression that the public is getting as a result of the way the findings have been publicized?"

        "It's almost like you were sitting down at a dinner table and saying, hey, Judy, what do you think of the legal system, what do you think of this case.",
        "Well, actually, if you want to talk about the low-fat diet, compared to most diet studies that have been published, and mind you those tend to be six-month or one-year studies, we have incredibly high follow-up rates for the end-points, which were heart disease and cancers.",
        "And we have data on almost every one of those women.",
        "What we have observed, however, is that we tried to institute this diet in a way that would be clinically relevant, i.e., not, as Joanne was explaining, putting everybody in a metabolic ward or feeding them all their food, because you can't do that in the real world.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So, it was done by counseling and coaching and bringing people in for group lessons and things like that.",
        "Clearly this study tells us that it is difficult to achieve huge changes in diet.",
        "We got women to drop their fat 11 percent the first year and it was only eight percent by the end.",
        "Maybe that is a lesson for the clinical world that maybe this is all one can realistically achieve in a clinical setting in terms of diet change.",
        "So, you can say that's a problem in that we powered it to expect a greater change.",

        "Our e-mail address is talk@npr.org.",
        "And Barbara Howard, before we went on that break you were talking about some of the findings that are in, I guess you might say, what you learned inside of these studies, that initially, the big results were announced, and yet inside these studies there are some very interesting things to be learned about women and health.",
        "You were talking about that in terms of low fat.",
        "What about in terms of hormone therapy?",
        "Well, I think that if you will recall back when we had to stop the hormone trials, we looked at a large number of diseases that, on the women, on hormones, compared to placebo.",
        "With the combined regimen, the estrogen plus progestin, it was an extremely adverse profile with only fractures really being the only meaningful end point that showed an improvement.",
        "And when we did subgroup analysis as Joanne beautifully explained, there was no tendency even that this might differ in younger and older women.",
        "When the estrogen trial ended, it was a more complicated picture with still a great deal of risk from stroke, from blood clots, and also from things like incontinence, from gall bladder disease, etc. And yet, in the case of that study looking at heart disease, there appeared to be a trend.",
        "It was not significant, but it was a trend that the effects on heart disease might not be adverse in younger women.",
        "So, this latest paper focused in on that one trend.",
        "And I think that maybe the source of confusion, because don't forget that those women still are at risk for strokes and blood clots and incontinence and gall bladder disease, but it was reassuring in that the FDA's recommendation now is that if one needs to take estrogen for menopausal symptoms, take it for as little time as possible.",
        "And it does look like in the younger women there may not be as adverse a risk factor if they take just estrogen alone."

        "But one of the criticisms of that particular study is that I think many of the women or most of the women in the study were past menopause.",
        "Is that correct?",
        "That's right, and that's because in 1990 when this study was designed, there was a universal recommendation that all women should take estrogen for the rest of their lives to prevent heart disease.",
        "And that was very, very well accepted, and yet the breast cancer people were telling us that it was associated.",

        "I think the caller is very wise, and I'm glad that she brought up this point.",
        "I want to explain that when this trial was designed, it was designed, the low-fat trial, for cancer as an outcome.",
        "Based on all the observational data linking total fat, not the kind of fat, to breast cancer especially, but also, to a lesser extent, to colon cancer.",
        "Heart disease was added as what we call a secondary end point.",
        "You couldn't design it for heart disease, you would have needed even more women and it would have been more expensive.",
        "So, the findings, I believe, tell us a lot.",
        "First of all, if you look at the data for breast cancer this confidence that Joanne was explaining was seven percent.",
        "The decrease we got was within seven percent of probability, not quite five, but seven.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "And in the women who started out eating more fat, it was very significant and they got a 21 percent reduction in breast cancer.",
        "So that the caller is very right, that this is not telling us that women should go out and eat a lot of fat.",
        "And if women are eating a high-fat diet, they should reduce their fat.",
        "Now when we looked at the heart disease data, what we found was that it confirmed, for the first time in a long-term trial, what we had been proposing, that it was the type of fat."

        "And the polyunsaturated, the fish oils, the fats that comes from plant products, including the flax seed, are healthy, and it is the saturated fat, the fat that comes from meats, meat fat and from high fat dairy products and the trans fat from those hydrogenated cooking and baking products, are the ones we need to avoid.",
