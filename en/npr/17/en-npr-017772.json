        "Thanks so much for calling in, Clark, and for calling us on our simplifying the results of the study too much, obviously, as we introduced the show.",
        "And maybe again, this is one of those findings that you have to dig a little deeper to really understand.",
        "Barbara Howard?",
        "Well, I'm going to defend the press there in that the distinction here is that, as trialists, there is a scientific way that one has to present the result.",
        "And first, you have to show the group as a whole, and the reduction in hip fractures in all the group, all the ages, was not, it didn't reach that level of statistical significance.",
        "It was close again, but it didn't make it.",
        "So, we always have to say that first.",
        "And that's of course what the headlines picked up.",
        "But what he's pointing out is, as soon as you look to the next level you see for all the women over 60, there was a 21 percent reduction.",
        "And for the women who actually took their pills, because whenever you do a trial, and we had quite good adherence in that trial, in other words people taking their pills, but some didn't, if you took them out, then there was a 29 percent reduction in the whole group.",
        "So that's the problem.",
        "We have to report it, in a scientific article, the way it's expected for good science, and that then the news report is going to show the primary finding.",
        "And, if people don't read past the headline, they don't get the rest of it.",
        "Barbara Howard is the chair of the Publications Committee for the Women's Health Initiative.",
        "And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News.",
        "Meir Stampfer is chair of the Department of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health, and he's joining us now from his office in Boston, Massachusetts.",
        "Thanks for being with us today.",
        "Good afternoon.",
        "Professor Stampfer, you have been critical of some of the findings, or have had some problems with this study.",
        "Why?",
        "Well, my initial concern about the trial dates back from when it was being planned.",
        "I didn't think that the low-fat diet was the best hypothesis to test at that time.",
        "A lot of people did feel that low-fat diet was the way to go for health, so it was an important question, but I felt that it would be better to test a different kind of diet that might be more likely to succeed.",
        "But, nonetheless, good scientists held different views, and that's how science progresses.",
        "The trial was done.",
        "We have the answer, which I think is the end of the fat is bad mantra.",
        "I think that should have ended earlier, but at least it's ending now, and we can move on to the type of fat, which is far more important.",
        "What can be learned about these kinds of, the studies themselves, looking at this particular, the Women's Health Initiative, what does health scientists learn about how to conduct a study?",
        "Well, I think we learned a number of important facts.",
        "First, that it's tremendously expensive and difficult to do a diet trial and to really get people to adhere over a long term.",
        "So, we don't have very many chances to do trials like this.",
        "So, we need to be very careful about choosing diets that are most likely succeed before embarking on another such venture.",
        "I think the second thing we learn is that even with a long-term trial like this you still wind up somewhat disappointed, because many of the diseases that we're interested in take even longer to develop.",
        "For example, we know for colon cancer, what happened 20 years ago is important for the diagnosis of colon cancer.",
        "For breast cancer, we know that influences as early as childhood or even in utero can be important.",
        "So, you can do a 15-year trial and still not get the answer.",
        "Yeah...",
        "May I comment?"

        "Yes.",
        "Go ahead, Barbara Howard.",
        "I think Meir makes some good points about the fact that it will be very important to be able to now do other studies with different dietary patterns, but I want to be sure that it's understood that I don't think the study showed that fat's not important.",
        "As I said a little earlier, the women who were eating the highest of the fat diets did have reductions in breast cancer.",
        "And the reduction in breast cancer is very close to significant, and given the time, that's a long-term cancer as well, we will have five more years to know if that curve, which seems to be widening, continues to widen.",

        "And before we went on that short break, Barbara Howard and Meir Stampfer, I think you both were trying to get a word.",
        "I think...",
        "I hadn't finished what I was saying, and the other point I want to make about weight is calories.",
        "The biggest nutrition problem we have in this country is overweight.",
        "And we found that this diet was helpful for weight maintenance, but the point is that fats have a lot of calories, and we know now that in order for people to really seriously lose weight, they have to lower calories and exercise more.",
        "We didn't do a weight-loss study, but an individual needs to keep in mind that fats are one of the biggest sources of calories in their diet.",
        "And Meir Stampfer, you wanted to respond.",
        "Yes, of course calories are key, and I agree that's our major nutrition problem, but the weight loss in this trial, actually at the end of the trial, there was a 400 gram difference between the groups.",
        "It was not a weight-loss trial.",
        "It was just specifically targeting low fat.",
        "Getting back to the earlier point about the breast cancer, this non-significant reduction in breast cancer, I believe that the best explanation for that is the modest weight loss that occurred in the low-fat group, which was bigger in the early years of the trial, and then later became smaller.",
        "But if you calculate the expected change in breast cancer risk based on weight loss, not fat intake, but weight loss, you come to about seven to eight percent, which is just about the amount that was observed.",
        "Post-menopausal overweight is a very important risk factor for breast cancer.",
        "And if women can maintain ideal body weight in the post-menopausal years, they'll have a much lower risk of breast cancer.",
        "Let's take a call now from Anne in Rhode Island.",

        "Yes.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "I wondered whether or not your outcome studies, if I'm using the right term, made a differentiation between those women who had breast cancer that were estrogen dependent and the women who did not have estrogen dependent breast cancer, because I understand that actually estrogen is more likely to be secreted in, I think it's the adrenal glands, even when you're menopausal, if you have extra fat on your body.",
        "That's right.",
        "Estrogen is secreted by your adrenals, but also by your fat tissue.",
        "And, we in fact did look at receptor status, and the women who had estrogen receptor positive tumors had a significant reduction in breast cancer.",

        "There's probably not any reason right now to make any quick and hard changes.",
        "It's certainly worth discussing with your doctor.",
