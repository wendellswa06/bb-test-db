        "A little bit later in the program, we'll be joined by Congressman Christopher Shays of Connecticut, who is one of those in favor of putting this deal on hold.",
        "But joining us now is James Vande Heim, a White House Correspondent for The Washington Post.",
        "He's with us from The Post Studios here in Washington, D.C.",
        "Jim, nice to have you back on the program.",
        "Good to be here.",
        "And this deal has now taken up a lot of the White House's time over the past couple of days.",
        "Scott McClellan said at the briefing today, that in hindsight, the administration probably should have spent a little bit more time briefing Congress ahead of time.",
        "Yeah, we've heard a much softer and more compromising tone from the White House today.",
        "First, they're admitting that they probably should have been consulting Congress throughout the process.",
        "And they've also suggested that there'll be additional briefings in the days and weeks ahead, so they can allay any concerns that members of Congress have.",
        "I was on Air Force One yesterday with the president when he made his initial statement about the deal.",
        "And he was very agitated, and very sharp in his criticism of those members of Congress who are trying to hold up the deal, threatening to veto.",
        "I think the White House decided they had to tone it down and not make this a confrontation of the White House versus Congress.",
        "But rather, you know, spend the next couple of days trying to share with Congress what, you know, what they learned from their review process.",
        "And try to get to a point where they could eventually approve this deal.",
        "I think what's interesting is, even after the president spoke yesterday, and then Scott McClellan spoke today, we've had a lot of Republicans come out and still criticize it as sharply as ever.",
        "And we'll have more on that when we come back after a short break.",
        "Jim Vande Heim, stay with us.",
        "If you'd like to join the conversation, 800-989-8255, the e-mail address is talk@npr.org.",

        "I think it was the former majority leader Tom Delay who said if President Bush does veto a bill like this, he'll lose the vote.",
        "It'll be overridden.",
        "That's what so amazing about this.",
        "I cannot recall a time during Bush's tenure in office where you've had this many prominent Republicans taking the president on, on a terrorism-related issue.",

        "They've been sort of unified in the approach to fighting terrorism, and now you have Republicans, and not just any Republicans.",
        "You know, Bill Frist, Denny Hastert, and other leaders of the Republican Party and Congress, essentially, questioning the president's commitment to keeping the country safe when it comes to ports, and allowing this deal to go through.",
        "And I think that's what's so extraordinary about this, and I do not think the White House ever anticipated that there would be this ferocious of a response, and this persistent of a response from Congress.",

        "And they can take the chance here to be, quote/unquote, you know, \"\"tough on terrorism,\"\" and yet now positioned to everything that folks seem to be not liking about President Bush, not that I'm a President Bush supporter.",
        "Well, in terms of, obviously, any member of the House of Representatives is up for election this year.",

        "And I think their calculation is that if their...",

        "There's a lot of facts out there that members don't know, and they're jumping out there in criticizing the president.",
        "Other people see this, and they jump on board, and as long as there's a lot of pressure coming from the grass roots, and if you listen to conservative talk radio, tune in to Fox for a couple of minutes, or listen to C-SPAN and these call in shows from Republicans, I have never heard the grass roots this upset at the president over a particular policy.",

        "What's happening to the president's agenda?",
        "It's not good for the White House.",
        "Sort of, rule number one in politics, you want to be defining the issue instead, of being defined by the issues.",

        "They find themselves not being able to talk about energy or healthcare or their so-called competitive initiative, which are the issues they want to be talking about over the next few weeks.",
        "Instead, they're talking about Cheney and the secrecy of the White House, and now they're talking about whether they're actually committed enough to combating terrorism as part of this port deal.",
        "I think a lot of Republicans felt like the president should have been engaged in this issue over the weekend, when there was a lot of clamoring for Republicans, and a lot of lawmakers in those port cities that were raising concerns about it, and making sure that he would have been upfront defining this issue instead of now having to spend the next couple of days saying, whoa, what a second.",

        "But I can just tell you what's in my heart of hearts.",

        "We're fighting Islamist terrorists, frankly, primarily, in the Middle East.",
        "We are dealing with Arab countries, to which not one has truly been definitive about its position about Hamas, Hezbollah, al-Qaeda.",

        "Two of the 9/11 hijackers came from the United Arab Emirates.",
        "But yesterday, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld said that they have been outstanding partners in the war on terror since 9/11, and the country that owned these ports previously, Britain, certainly, last year, had its own problems with domestic, home-grown terrorists.",
        "Well, I mean, I think that's a fair point.",
        "I mean, you know, that there could be a failure, even of Great Britain, to operate these ports correctly, with some of their own constituencies.",
        "But, you know, with all do respect to what Mr. Rumsfeld said, this is the problem with the Arab community: they're on both sides of the equation.",
        "There was times that we've asked the Saudis to increase the oil supply, to lower prices, and the Saudis have cooperated.",
        "There have been examples to which we can say, yes, they have shown great cooperation.",
        "But what Mr. Rumsfeld didn't say was, after September 11th, we had a significant problem with the Arab Emirates not cooperating, and seizing assets of Osama bin Laden.",
        "There is no outrage, anywhere, about the beheadings of Islamic groups.",
        "But then there's an outrage, and they condone and they encourage outrage over a cartoon in a newspaper in Denmark.",
        "I mean, that's why I have such discomfort.",
        "A lot of people might say, Mr. Congressman, that those are you know sort of ad homonym attacks.",
        "I mean, I've not heard of any riots in the UAE.",
        "I'm missing a point that maybe you need to straighten me out on.",
        "When you have an Islamic community, almost in mass, become violent over a cartoon, be totally silent about the beheadings in Iraq of Americans and other totally innocent civilians, my view is, and I'd like to know how I'm wrong, they're really on both sides of the equation, and I don't think we can have someone on both sides of the equation running our ports.",
