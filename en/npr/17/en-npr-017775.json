        "And I just wanted to inform everybody that the United Arab Emirates, and especially the port of Jebel Ali, that's the main port for this small country, is the absolute most modern, well-run, well-managed, high-tech seaport in the world.",
        "They have something like 50 to 60 ships going in and out of that port every day.",
        "It's, it's just high-tech, it's hard for me to explain to you in detail, but it's the most well-managed, secure seaport environment I've ever been in, and I've been in all seaports, all over the world, and part of my training, I'm required at least once every two years to take a two-week class in ship and port security.",
        "And I can tell, you from my viewpoint, that our American seaports, the security there is a joke.",
        "It's an absolute joke, the security we have in our own seaports, and quite a few of our container seaports are failing, especially seaports like Baltimore, because of the most sloppy management by American companies and other companies.",
        "If United Arab Emirates ever came and started managing our seaports in the United States, it would be a relief."

        "It wasn't the kind of, it wasn't the kind of review that asked for public input.",
        "But, I'd just note that the law was amended in 1993, and that that law states that the review is mandatory, the 45-day investigation is mandatory when they acquire, is controlled by or acting on behalf of a foreign government, and the acquisition could result in the control of a person, could result in control of a person engaged in interstate commerce in the United States that could affect the national security of the United States.",
