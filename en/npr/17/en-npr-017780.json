        "Fox News host and former presidential candidate Mike Huckabee moderated a forum.",
        "As NPR's Ari Shapiro reports, it wasn't exactly a debate.",
        "In fact, this was sort of the opposite of a debate.",
        "The candidates never actually shared the stage.",
        "They were explicitly prohibited from attacking or even mentioning each other.",
        "Still, most found ways to get in a jab without naming their rivals.",
        "The vast majority of the jabs were aimed at front-runner Mitt Romney.",
        "One member of the audience asked Jon Huntsman about his position on abortion.",
        "I am very clear on my pro-life philosophy.",
        "I have always been pro-life, and I always will be.",
        "Romney supported abortion rights before he changed his position.",
        "Rick Santorum also tried to contrast himself with the stereotype of Romney as a political opportunist who blows in the wind.",
        "Not everybody agrees with everything you believe in, but what they want to know is that you believe what you believe.",
        "And folks trusted me that I would stand up and in fact do what I said and that I was doing it for the right reason.",
        "Newt Gingrich did not even bother with the oblique attacks.",
        "He went after the former Massachusetts governor by name, continuing the argument he has pursued for the past week, that Romney made a fortune at the investment company Bain Capital by closing companies and laying people off.",
        "Governor Romney ran saying he created 100,000 jobs in the private sector, and let me just say...",
        "Mr.",
        "Speaker, we've said we will not allow any comment of the other candidates.",
        "Well, I'm just trying to answer his question.",

        "To ask questions about a particular company is not the same as attacking capitalism, and I don't see how you can expect us to have a presidential campaign in which an entire sector is avoided.",
        "And I guarantee you if we Republicans avoid it, our nominee in the fall is not going to find that Obama avoids it at all.",
        "All week long, Rick Perry joined in the Romney attacks on the campaign trail.",

        "We were at the Brookings Institution in Washington to talk about trade and other global economic issues, and I began by asking him, at this point, are the TPP and a proposed deal with Europe, the TTIP, dead?",
        "No.",
        "There's a strong case for a good trade agreement, which TPP is, and we're going to continue to press forward, as the president has indicated.",
        "We're going to continue to work with the Europeans.",
        "Whether we can finish it or not I can't guarantee, but we're going to still try to get that done.",
        "But on TPP where you've lost Secretary Clinton as a supporter it seems, do you read the opposition to that as just an election year kerfuffle, or is there something changing in the way Americans see trade agreements and in the way Washington had better negotiate trade agreements?",
        "You know, Robert, I think that the benefits of the market access for American workers are clear.",
        "I think what we need to be more clear at is how the benefits of trade agreements get to workers, how workers are equipped with the training they need to have the jobs in the new economy, how companies share the benefits of growth with workers.",
        "We have to make a stronger case, a better case, but the substance, the facts are clear."

        "You know, people have to focus on not just the nominal number of what the size of the deficit is but the deficit as a share of the economy.",
        "When we came into office, it was roughly 10 percent of GDP.",
        "It's now under 3 percent of GDP.",
        "That is the most dramatic reduction in deficit in history.",

        "It is ticked up a little bit, but it's in the zone of a sustainable level.",
        "And when - if you ask me today, what is the most pressing need, it is more important to invest more in infrastructure and training today to build the economic foundation for growth that will throw off more income and more revenue in the future than to get an incremental amount of deficit and debt reduction over the next few years.",
