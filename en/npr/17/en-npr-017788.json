        "Yes, I just wanted to make a comment basically with regards to actually who should get awards.",
        "You know many times substance, as far as it being that the movie has and how it is better for the actor and the entire content of the movie is not taken into consideration.",
        "And many movies are very shallow in content, they don't have much, the plot is lousy, yet those actors seem to be getting awards left and right.",
        "I don't understand when are we going to analyze the actual essence of the movie which is very important, and should play an important role in letting our actors, you know, win awards.",
        "Well, let me ask you Michael Kahn, should the content of the, the award is presumably for acting rather than for social content.",
        "Well, I also think though that the writing is important, and if the writing is good, the actor has a better chance of being nominated.",
        "And in the case, I think, of the men this year, those are very well written films.",
        "And so, actually all of those films have content that should make this person who's listening happy.",
        "Let me ask you in this context, I mean there has been a whole category of films and you think of the Star Wars movies, you think of the Indiana Jones movies, you think about all of these winning loads and loads of awards for technical achievement, maybe sometimes for film editing, but they never win for acting.",
        "You can't win as an actor in an action movie, can you Carrie Rickey?",
        "Not often.",
        "Off hand, I can't think of one.",
        "Although I would have nominated Naomi Watts for King Kong this year because I thought she was sensational.",
        "Well there were people who wanted to nominate the actor who, you know acted out King Kong.",
        "Andy Sirkus...",
        "Andy Sirkus...",
        "Andy Sirkus, yes."

        "But Michael, I wanted to ask you a question.",
        "Why do you think that Oscars tend to go to actors who are more, do more character acting than personality actors?",
        "I mean, it used to be that Katherine Hepburn would win because, and she, the Katherine Hepburns would win but not the John Waynes or the Clint Eastwoods because they did not vary from role to role as much.",
        "Well I think now people are looking to say, well, I think that's acting.",
        "And so when you're playing a character and people can sort of see that you're acting, they actually can have some idea that you're working.",
        "I mean, you know, when Kate Blanchet, who probably should have won for something else, won to be playing Katherine Hepburn, it's because they could tell that she was acting.",
        "She had a different accent.",

        "I mean, she's a wonderful actress and I'm looking forward to seeing her again on the stage.",
        "But you could tell, I suppose, that Philip Seymour Hoffman and you've seen in other films, is clearly giving a performance because he's unrecognizable.",

        "(Soundbite of \"\"Rain Man\"\")",
        "Michael, go ahead I'm sorry.",
        "Yes, sorry there's also something I think that when people like Katherine Hepburn and Betty Davis were winning that they had big studios behind them.",
        "And now that there aren't studios, I think, and it's more independent work from actors, people are looking to see what looks like acting to them.",
        "But is it harder to be Clint Eastwood and do that every time?",
        "Or is it harder to be Robert DeNiro and be a chameleon and start from scratch every time?",
        "Well, I think it's hard to be yourself every time and still be interesting, but it's probably more difficult to try to characterize and transform in a film."

        "LeClair barely looks up from his machine.",
        "Yes, it is entirely, except for Munich, it's the only big studio picture in the race.",
        "I think the Academy is somewhat panic-stricken about ratings because some of these movies, most of these movies are smaller movies and maybe a lot of people haven't seen them.",
        "And, you know, we're in this strange time where the studios are making a lot of sort of junky programmers, movies that are not really connecting, and we have a big box office slump going on for that reason.",
        "But again, the labels that did these mostly are quasi-independent.",
        "They're the independent branch, arms of big studios.",
