        "Let me ask you, do you think though that sometimes if somebody has a lot of films in the can coming up that people vote because they know that that award is going to help their next movie?",

        "Yeah, well, maybe more so for Jamie Foxx there.",
        "But playing against type, Michael Kahn, that certainly has rewarded other actors in the past.",

        "So that's also a change of pace.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So, but I absolutely agree.",

        "The others, she says, they all mimic existing or deceased persons or play up stereotypes.",
        "Age, Kim Masters, does the age of an actor seem to play a large roll, a feeling that they may have to pay more dues?",
        "Well, maybe Carrie remembers these, some of the numbers better than I do.",
        "Certainly there have been young winners.",

        "Heath Ledger is also a very much a change of pace pace.",
        "We've seen him in a lot of broad comedies and action movies.",
