I think that I, if I'm remembering correctly, I think it was the, was it the Avi, oh, there was, no there, I think it was The House of Sand and Fog, they tried to get a Best Supporting Actor's campaign and they were construed to have disparaged the competing actresses, which is a violation of the rules and probably didn't help her.",

        "If you're going to go negative about another movie, even if it's not something with fingerprints attached to it, there may be a little bit of backlash if you are perceived, as usually, I mean it usually is the Harvey Weinstein, formerly of Miramax, now with the Weinstein Company, many, many Oscar contenders, The English Patient and Shakespeare in Love, and so on, usually he is the guy, I mean we may as well say the reality of it, who has been perceived as the negative campaigner.",
        "And I think it's a dicey game, it can backfire.",
        "And also his campaign for Gangs of New York also totally backfired.",
