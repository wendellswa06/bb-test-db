        "Right now, there are roughly five billion active mobile phones on the planet, but the vast majority are not connected to the Internet.",
        "And that's because data plans are far too expensive for most of the world's population to afford.",
        "So, even if the cost of a Smartphone drops dramatically in the next few years, that's not going to matter if data makes that phone basically useless.",

        "So, let's say, Facebook would be free.",
        "The idea is that would make buying that phone more attractive.",
