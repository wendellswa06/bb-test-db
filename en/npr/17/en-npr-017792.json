        "It was the 1960s.",
        "Yes, but I was a normal-sized child until seventh grade.",
        "And then suddenly I shot up and I went from about five-one in seventh grade to about six-one in ninth grade.",
        "But fortunately, I was so oblivious that I hardly noticed.",
        "You hardly noticed?",
        "Well, I - my mother noticed more than I did.",

        "I used to say, first I was taller than the girls and then I was taller than everybody, including the teachers, I have to say.",
        "Let me ask you both.",

        "Rebecca?",
        "It didn't really affect just like the friends that I had, but it affected dating, definitely.",
        "I never dated until college, actually.",
        "I have my first boyfriend right now, so I mean, I never dated boys because I was taller than all of them and that was intimidating."

        "Well, when he was six-foot-ten and I was six-foot-two, it was great.",
        "But since then I met somebody who saw us in the dining room of his university, which is Yale University, and he said that we looked, and we felt to be, that we were kind of sheepish and awkward.",

        "Every time we passed a crowd, we'd hear the phrase, dio metre, dio metre, which means two meters.",
        "They would be looking at him and exclaiming that he was more than two meters tall.",
        "And Rebecca, you've written that in fact, people talk about you as if you're invisible, or at least they don't think you can hear them."
