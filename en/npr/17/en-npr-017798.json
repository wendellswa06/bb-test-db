        "It's part of our community.",

        "Well, we'll ask the Professor in jut a minute.",

        "Well, the answer to your question is a little bit different if you're looking for a roommate, because the Fair Housing Act is pretty clear that if you're talking about bringing someone into to your home, to share your living space, you can discriminate as much as you want to, because you're exempted.",
        "And that's the way that the Fair Housing Act works, it works by exemption.",
        "Everybody is covered.",
        "You can't discriminate unless you fall within an exempted category.",
        "In the case of bringing someone into your personal house, you're probably right.",
        "You can make decisions about who you decide to live there and who you decide should not.",
        "But as soon as you get into a situation where you have, like, three rental properties, or you've got a quad-plex, you can't do that.",
        "The federal law is very clear about this, and no, you don't get to make the decisions based upon race, or religion, or sexual preference.",
        "And does the commercial aspect of it, not paying for an ad, it's not an ad, it's a listing, does that make any difference?",
        "The commercial aspect of accepting money for the advertisement is not very much of a concern here.",
        "What is a concern is whether or not Craig's List is exercising editorial control.",
        "Are they policing these advertisements?",
        "And if they are, they're probably going to be held to what's required in the FHA.",
        "Now, there's a question about whether or not the individual advertisers on Craig's List fall within one of the exempted categories.",
        "So, if I were advertising somebody to be my roommate, am I only doing that within the size of my apartment, and that's the only area?",
        "In which case I might be exempted, and Craig's List would have no responsibility?",
        "Or do I own a dozen apartment buildings, and therefore it's an obligation to stay within the law?",
        "Todd, thanks for the call."

        "Thank you.",
        "And, let me ask another question, which is not about how the law applies now, but about the possibility of future laws.",
        "If this is used as a way to evade the Fair Housing Act, it's entirely possible that, even if Craig's List and the courts say they're not responsible, Congress will draft a law to say, yes you are responsible, as of now.",
        "Well that's a very real possibility, although I think that Congress recognizes that there's a lot of transitory communication and we do not want to get too close to the First Amendment on this one with the respect to the internet.",
        "Starting in 1996 with the Commerce Department survey on the internet, and the decision to recommend to Congress that there be a hands-off position, that was adopted wholeheartedly by the Clinton Administration, and so far through the Bush Administration.",
        "They have kind of taken that, although there's some eroding of that with respect to the obscenity issues coming out of the Pennsylvania case on...",
        "But wouldn't racial segregation or discrimination be, you know, an opened case for vulnerability, if you would?",
        "I think it absolutely is.",
        "And I think the thing that's real interesting about this particular case is that, if there is a pattern here, and a pattern of a website going through and allowing this sort of hate message to be out there, I think Congress has a pretty easy case in front of it to make to the American public that we shouldn't allow that type of racial hatred.",
        "The problem is going to come...",
        "And, very quickly.",
        "The problem is going to come though with respect to the number of units that you're offering.",
